<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Oppose Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Environmentalists are joining critics of the  
Kyoto climate treaty in opposing legislation intended to spur 
voluntary reductions in greenhouse gases. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would guarantee government credit, should the  
treaty take effect, to companies acting early to curtail 
heat-trapping gases. The measure has sponsors from both parties and 
was seen a few months as likely to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	But some environmentalists now fear the bill would allow credits  
for emissions not verified and for various measures that do not 
directly reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted. Some 
critics also are opposed because they say the legislation would 
promote use of nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill rewards our biggest polluting companies even if they  
make no changes whatsoever,'' John Passacantando, executive 
director of Ozone Action, an environmental group active in the 
climate debate, testified Wednesday before the Senate Environment 
and Natural Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has the potential to pre-empt real emission reductions,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other groups opposing the legislation include the Sierra Club,  
Natural Resources Defense Council, World Wildlife Fund, the 
National Environmental Trust and Greenpeace. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two environmental organizations have come out strongly for  
the measure -- the Environmental Defense Fund and the Nature 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way of getting the process started,'' said Fred Krupp,  
EDF's executive director, said in an interview. He did not testify 
at Wednesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year a growing number of Fortune 500 companies,  
including DuPont, United Technologies, BP-Amoco, and utilities such 
as American Electric Power have committed to cutting the greenhouse 
gases they produce, mainly carbon dioxide, by using energy more 
efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Claussen, executive director of the Pew Center on Global  
Climate Change, testified Wednesday that while some of those 
companies may oppose the climate treaty negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, 
in December, 1997, they ``support the view that they should act 
now, not later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, these companies want assurances that their  
actions will be given credit if mandatory greenhouse emissions are 
imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Her group includes 22 major corporations that have pledged  
voluntary actions on climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., the committee's chairman and a  
co-sponsor of the bill, said the credits would not be given unless 
reductions are verified. 
</P>
<P>
	``The alternative is ... to do nothing to begin dealing with  
what could turnout to be a substantial environmental and economic 
problem,'' Chafee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., another co-sponsor, said ``the  
sooner we begin to act (on climate change) the sooner we will 
deflected the alarming upward trend'' of greenhouse gas emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The emissions have increased 11 percent since 1991 and are on  
target to continue annual increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry sources say that behind the business community's  
opposition is a fear the bill is another step toward ``backdoor 
implementation'' of the Kyoto treaty already signed by Clinton but 
facing strong opposition in Congress.

<HEADLINE>  32 Die in Kenya Train Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- A train carrying tourists derailed today  
while rounding a sharp bend inside a national park, killing at 
least 32 people, Kenyan officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Philemon Abongo said 32 people died. But he  
told reporters he could not confirm a report from the Defense 
Department that five foreigners were among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	A French Embassy spokesman said at least one French woman was  
killed, and that there were at least 86 French tourists on the 
train. The embassy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
said it was not known how many French passengers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Nairobi Hospital said nine French citizens, eight Britons and  
four Kenyans had been admitted, some in very serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The train carried 400 people, and there were initial reports  
that about 100 were trapped after the derailment. But an Associated 
Press reporter who arrived at the scene eight hours after the 
accident saw no large-scale rescue operation under way for any 
trapped passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred on the edge of Tsavo National Park, 155  
miles southeast of Nairobi, said Nicholas Simani, a Defense 
Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The train rolled over on the single-track railway at 4:15 a.m.  
on a sharp bend before a junction known as ``Man-eaters'' because 
of the dozens of Indian workers eaten by lions when the railway was 
built early in the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Greenwood, 59, of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., who suffered  
only minor injuries, said he was riding in the last of the 13 
passenger cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the doors were locked, and nobody had the keys to open  
them,'' he said at Nairobi Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwood said some survivors had to climb out windows and walk  
about a mile to the main Nairobi-Mombasa highway, where they were 
helped by Chinese road workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatrice Perez, one of a group of 13 French tourists on the  
train who was brought to Nairobi by the air force, said the train 
sped up just before the accident. She said at least 10 cars rolled 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	She told rescuers it took hours before helicopters took the  
injured and others to Voi, 30 miles southeast of the accident site. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Burstow, 20, a British student from Sussex University who  
was driven to Nairobi Hospital with five other British nationals, 
said most of the passengers in the first class car he was traveling 
in were sleeping when the train derailed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I noted that the train was traveling rather fast. The next  
thing I know is that there was a rather large noise and a lot of 
commotion,'' said Burstow, who wore a bandage on one leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The train leaves Nairobi every evening for the 310-mile trip to  
Mombasa. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, 61 people were killed 30 miles northwest of today's  
accident site when a train traveling from Mombasa to Nairobi 
plunged into a rain-swollen river after a bridge was swept away.

<HEADLINE> 71 Arrested at Diallo Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Comparing the police shooting of an unarmed  
immigrant to a lynching, actress Ruby Dee joined husband Ossie 
Davis in getting arrested outside police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seizing and shooting and beating reminds me of when there  
were lynchings all over the country,'' Miss Dee said. ``We've got 
to start saying `No further. This must stop.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The actors were among 71 people arrested Tuesday, the latest in  
a long list of high-profile activists and politicians arrested 
during demonstrations against the Feb. 4 killing of Amadou Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	Police looking for a rape suspect late at night fired 41 shots  
at the Guinean immigrant, hitting him 19 times. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury has almost finished hearing evidence in the case.  
The four officers, members of the police department's elite Street 
Crimes Unit, will not testify before the panel, their lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably have a beginning of a resolution on this thing  
the beginning of next week,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir has been under fire himself since his staff said he  
couldn't attend a City Council hearing on the Street Crime Unit on 
Monday because he had a scheduling conflict. On Sunday, he was 
spotted attending the Academy Awards in Los Angeles, raising 
criticism for schmoozing with celebrities and planning to skip the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the outcry, he flew back to New York in time for the  
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Safir has asked for an investigation of whether that trip to  
Los Angeles violated city ethics rules, because he and his wife 
were guests of George Fellows, the president and chief executive 
officer of Revlon, police department spokesman Lt. Dennis Cirillo 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to flying with Fellows on a corporate jet, the  
Safirs were given prized tickets to the Oscars. The city charter 
prohibits public officials from taking gifts worth more than $75 
from people and corporations who do business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir says Fellows is a personal friend. A Revlon spokesman,  
Howard Rubenstein, said Fellows -- not Revlon -- paid for the trip. 
Revlon got some Oscar tickets, worth at least $250, because the 
company was a sponsor of the Oscar telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir's predecessor, William Bratton, resigned under pressure in  
1996 after the mayor launched an investigation into trips Bratton 
took at the expense of corporate honchos. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests of Davis, 81, and Miss Dee, 74, came during the  
third week of daily protests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to do it, I have no choice,'' Miss Dee said of her  
protest. ``Because I've got five grandsons and one son. ... I wake 
up thinking that could happen to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through 11 days of carefully choreographed weekday protests, 391  
people -- including former Mayor David Dinkins and National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People President Kweisi 
Mfume -- have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has been under fire for his handling  
of the case, said the protests didn't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel beleaguered,'' he said. ``I don't feel under  
siege. I feel normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officers had a right to empty their guns if they feared for  
their lives when they encountered Diallo in the vestibule of his 
apartment building, said attorney Marvyn Kornberg, who represents 
Officer Sean Carroll.

	Yugoslav Leader Remains Defiant  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- With NATO forces poised to bomb  
Yugoslavia, President Slobodan Milosevic called on his people to 
defend the country ``by all means.'' Milosevic said his decision to 
reject a U.S.-supported peace pact for Kosovo was the ``only 
correct one,'' although it almost certainly doomed his country to 
an attack by allied forces. Dutch officials said NATO would first 
issue a ``verbal warning'' to Belgrade that an assault was 
imminent, giving Milosevic a last chance to avert it. ``Then we 
will have a first aerial attack,'' he said. It would be NATO's 
first attack against a sovereign country in its 50-year history. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton: Kosovo a Stand Against Evil  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton likened NATO's confrontation  
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic today to a struggle 
between good and evil, as American and allied forces prepared to 
attack Yugoslavia's air defenses. Clinton said the Kosovo crisis is 
a stand against ``destructive racial, ethnic, religious and 
cultural'' aggression. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said 
there is ``no alternative ... but to take military action'' against 
Yugoslavia, where Serbs have continued to attack ethnic Albanians 
despite the threat of NATO airstrikes. 

</P>
<P>
	Macedonia Tense As Strikes Loom  
</P>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- With NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia  
imminent, neighboring Macedonia is worried about the possible 
consequences to its own fragile stability. The only republic to 
emerge unscathed from the breakup of Yugoslavia, Macedonia is in a 
delicate position because of the presence of more than 10,000 NATO 
troops, but NATO officials say the troops in Macedonia would not 
take part in airstrikes. However, there are fears of retaliatory 
attacks by Serbs and a tide of ethnic Albanian refugees from 
Kosovo, which could destabilize Macedonia.

	Jackson Won't Run in 2000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-time Democratic presidential candidate  
Jesse Jackson today said he will not make a bid for the White House 
in 2000. The civil rights leader said he believes he can help 
minorities and the poor more by jump-starting private investment in 
their businesses than by making a third run. Jackson's decision 
leaves former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and Vice President Gore 
as the front-runners for the Democratic nomination. 

</P>
<P>
	Court OKs Hunting by Chippewas  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ruled today that eight bands  
of Chippewa Indians can continue to hunt and fish on 13 million 
acres of public land in Minnesota without state regulation. The 
court said that neither an 1850 presidential order nor Minnesota's 
statehood in 1858 stripped the Chippewas of the hunting and fishing 
privilege they received in an 1837 treaty. Some Indian law experts 
had said the court's decision could affect the security of other 
Indian treaty rights.

	Mossad Agent Jailed for 5 Years  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A former Mossad spy was sentenced today to five  
years in jail for supplying phony information which reportedly 
brought Israel to the brink of war with Syria. Yehuda Gil 
reportedly told his superiors in 1997 that Syrian President Hafez 
Assad was planning a military strike to seize part of the Golan 
Heights captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. Gil retired 
from the Mossad in 1989 after 19 years of service, but continued to 
freelance for the agency. He said he felt the need to continue to 
prove himself after his retirement.

	More Consumers Fall Behind on Loans  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' confidence in the economy and  
appetite for borrowing increased in the final three months of 1998, 
pushing the delinquency rate on consumer loans and credit cards to 
a 15-month high. The seasonally adjusted percentage of credit-card 
accounts 30 or more days past due rose to 3.45 percent in the 
October-December quarter, from 3.28 percent the previous quarter, 
the American Bankers Association said today.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former NBA star Magic Johnson has agreed to  
overhaul and restore a theater that has been closed for 22 years, 
the latest addition to his chain of movie houses in underdeveloped 
urban areas. Johnson's company, Magic Johnson Theaters, will 
transform the 1920s-era Flatbush Avenue cinema in Brooklyn into a 
cutting-edge 12-screen complex. The $30 million multiplex would 
open in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Advertises IOC Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Sydney Olympics organizing  
committee (SOCOG) took out paid advertisements in Australian 
newspapers Thursday to promote International Olympic Committee 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee chief executive Sandy Hollway said the advertisements  
were aimed to counter bad publicity surrounding the Olympic 
movement in the wake of the bribery scandal and gift-giving 
allegations against Australian IOC member Phil Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway said he hoped the investigation into whether Coles  
accepted jewelry from a person associated with the unsuccessful bid 
by Athens, Greece, for the 1996 games would be ended quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like every strand of the controversies affecting the Olympics,  
I would like to see this one out of the way,'' Hollway told 
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike SOCOG president Michael Knight, Hollway has declined to  
call for Coles' resignation from the committee's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway, who needs to find $137 million in new sponsors' money  
to meet budget targets, told a meeting of existing sponsors on 
Wednesday they were right to be concerned about the controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that although no sponsor had yet walked away from the  
Sydney games, the controversy ``doesn't make life any easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The advertisements, reportedly costing $25,000, display an open  
letter listing reforms adopted by the IOC at a meeting in Lausanne, 
Switzerland, this month. These include expelling members found 
guilty of corruption, changing the selection process of host 
cities, an examination of the structure of the IOC and the 
establishment of an Ethics Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway said news coverage of the IOC meeting had been overly  
negative and the advertisements were a way of putting out ``some of 
the more positive messages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC is now, thankfully, on a path to reform,'' Hollway  
says in the letter. ``If the steps taken by the IOC last week are 
followed through -- and every friend of the Olympics must hope and 
urge that they are -- this could be a watershed for the better in 
the international Olympic movement.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Focuses on Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton called on Democratic  
business and labor leaders to take advantage of the nation's 
prosperity and push forward on economic initiatives from investing 
in targeted urban areas to expanding trade. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day when a U.S.-led NATO force was preparing to launch  
airstrikes on Kosovo, Clinton headlined two Democratic National 
Committee fund-raisers, bringing in more than $1 million and 
promoting his message on issues from education to Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The president touted the strength of the economy, underscoring  
his belief that a strong economic policy fits in with the values of 
the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible to have a good economic policy .... and have a  
more humane society,'' he said at a dinner Tuesday night for the 
Democratic Business Council at the Mayflower Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that not all Americans have reaped the benefits of the  
nation's prosperity, Clinton highlighted his efforts to give 
businesses an incentive to invest in communities. He cited room for 
growth in the United States' trade alliances with other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democratic Party should not be afraid of trade,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The president also warned that Americans cannot ignore foreign  
policy matters, pointing to the financial crisis in Asia and its 
implications for the United States' economic well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no longer an easy dividing line between our policy at  
home and our policy around the world,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton elaborated on this notion in his remarks about the  
situation in Kosovo. He asserted that Americans should have a 
vested interest in addressing problems in Europe, with many nations 
there being important trading partners for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is terribly important that that we recognize that  
economics cannot exist in a global context in the absence of 
security, peace and freedom,'' Clinton said at a later event at the 
home of former New York Rep. Tom Downey. ``Even though I think 
there is a huge moral component there, it will have direct personal 
benefits to Americans if we have a stable, free, united Europe.''

<HEADLINE> 5,000 Fans Send UConn to Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- About 5,000 Connecticut fans filled their  
home court Wednesday to give the Huskies a rousing send-off to the 
NCAA tournament Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing in three regional finals in the past 10 years,  
coach Jim Calhoun told the crowd the Huskies are not satisfied with 
just making it to the national semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the best fans in America, and that's the truth,''  
Calhoun said to thunderous applause. ``What we're going to Florida 
for is to match you and to bring home the national championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gampel Pavilion reverberated with the cheers and stomping feet  
during the players' brief appearance, which was broadcast live on 
three local television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	After the rally, the team left for a charter flight to St.  
Petersburg, Fla., where it will meet Ohio State on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can't go to St. Pete, this is the next best thing,''  
said Pete Powers of Ellington, a 1978 Connecticut graduate who 
brought his two children, ages 7 and 8, to the rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Husky fever extended beyond the Storrs campus to the state  
Capitol, where Sen. Thomas P. Gaffey urged the governor to declare 
Saturday an honorary state holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state should recognize the hard work and dedication it  
requires to get to this level of excellence,'' Gaffey said 
Wednesday. ``It costs the state nothing -- and besides, it's fun.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nissan To Produce New Z-Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co. plans to return its most famous  
vehicle, the Z sports car, to the North American market to help 
reverse its sales dive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese automaker will announce next Wednesday at the New  
York International Auto Show that a production version has been 
approved, said a company source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan displayed a prototype of the new Z-car in January at the  
North American International Auto Show in Detroit and has been 
hinting for nearly a year it may go into production. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a great move,'' said analyst Wes Brown of  
Nextrend, an industry consulting firm in Thousand Oaks, Calif. 
``When we first saw the vehicle in concept form, our opinion was 
it's a no-brainer. It's an image car and that's something that 
Nissan's been lacking for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fortunes of Nissan, the second-largest automaker in Japan,  
have declined in large part because of its failure in the U.S. 
market, where its cars and trucks are considered reliable but 
bland. Last year its U.S. sales fell 14 percent in a robust market. 
</P>
<P>
	Its huge debt, estimated between $22 billion and $37 billion,  
has forced Nissan to consider an alliance with another automaker. 
DaimlerChrysler AG backed out of talks with Nissan two weeks ago, 
though Nissan now is negotiating a possible linkup with France's 
Renault SA. 
</P>
<P>
	The original Datsun 240-Z was a big hit with Americans when it  
debuted 30 years ago. It was stylish, agile and affordable -- traits 
Nissan is hoping the new Z-car will inherit as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect the new Z could go into production within the  
next couple of years, but it will face a lot more competition. 
Honda Motor Co., Audi AG and Toyota Motor Corp. all have new 
roadsters planned to hit the market in the next year or two. 
They'll join the Mazda Miata, BMW Z3, Mercedes-Benz SLK and Porsche 
Boxster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Z-car prototype borrows many styling cues from the original  
240-Z. They include a long hood, ``sugar scoop'' headlight wells 
and sweeping front fenders in an overall fastback shape that's 
evocative of, but more aerodynamic than, the original. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan officials noted at the Detroit show that debt-laden  
Nissan cannot afford anything less than a big hit with the new Z. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, it's a risk,'' Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan's  
California design studio where the Z prototype was designed, said 
in January. ``Nissan can't afford to make a misstep right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan officials said then that the new Z needs to be a  
high-volume car with sales as high as 100,000 a year. The company 
hopes to price it below $25,000, which would put it at the lower 
end of the market that the Miata has dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``A vehicle like that priced at that range will create a  
tremendous amount of showroom traffic, and that's what they need,'' 
Brown said. ``But there's too much competition out there to expect 
100,000 units of a sports car in this market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rear-drive car likely will be powered by a four-cylinder  
engine, but a six-cylinder engine may also be offered. Hirshberg 
said in January that Nissan also was considering a convertible 
version.

<HEADLINE> Brain Wave Device Spells Messages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have developed a way to let paralyzed people use  
their brain waves to maneuver a ball on a computer screen and spell 
out messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Electrodes and wires were attached to the scalp of two patients  
with advanced Lou Gehrig's disease. They learned to maneuver the 
ball by varying the strength of a specific kind of brain wave. 
</P>
<P>
	It took five steps to choose each letter. The process is slow: a  
proficient speed is about two letters per minute. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``it is reliable and precise enough to allow the patient to  
communicate,'' scientists from the University of Tuebingen in 
Germany, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and elsewhere 
wrote in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique differs from one reported last October, which uses  
a tiny brain implant rather than electrodes to pick up signals that 
control a cursor.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	March 17  
</P>
<P>
	The Sun, Lowell, Mass., on Steve Forbes:  
</P>
<P>
	His novice campaign in 1996 featured $42 million of his own  
money, a dominant idea -- the flat tax -- and constant repetition of 
the slogan ``hope, growth and opportunity.'' American politics 
tends to reward candidates who have been around the track a time or 
two, and Forbes, 51, has clearly learned. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he started early, vigorously courted religious  
conservatives, assembled an experienced staff and established a 
grass-roots organization. His Internet site features an 
old-fashioned pitch for contributions, volunteers and press 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest advantage is the oldest political weapon of all,  
money. Campaign analysts say he may spend $50 million in pursuit of 
the GOP nomination. By contrast, a credible mainstream campaign 
this year would come at around $20 million. Multimillionaire 
publisher Forbes can bankroll his campaign, but because of 
ill-conceived campaign finance laws his rivals must raise their 
funds $1,000 at a time. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 22  
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio Express-News, on starvation in North Korea:  
</P>
<P>
	They are called ``black swallows,'' the starving, stunted and  
orphaned children of North Korea who haunt the country in search of 
food. 
</P>
<P>
	They are the youngest victims of a devastating famine that has  
killed at least 2 million North Koreans since the mid-1990s. 
Two-thirds of all children younger than 7 are malnourished. 
</P>
<P>
	While a series of droughts has contributed to the crisis, much  
famine results from corruption and inefficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, while millions starve, leaders invest in nuclear weapons,  
defying international law. Nonetheless, the United States remains 
its largest donor of food. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, much of the donated food does not reach hungry  
citizens, but winds up in the padded stomachs of the military and 
Communist Party. Because of this, Doctors of the World and Doctors 
Without Borders last summer left North Korea in protest. 
</P>
<P>
	The callousness of North Korean leaders poses a moral dilemma  
for the United States and other nations. Should food donations 
continue even though much of it is diverted from the neediest 
people? Or should such donations cease? ... 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, on Medicare:  
</P>
<P>
	If the president and Congress would make tough choices on  
difficult issues, there would be no need for bipartisan 
commissions. They don't, so in 1997 Congress created the National 
Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaired by Sen. John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, the 17-member  
panel was charged with redesigning an entitlement program that, 
like Social Security, is popular among older Americans but 
financially unsound. Sen. Breaux and Rep. Bill Thomas, a California 
Republican, proposed to save money through market mechanisms and by 
raising the age of eligibility from 65 to 67. ... 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the president has offered the same response to  
Medicare's financial woes as he has for Social Security's: Dedicate 
a chunk of future budget surpluses to keep the program in business 
a few years longer. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It would be downright irresponsible to let Medicare costs spiral  
until the program goes bankrupt -- and to let millions of additional 
Americans get accustomed to benefit levels that are simply 
unsustainable. If the president doesn't like Sen. Breaux's 
solution, he is obligated to come up with something better.

<P>
	Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, on medical marijuana:  
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one years ago, New Mexico became the first state to  
initiate a pilot program that ultimately concluded what a federal 
study stated only this past week: Marijuana can relieve suffering 
for some ill or terminally ill patients, and that legalizing it for 
medicinal use would not lead to widespread abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. drug policy director Barry McCaffrey hailed ... National  
Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine report as ``the most 
comprehensive analysis of medical marijuana ever done'' and 
supported its conclusions -- a significant endorsement considering 
McCaffrey had commissioned the study to support opposition to 
medical marijuana initiatives in California, Alaska, Arizona, 
Nevada, Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	This study, and McCaffrey's turnaround, should give Congress the  
scientific and political backing it needs to finally eliminate 
federal restrictions on states that allow medical marijuana use. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Congress should change this view ... to reclassify marijuana as  
a Schedule II drug. This change acknowledges a legitimate medical 
use, allowing doctors to prescribe it under tightly-controlled 
conditions, just as they can prescribe cocaine, morphine and other 
drugs with high potential for abuse. Schedule II prescriptions are 
subject to both federal and state review. ...

<P>
	Wheeling (W.Va.) News-Register, on teacher education:  
</P>
<P>
	It's only a matter of time until young people wise up and stop  
using ``The dog ate my homework'' as an excuse for not getting the 
job done. These days, a better line might be, ``Oh, my term paper 
isn't done because my parents wouldn't spend enough money on it.'' 
After all, if young people are learning nothing else, they are 
coming to understand that the standard excuse for any problem, 
particularly if government is involved, is that not enough money is 
being spent. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened again last week, when a national task force of top  
college officials issued a report on what should be done to improve 
teacher-education programs. Spend more money, said the officials. 
...
</P>
<P>
	To be fair, we should note that the report also contained some  
reasonable, productive recommendations such as one that teachers 
should be ``thoroughly prepared in the subject matter they will 
teach.'' The only thing wrong with this picture, of course, is that 
Americans no doubt have thought for many years that education 
schools were turning out teachers who were supposed to be so 
prepared. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Sorry, but we're not buying the task force's report. Instead of  
whining for more money, its members ought to be considering what 
most Americans in private industry had to do years ago: doing 
better work and adapting to changing times. 

</P>
<P>
	March 17  
</P>
<P>
	The Columbian, Vancouver, Wash., on U.S. Forest Service:  
</P>
<P>
	Not since 1982 has the U.S. Forest Service been able to revise  
and bring up to date its rules and regulations for managing 191 
million acres of trees in 155 national forests. Successive efforts 
to do so have crashed into knots of conflicting interests. 
</P>
<P>
	So it may be with the present round of revisions, with new  
management plans for most forests on a 2001 deadline. This time, 
however, the planners and surrounding advocates for various 
interests will have available a 193-page report from 13 scientists 
who were appointed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to cut 
through the knotty interests binding the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists, representing the nation's best academic forestry  
programs, advised that the primary goal of forest management should 
be the long-term health of the forests. 
</P>
<P>
	While it may be difficult to believe that such advice is even  
necessary, it was not uncontroversial; nor will it be met with 
universal acclaim. Several scientists bailed out of the committee 
or prepared minority reports. Groups with particular interests in 
how the forests are managed did their best to shape the final 
product and now are applauding or jeering according to how well 
they did in the shaping. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, environmentalists and recreationalists like the  
recommendation. Loggers and other beneficiaries of the more 
traditional multiple-use context for forest management do not like 
what the scientists had to say. ...

<P>
	Springfield (Ohio) News-Sun, on drug offenses:  
</P>
<P>
	Like most other states, Ohio has emphasized punishment as a  
means of dealing with the drug epidemic. Lawmakers have mandated 
long sentences for people who sell or use drugs, and for those who 
commit other crimes to support drug habits. As a result, the state 
has spent hundreds of millions of dollars building the cells needed 
to house an ever-increasing prison population. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio must turn around its spending priorities in dealing with  
drug abuse. It cannot and should not abandon the fight against drug 
crimes, but that effort should be reorganized. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison cells ought to be reserved for the kingpins and other  
dealers who are getting rich off the suffering of others. The use 
of drug courts should be instituted so court dockets won't be 
clogged with the cases of casual users and addicts who need 
counseling and treatment rather than incarceration. 

</P>
<P>

<P>
	The Miami Herald, on Argentine President Carlos Menem:  
</P>
<P>
	Changing direction more times than a kid on a seesaw,  
Argentina's President Carlos Menem once again threatens to run for 
a third consecutive term. Forget that the Argentine constitution 
... expressly prohibits a third one. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Mr. Menem acts as if his country's politics is a personal  
playground. ... Maybe Mr. Menem is trying to monopolize the 
spotlight, angling for post-office influence, or deflecting 
attention as he did with talk of ``dollarization.'' ... 
</P>
<P>
	This might be humorous, if Argentina's political leaders didn't  
have better things to do. ... Unfortunately, the judiciary serves 
dangerously at the pleasure of presidential whim. Putting the issue 
before the Argentine Supreme Court risks a ruling that mocks both 
the constitution and rule of law. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Sadly, until democratic institutions and political oppositions  
strengthen, there's little check on politicians that value personal 
power over representative government.

	Daily News of Los Angeles, on overlong Oscars:  
</P>
<P>
	At just over four hours, Sunday night's Oscar extravaganza of  
film clips interspersed with live-action speeches was the longest 
and most self-indulgent Academy Awards telecast ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Please, doesn't anyone in Hollywood know how to yell ``cut''  
anymore?

cavorted and careened into our hearts when he won best foreign 
language film for his ``Life is Beautiful,'' which he directed, 
wrote and starred in. ... Benigni's effervescence was a genuine, 
live moment, glorifying the best of moviemaking. 
</P>
<P>
	His spontaneity enlivened a show filled with too much darkness  
and despair at seeing all the talent that's passed away over the

</P>
<P>
	The Mirror, London, on Slobodan Milosevic:  
</P>
<P>
	Time has finally run out for the Serbian butcher. Slobodan  
Milosevic got away with mass slaughter in Bosnia and then in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	He was warned and threatened but he faced down the world's great  
powers. Unitl now. There are two alternatives. To walk away from 
what is happening and let Milosevic's killers ravage the country. 
Or to hit back. 
</P>
<P>
	If NATO's forces did nothing, he would not stop at Kosovo. Like  
all dictators, his ambition recognizes no borders. He will move 
into other European countries and won't stop until he is forced to. 
</P>
<P>
	The time to do that is now. Before counless more deaths are  
added to the thousands who have died already. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 24  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Mail, London, on Slobodan Milosevic:  
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic knows perfectly well that two members of the U.N.  
Security Council -- Russia and China -- are bitterly opposed to 
NATO's plans. He knows too that some members of the Alliance, such 
as Italy, are lukewarm over using force. He will certainly try to 
exploit those divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Make no mistake: when the piteous pictures of casualities appear  
on our television screens, Britain and her allies will come under 
increasing pressure to desist. There will be questions in the UN 
over the legality of the actions. And it will be forcefully argued 
that this country has no national interest in the Balkans. One 
thing is clear. This is a dangerous enterprise, with an outcome 
nobody can foresee. Things might have been different had the 
Alliance acted decisively in the first place, instead of relying on 
empty bluster and giving a fatal impression of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	There must be no repitition of that mistake. If the planes go  
in, there can be no half measures or pinpricks. NATO must 
understand that once it opts for military action, it has no choice 
but to strike relentlessly and hard. 

</P>
<P>
	March 23  
</P>
<P>
	The Straits Times, Singapore, on NATO:  
</P>
<P>
	World opinion must wonder why the North Atlantic Treaty  
Organization has not yet acted against a Serbian government that 
thas violated every possible civilized canon in its brutal 
treatment of the Muslim ethnic Albanians who comprise more than 90 
percent of the population of Kosovo province. Similar pussyfooting 
in Bosnia enabled Serbian troops to overrun the United 
Nations-designed safe haven of Srebrenica and massacre its Muslim 
civilians while impotent Dutch peacekeppers stood by. Yugoslav 
president Slobodan Milosevic, the villain of both situations, must 
be laughing up his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has been bombed and besieged for  
far less, the West apparently being more concerned about the Kurds 
in Iraq (but not in NATO-member Turkey), than about Bosnians and 
Albanians. 

</P>

</P>
<P>
	Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on U.S. economy:  
</P>
<P>
	It has been a `lost decade' for Japan but a decade of dramatic  
prosperity for America. ... It is also true that the bedrock of 
success (in the United States) are the growing seeds of danger: 
overshooting stock prices and ballooning external deficits. That 
the stock market is overheating is indicated by almost every 
relevant barometer, such as corporate asset value, the level or 
earnings and profit forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the stock market keeps on rising, despite fears it might  
crash at any time. The real danger seems to lurk not so much in the 
nonstop ascent itself as in the apparent inability, or 
unwillingness, to stop it. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Even a mild economic slowdown could send foreign investors  
pulling their investments out of the United States. If that 
happens, the dollar would weaken, stock prices would plunge and 
interest rates would soar -- all at the same time. And the slowdown 
could quickly turn into a slump. ...

	Bangkok Post, on Burma's refusal to grant visa to dying husband  
of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi: 
</P>
<P>
	The refusal to (lift) Mr. Aris's travel ban even on  
compassionate grounds before last week's firestorm of publiciy was 
predictable. It is part of their psychological campaign against the 
immensely popular and elected political leader of Burma. There are 
two points. The first is the junta's cynical declaration that it 
will use any weapon -- including a grieving, cancer-stricken man 
against his wife. The second is the chilling attitude that the 
government can, and should, control when and how a man and wife can 
meet.

</P>
<P>
	The Australian, Sydney, on Indonesia:  
</P>
<P>
	Gruesome pictures of beheaded Indonesians bear dreadful  
testimony to the dangerous disintegration of the power of the 
republic's central government. 
</P>
<P>
	Violent deaths are occurring daily through the vast archipelago.  
... While many of them are the result of the huge pressures caused 
by Indonesia's economic collapse, hundreds have been killed in 
direct retribution for the transmigration program aggressively 
promoted by the Suharto government, which clamped down hard on 
dissent and expressions of interracial, inter-religious animosity. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be easy to argue that the Jakarta government should be  
more active. But the administration of President B.J. Habibie has 
already moved far more quickly on reform than most expected. The 
proximity of the (June 7) poll has hamstrung Habibie on further 
reforms. The decision of the Indonesian armed forces to wind down 
direct involvement in the political process has left a hiatus in 
civil law enforcement that cannot be easily filled. Depressing as 
it sounds ... prospects for an early end to the killings are not 
good.

	Le Temps, Geneva, Switzerland, on the round-the-world balloon:  
</P>
<P>
	For nearly three weeks, that marvellous machine which flew

balloonists held the whole world in their hands and offered to 
share it with us. Thanks to them, this earth, for a moment in 
everyone's life, became ours again. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Now they are back. They returned to the ground in their  
miniscule cabin, underneath this balloon which now seems huge and 
clumsy. ... 
</P>
<P>
	You only remember the first. The success of Bertrand Piccard,  
Brian Jones and their team certainly depressed all the balloonists 
who thought they could go round the world before them. But, 
discreetly swallowing their bitterness, they joined in with the 
enthusiasm. This victory belongs to them too. Thanks to them the 
suspense remained intact, the field open, and the dreams 
inexhaustible. ...

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- U.S. telecommunications company MediaOne Group  
Inc. and Britain's Cable and Wireless PLC said Wednesday they are 
considering the sale of One 2 One, Britain's fourth-biggest mobile 
phone operator. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said another possibility may be to spin off One 2  
One through initial public offering of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
	A sale of One 2 One could fetch $18 billion, the Financial Times  
newspaper reported. It would be the first time that a British 
mobile phone company has changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Launched in 1993, One 2 One now has 2 million subscribers and  
covers 96 percent of Britain's population. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times said potential buyers include Germany's  
Deutsche Telekom and Mannesmann Telekom, and U.S. companies Bell 
Atlantic Corp and SBC Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne, the fourth-largest U.S. cable company, said Monday it  
would explore the sale of its international wireless communications 
businesses after agreeing to be acquired by rival cable operator 
Comcast Corp.

<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina junior point guard Ed  
Cota said he will stay in school for one more season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cota flirted with foregoing his final year of eligibility to  
enter the NBA draft. But he said Wednesday he decided to stay in

</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of where I might go in the NBA draft, I want to get  
my degree on time and I want to help my teammates compete for a

day I want to play professional basketball but I feel I still have 
goals to meet at the college level, both on and off the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cota, a two-time second-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference  
selection, is 23 assists shy of becoming the school's career 
leader.

<HEADLINE> Dahmer Victim's Brother Murdered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The brother of one of Jeffrey Dahmer's victims  
was stabbed to death in his apartment, and pages from pornographic 
magazines were stuffed in his clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Police on Tuesday arrested a 38-year-old man in Ernest Smith's  
Sunday death but had not immediately determined a motive. The 
suspect's name wasn't released. 
</P>
<P>
	Dahmer confessed to killing, dismembering and sometimes  
cannibalizing 17 young men and boys before his 1991 arrest. He was 
beaten to death in prison by a fellow inmate in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernest's brother, 28-year-old Eddie Smith, had been missing for  
more than a year before the family learned that Dahmer admitted he 
was one of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Smith, sister of the two men, said her brothers were  
close. She said Eddie's death plunged Ernest, a Persian Gulf War 
veteran, into a depression that led him to drink, and he had some 
brushes with the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like living a nightmare all over again,'' Ms. Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ernest Smith's killer ``posed'' the body, according to a medical  
examiner's report. Figurines, which were not described in the 
report, were placed around the body and put in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheets from pornographic magazines were stuffed into his shoes  
and pants and cigarette ashes were put in an ear. The kitchen knife 
used to kill him was left in his body. 
</P>
<P>
	After Eddie Smith's slaying, the 45-year-old Ms. Smith said she  
had a series of nervous breakdowns and was diagnosed with 
post-traumatic stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she remembers Dahmer's trial, when he walked into court  
with a ``smirk.'' Dahmer was later killed in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure I'll be able to stand up and take it this time,''  
Ms. Smith said.

<HEADLINE>  Anti-Apartheid Activist Gets Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- A judge today sentenced former  
anti-apartheid hero Allan Boesak to six years in prison for 
defrauding donors to a charity he headed. 
</P>
<P>
	Boesak, 53, was convicted last week in Cape Town's High Court on  
four counts of fraud and theft from foreign donors including singer 
Paul Simon and a Swedish government aid agency. 
</P>
<P>
	He used some of the $400,000, donated to a charity he headed, to  
buy two houses in plush Cape Town suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, referring to a letter sent by Nobel laureate  
Archbishop Desmond Tutu in defense of the one-time African National 
Congress official, acknowledged that Boesak played an important 
part in ridding South Africa of the hated system of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
	But a lenient sentence would mean ``the administration of  
justice could fall into disrepute,'' Judge John Foxcroft said in 
the packed courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	As Foxcroft read the sentence, Boesak appeared to be fighting  
back tears. His wife Elna and son Allan Jr. wept. 
</P>
<P>
	After the hearing, Boesak remained defiant.  
</P>
<P>
	``My innocence is not touched in one way or the other by a  
conviction of this court,'' he told reporters. ``The last word is 
not spoken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to a widely condemned court decision Tuesday, in which  
a white farmer received a suspended sentence in the fatal shooting 
of a black infant near Johannesburg, he said: ``I have not fought 
for the murderer of a black child to walk free and for something 
like this to happen to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of supporters chanted ``Boesak, Boesak, long live  
Boesak,'' when he arrived. After sentencing, they held up signs 
reading, ``Boesak you are our hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the sentencing, Foxcroft denied an application for an  
appeal. Defense lawyer Mike Maritz said he would fight the decision 
before the appellate court. He has a 21-day window to make the 
motion, during which Boesak can remain free. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing for a suspended sentence, Maritz had said Boesak had  
been punished enough by spending all his money on legal fees and 
watching his religious and political careers collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	But state prosecutor J.C. Gerber asked the court to hand Boesak  
a sentence at least as tough as the one given to his former 
bookkeeper. Freddie Steenkamp, convicted of embezzlement, had 
earlier received a six-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Foxcroft agreed today that Boesak had already suffered, saying,  
``I take no pleasure'' in sentencing him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not likely that he will be able to slip into obscurity  
and that the stigma will probably follow him to the end of his 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter, Tutu had acknowledged being ``deeply distressed''  
by the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	However, ``His contributions to the country and its people  
outweigh overwhelmingly the consequences of those actions of which 
he has been convicted,'' Tutu wrote. ``I cannot see that it is in 
his (Boesak's) or society's interest to sentence him to 
imprisonment.''

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor: Jail F. Lee Bailey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A federal prosecutor says lawyer F. Lee  
Bailey is keeping $2 million that a client owes the government, and 
should be held in contempt if he doesn't turn it over. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey says the money was his legal fee, and most of it was  
spent defending his client. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time he fought such a claim, he lost and spent 43 days  
in prison until he paid up. 
</P>
<P>
	In court documents filed earlier this month, Assistant U.S.  
Attorney Marie DeMarco alleges Bailey is in contempt of court for 
keeping some of the money a jury ordered forfeited by imprisoned 
real estate pitchman William J. McCorkle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in contempt of anything,'' Bailey said from his Palm  
Beach County home. ``I'm not holding any money that is subject to 
the forfeiture order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCorkle and his wife were convicted of 151 fraud, money  
laundering and other counts in a get-rich-quick scheme. They were 
sentenced to 24 years in prison each, and jurors ordered them to 
forfeit $10.6 million in assets, including the $2 million set aside 
for McCorkle's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said the government is trying to keep him from handling  
McCorkle's appeal, and that all but $110,000 of the $2 million 
legal fund was spent on legal fees and expenses in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	McCorkle became a familiar face to viewers of late-night  
television with infomercials in which he told how he had gone from 
a childhood of poverty to a real-estate millionaire with a yacht, a 
luxury home and a helicopter. Prosecutors said he and his wife 
swindled customers with videotapes, books and seminars promising no 
debts, lower taxes and early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Bailey was jailed for 43 days in a dispute over $16  
million in stock seized from a man who was convicted of drug 
charges. Bailey claimed he was given the stock as legal fees, while 
the government contended it was part of the forfeiture. Bailey is 
still trying to recoup his attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey gained fame early in his career by representing Dr. Sam  
Sheppard, who case inspired ``The Fugitive,'' and Albert DeSalvo, 
who claimed he was the Boston Strangler. More recently, he was on 
the team that defended O.J. Simpson.

<HEADLINE> Justice OKs SBC-Ameritech Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- SBC Communications' planned merger with  
Ameritech Corp., which would create the nation's largest local 
telephone company, has been conditionally approved by the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's action Tuesday removed a big hurdle to the  
merger, but it still must be approved by the Federal Communications 
Commission, which is reviewing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Valued at $57 billion when it was announced in May, the merger  
would unite two local Bell companies that control 57 million phone 
lines spread through 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department approved the merger as long as the  
companies sell cellular properties in each of 17 markets. Once that 
is done, SBC also can proceed with another deal to buy the cellular 
telephone operations of Comcast Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC and Ameritech have agreed to the condition and will sell one  
of two cellular properties in each of those markets in Illinois, 
Indiana and Missouri. Markets include the major metropolitan areas 
of Chicago and St. Louis, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without these divestitures, consumers would have paid higher  
prices or received lower-quality services,'' said Joel I. Klein, 
chief of the antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups and long-distance companies wanted the  
Department of Justice to block the merger, arguing it would thwart 
local phone competition and thus the prospect of lower prices. 
They'll continue to pursue that option at the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Divestiture of the cellular properties was a no-brainer. We  
are deeply disappointed that the DOJ didn't do a lot more than 
that,'' said the Consumer Federation of America's Mark Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, which has expressed doubts about companies' need to get  
big to compete, hasn't ruled out any options, including imposing 
conditions on the merger or blocking it. SBC and Ameritech, 
however, are confident the FCC will approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts believe the FCC will impose conditions, but Ameritech's  
general counsel, Kelly Welsh, said ``it's too early to predict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio-based SBC Communications Inc. and Chicago-based  
Ameritech, supported by major telephone unions, said the merger 
would be good for consumers and competition. The merger, they said, 
will spur local phone competition and possibly lower prices, 
accelerate the roll-out of high-speed Internet access and data 
services and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also gives them the financial clout and efficiencies of size  
to provide local phone service in 30 markets outside their combined 
13-state local region. Such a move would have SBC-Ameritech 
competing against fellow Bell companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents contend the merger would create a too-powerful company  
that would discourage rivals from offering local phone and other 
competing services in SBC-Ameritech's local phone region. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states in the proposed merger are Arkansas, California,  
Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Illinois, 
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Study Urges U.S. To Avoid Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States should resist imposing  
unilateral, economic sanctions when a country behaves offensively 
because they rarely work, a new study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanctions also place a burden on U.S companies, their workers  
and the economy as a whole, to the benefit of competitors, said the 
report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a 
Washington-based foreign policy think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups estimate sanctions cost the U.S. economy from $5  
billion to $20 billion in lost sales each year. But human rights 
groups support them as a way of punishing repressive regimes and 
say they contributed to bringing down South Africa's apartheid 
regime in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	As the study was released several members of Congress from both  
houses, led by Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., were holding a news 
conference today to introduce a sanctions reform bill. It proposes 
several guidelines when sanctions are considered either by the 
president or Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	These include increased administration consultation with  
lawmakers, public hearings, a cost-benefit analysis, a preference 
for targeted and multilateral measures whenever possible, 
presidential waivers when needed and automatic cancellation of any 
sanctions after two years unless Congress and the president 
re-authorize them. 
</P>
<P>
	When Lugar introduced similar legislation last year, he said the  
bill proposed that ``we might have sanctions sometimes, but only 
after we know what we are doing.'' Sponsoring the measure in the 
House is Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill., chairman of the Ways and Means 
subcommittee on trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration favors some overhaul of U.S policy on  
sanctions to make them more efficient but maintains they should 
remain an arrow in the diplomatic quiver in the words of a State 
Department official. 
</P>
<P>
	The CSIS report said that instead imposing economic sanctions,  
the United States should remain engaged with countries whose 
behavior it finds offensive except in rare cases. While the slower 
pace of engagement is less spectacular than high-profile punishment 
of a country, the report says it is almost always more effective. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has sanctions in effect covering 26 countries  
from Angola to Zambia accounting for half of the world's 
population.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Prepares for Yugo Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American and allied warships and bombers stood  
ready today to deliver a ``swift and severe'' blow to Yugoslavia, 
starting with a U.S.-led barrage of sea- and air-launched cruise 
missiles that would target Yugoslav air defenses and open the way 
to a larger-scale bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision on when to start the attacks lay with U.S. Army  
Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's top commander. NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana gave Clark the formal go-ahead Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``No alternative is open but to take military action,'' Solana  
said solemnly at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Solana 
announced his move just hours after last-ditch talks in Belgrade 
between President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. special envoy Richard 
Holbrooke ended in failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Solana  
said: ``Up to now we have not heard of any change in the behavior 
of President Milosevic. ... We are going to continue with the 
decision taken yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary  
William Cohen were summoned to the White House before 7:30 a.m. 
today, about two hours after eight U.S. B-52 bombers were seen 
flying out of a British air base. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton prepared the nation for an imminent attack on  
Serb targets, saying that although American troops would be at 
risk, the air campaign is necessary for Europe's long-term 
stability. Congress lined up behind him, dropping a move to cut the 
financial rug from under U.S. military action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to level with you,'' Clinton said in a speech Tuesday.  
``This is like any other military action. There are risks in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said American diplomatic efforts had reached a dead end  
and Serb troops were terrorizing and murdering civilians in Kosovo, 
a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic. ``We have to 
take a stand now,'' Clinton said. ``If we don't do it now, we will 
have to do it later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An opening volley of cruise missiles would be fired from four  
U.S. Navy ships and two submarines in the Adriatic, along with one 
British sub, plus Air Force B-52 bombers flying from a base in 
England. Also likely to be among the first in action: Air Force 
F-117 stealth fighter-bombers based in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Tuesday that the  
Yugoslav Army was dispersing its air defense equipment in 
anticipation of NATO airstrikes. Yugoslav officials, citing an 
``imminent threat of war,'' declared a state of emergency, 
mobilized troops and put the army on a high state of alert. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have plans for a swift and severe air campaign,'' Bacon  
told reporters. ``This will be painful to the Serbs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, appearing Tuesday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live''  
program, said, ``The purpose of this is to deter Slobodan Milosevic 
from continuing on his rampage and going in and torching, having 
his soldiers and his special police torch the villages. It is 
designed to deter that and also to damage his capability to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commander who would direct the air campaign, on orders from  
Clark in Brussels, is Navy Adm. James O. Ellis Jr., commander in 
chief of Allied Forces Southern Europe. From his headquarters in 
Naples, Italy, he also is commander of U.S. Naval Forces Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said NATO has the option of using the Air Force's B-2  
stealth bomber, which has never seen combat. The radar-evading 
plane, at $2 billion apiece the most expensive plane ever built, 
can drop satellite-guided bombs on a round-trip sortie from the 
only B-2 base, at Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has a force of 350 to 400 aircraft earmarked for airstrikes  
in Yugoslavia. Just under 200 are American, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	As NATO strikes appeared all but inevitable, Russian Prime  
Minister Yevgeny Primakov registered his opposition by canceling a 
White House visit even as he flew to Washington on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to patch up differences with Moscow, Albright spoke  
by telephone for more than half an hour with her Russian 
counterpart, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, according to Albright's 
spokesman, James P. Rubin. Albright told Ivanov she hoped the 
United States and Russia could find a way ``to deal with the 
situation and continue to work in other ways,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also conferred twice by telephone with Solana, the NATO  
chief, and talked separately with the foreign ministers of France, 
Britain and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	One major diplomatic casualty of the decision to bomb  
undoubtedly will be the 1993 START II treaty, which would sharply 
reduce arsenals of U.S. and Russian long-range nuclear weapons. 
Spurgeon Keeny, president of the private Arms Control Association, 
said Primakov's canceled visit ``bodes ill for what appeared to be 
favorable prospects for Russian ratification of the START II treaty 
and for longer-term U.S.-Russian relations.'' The Russian 
parliament has not ratified the document. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate had been scheduled to take a major procedural vote on  
legislation by Republican leaders designed to keep Clinton from 
using U.S. military power in the Balkans crisis without support 
from Congress first. 
</P>
<P>
	But after Clinton met with congressional leaders at the White  
House, Senate leaders shifted gears and expressed support for 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at a critical hour,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a  
potential presidential candidate in 2000, said. With a bombing 
campaign imminent, it was no time to undermine Clinton's role as 
commander in chief, McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate then voted 58-41 Tuesday night to support Clinton's  
decision, while asking for more information later. Thirty-eight 
Republicans and three Democrats -- Sens. Jeff Bingaman of New 
Mexico, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin and Ernest Hollings of South 
Carolina -- opposed the resolution. Supporting the measure were the 
remaining 42 of the Senate's 45 Democrats and 16 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The brief measure states that ``the president of the United  
States is authorized to conduct military air operations in 
cooperation with our NATO allies against the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).''

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Carjackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court made it harder today for  
federal prosecutors to seek extra punishment for alleged carjackers 
who hurt or kill someone during their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-4 decision came in the case of a California man who  
challenged his 25-year prison sentence for a 1992 violent 
carjacking in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a federal crime to use a gun while taking a motor vehicle  
from someone else by force and violence, and the maximum penalty is 
15 years in prison. But if ``serious injury results,'' the maximum 
penalty goes up to 25 years, and if a death results from the crime, 
the convicted carjacker can be sentenced to life behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel Jones was sentenced to 25 years because the stolen  
car's owner had been threatened with a gun and hit in the ear with 
the gun hard enough to cause bleeding and permanently affect his 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Jones' conviction  
and sentence in 1997, rejecting his argument that prosecutors 
should have been required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the 
``serious injury'' provision of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also rejected Jones' contention that his  
conviction was tainted because prosecutors failed to include the 
``serious injury'' provision in the indictment against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the 9th Circuit court ruled that the provision is a  
sentencing factor that need not be mentioned in a carjacking 
indictment and requires less stringent proof than the 
beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``We think the fairest reading of (the law) treats the fact of  
serious bodily harm as an element, not a mere enhancement,'' and 
therefore such harm must be charged in an indictment and proved to 
a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, Justice David H. Souter wrote for 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The government had argued that the serious injury and death  
provisions need not be proved to a jury, but could be determined by 
a judge at sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that interpretation, Souter said the law ``would be open  
to constitutional doubt'' involving the Sixth Amendment guarantee 
of a jury trial in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a potential penalty might rise from 15 years to life on a  
non-jury determination, the jury's role would correspondingly 
shrink from the significance usually carried by determinations of 
guilt,'' Souter added. 
</P>
<P>
	His opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin  
Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices  
Anthony M. Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the four, Kennedy said the ruling ``casts doubt on  
sentencing practices and assumptions followed not only in the 
federal system but also in many states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the nation's highest court first agreed to hear Jones' case  
last year, it appeared the justices would decide whether Congress 
had overstepped its authority when it made carjacking a federal 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	But the justices subsequently ditched that constitutional issue  
and made it clear it they would decide only the dispute resolved 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 2, the court preserved the broad sweep of the federal  
anti-carjacking law, rejecting a legal challenge that would have 
limited it to cases in which robbers intend to hurt their victims 
no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled in a New York case that the law also covers  
crimes committed with the ``conditional intent'' of harming victims 
who refuse to comply with the robbers' demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The case acted on today is Jones vs. U.S., 97-6203.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell dedicated a new boutique for  
breast cancer patients in honor of her mother, who died from the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roseann O'Donnell Boutique at Beth Israel Medical Center's  
cancer center in Manhattan will offer wigs, breast prostheses, 
special bras and other items. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a comprehensive care center that offers different  
accessories for women to help them with their appearance, 
self-esteem and self-image while they are going through this,'' 
O'Donnell said at the dedication Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The talk show host, who donated $300,000 to start the boutique,  
was only 10 years old when her mother died. O'Donnell has been an 
avid supporter of breast cancer awareness. 
</P>
<P>
	The boutique is open to the public, and proceeds will be donated  
to breast cancer charities.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Mulls Ways To Push IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress could cripple the International  
Olympic Committee by denying it millions of dollars in 
sponsorships, one of several incentives lawmakers are considering 
in an effort to push the panel toward reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The leverage: Nine of the top 11 IOC sponsors are American  
companies and the IOC receives the bulk of its television revenue 
from the United States. Each sponsor pays $40 million-$50 million 
every four years, and NBC has committed $3.5 billion for U.S. 
Olympic rights through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to Sen. Ted Stevens, the Senate's authority on the  
Olympics, are preparing legislation to impose harsh penalties if 
the IOC doesn't clean up its operations -- and the games' image -- 
following the worst scandal in its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is likely to move through the Senate Commerce  
Committee, chaired by Sen. John McCain. The Arizona Republican is 
taking steps, too, to lean on the IOC, including inviting committee 
President Juan Antonio Samaranch to the panel's April 14 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also will call upon former Senate majority leader George  
Mitchell, who headed a five-person commission that released a 
report March 1 that was highly critical of IOC operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing, McCain said Wednesday, is necessary ``so we can  
receive the assurances of Sen. Mitchell and others that (the 
allegations) are correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Congress has no authority over the Olympic Charter,  
Stevens' legislation would be a resolution that would impose three 
kinds of sanctions against the IOC if the embattled panel doesn't 
enact certain reforms to charter. 
</P>
<P>
	The punishments considered by the panel are:  
</P>
<P>
	--limiting the IOC's nonprofit status under U.S. law, which  
allows it to receive tax-exempt contributions; 
</P>
<P>
	--limiting the business tax deductions which U.S. law allows  
contributors to take; 
</P>
<P>
	--remove broadcast rights from the IOC and bestow them  
exclusively on the United States Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior aide to Stevens who demanded anonymity said that the  
provision limiting tax deductions may not survive the bill-drafting 
process because it would all but guarantee the withdrawal of U.S. 
business contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The revocation of broadcast rights, on the other hand, is  
legally and legislatively the strongest of the proposed 
punishments, the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid such sanctions, the IOC must:  
</P>
<P>
	--establish limits on and require disclosure of gifts received by  
IOC members in their duties. The charter currently provides no 
limits, though the IOC limits gifts to no more than $150; 
</P>
<P>
	--establish an independent panel of non-IOC members to review and  
recommend punishments for alleged violations of the Olympic Charter 
by IOC members. Presently, IOC members can be removed only upon the 
recommendation of its Executive Board, which is comprised of IOC 
members; 
</P>
<P>
	--establish a conduct guide for potential host cities and for the  
disqualification of candidate cities for violations. 
</P>
<P>
	--establish uniform policies on banned substances and procedures  
enforced by an independent agency and adopted by the international 
sports federations, national Olympic committees and the Olympic 
organizing committees. Currently, the three entities have 
conflicting policies; 
</P>
<P>
	--make public a quadrennial report disclosing all IOC receipts,  
expenditures and gifts received by members. The charter does not 
require the IOC's report to be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	--improve accountability among the IOC and its executive board by  
guaranteeing seats to countries that have held Olympics. IOC 
members are accountable to no one, a situation that Stevens and 
McCain believe led to the bribery scandal this year.

	NATO Set To Attack Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Air raid sirens sounded for several  
minutes today in Pristina, signaling that NATO airstrikes against a 
defiant Yugoslavia could come soon. Belgrade has declared a state 
of emergency to warn citizens of an impending bombing. Yugoslav 
forces scattered to hide from an expected missile attack. A wave of 
U.S. B-52 bombers stationed in Britain flew out of their base this 
morning and are on standby for a strike on Serb targets. But 
Yugoslavia's ambassador to Russia says his country is ready to 
resume peace talks with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, who left 
Belgrade yesterday after failing to reach a deal with President 
Slobodan Milosevic. 

</P>
<P>
	Pentagon Prepares Yugoslavia Attack  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Military officials say American and allied  
warships and bombers stand ready today to deliver a ``swift and 
severe'' blow to Yugoslavia, starting with a U.S.-led barrage of 
sea- and air-launched cruise missiles that would target Yugoslav 
air defenses. President Clinton yesterday prepared the nation for 
an imminent attack on Serb targets, saying that although American 
troops would be at risk, the air campaign is necessary for Europe's 
long-term stability. Clinton said American diplomatic efforts had 
reached a dead end and Serb troops were terrorizing and murdering 
civilians in Kosovo. 

</P>
<P>
	Primakov Says Airstrikes Won't Help  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov abruptly  
canceled a planned trip to the United States after getting word of 
the failed diplomatic effort in Yugoslavia, and warned that NATO 
airstrikes against Serb targets would only raise international 
tensions. Primakov, who was to meet with President Clinton and Vice 
President Gore in an effort to secure new loans from the 
International Monetary Fund, said an attack would damage relations 
between Russia and the United States. President Boris Yeltsin said 
Russia ``has been and will be categorically opposed to NATO use of 
force.''

	Pinochet Awaits Extradition Ruling  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's highest court is expected to rule today  
on whether former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet can be 
extradited to Spain. Pinochet was arrested last October in London 
on a Spanish warrant as Spain wants to try Pinochet on genocide and 
terror charges stemming from his 17-year rule. The House of Lords 
had earlier ruled against Pinochet, saying he was not entitled to 
immunity from prosecution as a former head of state. But that 
decision was thrown out because one of the judges had links to a 
human rights group taking part in the case.

	31 Die in Kenya Train Crash  
</P>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- At least 31 people were killed today when  
a passenger train in Kenya derailed. Five non-African foreigners 
were among those killed in the accident on the edge of Tsavo 
National Park, 155 miles southeast of Nairobi, according to the 
Defense Department. Their nationalities were not immediately 
available. Officials said there could be as many as 100 people 
still trapped in the wreckage.

	Two Pakistan Bus Accidents Kill 60  
</P>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Soldiers searched for more bodies

as 60 people, police said. The army sent in dozens of soldiers to 
dredge the Jehlum canal near Mandi Bahauddin, 90 miles north of 
Lahore, the capital of the Punjab province. The accident occurred 
yesterday. So far, nine bodies have been recovered from the 
fast-moving canal.

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Bryon Russell hit a 3-pointer with just  
4.7 seconds left to give the Utah Jazz an 84-81 victory over the 
Miami Heat last night in a matchup of two of the NBA's best teams. 
The Jazz erased an eight-point fourth-quarter deficit to win at 
home for the 24th time in their last 25 games. Utah leads the 
Midwest Division with a 20-6 record, and Miami is first in the 
Atlantic with an 18-7 mark.

	NATO Airstrikes Hit Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Wave after wave of NATO warplanes  
and missiles struck Yugoslavia today, pummeling army barracks, 
power plants and air defenses in a bid to force Serbs to cease an 
onslaught against Kosovo Albanians. Scores of cruise missiles and 
dozens of warplanes attacked, including six U.S. B-52 bombers and 
two B-2 stealth bombers, appearing in combat for the first time. 
The Yugoslav army declared a state of war shortly after the first 
wave of NATO attacks. It said more than 20 targets were hit, but 
claimed that no air defense units were damaged. Explosions hit 
Belgrade and Kosovo's capital of Pristina

	Clinton Endorses NATO Attack  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today acknowledged the risk  
of American and allied losses in airstrikes on Serb forces in 
Yugoslavia. ``Only firmness now can prevent greater catastrophe 
later,'' Clinton said. He promised a more complete explanation in 
an Oval Office address to the American public tonight at 8 p.m.. 
Defense Secretary William Cohen said there was some air-to-air 
combat, but ``our aircraft have safely returned'' after the first 
wave. A defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
at least one Yugoslav MiG fighter was shot down.

	Russia Halts NATO Partnership  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin pulled Russia out of its  
partnership with NATO today and warned of possible further steps to 
protest the airstrikes against Yugoslavia. He called the attacks 
deeply troubling. If the conflict grows, Russia reserves the right 
to take ``adequate measures, including of a military character, to 
ensure its own and general European security,'' Yeltsin said after 
airstrikes began.

	McDougal: Husband Made Up Stories  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal testified today that her  
former husband, now dead, made up stories implicating President 
Clinton in Whitewater to appease prosecutors and win a lighter 
prison sentence. Testifying at her trial for refusing to answer 
questions before the Whitewater grand jury, Mrs. McDougal said 
James McDougal urged her to tell what she called ``stories'' about 
the president, including that Clinton knew about a fraudulent 
$300,000 loan to his Whitewater business partners, the McDougals. 
Mrs. McDougal said she never discussed the loan with Clinton.

	32 Die in Kenya Train Crash  
</P>
<P>
	MAN-EATER'S JUNCTION, Kenya (AP) -- A train carrying more than  
400 people to Kenya's Indian Ocean coast derailed along a curve 
before dawn today. At least 32 people were killed and over 100 were 
injured, Kenyan officials said. Passenger cars of the 
Nairobi-to-Mombasa train tumbled onto the dusty scrubland and 
crashed into each other in the dark just before the Tsavo River, 
155 miles southeast of the capital, Nairobi.

	Pentagon Questioned Over Anthrax  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers questioned Pentagon officials today  
about plans to inoculate 2.4 million members of the armed forces 
against anthrax. Up to 200 service members have refused to take the 
vaccine. The Pentagon has said that 220,000 have been vaccinated. 
At a House hearing, many critics of the Pentagon's mandatory policy 
also testified, raising concerns over whether the vaccine would 
place many soldiers in more danger.

	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Federal regulators today ordered Kiwi Air  
Lines to stop flying. It said the tiny discount carrier was 
``unable or unwilling'' to fly with top safety standards. The 
Federal Aviation Administration ordered the Newark-based carrier, 
which filed for bankruptcy yesterday, to cancel its six-city flight 
schedule.

	Dow Ends Down 4.99  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed narrowly mixed today after a  
lackluster session as traders recovered from yesterday's big drop. 
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 4.99 to close at 9,666.84 
after trading in a narrow range all day. NATO's launching of air 
strikes against Yugoslavia had no apparent effect on the stock 
market. On the NYSE, gainers led losers 1,512-1,440. The Nasdaq was 
at 2,365.25, up 42.41.

	NCAA Puts Wisconsin on Probation  
</P>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin's athletic program was placed on  
two years' probation today for what the NCAA described as 
widespread, unauthorized spending of booster club money. But the 
school's teams were spared penalties involving postseason 
tournaments, TV appearances and scholarships. The NCAA said the 
university must conduct an internal audit and develop a program on 
compliance of NCAA rules.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Struggles With Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian repeated his request to  
a judge today to allow relatives of the man he is accused of 
murdering to testify in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The 70-year-old retired pathologist argued spiritedly Tuesday in  
trying to get Melody Youk, the wife of Thomas Youk, on the witness 
stand. But Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Jessica Cooper 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
	She told Kevorkian to file a brief with his arguments by this  
morning on why he should be allowed to call Youk's widow and his 
younger brother, Terrence, whom Kevorkian also was seeking to call. 
</P>
<P>
	A brief signed by Kevorkian, who is acting as his own attorney,  
was filed today by David Gorosh, one of his legal advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	The brief said Youk's widow and brother should be allowed to  
testify under exceptions to rules against hearsay testimony. It 
contends that what Youk's relatives said to Kevorkian, especially 
statements that they did not intend for him to kill Youk, ``is 
relevant to the defendant's state of mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it said the testimony about what Kevorkian said to them  
would shed light on whether he killed Youk with premeditation and 
deliberation, which are necessary for first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorosh said the brief restated ``in legalese'' arguments  
Kevorkian tried to make Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has a new appreciation for what trial lawyers do,''  
Gorosh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution said it would file a response to Kevorkian's  
brief later today. The trial was in recess until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Cooper had repeatedly urged Kevorkian to reconsider  
representing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution essentially argued Tuesday, and the judge  
agreed, that since mercy killing is not a defense allowed in the 
murder statute, presenting material to the jury about Youk's 
suffering would be irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
	``In essence, he is railroading himself to a quick conviction  
unless there is a backlash of sympathy from the jury for the 
predicament he's in,'' said Larry Dubin, a law professor at the 
University of Detroit-Mercy, commenting on Tuesday's developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Youk, 52, died Sept. 17. A videotape later aired by CBS shows  
Kevorkian giving Youk a lethal injection of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was charged with first-degree murder and delivery of a  
controlled substance after daring prosecutors to file charges. He 
had faced trial four times before on assisted suicide charges, with 
cases ending in three acquittals and a mistrial. But he had never 
before been charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, prosecutors showed jurors the central piece of  
evidence against Kevorkian -- the ``60 Minutes'' videotape -- and 
rested their case before lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors watched intently but showed little emotion during the  
video. It shows Kevorkian asking Youk about his struggles with Lou 
Gehrig's disease and getting consent for his death before injecting 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Youk was diagnosed two years ago with the fatal disease, also  
known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It is a progressive illness 
that eventually leaves victims unable to speak, swallow or move. 
</P>
<P>
	Before trial, Cooper ruled that Kevorkian could describe Youk's  
pain and suffering in defense of an assisted suicide charge -- but 
not in defense of a murder charge. Consent by the subject of a 
mercy killing is not a defense to murder under Michigan law. 
</P>
<P>
	After Cooper's ruling, prosecutors dropped the assisted suicide  
charge and narrowed the scope of evidence Kevorkian could 
introduce. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Price Foley, a professor at the Detroit College of Law  
who watched part of Tuesday's proceedings, said Cooper had a 
delicate balancing act to perform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her frustration is palpable,'' Foley said. ``She has to weigh  
his constitutional right to represent himself with his 
constitutional right to a fair trial.''

<HEADLINE> McDougal: Husband Made Up Stories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal testified today that her  
former husband, now dead, made up stories implicating President 
Clinton in Whitewater to appease prosecutors and win a lighter 
prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying at her trial for refusing to answer questions before  
the Whitewater grand jury, Mrs. McDougal said James McDougal urged 
her to tell what she called ``stories'' about the president, 
including that Clinton knew about a fraudulent $300,000 loan to his 
Whitewater business partners, the McDougals. Mrs. McDougal said she 
never discussed the loan with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But her ex-husband warned her, ``If you don't tell this story,  
you're going to jail,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDougal, who at first refused to cooperate with Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr, changed his mind after being convicted of 
fraud, Mrs. McDougal said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me this is something he had to do because he did not  
want to die in jail,'' she testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal also suggested there may have been collusion  
between Starr's office and Jim McDougal to get her to allege she'd 
had a sexual affair with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	After he began cooperating with Starr's office in 1996, ``Jim  
told me ... `just say you had a sexual affair with Bill Clinton,''' 
Mrs. McDougal testified. 
</P>
<P>
	She said McDougal told her ``There is a man'' in Starr's office  
``named Hickman Ewing who believes he can get Clinton on a sex 
charge'' and ``sink him before the election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her ex-husband told her that ``you can write your own  
ticket'' with Starr's office if she made the sex allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, Ewing said that he didn't talk to Jim  
McDougal about any sex allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not doing anything along those lines at all,'' said  
Ewing. ``I've never heard any discussion along those lines in my 
office at the time frame she was talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing up to 84 years in prison, McDougal was sentenced to three  
years because of his cooperation with prosecutors. He died in 
federal prison in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said she listened as her ex-husband tried out  
different versions of his ``outlandish'' story that Clinton 
discussed the loan briefly with him and former municipal judge 
David Hale, who made the federally backed $300,00 loan. Hale also 
has said Clinton knew about the loan, but Mrs. McDougal maintains 
he lied, too. 
</P>
<P>
	She recalled McDougal saying as he rehearsed the story, ``I have  
got a whole new twist, what do you think about the way I say this, 
does this sound believable?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal alleged that at one point her ex-husband suggested  
she could get a deal with Starr's office if she simply testified 
that Clinton was present for a discussion about the $300,000 loan. 
``If you come in and say this you can write your own ticket,'' she 
quoted McDougal as telling her. 
</P>
<P>
	During four hours of testimony Tuesday, Mrs. McDougal  
occasionally dabbed tears from her eyes as she testified that her 
husband's mental illness was the undoing of their marriage and 
business, and ultimately led to the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Mark Geragos, said the testimony Tuesday was a  
``cathartic'' experience for his client. She has said she refused 
to answer federal grand jury questions because she feared 
retaliation from prosecutor Kenneth Starr if he didn't like what 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way she was going to get out the true story here was  
to tell it in a courtroom,'' Geragos said outside the courthouse. 
Mrs. McDougal is charged with obstruction of justice and criminal 
contempt of court for refusing to answer grand jury questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal and her late ex-husband were partners with the  
Clintons in the Whitewater real estate venture in northern 
Arkansas. The McDougals and then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker were convicted 
of business fraud in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, she refused to answer grand jury questions about the  
Clintons and spent 18 months in jail for civil contempt. She again 
refused to answer the questions in April last year and was indicted 
on two counts of criminal contempt and one count of obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking directly at jurors and choking back tears, Mrs. McDougal  
said Tuesday her ex-husband was ``a control person,'' had a temper 
and experienced mood swings, but would not concede at first that he 
had a problem. She said he suffered from manic depression and had 
serious health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors showed no expression. Some took notes; others rocked  
in their chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal described how she was in awe of her husband,  
trusted him and did not realize until their marriage hit the skids 
and their Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan was being investigated 
by bank examiners that he had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	When McDougal asked her to sign a $300,000 loan to her from  
Hale's Capital Management Services, she did not question him, she 
said. Hale, a prosecution witness in the 1996 trial, has claimed 
that Clinton pressured him to make the fraudulent loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale has served 21 months of a 28-month sentence for defrauding  
the Small Business Administration through Capital Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal described how James McDougal, who also had worked  
on Clinton's gubernatorial staff in Arkansas, ``loved Bill Clinton 
very much.'' But she said her husband became angry with Clinton 
after the thrift failed and McDougal was charged in the late 1980s 
with banking violations.

<P>
	JONESBORO, Ark. (AP) -- The wreath of white roses and red apples  
was for the teacher. Four others -- decorated with a softball, 
ladybugs, frogs, yellow daffodils and ivy -- were for the students. 
</P>
<P>
	They adorned a memorial podium Wednesday, each precious to the  
families of the five killed a year ago in a hail of bullets at a 
Jonesboro schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Families and friends marked the anniversary with a ceremony on  
the Craighead County Courthouse lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I miss most is the memories we never had the chance to  
have,'' student Darah Tate said of her teacher and friend, Shannon 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	At 12:20 p.m. the crowd observed a moment of silence for  
students Natalie Brooks, Paige Ann Herring, Stephanie Johnson and 
Britthney Varner and Mrs. Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to friends and relatives, about 250 people attended  
the one-hour service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was indeed one year ago that this horrendous thing  
happened,'' said The Rev. Laird Duran. ``Since then our community 
has not been the same. No parent, husband or friend should have to 
experience this horrible loss.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Details of AmWest Contract Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- America West's 2,300 flight attendants will  
divide $3.1 million in bonuses as part of their tentative contract 
agreement with the airline, union officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline averted a strike by reaching a five-year, $80  
million deal over the weekend with the Association of Flight 
Attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFA's negotiating committee on Wednesday night released some  
details of the contract, which includes a pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-scale flight attendants will see their salary rise from  
$23,800 to between $32,200 and $33,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight attendants would also be paid daily expenses for the  
first time -- a payment for every hour they are on the job or 
awaiting a flight to their home base. 
</P>
<P>
	The per diem rate is $1.30 per hour, increasing to $1.50 per  
hour after 30 months of the contract and $1.75 per hour after 60 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	America West spokesman Patty Nowack said the airline had no  
comment on the tentative contract, which still must be ratified by 
a secret mail ballot by the flight attendants with the final count 
scheduled April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	America West, based in suburban Tempe, has hubs in Phoenix, Las  
Vegas and Columbus, Ohio, serving 53 domestic destinations and 
eight cities in Mexico and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com, Samsung OK Korea Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Internet bookseller Amazon.com signed  
a deal with Samsung Corp. today to sell books in South Korea 
without charging high shipping costs, Samsung officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract allows Seattle-based Amazon.com to use Samsung's  
Internet shopping-mall Web site to sell books, music and other 
wares in South Korea, beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, South Koreans have had to pay shipping charges to buy  
Amazon.com books, which are shipped individually from the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Under its deal with Samsung, Amazon.com will ship books in large  
quantities to South Korea, eliminating most of the shipping costs 
that individual shoppers must pay, Samsung officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipping costs have been a hurdle for Amazon.com's efforts to  
expand sales in South Korea and other countries.

<HEADLINE>  Stock Prices Narrowly Mixed / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed Wednesday as investor  
concerns about earnings eased following Tuesday's big selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
0.56 at 9,672.39, after falling 218.68 Tuesday. That was the Dow's 
second-biggest point loss this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took some froth out of some of these stocks yesterday,  
and there's a lot of talk of 'we'll wait and see' here,'' said Tim 
Morris, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was off 0.11 at 1,262.03. 
</P>
<P>
	Market bull Abby Joseph Cohen, the equity strategist at Goldman  
Sachs, raised her 12-month target on the S&AMP;P to 1,325 from 1,275. 
Cohen also raised her target on the Dow to 10,300 from 9,850. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite was up 5.16 at 2,328.00. That index, which  
is heavily weighted in technology shares, has been weaker amid 
concerns that computer-related companies will report disappointing 
first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	But John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.  
of Hartford, Conn., was unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every quarter, you see a big dip in the market because of  
concerns about the upcoming quarter's earnings,'' Shaughnessy said, 
``and that's what we're witnessing. The key thing is that the 
underlying fundamentals remain very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were watching the escalating conflict in Kosovo, but for  
the time being were not concerned that possible NATO air strikes 
would pull stocks lower. Bond prices were firmer today, with the 
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond steady at 5.53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds were helped by a Commerce Department report that February  
orders for durable goods to the nation's factories dropped a sharp 
5 percent. February's decline followed big gains in January and 
December and left orders still above the November level. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow stocks were helped by technology shares, with IBM up 2 1/4 at  
167 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Stock Exchange stocks were led by America Online, which  
was down 4 3/16 at 116. Brown Brothers Harriman downgraded the 
stock's rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Internet stocks were down as well. Yahoo! was off 5 3/8 at  
150 1/8 in Nasdaq trading, and Amazon.com was off 2 at 117 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues edged out advancers on the NYSE, with 1,322 up  
and 1,340 down. Volume was strong at 346.31 million shares, but 
down from Tuesday's pace of 373.84 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks fell sharply for a second day in a row as  
investors sold shares following Tuesday's tumble on Wall Street. 
The Nikkei 225 stock average slid 3.14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	European stock markets were sharply lower in afternoon trading,  
hit by earnings concerns and the prospect of combat in the Balkans. 
London's FT-SE 100 stock index was off 0.81 percent, but the DAX 
index in Frankfurt was down more than 2.74 percent, and the CAC in 
Paris was off 0.52 percent.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A Swiss engineer and his German  
co-worker were kidnapped this week while working for a local cement 
company, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lirgg Hans Ulrich, 46, of Switzerland and Axel Slogsnat, 47, of  
Germany were kidnapped Tuesday in northwestern Antioquia state, 
diplomats from both countries said. The state is a longtime 
battleground between leftist rebels, rightist paramilitary groups 
and the army. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear who kidnapped the men, but Swiss embassy  
counselor Jean Pierre Billard said evidence pointed to the rebels. 
Billard said that the kidnappers had yet to contact authorities or 
demand ransom. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's army has blamed the abductions on the 15,000-member  
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's 
largest rebel group. FARC units frequently kidnaps foreigners and 
demands ransom to finance its insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia has the world's highest kidnapping rate, and foreigners  
are prized abductees because they often fetch the highest ransom.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Representatives for hundreds of exonerated  
prisoners filed a civil suit Wednesday demanding financial 
compensation for the time they spent in prison on terrorism 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	President Alberto Fujimori released 470 prisoners convicted of  
terrorism during Peru's war against leftist rebels in the past 
three years after a government commission reviewing their cases 
found they were innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	The freed prisoners have received no compensation for their  
prison time and many have encountered trouble rebuilding their 
shattered lives. 
</P>

	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- About 2,000 people marched  
through the nation's capital Wednesday to mark the 19th anniversary 
of the March 24, 1980, assassination of Roman Catholic Archbishop 
Oscar Romero. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrying bunches of red roses and carnations, the marchers  
chanted ``After 19 years of martyrdom, 19 years of hope, Monsignor 
Romero lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romero, a critic of abuses by the Salvadoran military during the  
country's civil war, was shot to death while celebrating Mass in a 
church in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1993 U.N. Truth Commission report said there was evidence  
Romero's killing was ordered by former army major and rightist 
politician Roberto D'Abuisson, who died of cancer in 1992 and was 
never formally charged in the crime.

	TOLUCA, Mexico (AP) -- A former state attorney general has been  
sentenced to serve a 4 1/2-year prison sentence for ordering police to 
discard the tortured body of a prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Peredo Merlo, attorney general of the southern state of  
Morelos until his arrest in early 1998, is the highest-ranking 
official to be convicted in scandals that also have forced the 
resignation of the state's governor and many of his subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
	Peredo was free on bail during the yearlong trial on charges of  
torture and covering up criminal activity. His conviction on both 
counts can be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, traffic police in the neighboring state of  
Guerrero caught state police dumping the body of kidnapping suspect 
Jorge Nava Aviles along a road. 
</P>

	Police officers had beaten Nava to death, and Peredo ordered  
officers to get rid of the body.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican officials said Wednesday that better  
weather and greater prevention efforts caused a drop in the number 
of forest fires, a year after massive fires sent clouds of smoke as 
far as north as the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But they cautioned more dry weather is forecast this year,  
especially in the north of the country, and that the upcoming Holy 
Week is traditionally the most dangerous time of the year because 
of increased travel and camping activities. 
</P>
<P>
	This year 1,248 forest fires have been recorded, charring 25,594  
acres, well below the same period last year, when officials 
recorded 4,322 fires destroying 202,600 acres. 
</P>

	The government has increased television, radio and newspaper  
advertisements on fire safety and distributed more than 1 million 
pamphlets.

	Alfredo Laya, the newly elected governor of Vargas state, home  
of Venezuela's largest port, was to visit Taiwan this week at the 
invitation of the Taiwan Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	A state spokesman said Laya canceled the trip, which was aimed  
at attracting foreign investment, after Venezuelan Foreign Ministry 
officials said it might be seen as recognition of Taiwan's 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	China considers Taiwan a renegade province and discourages  
diplomatic relations with the island, which declared its 
independence at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.

<HEADLINE> Feds Seek Minority Help for Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The federal government is forming  
partnerships with labor unions and black, Hispanic, and American 
Indian advocacy groups amid fear that millions of people won't be 
counted in the 2000 census. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau announced plans Wednesday to link with such  
organizations as the National Urban League, AFL-CIO and National 
Congress of American Indians to help persuade people in minority 
communities to cooperate and be counted. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans include placing advertisements in the ethnic press and  
using advocacy groups to recruit some of the temporary employees 
the Census Bureau uses for its once-a-decade head count. 
</P>
<P>
	The government estimates 4 million Americans went uncounted in  
the 1990 census. Most of them were urban poor, and the undercount 
may have deprived that group of hundreds of millions of dollars in 
federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Many immigrants, legal and illegal, fear that filling out census  
forms or talking to census-takers will get them in trouble with the 
government, said Delia Ibarra, spokeswoman for the Mexican American 
Legal Defense Fund, one of the groups working with the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't understand it is illegal for census information  
to be shared with the IRS or INS,'' Ibarra said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibarra's group plans to raise $2 million to pay for ads and hire  
community workers to urge Hispanics to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics were undercounted by 5 percent in 1990, the Census  
Bureau estimates. Only American Indians fared worse.

<HEADLINE> Durable-Goods Orders Drop 5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American manufacturers fighting to recover  
from the world economic slump suffered a setback in February with 
the sharpest drop in more than seven years in new orders for 
airplanes, electronics and other big-ticket goods, the Commerce 
Department reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders slumped 5 percent to a seasonally adjusted $192 billion,  
about double the drop predicted by economists and the worst since 
December 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sector is still struggling to show a significant  
turnaround,'' said economist Lynn Reaser of Bank of America Private 
Bank in Jacksonville, Fla. ``The magnitude of the decline was very 
large and it was widespread.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The slump that began in Asia nearly two years ago has hurt U.S.  
manufacturers by cutting their export sales and forcing them to 
compete at home against low-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	That pushed the U.S. trade deficit to a record $169 billion last  
year and prompted lawmakers, over opposition from the Clinton 
administration, to try to protect one particularly affected 
industry, steel. The House, by a 289-141 vote last week, passed 
legislation sharply limiting steel imports to pre-1998 levels. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, though, the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal  
report was primary metals, which includes steel. Those orders 
jumped 7.2 percent. Every other category posted a decrease. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, speaking in New York,  
acknowledged ``business problems and job losses'' resulting from 
the growing trade deficit. But he said the benefits of imports are 
sometimes overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imports reduce prices and increase choice for consumers;  
reduce prices and increase choice for producers, which should lead 
to greater job creation and higher wages,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had been encouraged by significant gains in durable  
goods orders, of 3.3 percent in January and 3.4 percent in 
December. But factory layoffs continued despite the increase in 
orders. Job losses total 337,000 over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The February drop in orders ... will spur more job cutbacks,''  
said economist Ken Mayland of KeCorp in Cleveland. ``The only good 
coming out of this is that the weakness in the factory sector will 
keep any buildup of inflationary pressures at bay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. factories would have been much harder hit by international  
weakness if not for offsetting strong consumer demand -- aided by 
plenty of jobs and high stock prices -- in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a separate report suggests a bit of strain may be  
developing in Americans' ability to keep up the spending. The 
delinquency rates for both credit cards and other consumer loans 
increased during the final three months of last year, the American 
Bankers Association said. 
</P>
<P>
	A seasonally adjusted 3.45 percent of credit-card accounts were  
30 or more days past due, up from 3.28 percent the previous 
quarter. A composite rate for other consumer loans, including car 
loans and closed-end home equity loans, rose to 2.35 percent from 
2.29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a huge 32 percent drop in civilian aircraft orders  
explained a lot of the decline in orders for durable goods, 
expensive items expected to last at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
	But orders excluding the volatile aircraft industry, where the  
timing of a handful of orders can distort the trend, also fell -- by 
3.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders plunged 37.9 percent for military goods, 8.5 percent for  
electronic and other electric equipment, 9.4 percent for 
transportation equipment other than aircraft, 8.5 percent for 
electronic and electrical equipment and 0.4 percent for industrial 
machinery.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Flag-Burning Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Tuesday renewed its push for a  
constitutional amendment that would authorize Congress to ban 
desecration of the American flag, a measure that died last year for 
lack of Senate action. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment has acquired enough support for passage in the  
House and, supporters say, for ratification by the states. House 
supporters said they were trying again for the third piece of the 
equation -- a two-thirds vote in the Senate -- over the objections of 
critics who say the measure violates the First Amendment's 
protection of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I disagree with this assertion,'' said Rep. Charles Canady,  
R-Fla., chairman of the House subcommittee on the Constitution. 
``Burning the flag is burning the flag, not making a speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others who testified at Canady's hearing on Tuesday  
disagreed, saying the measure would allow Congress to govern 
people's thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This amendment would give Congress the power to dictate to the  
American people how they can and cannot express themselves,'' Rep. 
John Lewis, D-Ga., told Canady's panel. ``It would allow Congress 
to prohibit a particular expression, to outlaw a particular 
thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that flag desecration is an act  
of free expression protected by the First Amendment. Congress 
responded by passing the Flag Protection Act, but the court struck 
down the law in 1990 as being inconsistent with free speech 
protections. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Republican-controlled House in 1995 adopted a flag  
protection amendment by 312 to 120, far more than the two-thirds 
vote required. But the Senate vote failed by three votes, and the 
measure died. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you pass this amendment, you presume to read the minds of  
dissenters across the nation,'' said former Rep. David Skaggs, a 
Democrat from Colorado.

<HEADLINE> New Efforts at Exposing New Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wherever she happens to be performing, rock 'n'  
roll singer Mary Cutrufello can never be certain that the local 
music store has her record in stock or that the clerks even know 
who she is. 
</P>
<P>
	So it was a real boost when the 311-store Best Buy music chain  
made her one of its featured artists in a campaign aimed at 
promoting young talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutrufello's debut album and the work of seven other artists are  
prominently displayed in each store, their discs are discounted and 
Cutrufello starred in a television commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a publicity stunt that's also a symptom of something gone  
awry. Best Buy's campaign, and a just-introduced Billboard 
publication on new musicians, speaks to a growing concern about the 
music industry's failure to support and develop new talent. 
</P>
<P>
	For every Jewel and Alanis Morissette who become big stars,  
dozens more talented musicians falter. Experts blame tightened 
radio playlists that offer fewer chances for new artists to be 
heard, and the tendency of record companies to concentrate on a few 
superstars that can make money in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want new faces to rally around,'' said Billboard  
editor-in-chief Timothy White. ``When you have so few people -- good 
or bad -- that people are paying attention to, it makes the music 
industry seem so claustrophobic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new quarterly publication, The Billboard WeatherBureau,  
features reviews, features and trend stories just on new artists. 
It's designed for an industry audience and people intensely 
interested in music. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a certain irony: so much music goes unnoticed partly  
because there's so much music out there. Some 28,000 CDs were 
released last year, said Gary Arnold, Best Buy's senior vice 
president of merchandising. That's triple the figure of a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few dedicated fans are familiar with more than a small  
fraction of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be a daunting task to go through all of it and see what  
you might like,'' Cutrufello said. ``It's hard to keep up. Not that 
you slavishly follow what other people say, but if there's someone 
you can trust telling you something's good, that really helps. It's 
like a good club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best Buy is trying to act as that filter. In addition to the  
displays, the chain will have listening posts so fans can sample 
featured artists, and also hopes to sponsor concert tours soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Cutrufello, a rock singer whose style is inspired by  
Bruce Springsteen, Best Buy has targeted dreamy rocker Rufus 
Wainwright, country singer Kelly Willis, New York swing band Blues 
Jumpers and other newcomers Thievery Corporation, David Garza, 
Patricia Barber and Remy Zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the artists, like Wainwright, have been critically  
acclaimed, and others are virtual unknowns who record for 
independent labels. Willis isn't exactly new -- she released three 
albums in the early 1990s -- but her latest Rykodisc album is her 
first in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so much unheard music out there that's really good,  
I'm grateful and applaud anybody who's going to try to help improve 
things,'' the Austin-based Willis said. ``It will definitely help 
to have your CD in a visible spot ... It's just that much more of a 
chance that they will give you a listen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a second chance for Cutrufello. Her debut last summer was  
accompanied by a certain amount of critical fuss, but she lost any 
chance for commercial momentum when her record company was 
swallowed up in the Universal Music Group consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
	Best Buy has two primary motivations. Someone who tries a new CD  
and enjoys it is likely to come back for more, of course. And it 
helps to cultivate a reputation where music fans can find something 
new, since most music fans see that as a weakness of big chains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for records that people are passionate about,''  
said Best Buy's Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
	Billboard saw the same industry void when it decided to launch  
its new publication. It has been a common complaint that companies 
don't have the patience to stick with artists and help them 
develop, dropping them if there's no quick success. 
</P>
<P>
	A mission statement in the magazine's first issue says  
WeatherBureau ``will report only on those emerging artists we seek 
to recommend, with all our coverage non-aligned and our reviews 
free of the crass grading symbols that demean artists and critics 
alike. We want to alter the way everyone looks at the new music 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
	White said he hoped it acted like some cold water to the face of  
the music business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to have much of a record industry if it's just  
down to 10 or 15 superstar acts and the rest just get swept away,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> O'Brien Is Familiar With Big East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In the college basketball fraternity, careers often overlap from  
one school to another. For Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien, there are 
all kinds of connections in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien, whose Buckeyes face Big East champion Connecticut on  
Saturday at the Final Four, has deep roots in that conference. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was growing up in Brooklyn, N.Y., O'Brien had an army of  
recruiters after him. St. John's, a Big East charter member, was 
among those hot on his trail. He chose Boston College, another Big 
East original. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lou Carnesecca recruited me very hard,'' O'Brien said on  
Wednesday. ``If I didn't go to Boston College, I was probably going 
to St. John's. I became very familiar with St. John's, not only as 
a high school player but in college. I played against them and I 
coached against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And last week, he knocked St. John's out of the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
	That put Ohio State in the Final Four, where the Buckeyes drew  
UConn, another longtime O'Brien connection. He spent five years as 
an assistant coach with the Huskies on Don Perno's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coaches spend a lot of time recruiting and one of  
O'Brien's first assignments at UConn was Karl Hobbs, now an 
assistant coach at the school. Hobbs' high school coach was Mike 
Jarvis, now the head coach at St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing and coaching in Boston, O'Brien became friendly with  
other New England coaches, including the head man at Northeastern. 
One month after he was hired as head coach at BC, Jim Calhoun, his 
old pal from Northeastern, got the job at UConn. 
</P>
<P>
	The coincidence wasn't lost on O'Brien.  
</P>
<P>
	``We got into the Big East together,'' he told Calhoun, ``and we  
find ourselves getting into the Final Four at the same time.''

<HEADLINE> Race Tracks OK Online Betting Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Wanna bet on horses? Maryland bettors may be  
able to do so on their home computers beginning May 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Pimlico Race Course and Laurel Park have reached an agreement  
with Youbet.com, a Los Angeles-based company, to provide online 
betting as well as handicapping information and audio and video 
from races. Both tracks are owned by the Maryland Jockey Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Subscribers would have to pay a monthly fee to get race  
information through secured software. 
</P>
<P>
	Youbet.com officials said they plan to take bets on the  
Preakness on May 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland officials say profit isn't their motive, but more to  
see if and how this new kind of betting will affect the state's 
race tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really aren't looking at the venture right now as making  
money or not making money. We're going to analyze what kind of 
effect it is going to have on Maryland,'' said James Mango, chief 
administrative officer for the tracks. ``We're trying to 
self-defend ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But track officials hope having this kind of betting in place  
locally will keep other states from grabbing racing revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Youbet.com deal expires at the end of the year,  
Maryland Jockey Club officials will have a chance to see if it 
really has an impact on Maryland before making a long-term 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Youbet.com already webcasts races from about 20 tracks. Although  
Youbet.com posted losses of $11.2 million on revenues of $98,000 
for the nine-month period that ended last September, industry 
experts expect online gambling to be big business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other jurisdictions have said, `Let's make a deal,' and roll  
with it. Our approach is to see how it works before we strike a 
long-term deal,'' Mango said. 
</P>
<P>
	The local tracks would get a percentage of the total wagers,  
much like the split of revenues from a simulcast. It's unclear, 
however, what percentage Maryland tracks would get. 
</P>
<P>
	With simulcast races, usually 3 percent of wagers is split  
evenly between the tracks and their purse account, which 
distributes it to horse owners, trainers and jockeys that finish 
fourth or better in a race. 
</P>
<P>
	Although laws passed in 1984 permit betting over the phone,  
including online betting, there are no regulations governing these 
kind of enterprises because there has been little interest so far. 
The writing of regulations has also been delayed while Gov. Parris 
Glendening reviews gambling issues. 
</P>
<P>
	But Youbet.com can bypass the lack of regulations because it's  
routed through a Pittsburgh-area harness race track, The Meadows, 
said Bruce Spizler, an assistant Maryland attorney general and 
counsel to the Maryland Racing Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	A study commission on horse racing recommended Friday that  
regulations be written soon to permit Internet and telephone 
wagering. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor has not yet had an opportunity to look at those  
recommendations, said Karen Napolitano, a spokeswoman for the 
Department of Licensing, Labor and Regulation, which oversees the 
racing industry.

<HEADLINE> Feds May Have Funded Ore. Suicides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There is a ``remote possibility'' federal  
dollars were used for services related to two physician-assisted 
suicides in Oregon last year, the Clinton administration said in 
documents made public Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 federal law prohibits the use of federal dollars for  
physician-assisted suicides. Oregon is the only state where 
assisted suicide for terminally ill patients is legal. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon officials, who plan to complete an investigation next  
month, said they would refund the money if they found any federal 
dollars were used. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter released Wednesday by Rep. Thomas Bliley, the  
administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration wrote 
that the government believes Oregon is complying with the 
physician-assisted suicide law. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a five-page report accompanying the letter, Nancy-Ann Min  
DeParle's agency said ``there is a remote possibility a physician 
may have erroneously submitted claims ... related to 
physician-assisted suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency was responding to questions submitted in writing last  
month by Bliley, chairman of the House Commerce Committee, and 
three other committee Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers asked the Clinton administration to review whether  
Oregon is complying with federal law by covering assisted suicides 
in its health plan for 350,000 poor Oregonians. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 1, Oregon began covering physician-assisted suicide  
under its health plan for the poor, known as the Oregon Health 
Plan. No one has filed claims under the Death With Dignity Act 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
	But two patients who died before Dec. 1 were covered by the  
Oregon Health Plan. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible that doctors for those patients could have  
submitted Medicaid claims that went through the system and were 
reimbursed, said Hersh Crawford, who oversees the state's Medicaid 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials said that 15 terminally ill Oregonians used the  
act to end their lives in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon Health Plan is funded in part by federal Medicaid  
dollars, but state and federal officials have tried to ensure that 
any costs related to the Act are paid entirely by the state.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Parliament OKs Big Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Parliament on Wednesday approved a  
record-breaking set of tax cuts totaling $79 billion in an effort 
to pull the nation out of its worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts are Japan's largest ever. Combined with a $691 billion  
budget passed in Parliament last week, they are intended to 
stimulate Japan's ailing economy, suffering from a banking crisis 
and slumping domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax package gained final approval in Parliament's upper  
house and is scheduled to take effect April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Government spokesman Satoshi Watanabe said $58 billion of the  
tax cuts are permanent reductions applicable mainly to income, 
residential and corporate taxes. The balance is for strategic tax 
relief such as relief on mortgages, Watanabe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will finance the measures with bonds, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition, income tax rates will be slashed by 20 percent,  
with the maximum reduction set at $2,110, while residential tax 
will be reduced by 15 percent, up to a maximum of $338. 
</P>
<P>
	The effective corporate tax rate will be cut from 46.36 percent  
to 40.87 percent, which near rates in other industrialized 
countries. The cut will reduce corporate taxes by $19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is also set to abolish taxes on securities  
transactions and commissions at some exchanges, Watanabe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recently-approved budget, also to take effect on April 1,  
includes legislation to boost government spending by 5.4 percent 
and calls for $84 billion in new public works outlays. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget's approval was the swiftest in postwar history,  
reflecting a growing urgency within the government to reinvigorate 
the world's second largest economy.

<HEADLINE> NHL Trades Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Apparently, the Detroit Red Wings didn't believe they had enough  
to win a third straight Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	So on the final day for NHL trading, the Wings were the busiest  
barterer, adding 59 years of experience to their roster Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings, with a mediocre 34-30-6 record, added star  
defenseman Chris Chelios from Chicago, veteran defenseman Ulf 
Samuelsson from the New York Rangers, and wing Wendel Clark and 
backup goalie Bill Ranford from Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get a chance to acquire a player like Chris Chelios,  
you get pretty excited,'' Red Wings general manager Ken Holland 
said. ``He's one of the premier defensemen in the National Hockey 
League. We felt it was a move we had to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Chelios has won three Norris Trophys as the  
league's top defenseman in a 16-year career. He is one of the NHL's 
best two-way defensemen and a big hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	The rugged Samuelsson isn't bad, either, having won two Stanley  
Cups in Pittsburgh early in the decade. He's currently out 2-3 
weeks with a broken foot, and was obtained for a 1999 second-round 
pick and a third-round selection in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit already is without defensemen Todd Gill and Uwe Krupp.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously the Rangers made their decision to not include me in  
their plans, or I think I would have been signed already,'' said 
Samuelsson, who will be an unrestricted free agent after this 
season. ``But I'll listen to them again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, 32, is one of hockey's best leaders. In his 14th season,  
he was the Lightning's leading scorer with 28 goals and 14 assists 
in 65 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranford, who was the MVP of the 1990 playoffs in helping  
Edmonton win the Stanley Cup, appeared in 32 games for the 
Lightning and compiled a 3-18-3 record in his 14th NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
	For Chelios, the Blackhawks received defenseman Anders Eriksson  
and first-round draft picks in 1999 and 2001. Chicago lost 5-2 at 
Pittsburgh hours after the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely a roller coaster day for us,'' Tony Amonte  
said. ``There was a lot of emotion spent all afternoon, and you 
could see we just didn't have the jump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit traded backup goalie Kevin Hodson, 27, and two draft  
picks for Clark and Ranford. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's other Stanley Cup finalist, the Washington Capitals,  
with little hope for a playoff berth this season, sent longtime 
captain Dale Hunter to the Colorado Avalanche, forward Joe Juneau 
to the Buffalo Sabres and wing Craig Berube to the Philadelphia 
Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche gave Washington a 1999 second-round draft pick for  
Hunter and a third-round selection in 2000. Juneau, who has 14 
goals and 27 assists this season, was dealt with a 1999 third-round 
pick to the Sabres for minor league defenseman Alexei Tezikov and 
future considerations. Berube will join the Flyers in exchange for 
future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been really tough, really emotional, after what we  
accomplished last year,'' Capitals general manager George McPhee 
said. ``Pulling these guys out of the mix wasn't easy, but they're 
all unrestricted free agents and we weren't going to get anything 
for them this summer if they signed elsewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also:  
</P>
<P>
	--San Jose obtained center Vincent Damphousse from the Montreal  
Canadiens for a 1999 fifth-round draft pick and a 2000 second-round 
selection. The Sharks also got wing Greg Pankewiecz from the 
Calgary Flames for future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the guy's got some darned good credentials,''  
Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi said of Damphousse. ``This guy 
has played at a high level and played for Team Canada, so there's 
more to him than just numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Toronto acquired center Yanic Perreault from the Los Angeles  
Kings for minor league forward Jason Podollan and a '99 third-round 
draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	--Philadelphia added one of the top offensive defenseman in the  
league, Steve Duchesne, from Los Angeles for defenseman Dave Babych 
and fifth-round draft pick in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dallas got center Derek Plante from the Sabres for a 1999  
second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	--Florida acquired defenseman Mike Wilson from the Sabres for  
defenseman Rhett Warrener and a 1999 fifth-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Edmonton Oilers got defenseman Jason Smith from Toronto for  
a 1999 fourth-round and a 2000 second-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	--St. Louis reacquired wing Blair Atcheynum for a sixth-round  
draft pick in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	--Phoenix swapped young defensemen with the Rangers, sending  
22-year-old Jason Doig to New York in exchange for 23-year-old 
Stanislav Neckar and a sixth-round pick in the 1999 draft. The 
Coyotes also sent center J.F. Jomphe to Montreal for future 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers also acquired defenseman Chris O'Sullivan from  
Calgary for defenseman Lee Sorochan, and right wing Kevin Brown 
from Edmonton for left wing Vladimir Vorobiev. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Blackhawks acquired right wing Chris Murray from the Ottawa  
Senators in exchange for Nelson Emerson. 
</P>
<P>
	--Vancouver traded center Peter Zezel to the Anaheim Mighty Ducks  
for future considerations.

<HEADLINE> CBS, TNN Combine of Documentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Minutes into the 13-part ``Century of  
Country'' documentary, it's clear how broad an undertaking it is to 
even define country music, much less tell its story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Country music is the same thing as the blues,'' Waylon  
Jennings opines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Country music is contemporary jazz,'' singer Ray Price  
declares. 
</P>
<P>
	Harlan Howard, the great country music songwriter (``Busted,''  
``I Fall to Pieces''), offers this: ``Basically, it's the people's 
music. We really do deal with divorces and tragedies and so forth. 
And sometimes people think we're kind of hokey. But country music 
is here and it always will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on previews of two episodes -- one covering pioneers like  
Jimmie Rodgers and The Carter Family and the other on bluegrass and 
Western swing -- ``Century of Country'' captures the wide scope of 
country music and celebrates it. 
</P>
<P>
	The documentary touches on women in country music, rockabilly,  
bluegrass, Western swing, the Grand Ole Opry and honky-tonk music. 
Many current stars are interviewed, and the lives of greats like 
Hank Williams Sr., Jimmie Rodgers and Patsy Cline are covered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nashville Network will air the first of 13 weekly one-hour  
segments of ``Century of Country'' at 8 p.m. EST Wednesday (March 
31). The host is actor James Garner and CBS newsman Bob Schieffer 
narrates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Century of Country'' marks the first collaboration between TNN  
and CBS News. Westinghouse Electric Corp., which owns CBS, bought 
TNN in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had more fun,'' said Schieffer, host of the weekly news show  
``Face the Nation'' on CBS. ``Maybe because it was such a break 
after covering Monica Lewinsky and Ken Starr. It was like a 
vacation to me. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I really learned a lot. They have gone out and interviewed  
everybody that you ever heard of, and some that you've never heard 
of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the things Schieffer learned: ``Apparently Jimmie Rodgers,  
who was The Singing Brakeman, was the first person to yodel,'' he 
said. ``You would think it came from ranches or something Western. 
</P>
<P>
	``But apparently he heard some Swedish guy yodel,'' Schieffer  
said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	The series is a step forward for TNN, whose claim to be THE  
country music cable station has slipped since it started showing a 
new version of ``Roller Derby'' and reruns of ``The Waltons'' and 
``Dukes of Hazzard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if you're looking for a critical viewpoint of country music,  
wait until the Bravo cable channel reruns the three episodes of its 
excellent ``Naked Nashville.'' TNN has always been a Nashville 
booster rather than a critic, and ``Century of Country'' sidesteps 
anything that could dampen the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The shows still are a lot of fun, however. For example, it's  
hard to resist the enthusiasm of singer Marty Stuart. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can wear cool clothes,'' Stuart says in the opening  
episode, ``Celebration of Country.'' ``You can wear your hair 
goofy. Girls like you. You get applause. You get to live this nomad 
lifestyle. And you get paid for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the segment on bluegrass, 18-year-old mandolin player  
Chris Thile pays tribute to late bluegrass founder Bill Monroe, 
then reveals he's working on combining bluegrass and classical 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find there's an amazing energy in Bach that is kind of like  
some of the stuff that Bill Monroe was coming out with,'' Thile 
said. ``I wrote a song where I try to get some of that same energy 
with the bluegrass background in it -- sort of a `grassical' song.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Skaggs tries to explain how exciting Bill Monroe and the  
Blue Grass Boys were in their heyday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they were on the stage it sounded like the Beatles were  
on stage,'' Skaggs said. ``I hear these country people screaming at 
the top of their voices hearing this new music that no one had ever 
heard before. It was a new sound, it was a new day for this 
music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schieffer said he came into the assignment thinking he knew  
something about country music from a lifetime of listening. He saw 
Ernest Tubb perform when he was a boy in Fort Worth, Texas, then 
became a fan of Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
	The assignment showed him he had much to learn.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you have just the vaguest interest in country music, you'll  
find this 13 hours just fascinating,'' Schieffer said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in country music...  
</P>
<P>
	CD-ROM: A country music CD-ROM encyclopedia is being released  
with the ``Century of Country'' documentary on TNN. ``Definitive 
Country: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Country Music and its 
Performers'' features photos, audio interviews, videos and 
discographies. It is published by StarWorks Inc. and has a list 
price of $29.98. 
</P>
<P>
	THE MAN IN BLACK: TNT will air a tribute concert to Johnny Cash  
at 8 p.m. EST on April 18. The show will be taped April 6 at the 
Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City. Performers include June 
Carter Cash, Sheryl Crow, Dave Matthews, Willie Nelson, Marty 
Stuart, Chris Isaak and Emmylou Harris.

<HEADLINE>  Blue Jays' New Skipper Settling In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Jim Fregosi straddles the front seat of a  
grounds crew cart and starts talking baseball. It could take all 
day, because this is by far his favorite subject. 
</P>
<P>
	One week after returning to the dugout as manager of the Toronto  
Blue Jays, Fregosi is the epitome of a man back in his element. 
</P>
<P>
	``Has it been a week already?'' Fregosi jokes. ``It seems like a  
month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stepping into an awkward situation is nothing new for Fregosi.  
Being hired to replace Tim Johnson this spring may top the list, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays took the unusual, but not unprecedented step of  
firing Johnson in the middle of spring training in the wake of 
controversy over his lying about service in Vietnam. Fregosi, who 
took over as manager of the White Sox, Angels and Phillies in 
midseason, came on board with about three weeks left before opening 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Add the rare circumstance of managing the team that beat him in  
the 1993 World Series, and Fregosi found himself in the middle of 
baseball history -- or trivia, take your pick -- again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the only guy traded for Nolan Ryan, too,'' Fregosi said.  
``So there's a first. I guess I've been involved in a lot of 
firsts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, who turns 57 two days before Toronto's season opener,  
can't hide the fact that he has to be among the happiest people in 
baseball. He saunters around the fringes of the field for an hour 
or so before the game, signing autographs, greeting friends and 
hugging opposing coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	He managed his first game back against his former team a week  
ago, hugging the man who got his job, current Phillies manager 
Terry Francona. On Wednesday, the two shook hands as they exchanged 
lineups before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays beat the Phillies 4-3 in 10 innings Wednesday,  
giving Fregosi two straight victories over his former team. He's 
3-4 since Johnson was fired. Thoughts of his six years in 
Philadelphia are never far away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a one-year club,'' Fregosi said of the '93  
Phillies, whose heartbreaking World Series loss to the Blue Jays on 
Joe Carter's homer off Mitch Williams still haunts Philadelphia 
fans. ``You win with offense, and offense comes and goes from year 
to year. I think Atlanta's proved over this decade that if you have 
pitching, pitching always keeps you in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi calls the Blue Jays' starters -- Pat Hentgen, David  
Wells, Joey Hamilton, Kelvim Escobar and Chris Carpenter -- 
``probably by far the best starting rotation I've ever managed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Fregosi needs is a closer. Robert Person was regarded as  
the front-runner, but hasn't been healthy. It might turn into the 
dreaded ``bullpen by committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No closer? No problem. In Philadelphia, Fregosi had a knack for  
grooming them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had Mitch Williams, who never threw a strike, and went to  
Doug Jones, who never threw a ball,'' Fregosi said. ``Then I had 
Heathcliff Slocumb, who never closed before, and Ricky Bottalico, 
who never closed before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fired by the Phillies after the 1996 season, Fregosi was with  
the San Francisco Giants as a special assistant to the general 
manager when Blue Jays GM Gord Ash sought permission to talk to 
him. He also had interviewed for the spot before Ash picked 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's in your blood, you're always happier doing something  
you've always done,'' said Fregosi, who signed a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	From his rough, sunbaked skin to the slicked-back,  
salt-and-pepper hair to his managerial style, the essence of 
Fregosi is ``old school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how he is. That's his style,'' Cecil Fielder said. ``As  
a player, you really have to appreciate that. All he's saying is 
give him 100 percent. If that's all my manager is asking me to do, 
I think I can handle that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, who has a 861-938 record in 13 seasons, said he never  
would have been able to stay in managing without a break between 
jobs. He had three years off after managing the White Sox and two 
full seasons away from it after getting fired by the Phillies.	   ``I don't know how these guys do it, manage for 15 straight 
years,'' Fregosi said. ``I think you kind of lose perspective on 
how things are. You need to kind of rejuvenate. I've managed a long 
time, but I've always had a break in between. You do come back with 
a new enthusiasm, so to speak.''

giving Fregosi two straight victories over his former team. He's 
3-4 since Johnson was fired. Thoughts of his six years in 
Philadelphia are never far away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a one-year club,'' Fregosi said of the '93  
Phillies, whose heartbreaking World Series loss to the Blue Jays on 
Joe Carter's homer off Mitch Williams still haunts Philadelphia 
fans. ``You win with offense, and offense comes and goes from year 
to year. I think Atlanta's proved over this decade that if you have 
pitching, pitching always keeps you in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi calls the Blue Jays' starters -- Pat Hentgen, David  
Wells, Joey Hamilton, Kelvim Escobar and Chris Carpenter -- 
``probably by far the best starting rotation I've ever managed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Fregosi needs is a closer. Robert Person was regarded as  
the front-runner, but hasn't been healthy. It might turn into the 
dreaded ``bullpen by committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No closer? No problem. In Philadelphia, Fregosi had a knack for  
grooming them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had Mitch Williams, who never threw a strike, and went to  
Doug Jones, who never threw a ball,'' Fregosi said. ``Then I had 
Heathcliff Slocumb, who never closed before, and Ricky Bottalico, 
who never closed before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fired by the Phillies after the 1996 season, Fregosi was with  
the San Francisco Giants as a special assistant to the general 
manager when Blue Jays GM Gord Ash sought permission to talk to 
him. He also had interviewed for the spot before Ash picked 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's in your blood, you're always happier doing something  
you've always done,'' said Fregosi, who signed a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	From his rough, sunbaked skin to the slicked-back,  
salt-and-pepper hair to his managerial style, the essence of 
Fregosi is ``old school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how he is. That's his style,'' Cecil Fielder said. ``As  
a player, you really have to appreciate that. All he's saying is 
give him 100 percent. If that's all my manager is asking me to do, 
I think I can handle that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, who has a 861-938 record in 13 seasons, said he never  
would have been able to stay in managing without a break between 
jobs. He had three years off after managing the White Sox and two 
full seasons away from it after getting fired by the Phillies.	   ``I don't know how these guys do it, manage for 15 straight 
years,'' Fregosi said. ``I think you kind of lose perspective on 
how things are. You need to kind of rejuvenate. I've managed a long 
time, but I've always had a break in between. You do come back with 
a new enthusiasm, so to speak.''

<HEADLINE> Plane Crash Relatives Now Relieved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Relatives of people who died in the 1994  
crash of USAir Flight 427 expressed relief Wednesday that after 
more than four years they finally know what caused the disaster 
outside Pittsburgh that killed all 132 people on the Boeing 737. 
</P>
<P>
	They praised the National Transportation Safety Board for  
criticizing the Boeing 737's rudder system and recommending changes 
to improve it. But family members who attended the board's meeting 
were less hopeful that the Boeing Co. or the Federal Aviation 
Administration would act quickly to implement any fixes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a fight for four and a half years just to find out how  
my daughter got killed,'' said Fred Rubino of Poland, Ohio. ``Now I 
hope they do what they are supposed to do to correct the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Johnson of New Bedford, Mass., whose mother was on the  
doomed flight, said he feared the aviation industry would place 
business over human life and resist costly changes to the 737, the 
world's most widely used jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board, wrapping up two days of hearings, declared  
that a rudder reversal caused the USAir crash as well as the 1991 
crash of United Airlines 585 outside Colorado Springs, Colo., that 
killed all 25 people aboard, and another near-crash in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The board, which has no regulatory powers, asked the FAA to  
convene a panel including Boeing officials to further improve the 
rudder system's design. But Boeing and FAA officials said they 
believe changes already being made are eliminating the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol McSherry, whose husband was on Flight 427, said that while  
grieving does not end with the investigation's finish, ``I no 
longer have to concentrate on how he was killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Hamley, whose wife was a 427 flight attendant, said he was  
relieved the crew was not blamed, and he praised the safety board 
for its strongly worded findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty sound. It's pretty decisive,'' Hamley said. ``Now  
will the FAA implement it? That's the $64 question. I'm 
pessimistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many relatives complained about the length of the probe, stymied  
because the plane had a primitive recorder that documented only 11 
pieces of flight information. The investigation is the longest in 
the NTSB's 31-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The board's chairman, Jim Hall, met privately with family  
members after the meeting, and participants said he apologized for 
taking so long. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives urged each other to press the FAA and Congress to  
force changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will pay attention to families,'' Hollie Bush of Shaker  
Heights, Ohio, said after the closed-door session. Her daughter, a 
bank executive, died coming home from a business trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Melinda Worrell of St. Petersburg, Fla., said the findings won't  
bring her father back but might prevent other families from 
suffering a similar fate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most positive thing is they know the cause of the  
accident, which enables them to prevent accidents in the future,'' 
she said.

<HEADLINE> House Restricts Arlington Burials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Burial at Arlington National Cemetery would be  
restricted to those who die on active military duty, and just a few 
others, under House-passed legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, passed 428-2 on Tuesday, also won House approval in  
the last Congress but was not taken up by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Burial at Arlington would be limited under the bill to members  
of the Armed Forces who die on active duty, military retirees, 
recipients of the Medal of Honor and other top awards, former 
prisoners of war and the president and former presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	It would eliminate the need for a waiver for a spouse and  
immediate family to be buried together with an eligible veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also end presidential waivers, but would allow  
Congress to grant individual waivers on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress, the vice president, Supreme Court justices,  
Cabinet secretaries and ranking diplomats would no longer be 
eligible simply on the basis of having served in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army has estimated that the 612-acre cemetery overlooking  
the Potomac River could be full by 2025 at current burial rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Burial at Arlington became an issue two years ago when it was  
revealed that Larry Lawrence, a big donor to the Democratic Party 
and ambassador to Switzerland, had received a waiver to be interred 
at the cemetery, in part because he claimed to have been wounded 
while serving in the Merchant Marine in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	After it was found that Lawrence had not served in the war as he  
had stated, his widow had his body exhumed and buried in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 70.

<HEADLINE> Gardening Tempos: Slow Versus Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- In the midst of ever-dizzier speeds, a  
good place to slow down is the garden. You get time for reflection. 
</P>
<P>
	For sure, this is easier for retirees than for working people.  
But I've known dedicated gardeners who would find time for both job 
and garden, even rising earlier in the morning to tend their 
beloved plants and breathe easy among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Drop a seed in the ground, or in a flat under lights, and you've  
got to wait for it to sprout. Maybe it won't, if the seed is sick 
or dead or if the light, soil, humidity and temperature aren't 
right. But it will take at least a few days, and maybe a couple of 
weeks, or even more than a month, for you to find out. 
</P>
<P>
	That's part of the scene -- the waiting, the anticipation and  
then the delight of seeing that first touch of green or the sense 
of failure if nothing shows. 
</P>
<P>
	But no message flashes across a screen saying you've goofed and  
telling you to retry or press any key to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	In a culture of sound bites and fast chips, slow motion may be  
tiresome to some. In fact, speed lovers have made some inroads into 
gardening. To cut time, many people have abandoned seed-sowing 
altogether in favor of ready-to-go plants. At a nursery, I've seen 
people spend hundreds of dollars in a single day on plants. They'll 
have lettuce patches and flowerbeds overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, with perennial ornamentals and trees, the time  
involved in getting growth makes it sensible to buy plants. But 
annual flowers and vegetables may easily be raised from seed, 
depending on your interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardening completely with store-bought plants resembles painting  
with numbers or eating only in restaurants or bringing takeout 
meals home. It's not art or cooking. 
</P>
<P>
	But you might ask what's wrong with beautifying your place with  
store-bought plants or cutting nursery-bred fresh lettuce leaves 
out of the garden? Who cares that they come from the nursery or, if 
you're well-off, that you hire somebody to do all the work? 
</P>
<P>
	Augusta Carter, a Georgia-born master gardener I knew, once told  
me, ``A gardener has to get grimy and dirty and enjoy what comes 
out of real work. If you're one of those people who are afraid to 
get your fingernails soiled or broken and you don't want to put on 
dirty old jeans and old sneakers and get out and dig, you're not 
really a gardener.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now dead, she was 81 at the time, but still intensely involved  
in the gardening she first got to love as a child in Georgia's red 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
	There are levels of gardening, of course. For some, it's just a  
kind of decor, like wallpaper or furniture. For others, it's a 
passion. 
</P>
<P>
	Even today, these aficionados not only plant from seed packets,  
they know how to save seeds from their own plants and propagate 
them. Many old-time tomato and pepper growers are reproducing 
heirloom varieties year after year with the seeds they expertly 
save. 
</P>
<P>
	But the signs seem to point the other way. I've just seen two  
new books -- ``The 20-Minute Gardener'' and ``The 20-Minute 
Vegetable Gardener,'' both by Tom Christopher and Marty Asher. They 
give helpful hints on how you can garden in just 20 minutes a day, 
or 40 if you're doing both veggies and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	In this time-saving climate, more and more seedhouses nowadays  
are offering pots of annual plants to be shipped to you at the 
right time, all set to go in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the great American pastime of mowing the lawn is affected.  
I do mine with an easy-to-use cordless electric mower. I asked my 
hardware store recently why they don't stock them. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer I got was, ``Few people around here are even buying  
gas-driven mowers any more. They hire landscaping crews to come in 
and do the lawn for them.''

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Hasek Out With Back Twist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dominik Hasek returned to practice but sat  
out Wednesday night's game after twisting his back against the New 
Jersey Devils a night earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury Tuesday night did not appear serious, but the Buffalo  
Sabres removed their star goalie from the lineup as a precaution 
for the game at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek was skating back in the crease when he was hit by Devils  
rookie Brendan Morrison with 49 seconds remaining in overtime 
Tuesday. The goaltender lay on the ice several minutes before 
getting up and finishing the game, which ended 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody hit my head, and I felt a big pain between my  
shoulders,'' Hasek said. ``I was afraid to move. Now I can move 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek rejoined the lineup March 19 after taking a month off with  
a strained groin. Buffalo went 5-4-3 during his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres recalled rookie Martin Biron to back up Duane Roloson  
against Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton Remarks on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of a Wednesday afternoon statement by President Clinton, as  
transcribed by the Federal News Service: 
</P>
<P>
	Good afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	United States forces, acting with our NATO allies, have  
commenced airstrikes against Serbian military targets in the former 
Yugoslavia. I will address the nation more fully tonight on why 
this action is necessary, but I wanted to say a few words now. 
</P>
<P>
	We and our NATO allies have taken this action only after  
extensive and repeated efforts to obtain a peaceful solution to the 
crisis in Kosovo. But President Milosevic, who over the past decade 
started the terrible wars against Croatia and Bosnia, has again 
chosen aggression over peace. He has violated the commitments that 
he, himself, made last fall to stop the brutal repression in 
Kosovo. He has rejected the balanced and fair peace accords that 
our allies and partners, including Russia, proposed last month, a 
peace agreement that Kosovo's ethnic Albanians courageously 
accepted. Instead, his forces have intensified their attacks, 
burning down Kosovar Albanian villages and murdering civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	As I speak, more Serb forces are moving into Kosovo, and more  
people are fleeing their homes -- 60,000 in just the last five 
weeks, a quarter of a million altogether. Many have headed toward 
neighboring countries. Kosovo's crisis now is full-blown. And if we 
do not act, clearly it will get even worse. Only firmness now can 
prevent greater catastrophe later. 
</P>
<P>
	Our strikes have three objectives. First, to demonstrate the  
seriousness of NATO's opposition to aggression and its support for 
peace. Second, to deter President Milosevic from continuing and 
escalating his attacks on helpless civilians by imposing a price 
for those attacks. And third, if necessary, to damage Serbia's 
capacity to wage war against Kosovo in the future by seriously 
diminishing its military capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	As I have repeatedly said to the American people, this action is  
not risk-free. It carries risks. And I ask for the prayers of all 
Americans for our men and women in uniform in the area. However, I 
have concluded that the dangers of acting now are clearly 
outweighed by the risks of failing to act: The risks that many more 
innocent people will die or be driven from their homes by the tens 
of thousands; the risks that the conflict will involve and 
destabilize neighboring nations. 
</P>
<P>
	It will clearly be much more costly and dangerous to stop later  
than this effort to prevent it from going further now. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the 20th century, after two world wars and a cold  
war, we and our allies have a chance to leave our children a Europe 
that is free, peaceful and stable. But we must, we must, act now to 
do that because if the Balkans once again become a place of brutal 
killing and massive refugee flights, it will be impossible to 
achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	With our allies, we used diplomacy and force to end the war in  
Bosnia. Now trouble next door in Kosovo puts the region's people at 
risk again. Our NATO allies unanimously support this action. The 
United States must stand with them and stand against ethnic 
violence and atrocity. Our alliance is united. 
</P>
<P>
	And I am particularly grateful for the support we have received  
from members of Congress from both parties. As we go forward, I 
will remain in close contact with Congress -- I have spoken with all 
the leaders today -- and in contact with our friends and allies 
around the world. And I will have more to say about all of this 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin Gets Two Years Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- The two-year probation Wisconsin received  
for unauthorized spending of booster club money mostly embarrasses 
the school, a top NCAA investigator said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The penalties are quite light for a major violation,'' said  
David Swank, chairman of the NCAA's Division I Committee on 
Infractions. ``The university did not properly oversee what its 
booster clubs were doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school's teams were spared penalties concerning postseason  
tournaments, television appearances and scholarship allotments. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin chancellor David Ward said he was ``gratified'' the  
NCAA found most of the questioned expenditures would have been 
considered proper had necessary written approval been obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	``No competitive advantage was gained and none of the funds  
accrued to the benefit of enrolled or perspective student 
athletes,'' Ward said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Pat Richter said a plan was in place to make  
sure similar mistakes don't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel very comfortable that we have eliminated these  
problems,'' he said. ``Certainly you don't like to be in this 
position. As David Swank mentioned, it is more embarrassing than 
anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the probation, the NCAA also required Wisconsin to  
conduct a ``comprehensive internal audit'' of the booster clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The university must also file annual compliance reports,  
continue developing a comprehensive athletics compliance education 
program and require the athletic director to attend an NCAA 
compliance seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a lenient penalty, I will grant you,'' Swank said. ``You  
have to give the university credit for what it did. They caught the 
violations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About a year ago, an internal audit turned up hundreds of cases  
of unauthorized spending of booster club money on allowable items 
from 1993 to 1997. Payments were made for such things as moving 
expenses, travel and business expenses and tickets to events. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit found 77 staff members, including Richter, received  
reimbursements from booster accounts.

<HEADLINE> Japan Banks Need Capital Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Shoring up Japan's banks with an injection of  
taxpayer money is the only way to stabilize the industry and 
restore public trust, the country's financial reconstruction chief 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's banks need capital reserves as plentiful as those in the  
United States, or they will be unable to regain international 
confidence, Hakuo Yanagisawa said in a speech at the Foreign 
Correspondents' Club of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, he said there will be time to deal with  
non-performing and questionable loans, preferably by banks removing 
them from their balance sheets and repackaging them for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Yanagisawa said that he doesn't believe that it will take 10  
years or more for Japanese banks to completely wipe away their 
problem loans, as some critics have claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Japan, once something starts, it's very quickly achieved,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yanagisawa's Financial Reconstruction Commission is overseeing a  
loan cleanup that is the cornerstone of the government's plan to 
pull the country out of its worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's banks have been hobbled by bad loans estimated to total  
at least $596 billion. The problem has led to a credit crunch which 
has hampered attempts to pull the economy out of its tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
	A bailout package of $63.9 billion has been proposed to allow 15  
of Japan's largest banks to dispose of their bad loans by March 31, 
the end of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the deal was that the banks had to submit restructuring  
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They pledged that they are going to improve their profits and  
from those profits they will pay back the government,'' Yanagisawa 
said.

<HEADLINE> Children's Vehicles Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Peg Perego USA Inc. is recalling 274,000  
battery-powered children's vehicles for repair after receiving more 
than 300 reports of electrical components overheating or 
accelerator pedals getting stuck, the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Electrical components in the vehicle can cause it to overheat,  
posing fire and injury hazards to children. According to the 
government and the Fort Wayne, Ind.-based company, 30 fires have 
been reported, resulting in one child suffering third-degree burns 
to his hand and at least $55,000 in property damage. 
</P>
<P>
	One child suffered a concussion and six children received  
bruises when accelerate pedals stuck and the vehicle hit trees, 
fences, walls or parked automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled vehicles run on two 6-volt batteries and were  
manufactured before December 1997. They are made of plastic and 
have been sold under the following names, which appear on the 
vehicle: Corral 270, Diablo, Dragon, Gaucho, Gaucho Grande, Gaucho 
High Torque, Gaucho Sport, Magica, Magnum, Ranger GT, Thunderbolt, 
Thundercat and Tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicles are intended for children 3 to 8 years old.  
Depending on the model, the vehicle speed ranges from 2.5 to 5 
miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Toy stores and retail catalogs sold the vehicles nationwide from  
1990 through 1997 for about $100 to $550. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are advised to remove the batteries from the vehicles  
immediately and keep children away until the vehicle has been 
repaired. Consumers should contact Peg Perego at 1-888-893-7903 
between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. EST Monday through Friday for a free 
repair kit. Consumers can also order a kit through the Web site at 
http://www.perego.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The repair kits can be installed by consumers or by an  
authorized Peg Perego service center.

<HEADLINE> Mets Outright Hideo Nomo to Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The New York Mets gave up on  
right-hander Hideo Nomo by outrighting the one-time sensation to 
Triple-A Norfolk on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo has 72 hours to decide whether to accept the assignment or  
declare himself a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult decision because it involves a player of his  
stature and given what he's done in his career,'' Mets general 
manager Steve Phillips said. ``But I've got to make a judgment in 
what I can do to have us win as many games as we can, and this 
starts the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, 30, starred in Japan before joining the Los Angeles  
Dodgers in 1995. He won 45 games in Los Angeles, but struggled last 
season and was traded to the Mets in June. He went 4-5 with a 4.82 
ERA in 17 games with New York and was ineffective this spring, 
going 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in four appearances.

	``He said he understood our decision and acted very  
professionally,'' Phillips said. ``Of course, he doesn't show a lot 
of emotion anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo made his much-publicized debut in May 1995 and immediately  
proved he could pitch well in any country. He won the NL rookie of 
the year award, led the league with 236 strikeouts and limited 
opposing batters to a .182 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996 Nomo pitched a no-hitter Sept. 17 against Colorado and  
went 16-11 with a 3.19 ERA. He finished second in the league by 
holding the opposition to a .216 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
	It was more of the same in 1997, when he recorded 233  
strikeouts. But he appeared to lose his touch last season, going 
2-7 with the Dodgers before being dealt to New York in a 
four-player deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips delivered the news to Nomo before the Mets arrived at  
the ballpark, so Nomo was not available for comment.

<HEADLINE> Panel Warns About Arsenic in Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- High levels of arsenic are being allowed in  
drinking water, despite findings that the government-sanctioned 
standards pose an unacceptable risk of cancer, an advisory panel to 
the federal government has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by a committee of the National Academy of Sciences was  
embraced by environmentalists and water quality experts as a 
clarion call for the Environmental Protection Agency to strengthen 
its regulations on allowable arsenic levels in tap water. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, made public Tuesday, concluded that the EPA's  
standard of a maximum 50 micrograms of arsenic per liter of water 
``does not sufficiently protect public health'' and should be 
lowered ``as promptly as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA, which has missed three deadlines on dealing with the  
arsenic regulations, agreed with the report's findings, and 
officials said a new arsenic standard for drinking water would be 
proposed by next January. A final standard, however, is not likely 
to be in place before late 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree with the conclusions of the report that we need to  
strengthen our drinking water standards to protect public health 
and the environment,'' said Charles Fox, assistant EPA 
administrator for water issues. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how many people drink water with high levels of  
arsenic. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said the number of water systems with arsenic levels  
approaching 50 micrograms per liter are relatively few, ``affecting 
less than half of a percent of the U.S. population,'' and usually 
those that rely on groundwater. Most major metropolitan water 
systems get water from lakes and streams where arsenic is less of a 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	But the American Water Works Association, which represents  
private experts on drinking water quality, estimated 2,200 of the 
56,000 U.S. water supply systems would be affected if the EPA 
lowered its standard from 50 micrograms per liter to 10 micrograms. 
It said the cost could be $1 billion for such a reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	The international standard for arsenic in tap water is 10  
micrograms per liter, five times tougher than the U.S. requirement, 
which dates back to 1942 and has not been changed despite a 1974 
directive from Congress to strengthen the standard. 
</P>
<P>
	The special committee of the Academy's National Research Council  
said EPA's current maximum allowable arsenic content poses a much 
greater cancer risk than the agency normally considers acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	Males who daily drank water at or near the maximum allowable  
arsenic levels had a 1 in 1,000 risk of developing bladder cancer, 
the study said. It cited a possibility, disputed by some panel 
members, of a combined cancer risk of as high as 1 in 100 over a 
lifetime, for those regularly exposed to the upper threshold of the 
EPA standard. 
</P>
<P>
	This far exceeds the EPA's general goal of limiting cancer risks  
to 1 in 10,000 over a lifetime, the scientific panel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inorganic arsenic, the form most likely to cause cancer, occurs  
naturally in the earth and is released into groundwater that 
travels through rocks and soil. The highest exposure to arsenic is 
in drinking water from wells as opposed to areas, including most 
urban areas, that get drinking water from lakes and streams, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said he couldn't give any estimate on what level the EPA was  
considering for the regulations expected to be proposed at the end 
of the year. But some environmentalists questioned whether the 
EPA's changes will be tough enough and suggested the agency may be 
minimizing the health impact. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Academy of Sciences is an independent organization  
chartered by Congress to advise the government.

<HEADLINE> Carlos Baerga Starts Over With Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- For a guy starting over at the bottom,  
Carlos Baerga was in a great mood. 
</P>
<P>
	The second baseman was smiling and unfailingly upbeat Wednesday  
morning when he showed up at the Cincinnati Reds training complex 
to try to resurrect his fading career. 
</P>
<P>
	He took batting practice, fielded grounders and even signed some  
autographs for a handful of fans who remembered his glory days in 
Cleveland -- three All-Star games, one World Series, seemingly 
unlimited potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after the Indians gave up on him and traded him to  
the New York Mets, the 30-year-old Baerga is barely hanging on. The 
St. Louis Cardinals waived him last Wednesday rather than keep him 
on the opening day roster at $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he accepted a nonguaranteed minor-league contract  
with the Reds, who consider him a low-risk reclamation project. For 
the first time since 1990, Baerga is out of the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit tough, when you're used to being in the big  
leagues,'' Baerga said. ``But you have to realize that sometimes 
you have to start again. Sometimes you have to do what you did 
before to get back on track. If I have to go that way, I'm going to 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has no choice. He will start the season at Triple-A  
Indianapolis knowing that nothing is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to be blocking the way of a prospect at  
Triple-A,'' general manager Jim Bowden said. ``If at some point we 
get him into shape, he might help the major league club. If not, he 
also may be a player we could trade down the road for a younger 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His shape is the big thing.  
</P>
<P>
	The Reds have assigned one of their trainers to help Baerga get  
in shape. Conditioning coordinator Lance Sewell set up a program to 
help Baerga lose weight and get stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga has thick thighs and an ample midsection, but doesn't  
understand the concerns about his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overweight stuff -- I've been like that all my career,''  
Baerga said. ``I'm a guy who always comes to spring training like 
that and I lose weight. So I don't worry about that. I know I'm 
going to be ready when I need to be ready -- my bat and my legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't anywhere near ready enough for the Cardinals, who  
watched him go 2-for-15 in six games and cut him loose. By dumping 
him last Wednesday, St. Louis owed him only 30 days' pay, or 
$163,394. 
</P>
<P>
	His production has declined since 1995, prompting the Indians  
and Mets to decide they could do better. When the Cardinals saw him 
in spring training, they decided he wasn't worth the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go to spring training and play (six) games and they just  
decide they're going to let me go. That was kind of surprising,'' 
Baerga said. ``I've never been in this situation before.''

<HEADLINE> Shaffer, Gros Win at Ski Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- As the U.S. National Alpine Championships  
ended on Wednesday, the country's top skiers could see how far they 
have come -- and how very far they still have to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Shaffer completed a sweep of the women's technical events  
with a national title in slalom and Sacha Gros won his second 
straight men's slalom and third national crown overall. The skiers 
raced on Deer Valley's Olympic slalom course. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two in a row is just unbelievably exciting,'' said Shaffer,  
who won the giant slalom title on Monday. ``I knew I had the 
ability to do it because I ski against these girls all year, but 
it's exciting to find out it's true on the course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaffer used a scorching final run to upset four-time national  
champion Kristina Koznick, who concluded a season of disappointment 
by failing to take home a U.S. title. Koznick finished in 1:50.39, 
just behind Shaffer's 1:50.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Koznick, who joined Picabo Street this season as the only  
members of the nation's A team, cried when she realized she had 
finished with a silver medal. Koznick had the race's fastest second 
run but was unable to make up a small deficit she conceded to 
Shaffer in the first run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody out here today expected me to win, and I expected it  
of myself as well,'' Koznick said. ``I'm disappointed, but I'm 
happy for Alex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's race, the United States' across-the-board  
weaknesses in technical events were exposed again. The race was won 
rather easily by Gros, who is battling a variety of minor aches and 
who admitted he ``didn't ski that great on either run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gros had a healthy lead after a fast first run and held off Drew  
Thorne-Thomsen in the second heat with a winning time of 1:43.49. 
Thorne-Thomsen posted the best finish of his career at 1:43.87. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a couple of guys fall right before my turn, so that made  
me really nervous,'' said Gros, who won the same event in Jackson 
Hole last year. ``This makes the season perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thorne-Thomsen, who has yet to ski on the World Cup circuit,  
raced on a new pair of short slalom skis. 
</P>
<P>
	``These skis are great,'' he said with a smile. ``I didn't know  
how fast I would be on them. I had some close calls, but it all 
paid off with my time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national overall champions also were named on Wednesday.  
Women's super-G winner Katie Monahan capped a solid all-around 
performance with a gold medal, and Dane Spencer of Boise, Idaho, 
took the men's title despite not winning an individual event. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest disappointment of the championships' final day --  
from the national team's perspective -- was yet another failure by 
Koznick in a big race. 
</P>
<P>
	After charging onto the international slalom scene in 1997-98,  
she has endured repeated disappointments since failing to finish in 
the Nagano Olympics. She also failed to finish in the 1997 Worlds 
at Sestriere, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she won her second World Cup race this season, she  
skied out of last month's world championship slalom in Vail, Colo., 
and now the national championship, an event she has owned since 
1995, was beyond her reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing, but you can't put your head down,'' she  
said. ``Next year will be here before you know it, and I'll have to 
work hard to do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaffer, who recently finished a breakout World Cup season  
similar to Koznick's 1997-98 campaign, made a strong case in her 
hometown to be the nation's next slalom star. She finished 15th in 
slalom at Vail last month and scored points in four other World Cup 
technical races. 
</P>
<P>
	``I start into next season tomorrow,'' she said. ``I have to  
build on the momentum I've got from here and use it on the World 
Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American men's team continues to search for solid direction  
in the technical events. For the second straight day, a foreign 
competitor skiing for Sierra Nevada College took a podium slot away 
from the United States' top skiers. 
</P>
<P>
	After Slovenia's Uros Pavlovcic won the GS on Tuesday, Italy's  
Marco Pastore finished third in the slalom. Gros dominated the 
lackluster field after his 19th-place slalom finish in the World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't comfortable today, but it was good enough to get the  
job done,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Grains, soybeans Retreat on Strike / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices retreated  
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade after U.S. warplanes struck 
targets in Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The first wave of attacks ordered by NATO boosted concerns there  
will be rift between the United States and Russia, which does not 
support the campaign to end Serbian military attacks on rebels in 
the Kosovo region. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a rift could end American donations to Russia during a  
period in which farmers are counting on the Clinton administration 
to boost their fortunes following weak global export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks erased wheat futures' early gains that came after  
the U.S. Agriculture Department began taking bids to buy 1.022 
million metric tons of hard red winter wheat for donation to needy 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 2 3/4 cents to $2.80 a bushel; May  
corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.28 a bushel; May oats rose 1 cent to $1.16 3/4 
a bushel; May soybeans fell 5 1/2 cents to $4.87 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle fell .78 cent to 66.62 cents a pound; April  
feeder cattle fell .48 cents to 71.52 cents a pound; April lean 
hogs fell .40 cent to 43.62 cents a pound; May pork bellies fell 
.63 cent to 55.37 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Ali Calls Holyfield-Lewis a 'Fix' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Muhammad Ali became the latest to question the  
controversial draw in the recent title fight between Evander 
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, calling the result ``the biggest fix in 
fight history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Senate Commerce Committee chairman John McCain,  
R-Ariz., Ali said he was humiliated that the sport ``had sunk to 
its lowest levels'' and added ``it was clear to all who watched 
that the deciding victor of the match was England's Lennox Lewis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draw in the heavyweight unification title fight between  
Holyfield and Lewis on March 13 in New York sparked investigations 
by a New York City grand jury, a New York state Senate committee, 
the New York State Athletic Commission and the Nevada Gaming 
Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a boxing fan, introduced a bill earlier this year which  
would restrict coercive option contracts by which promoters control 
a boxers' career, such as contracts forcing a boxer into a 
long-term deal in exchange for a shot at a world title. McCain 
named the bill for Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the former three-time heavyweight boxing champion of the  
world, I believe I have the credibility to say Lennox Lewis won 
this bout without question and should have been named the clear and 
decided victor,'' Ali wrote. ``What occurred once the 12-round 
event concluded will surely go down in the boxing annals as the 
biggest fix in fight history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Ali added his support to McCain's bill, which is  
aimed at protecting boxers from exploitation and requiring more 
openness from promoters about their financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	It would require promoters and organizers of major boxing events  
to disclose more financial information and to inform state boxing 
commissions of charges, costs and fees they take out of a boxer's 
purse. Identical legislation passed the Senate last October by 
voice vote, but the House did not take up the measure before the 
session ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation has taken on added importance, Ali said, in  
light of the disputed draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Professional boxers have for too long been the target of  
unscrupulous managers and promoters,'' Ali wrote. ``As witnessed 
(March 13), the three sanctioning organizations that award the 
title belts have joined the list of abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pray justice will be done and somehow along the way, honor  
can be restored to this sport,'' Ali added.

<HEADLINE> More Consumers Fall Behind on Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The delinquency rate on consumer loans and  
credit cards rose during the final three months of last year, as 
Americans' confidence in the economy and appetite for borrowing 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted percentage of credit-card accounts 30 or  
more days past due rose to a 15-month high of 3.45 percent in the 
October-December quarter, from 3.28 percent the previous quarter, 
the American Bankers Association said today. 
</P>
<P>
	A composite rate for other types of consumer loans, including  
auto loans and closed-end home equity loans, rose to 2.35 percent 
in the fourth quarter, from 2.29 percent in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	The association's economist, James Chessen, said delinquencies  
tend to rise when debt levels rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers took on slightly more debt at the end of last year,  
due in part to a good job market, confidence in the economy and a 
rise in the stock market,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry, which earned a record $61.9 billion profit  
last year, is well positioned to handle the modest increase in 
delinquencies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both delinquency rates remained below their peaks for the decade  
-- 3.72 percent for credit cards during the last three months of 
1996 and 2.74 percent for other consumer loans during 
July-September 1991.

<HEADLINE> Two Securities Firms Merge in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Two second-tier Japanese brokerages plan to merge  
next year in a deal that will create the country's fourth-largest 
brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of New Japan Securities Co. and Wako Securities  
Co. pools a combined $79.85 billion in assets, putting the merged 
company into the league of industry leaders Nomura Securities Co., 
Daiwa Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The two firms plan to reduce their work force to around 5,000  
from the current combined 7,197 employees, but did not specify a 
timetable. They will also slash the number of branch offices in 
Japan to no more than 100 from the current 127. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal strengthens the hand of the Industrial Bank of Japan  
Ltd. at a time when Japanese financial companies are scrambling to 
strike up alliances as the industry deregulates. 
</P>
<P>
	IBJ will control 25 percent of the newly created company  
directly and through affiliates, up from its current 4.9 percent 
stake in New Japan and 4.7 percent share of Wako. 
</P>
<P>
	New Japan and Wako said their successor company will take over  
the IBJ group's retail securities business throughout Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The heads of the two bokers said at a news conference that they  
plan to have the as-yet-unnamed merged entity turn a profit in its 
first year of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies had posted pretax losses for the last business  
year, which ended March 31, 1998. But they denied being forced into 
a merger by the IBJ, saying it was a product of their own 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to carry out the merger while we were in a position  
of strength,'' said Wako President Masaaki Sugishita, who will 
become chairman of the new firm. 
</P>
<P>
	New Japan President Tadashi Kawaguchi will take the post of  
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, New Japan Securities will pull out of overseas markets by  
closing subsidiaries in London, Hong Kong, New York and 
Switzerland. It will also shut representative offices in Frankfurt, 
Beijing, Shanghai and Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts welcomed the move, but said the new company will face a  
tough environment in which to grow as commissions drop from intense 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If New Japan and Wako can carry out further restructuring  
measures, that will boost their profitability to some extent,'' 
said Hideyasu Ban, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, adding the key is 
whether they can boost revenue in their combined retail operations.

<HEADLINE>  Blue Jays' New Skipper Settling In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Jim Fregosi straddles the front seat of a  
grounds crew cart and starts talking baseball. It could take all 
day, because this is by far his favorite subject. 
</P>
<P>
	One week after returning to the dugout as manager of the Toronto  
Blue Jays, Fregosi is the epitome of a man back in his element. 
</P>
<P>
	``Has it been a week already?'' Fregosi jokes. ``It seems like a  
month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stepping into an awkward situation is nothing new for Fregosi.  
Being hired to replace Tim Johnson this spring may top the list, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays took the unusual, but not unprecedented step of  
firing Johnson in the middle of spring training in the wake of 
controversy over his lying about service in Vietnam. Fregosi, who 
took over as manager of the White Sox, Angels and Phillies in 
midseason, came on board with about three weeks left before opening 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Add the rare circumstance of managing the team that beat him in  
the 1993 World Series, and Fregosi found himself in the middle of 
baseball history -- or trivia, take your pick -- again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the only guy traded for Nolan Ryan, too,'' Fregosi said.  
``So there's a first. I guess I've been involved in a lot of 
firsts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, who turns 57 two days before Toronto's season opener,  
can't hide the fact that he has to be among the happiest people in 
baseball. He saunters around the fringes of the field for an hour 
or so before the game, signing autographs, greeting friends and 
hugging opposing coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	He managed his first game back against his former team a week  
ago, hugging the man who got his job, current Phillies manager 
Terry Francona. On Wednesday, the two shook hands as they exchanged 
lineups before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays beat the Phillies 4-3 in 10 innings Wednesday,  
giving Fregosi two straight victories over his former team. He's 
3-4 since Johnson was fired. Thoughts of his six years in 
Philadelphia are never far away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a one-year club,'' Fregosi said of the '93  
Phillies, whose heartbreaking World Series loss to the Blue Jays on 
Joe Carter's homer off Mitch Williams still haunts Philadelphia 
fans. ``You win with offense, and offense comes and goes from year 
to year. I think Atlanta's proved over this decade that if you have 
pitching, pitching always keeps you in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi calls the Blue Jays' starters -- Pat Hentgen, David  
Wells, Joey Hamilton, Kelvim Escobar and Chris Carpenter -- 
``probably by far the best starting rotation I've ever managed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Fregosi needs is a closer. Robert Person was regarded as  
the front-runner, but hasn't been healthy. It might turn into the 
dreaded ``bullpen by committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No closer? No problem. In Philadelphia, Fregosi had a knack for  
grooming them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had Mitch Williams, who never threw a strike, and went to  
Doug Jones, who never threw a ball,'' Fregosi said. ``Then I had 
Heathcliff Slocumb, who never closed before, and Ricky Bottalico, 
who never closed before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fired by the Phillies after the 1996 season, Fregosi was with  
the San Francisco Giants as a special assistant to the general 
manager when Blue Jays GM Gord Ash sought permission to talk to 
him. He also had interviewed for the spot before Ash picked 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's in your blood, you're always happier doing something  
you've always done,'' said Fregosi, who signed a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	From his rough, sunbaked skin to the slicked-back,  
salt-and-pepper hair to his managerial style, the essence of 
Fregosi is ``old school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how he is. That's his style,'' Cecil Fielder said. ``As  
a player, you really have to appreciate that. All he's saying is 
give him 100 percent. If that's all my manager is asking me to do, 
I think I can handle that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, who has a 861-938 record in 13 seasons, said he never  
would have been able to stay in managing without a break between 
jobs. He had three years off after managing the White Sox and two 
full seasons away from it after getting fired by the Phillies.	   ``I don't know how these guys do it, manage for 15 straight 
years,'' Fregosi said. ``I think you kind of lose perspective on 
how things are. You need to kind of rejuvenate. I've managed a long 
time, but I've always had a break in between. You do come back with 
a new enthusiasm, so to speak.''

<HEADLINE>  Blue Jays' New Skipper Settling In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Jim Fregosi straddles the front seat of a  
grounds crew cart and starts talking baseball. It could take all 
day, because this is by far his favorite subject. 
</P>
<P>
	One week after returning to the dugout as manager of the Toronto  
Blue Jays, Fregosi is the epitome of a man back in his element. 
</P>
<P>
	``Has it been a week already?'' Fregosi jokes. ``It seems like a  
month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stepping into an awkward situation is nothing new for Fregosi.  
Being hired to replace Tim Johnson this spring may top the list, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays took the unusual, but not unprecedented step of  
firing Johnson in the middle of spring training in the wake of 
controversy over his lying about service in Vietnam. Fregosi, who 
took over as manager of the White Sox, Angels and Phillies in 
midseason, came on board with about three weeks left before opening 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Add the rare circumstance of managing the team that beat him in  
the 1993 World Series, and Fregosi found himself in the middle of 
baseball history -- or trivia, take your pick -- again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the only guy traded for Nolan Ryan, too,'' Fregosi said.  
``So there's a first. I guess I've been involved in a lot of 
firsts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, who turns 57 two days before Toronto's season opener,  
can't hide the fact that he has to be among the happiest people in 
baseball. He saunters around the fringes of the field for an hour 
or so before the game, signing autographs, greeting friends and 
hugging opposing coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	He managed his first game back against his former team a week  
ago, hugging the man who got his job, current Phillies manager 
Terry Francona. On Wednesday, the two shook hands as they exchanged 
lineups before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays beat the Phillies 4-3 in 10 innings Wednesday,  
giving Fregosi two straight victories over his former team. He's 
3-4 since Johnson was fired. Thoughts of his six years in 
Philadelphia are never far away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a one-year club,'' Fregosi said of the '93  
Phillies, whose heartbreaking World Series loss to the Blue Jays on 
Joe Carter's homer off Mitch Williams still haunts Philadelphia 
fans. ``You win with offense, and offense comes and goes from year 
to year. I think Atlanta's proved over this decade that if you have 
pitching, pitching always keeps you in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi calls the Blue Jays' starters -- Pat Hentgen, David  
Wells, Joey Hamilton, Kelvim Escobar and Chris Carpenter -- 
``probably by far the best starting rotation I've ever managed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Fregosi needs is a closer. Robert Person was regarded as  
the front-runner, but hasn't been healthy. It might turn into the 
dreaded ``bullpen by committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No closer? No problem. In Philadelphia, Fregosi had a knack for  
grooming them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had Mitch Williams, who never threw a strike, and went to  
Doug Jones, who never threw a ball,'' Fregosi said. ``Then I had 
Heathcliff Slocumb, who never closed before, and Ricky Bottalico, 
who never closed before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fired by the Phillies after the 1996 season, Fregosi was with  
the San Francisco Giants as a special assistant to the general 
manager when Blue Jays GM Gord Ash sought permission to talk to 
him. He also had interviewed for the spot before Ash picked 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's in your blood, you're always happier doing something  
you've always done,'' said Fregosi, who signed a two-year contract.

salt-and-pepper hair to his managerial style, the essence of

</P>

full seasons away from it after getting fired by the Phillies.	   ``I don't know how these guys do it, manage for 15 straight

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Plunge / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell sharply today for a second day  
in a row as investors took profits following a tumble on Wall 
Street. The dollar slipped further against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 503.63, or  
3.14 percent, to end the day at 15,515.47. On Tuesday, the average 
closed down 359.68 points, or 2.20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 117.72 yen at late afternoon, down 0.81 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 118.00 yen overnight. The dollar ranged from 117.25 yen to 
118.52 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the market's fall was exacerbated  
by dealers rushing to reduce their positions ahead of Thursday, the 
last day of trading for delivery of shares in this fiscal year, 
which ends March 31, said Hideyuki Okoshi, deputy manager at Chuo 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic investors and dealers took profits on the market's  
recent rally following the overnight plunge in New York, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
dropped 218.68 points to 9,671.83 at Tuesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 30.12 points, or 2.38 percent, to 1,233.59. 
The TOPIX closed down 6.05 points, or 0.48 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 685.37 million shares, down from 827.34 million shares 
Tuesday. Retreaters overwhelmed advancers 863 to 318, while 147 
issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped back against the yen  
after briefly strengthening in reaction to rising tensions in 
Yugoslavia, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially weakened in New York on Tuesday as U.S.  
stocks tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana ordered airstrikes against  
Yugoslavia, saying Tuesday that efforts to win a negotiated 
settlement over the crisis in the rebellious province of Kosovo had 
failed. He did not hint when military operations would begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Other traders said no comment by Japan's head of the Finance  
Ministry's international bureau Haruhiko Kuroda, in contrast to 
Tuesday's dollar supportive comments by officials, triggered the 
dollar selling. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.16 yen, down  
from 128.96 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.755 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.695 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.35 yen from 100.83 yen.

<HEADLINE> Karan Profits Top Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Donna Karan International Inc. reported  
better-than-expected fourth-quarter and year-end earnings 
Wednesday, signaling that the struggling fashion house's business 
may be returning to health. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based clothing maker lost $3.2 million, or 15 cents  
a share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 3, compared with a loss 
of $68.4 million, or $3.17 a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts' surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected  
a loss of 29 cents a share in the quarter. Donna Karan stock closed 
up 25 cents at $7.25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really are starting to show improvements,'' said Harvey  
Robinson, an analyst at Chapman Company in Baltimore. ``The results 
have taken a little longer than we thought, but they are 
happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While profits were better than expected, sales stumbled in the  
quarter, falling to $146 million, from $154 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the decline was a result of the company licensing  
out more of its operations. Donna Karan has a deal with Estee 
Lauder to make its beauty products and with Liz Claiborne for 
jeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded a decade ago, the Donna Karan brand quickly became the  
darling of the fashion world. Women liked the sophisticated yet 
comfortable styles that could be used for work or evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the company's initial sales of stock to the public in  
June 1996, much of the fanfare dissolved while costs kept rising as 
Ms. Karan expanded from women's apparel into men's, accessories and 
beauty aids. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was also stung by the economic crisis in Asia and a  
downturn in sales at its outlet stores. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Ms. Karan relinquished her post as CEO to John Idol, a  
former executive at Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. His immediate goal was 
to begin restructuring the troubled business. 
</P>
<P>
	The company soon announced an aggressive plan to cut costs,  
overhaul its core wholesale division and shake up its clothing 
lineup. It planned to open a number of company-owned retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm encouraged by the cost savings that managed to get in the  
last year,'' Robinson said. ``Now, they need to focus on growing 
their revenues again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Donna Karan earned $128 million, or 1 cent a  
share, compared with a loss of $81.4 million, or $3.78 a share, a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the year were $622.7 million, down from $638.7 million  
a year ago.

<HEADLINE>  Michelle Kwan Wins Early Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Michelle Kwan began a journey to her  
third title today with a superb performance in her qualifying round 
for the World Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing six triple jumps with ease and grace despite a cold  
for which she has been taking medication, Kwan easily won the 
qualifying group with marks from 5.6 to 5.9. She only did a 
triple-double combination and cut down another triple to a double 
lutz, but was otherwise solid in technique and exquisite in grace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt a little tired in my program but thought `one thing at  
a time','' Kwan said. 
</P>
<P>
	She received one 5.5 for technical merit from the Slovakian  
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Butyrskaya of Russia won a controversial split decision in  
the other group despite three mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan did not make any errors but only did a triple-double  
combination and cut down another triple to a double lutz. 
Otherwise, she was solid in technique and exquisite in grace. 
</P>
<P>
	``My jumps seemed solid but I could have done better,'' Kwan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting her performance were two spiral sequences that  
emphasized the choreographic difference between her and the other 
competitiors. Her marks were far ahead of the next best of the 
group, Vanessa Gusmeroli of France. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, the pairs title will be decided with Yelena Berezhnaya  
and Anton Sikharulidze, who won the short program on Monday, 
seeking their second straight world title. 
</P>
<P>
	How Kwan would perform after having to take antibiotics was in  
doubt until she took off on her first jump, a triple lutz-double 
toe loop combination that was secure. Then she went into a long 
back spiral with her leg almost vertical to the ice and her skate 
well above her head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling a little weak. I'm taking my medication and  
hopefully my body will get used to it and I will be fine later 
on,'' Kwan said. 
</P>
<P>
	She now has a day of rest before coming back for Friday's short  
program and repeating the long routine to ``Ariane''' on Saturday 
to defend her world title. 
</P>
<P>
	Her coach, Frank Carroll, said they hadn't decided whether she  
would practice on her day off. Kwan said she is overcoming the 
cold, but feels only about ``80 percent in energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The qualification round counts for 20 percent of the final  
score. A misstep or a missed jump could have been costly for Kwan. 
But she now will be equal in points with Butyrskaya, who captured 
the second qualification group over Tatiana Malinina of Uzbekistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya started strong with two good triple jumps. Then she  
faltered on the next three, including an awkward split coming down 
from a triple salchow. She ended with another triple, three in all. 
</P>
<P>
	Malinina had four triples and did not make a major mistake,  
although cutting down two jumps. Julia Soldatova, a rising Russian 
who placed third in the qualifier, had six triple jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	The first place votes from the judges were split among those  
three but Butyrskaya had the majority of firsts and got the overall 
top position. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new ISU scoring system, Kwan and Butyrskaya now enter  
the short program each with .4 factored placings. 
</P>
<P>
	The key consideration was that Kwan would not be trailing anyone  
entering the short program, which could cost a skater a chance to 
win -- as happened in the men's event Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elvis Stojko, the three-time world champion, finished third in  
the qualifying, followed by a third in Tuesday's short program. 
Previously, a third place in the short would still keep him in 
solid contention for his fourth world title. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he needs help -- a lot of it -- if he is to vault past the  
Russians ahead of him in Thursday's free skate. Both Russians won 
their group qualifications on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship is there for either Yevgeny Plushenko or Alexei  
Yagudin to lose. If either wins the long program -- or comes in 
second in the long to Stojko -- the title is his. 
</P>
<P>
	A few mistakes by both would be needed for Stojko to win.  
</P>
<P>
	Hoping for a mistake from the 16-year-old Plushenko would be  
risky. He was impressive with his jumps in the short, skating to 
``Hava Nagila.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin landed a bit off on his opening triple axel-triple toe  
loop combination, but stayed in form for the rest of the 
circus-themed routine, full of vivid and amusing gestures. 
</P>
<P>
	American champion Michael Weiss was fourth after a program that  
was less technically ambitious than the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians also took the lead in the ice dance event with Angelika  
Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov putting in a smooth performance to the 
Paso Double and Tango Romantica.

<HEADLINE> Designers Go for Glamour at Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Last year, it was Minnie Driver's garnet dress by Randolph Duke  
for Halston. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the most memorable dress at the Oscars was Gwyneth  
Paltrow's pink evening gown by Ralph Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow, winner of the Oscar for best actress, was a beautiful  
princess in pink. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gwyneth's dress definitely was a show-stopper from every  
level,'' said Tom Julian, trend analyst for Oscar.com and Fallon 
McElligott Advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Julian described Paltrow, star of ``Shakespeare in Love,'' as a  
regal beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	Another eye-catcher: best actress nominee Cate Blanchett of  
``Elizabeth'' in John Galliano's knitted purple gown with 
embroidered flowers on the front. 
</P>
<P>
	The gown plunged to the small of Blanchett's back. An  
embroidered hummingbird was in the center of the netting on the 
back of the dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar fashion was elegant, glamorous and even a little cutting  
edge. (Celine Dion's backward white suit by John Galliano for 
Christian Dior was perhaps too fashion-forward.) But it wasn't 
cookie-cutter fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, it's about individuality,'' said Randolph Duke, who  
launched his own company last November. ``Women want to look 
beautiful. It's not about putting on a dress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Driver wore Randolph Duke this year, as did Kim Basinger, Geena  
Davis, Lisa Kudrow, Rita Wilson and Laura Linney. 
</P>
<P>
	In a year when stylists got as much media attention as the  
nominees, ``there are too many people out there'' telling actresses 
how they should look, said Duke, who set up a temporary studio in a 
Los Angeles hotel. As a designer, ``You can control it more if you 
work intimately with an actress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cautioned, ``I don't think the red carpet should be a runway  
literally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amsale Aberra, whose celebrity breakthrough occurred when she  
designed Basinger's 1950s-inspired dress at last year's Golden 
Globes, created an ice-blue satin sleeveless gown for Oscar nominee 
Lynn Redgrave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really convinced it was 'the dress' as soon as I saw  
myself from the side,'' Redgrave said. ``With the bustle trailing 
behind me and a shawl draped over my shoulder, I knew that this 
would be my Oscar dress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was a breath of spring, dressed for ABC's Oscar preshow in  
a pink Bradley Bayou corset dress with a bustle back and train. 
(She wore her Randolph Duke design as a presenter.) 
</P>
<P>
	Also dressed in the colors of spring: Rachel Griffiths, who wore  
an iridescent pink silk taffeta halter gown by Richard Tyler; 
Goldie Hawn, in a blue beaded halter dress by Versace; and Meryl 
Streep, in a pale lavender gown with crystal embroidered draping by 
Valentino. 
</P>
<P>
	Why are the Oscars so important to the fashion business?  
</P>
<P>
	``Because it is now the visual medium for the global marketplace  
that projects into the future on every level,'' Julian said. ``Not 
just dresses, but hair, makeup, accessories. This becomes their ad 
campaign for the next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black didn't dominate Oscar fashion, but it did make a  
fashionable appearance, most notably on Sophia Loren, whose 
long-sleeve black gown with sheer square neckline was designed by 
Giorgio Armani. 
</P>
<P>
	Annette Bening wore a black silk crepe gown with a crisscrossed  
platinum beaded bodice by Escada. Also dressed in black: Jennifer 
Lopez, in a Badgley Mischka ball gown strewn with jewels, and Oscar 
nominee Fernanda Montenegro, who wore a pleated chiffon gown by 
Valentino. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody can be glitzy and glamorous and can look the part  
of screen stars, it's screen stars,'' said Bonnie Fuller, 
editor-in-chief of Glamour magazine. ``It wasn't just about youth. 
The more mature actresses looked just as stunning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dame Judi Dench chose a shimmering outfit by Bombay duo Abu Jani  
and Sandeep Khosla. Her pin-tucked cream silk dress was topped by a 
flowing silk coat in the same color, embroidered with white, gold 
and silver thread. 
</P>
<P>
	Escada designer Brian Rennie created a smoke velvet flocked  
chiffon gown with accent beading for Brenda Blethyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Also seen at the Oscars:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Emily Watson, in a dove-gray satin gown with embroidery by  
Valentino. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Helen Hunt, in a long gown by Gucci. The gown featured a full  
cutout back. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Anne Heche, in a shimmering silver knit dress by Cerruti.  
</P>
<P>
	Renee Zellweger's gown, with a fitted bodice, fringed hemline  
and iridescent hues, was created by stylist-turned-designer L'Wren 
Scott, who is based in Los Angeles. Scott also designed Mariah 
Carey's white halter dress.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Wants Better 'Black Boxes' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board  
held a two-day hearing before it set the cause of the 1994 crash of 
USAir Flight 427, but the members were clear on one point from the 
outset. 
</P>
<P>
	Again and again Tuesday they said the accident should have  
spurred the Federal Aviation Administration to order an immediate 
upgrade in the flight-data recorders used on such airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the board closed out its hearing by voting unanimously  
that the plane crashed because of a jam in a critical valve 
controlling its rudder. That jam caused the rudder to unexpectedly 
reverse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing 737, which spiraled into a ravine outside Pittsburgh,  
killing all 132 people aboard, had a primitive recorder that 
documented only 11 pieces of flight information. 
</P>
<P>
	Stymied by a lack of information about the position of the  
plane's flight control surfaces, including its rudder panel, the 
safety board in 1995 recommended an immediate upgrade in 737 
recorders. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said the recorders should keep track of more  
information, including the position of the flight control panels 
and the pilot commands to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the FAA gave airlines until 2001 to install recorders  
documenting at least 18 parameters -- including those requested by 
the board -- in all U.S. commercial airliners, not just 737s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave airlines four years to accomplish this complex task,''  
FAA Administrator Jane Garvey said in a statement issued in advance 
of Tuesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members and their staff criticized that decision, saying  
it may have deprived them of the chance to figure out an incident 
last month in which a MetroJet 737 started to roll over -- like the 
USAir plane. The recorder on the MetroJet plane had yet to be 
upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are any failure modes that we still do not  
understand, then the best way to be sure we are on top of that 
situation is to have these recorders in place, so that through 
incidents, and incident investigation, we can prevent any future 
accidents,'' board Chairman Jim Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The staff noted that Southwest Airlines, a discount carrier with  
737s comprising its entire 230-plane fleet, has voluntarily 
accelerated the upgrade to near completion despite a cost of 
$70,000 per airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a small, small investment,'' Hall said. ``It is just  
impossible to understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remark generated applause from the 100 relatives of the  
Flight 427 victims attending the board meeting, the only such 
outburst from them all day.

<HEADLINE> Calhoun Rides Emotion To Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Always animated, sometimes agitated, Jim  
Calhoun coaches with passion. 
</P>
<P>
	He jukes and jumps, bellows and glares. It's easy to read his  
emotions in the 40-minute span, but he has guarded them off the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Fate and the Final Four changed that in the past few weeks for  
Connecticut's winningest coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the postseason began, Calhoun has experienced the joys of  
a first grandchild and the death of a friend. Both were on his mind 
when the Huskies advanced to their first Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	It was more than enough to make a 56-year-old coach cry, and he  
didn't care who saw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found myself more nostalgic,'' Calhoun said Tuesday. ``I  
found that tears and outward emotions don't seem to be the one 
thing that I have a problem hiding anymore or see fit to hide over 
the past couple weeks. It gives me a different perspective on a 
couple different things, particularly my own journey through this 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His trek through college basketball, as coach of Northeastern  
for 14 years and at UConn since 1986, has been a steady climb to 
the top. He has a career record of 552-257 and is the only coach in 
Division I history to have at least 250 wins at two different 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	He remains the winningest coach at Northeastern with a 250-137  
record. On Jan. 23, he earned his 287th win at UConn, making him 
the winningest coach in school history. Saturday's win over Gonzaga 
in the West Regional title game sends Calhoun to his first Final 
Four where the Huskies (32-2) take on Ohio State (27-8). 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past few three or four days, I'm getting a much  
better feeling for what that bright light of the Final Four can 
do,'' he said. ``People get a chance to look closer at your 
program, at your career, at what our kids have achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of his ``kids'' was 26-year-old Joe McGinn. A popular team  
manager from 1992-95, he had kidney disease most of his life and 
died March 9 as the team was preparing for its first-round game in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond between the two was like father and son. When doctors  
last year decided McGinn's legs should be amputated, Calhoun broke 
the news to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the most emotional thing I've ever done,'' he said.  
``Much more emotional than a Final Four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emily Calhoun, born to Jim Jr. and wife Jennifer, arrived during  
the Big East tournament and sweetened the postseason immeasurably 
for her grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	He has carried her picture in his pocket throughout the NCAA  
tournament. It doesn't take much to get Calhoun talking about 
little Emily. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's the prettiest 3 1/2-week-old child I've ever seen,'' he  
said. ``And that's said without one bit of bias. It puts your life 
into different perspective and has allowed my wife and myself to do 
this. It's a wonderful feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All those feelings converged moments after the Gonzaga game as  
he struggled through tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an amazing thing,'' he said. ``I've lost a son and  
gained a granddaughter. It's an emotional time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices held steady Wednesday as investors  
fretted about the U.S.-led NATO bombing attack on Serb military 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/8 point,  
or $1.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, eased to 5.53 percent from 5.54 percent late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors usually seek bonds as a haven during U.S. military  
action because of concern that the fighting could drive down stock 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds also were helped by a government report of a  
bigger-than-expected 5 percent drop in February orders for durable 
goods -- the biggest drop in more than seven years. The report 
bolstered expectations that inflation won't pick up much in 1999, 
which could lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also were quiet Wednesday as traders waited to see how  
well the market would absorb AT&AMP;T's jumbo bond offering and a some 
new Treasury debt. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term and intermediate  
Treasury securities were unchanged from Tuesday, reported Bridge 
Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 1 
point to 1,286.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 4.48  
percent, while the discount was also unchanged at 4.37 percent. 
Six-month yields were unchanged at 4.52 percent, as the discount 
was unchanged at 4.36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One-year yields were unchanged at 4.69 percent from late  
Tuesday, while the discount was unchanged at 4.47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.94 percent from 4.75 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/32 to 125 1/32. The average yield to 
maturity was unchanged at 5.18 percent.

</P>
<P>
	On March 25, 1911, in a tragedy that galvanized America's labor  
movement, 146 immigrant workers were killed when fire broke out at 
the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. in New York.

lives. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, the Treaty of Rome established the European Economic  
Community. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, the Rev. Martin Luther King Junior led 25,000 marchers  
to the state capitol in Montgomery, Ala., to protest the denial of 
voting rights to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, 87 people, most of them Honduran and Dominican  
immigrants, were killed when fire raced through an illegal social 
club in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Soviet cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, who had spent 10  
months aboard the orbiting Mir space station and missed the 
upheaval in his homeland, finally returned to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: In the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in  
Prince William Sound, Alaska's chief environmental officer, Dennis 
Kelso, criticized cleanup efforts as too slow. 
</P>

	Five years ago: American troops completed their withdrawal from  
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: Shaken by horror stories from the worst genocide  
since World War II, President Clinton grimly acknowledged during 
his Africa tour that ``we did not act quickly enough'' to stop the 
slaughter of up to 1 million Rwandans four years earlier. The FCC

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rapper ODB declared his innocence after a  
brief hearing on a charge he violated California's new law banning 
violent felons from wearing body armor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wu-Tang Clan rapper, whose real name is Russell Jones,  
appeared with his attorney Wednesday before Municipal Judge Richard

	Jones was arrested Feb. 16 for wearing a bulletproof vest. The  
30-year-old entertainer had been scheduled to be in a Los Angeles 
court on Tuesday, but he was arrested in New York a day earlier on 
misdemeanor drug charges. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Shaffer, Gros Win at Ski Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- As the U.S. National Alpine Championships  
ended on Wednesday, the country's top skiers could see how far they 
have come -- and how very far they still have to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Shaffer completed a sweep of the women's technical events  
with a national title in slalom and Sacha Gros won his second 
straight men's slalom and third national crown overall. The skiers 
raced on Deer Valley's Olympic slalom course. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two in a row is just unbelievably exciting,'' said Shaffer,  
who won the giant slalom title on Monday. ``I knew I had the 
ability to do it because I ski against these girls all year, but 
it's exciting to find out it's true on the course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaffer used a scorching final run to upset four-time national  
champion Kristina Koznick, who concluded a season of disappointment 
by failing to take home a U.S. title. Koznick finished in 1:50.39, 
just behind Shaffer's 1:50.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Koznick, who joined Picabo Street this season as the only  
members of the nation's A team, cried when she realized she had 
finished with a silver medal. Koznick had the race's fastest second 
run but was unable to make up a small deficit she conceded to 
Shaffer in the first run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody out here today expected me to win, and I expected it  
of myself as well,'' Koznick said. ``I'm disappointed, but I'm 
happy for Alex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's race, the United States' across-the-board  
weaknesses in technical events were exposed again. The race was won 
rather easily by Gros, who is battling a variety of minor aches and 
who admitted he ``didn't ski that great on either run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gros had a healthy lead after a fast first run and held off Drew  
Thorne-Thomsen in the second heat with a winning time of 1:43.49. 
Thorne-Thomsen posted the best finish of his career at 1:43.87. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a couple of guys fall right before my turn, so that made  
me really nervous,'' said Gros, who won the same event in Jackson 
Hole last year. ``This makes the season perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thorne-Thomsen, who has yet to ski on the World Cup circuit,  
raced on a new pair of short slalom skis. 
</P>
<P>
	``These skis are great,'' he said with a smile. ``I didn't know  
how fast I would be on them. I had some close calls, but it all 
paid off with my time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national overall champions also were named on Wednesday.  
Women's super-G winner Katie Monahan capped a solid all-around 
performance with a gold medal, and Dane Spencer of Boise, Idaho, 
took the men's title despite not winning an individual event. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest disappointment of the championships' final day --  
from the national team's perspective -- was yet another failure by 
Koznick in a big race. 
</P>
<P>
	After charging onto the international slalom scene in 1997-98,  
she has endured repeated disappointments since failing to finish in 
the Nagano Olympics. She also failed to finish in the 1997 Worlds 
at Sestriere, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she won her second World Cup race this season, she  
skied out of last month's world championship slalom in Vail, Colo., 
and now the national championship, an event she has owned since 
1995, was beyond her reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing, but you can't put your head down,'' she  
said. ``Next year will be here before you know it, and I'll have to 
work hard to do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaffer, who recently finished a breakout World Cup season  
similar to Koznick's 1997-98 campaign, made a strong case in her 
hometown to be the nation's next slalom star. She finished 15th in 
slalom at Vail last month and scored points in four other World Cup 
technical races. 
</P>
<P>
	``I start into next season tomorrow,'' she said. ``I have to  
build on the momentum I've got from here and use it on the World 
Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American men's team continues to search for solid direction  
in the technical events. For the second straight day, a foreign 
competitor skiing for Sierra Nevada College took a podium slot away 
from the United States' top skiers. 
</P>
<P>
	After Slovenia's Uros Pavlovcic won the GS on Tuesday, Italy's  
Marco Pastore finished third in the slalom. Gros dominated the 
lackluster field after his 19th-place slalom finish in the World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't comfortable today, but it was good enough to get the  
job done,'' he said.

ended on Wednesday, the country's top skiers could see how far they 
have come -- and how very far they still have to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Shaffer completed a sweep of the women's technical events  
with a national title in slalom and Sacha Gros won his second 
straight men's slalom and third national crown overall. The skiers 
raced on Deer Valley's Olympic slalom course. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two in a row is just unbelievably exciting,'' said Shaffer,  
who won the giant slalom title on Monday. ``I knew I had the 
ability to do it because I ski against these girls all year, but 
it's exciting to find out it's true on the course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaffer used a scorching final run to upset four-time national  
champion Kristina Koznick, who concluded a season of disappointment 
by failing to take home a U.S. title. Koznick finished in 1:50.39, 
just behind Shaffer's 1:50.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Koznick, who joined Picabo Street this season as the only  
members of the nation's A team, cried when she realized she had 
finished with a silver medal. Koznick had the race's fastest second 
run but was unable to make up a small deficit she conceded to 
Shaffer in the first run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody out here today expected me to win, and I expected it  
of myself as well,'' Koznick said. ``I'm disappointed, but I'm 
happy for Alex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's race, the United States' across-the-board  
weaknesses in technical events were exposed again. The race was won 
rather easily by Gros, who is battling a variety of minor aches and 
who admitted he ``didn't ski that great on either run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gros had a healthy lead after a fast first run and held off Drew  
Thorne-Thomsen in the second heat with a winning time of 1:43.49. 
Thorne-Thomsen posted the best finish of his career at 1:43.87. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a couple of guys fall right before my turn, so that made  
me really nervous,'' said Gros, who won the same event in Jackson 
Hole last year. ``This makes the season perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thorne-Thomsen, who has yet to ski on the World Cup circuit,  
raced on a new pair of short slalom skis. 
</P>
<P>
	``These skis are great,'' he said with a smile. ``I didn't know  
how fast I would be on them. I had some close calls, but it all 
paid off with my time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national overall champions also were named on Wednesday.  
Women's super-G winner Katie Monahan capped a solid all-around 
performance with a gold medal, and Dane Spencer of Boise, Idaho, 
took the men's title despite not winning an individual event. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest disappointment of the championships' final day --  
from the national team's perspective -- was yet another failure by 
Koznick in a big race. 
</P>
<P>
	After charging onto the international slalom scene in 1997-98,  
she has endured repeated disappointments since failing to finish in 
the Nagano Olympics. She also failed to finish in the 1997 Worlds 
at Sestriere, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she won her second World Cup race this season, she  
skied out of last month's world championship slalom in Vail, Colo., 
and now the national championship, an event she has owned since 
1995, was beyond her reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing, but you can't put your head down,'' she  
said. ``Next year will be here before you know it, and I'll have to 
work hard to do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaffer, who recently finished a breakout World Cup season  
similar to Koznick's 1997-98 campaign, made a strong case in her 
hometown to be the nation's next slalom star. She finished 15th in 
slalom at Vail last month and scored points in four other World Cup 
technical races. 
</P>
<P>
	``I start into next season tomorrow,'' she said. ``I have to  
build on the momentum I've got from here and use it on the World 
Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American men's team continues to search for solid direction  
in the technical events. For the second straight day, a foreign 
competitor skiing for Sierra Nevada College took a podium slot away 
from the United States' top skiers. 
</P>
<P>
	After Slovenia's Uros Pavlovcic won the GS on Tuesday, Italy's  
Marco Pastore finished third in the slalom. Gros dominated the 
lackluster field after his 19th-place slalom finish in the World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't comfortable today, but it was good enough to get the  
job done,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Keep Packing In Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 640 million people traveled on U.S.  
commercial airlines in 1998, and the number of passengers is 
expected to reach nearly 1 billion by 2010, the Transportation 
Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater announced the latest  
figures, showing the seventh straight year of traffic growth, and 
stressed that safety remains the highest priority for the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers ``are a positive report card on our efforts to  
ensure that Americans have access to safe, affordable and efficient 
air travel,'' Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey noted that the increase in  
passengers ``is even more encouraging when you consider that there 
were no major air carrier accidents last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of passengers traveling on domestic flights on  
commercial air carriers is expected to increase to nearly 568 
million in 1999, a 2.4 percent increase over 1998. The number of 
passengers on U.S. and foreign flag carriers traveling to or from 
the United States is expected to increase to more than 132 million 
in 1999, a 4.8 percent increase over 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. commercial air carriers reported an operating profit of  
$9.2 billion in 1998, up $1.3 billion from 1997. To accommodate the 
projected increase in travel, the FAA predicts that the large 
commercial aircraft fleet will increase from 5,030 aircraft in 1998 
to 7,165 aircraft in 2010, an annual growth of 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Players' Field Is Strong As Usual  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- For the first time this decade,  
the PGA Tour has not had a first-time winner in the three months 
preceding The Players Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	This doesn't figure to be a good week for any of 46 players in  
the field who have never cashed a first-place check to finally 
break through. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally the toughest field on tour, the Players has a  
habit of demanding experience from its champions. Sometimes, that 
means knowing when to attack the Pete Dye terror called the Stadium 
Course. Usually, it means staying composed down the stretch with a 
mammoth amount of money at stake -- $900,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 25-year history of the Players, no one has ever made it  
his first PGA Tour victory. 
</P>
<P>
	That's no coincidence.  
</P>
<P>
	``The field here is so strong,'' defending champion Justin  
Leonard said Wednesday. ``The golf course lends itself more to 
people who have been in this position before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last couple of years are proof of that.  
</P>
<P>
	Len Mattiace was at 10-under and a stroke behind Leonard in the  
final round last year when he came to the par-3 17th, the famous 
island green. Even though Mattiace grew up near here, being in 
contention was unfamiliar turf, and it showed. 
</P>
<P>
	After two balls in the water and an eight on the scorecard,  
Mattiace wound up in a tie for fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Tommy Tolles took a two-stroke lead into the final  
round over David Duval, another local kid who had never won. Both 
played conservatively on an otherwise calm day and got lapped by an 
8-under 64 from Fred Couples. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you can win this one, you have beaten the best players in  
the world and you have done it on a very demanding golf course,'' 
Mark O'Meara said. ``It's a position course, and that usually takes 
time to get to know those things. Plus, it's a pretty big 
tournament when you look at the powerhouse players. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will see some new names up on the board early in the  
week,'' he said. ``But come the weekend, it definitely helps to 
have some knowledge about the way the course plays and how to play 
it in certain conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval won't be able to cite inexperience if he gets into  
contention again. After nine victories, $4.5 million and the first 
Sunday 59 in tour history, Duval is regarded as the best player in 
the world, even though the rankings don't agree. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Mattiace, he grew up hanging around the best players during  
the last weekend in March, and this tournament holds special 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the fifth most important tournament you would want to  
win,'' Duval said. ``Then having it in my backyard, I think that 
makes it even that much more desirable for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the Players has been regarded as the fifth major. Its  
purse has swelled to $5 million, double from when Greg Norman won 
in 1994. The course is as stern a test as any. And the roll call of 
champions is tough to match -- all but four have a major 
championship on their resume. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason to compare apples to oranges,'' said  
Leonard, asked to compare his 1997 British Open to last year's 
Players victory. ``But this is one hell of an orange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After three weeks of debate whether quality of a tournament is  
measured by how many top-10 players are in the field, this one is 
no contest. Forty-nine of the top 50 players are gathered this 
week, the exception being 51-year-old Jumbo Ozaki. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods is coming off a tie for 56th in the Bay Hill  
Invitational, the first time he failed to break par in a regular 
PGA Tour event since last year's Players Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably the elite,'' Woods said. ``It's not too often  
where you get the best players in the world coming together besides 
the majors. Just go right down the champions. It's some of the best 
players that ever played the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval skipped the Florida swing after his great start out west.  
He won the Mercedes with a Kapalua course-record 26-under. His 59 
in the Bob Hope Classic gave him another 26-under score and another 
victory, and he finished fifth in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In between an array of interviews during his three-week break,  
he found plenty of time to practice and play on the Stadium Course, 
which is looking more and more like a major championship setup. 
</P>
<P>
	The greens are firm and fast, the result of unusually dry  
weather in March. The rough is a little higher -- about 4 inches 
deep in most spots and particularly troublesome around the greens, 
where it goes from fringe to thick grass with nothing in between. 
</P>
<P>
	That should be enough of a challenge for anyone, let alone  
someone who has never won.

<HEADLINE> AOL May Cut Up to 1,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc., after initially saying it  
would keep the operations of Netscape autonomous, is taking firm 
steps to make its imprint on the newly acquired software pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL announced Wednesday it would cut up to 1,000 of the combined  
company's 12,000 employees, including up to 20 percent of 
Netscape's staff, in a broad realignment that creates four new 
divisions. AOL, the largest Internet access provider and online 
service, completed its purchase of Netscape last week for about $10 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL is ``pulling them in a bit more than they had indicated  
originally,'' said Zia Daniell Wigder, an analyst with New 
York-based Jupiter Communications Inc. But, she said, ``the 
reorganization was to some degree anticipated with this type of an 
acquisition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America Online decided there were more opportunities to merge  
staffs than when the deal was proposed last fall, said Barry 
Schuler, a top AOL executive who will run the combined company's 
Internet Web sites and online services. 
</P>
<P>
	While the two companies have different audiences -- Netscape  
caters more to business users while AOL targets consumers -- AOL 
wants to broaden sales by selling to both. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just found a lot of synergies in where we want to go with  
AOL,'' Schuler said in a telephone interview from Netscape's 
headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The integration reflects, in part, AOL's aggressive plans to  
increase development and distribution of Netscape's once-dominant 
software for finding and retrieving Web information. That could 
reinvigorate the browser's market share, which was surpassed by 
Internet Explorer after Microsoft Corp. gave it away. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, one of the most influential companies in  
cyberspace, may try to convince computer manufacturers to carry 
Netscape's browser, Schuler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL has extremely strong consumer marketing clout,'' Wigder  
said. ``They are in a pretty good position to indicate to PC 
manufacturers how they should be positioning themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, AOL plans to continue to feature Microsoft's Internet  
Explorer software as the preferred browser for jumping subscribers 
of its proprietary online service to the broader Internet. That's 
because Microsoft, in exchange, has agreed to give AOL a prominent 
link in the Windows operating system, which runs 90 percent of the 
world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Netscape's remaining staff will still work at the  
company's headquarters, but the new units will merge workers from 
both companies and managers may be asked to split their time with 
AOL's Dulles, Va. base. At the same time, AOL is eliminating up to 
500 of Netscape's 2,500 workers, largely in administrative 
positions such as accounting. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online is forming four new groups: Interactive Services,  
which includes AOL's online services, Netcenter and Netscape's 
browser; Interactive Properties, which includes AOL's production of 
news and entertainment and its ICQ messaging software; Netscape 
Enterprises, which includes Netscape's business software; and AOL 
International, which includes the overseas operations of America 
Online and its CompuServe unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AOL, dropped $3.87 1/2, or 3 percent, to close at  
$117.12 1/2. It was the most actively traded stock on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Ms. Magazine Relaunches -- Yet Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Like a cat with nine lives, Ms. magazine is back  
on the prowl. 
</P>
<P>
	After ceasing publication for the second time in its 27-year  
history, Ms. magazine is coming back again, this time owned by a 
consortium of businesswomen, heiresses and feminist Gloria Steinem. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are women who have put their money where their hearts  
are,'' said Ms. Steinem, a co-founder of the magazine and 
consulting editor. ``It is the only magazine for women controlled 
by women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First launched in 1972, Ms. ceased publication for eight months  
in 1989 because it was losing money. In 1990, it came back, without 
ads, cut publication from monthly to bimonthly and raised 
subscription prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Ms. celebrated its 25th anniversary with a new owner --  
Jay MacDonald, publisher of Working Mother and Working Woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, MacDonald sold Ms. to Liberty Media for Women, an  
investment group that includes Ms. Steinem; Abigail Disney, 
grand-niece of Walt Disney; Sandy Lerner, co-founder of Cisco 
Systems, maker of computer-networking equipment; Alix L.L. Ritchie, 
a philanthropist and publisher of a weekly Massachusetts newspaper, 
the Provincetown Banner. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine stopped publishing for three issues while the sale  
went through. Publication resumes with the April-May issue, which 
will be on some newsstands March 30 for $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine still accepts no ads and derives most of its  
revenue from subscribers, who number around 150,000, according to 
chief editor Marcia Ann Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
	The first issue of the newly reconstituted Ms. announces on its  
cover: ``WE'RE BACK! Wake Up &AMP; Smell the Estrogen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gillespie said the new Ms. is edgier and funnier. As for the  
target readership, editor Gloria Jacobs said there isn't one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It ranges from 18 to 80, quite literally -- we've never had  
that 18-to-34 or 25-to-35 readership,'' she said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Internic Changes Raise Feds' Ire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is demanding an explanation  
from the company that assigns most of the world's Internet 
addresses, after it moved quietly to steer customers of an 
important Web directory to its private commercial site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very concerned,'' said Becky Burr, administrator with  
the Commerce Department. ``This was undertaken without consultation 
with the United States government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People trying to visit the popular ``Internic.Net'' directory --  
which checks the availability of a new Web address -- are 
unexpectedly being swept automatically to the home page for Network 
Solutions Inc., which offers to register Internet addresses with 
the com, net or org suffixes for $119. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has remarkable authority over the Internet stemming  
from its exclusive government contract. It made the surprise change 
as the government moves to largely end its role managing the global 
computer network and hands responsibility over to a non-profit 
group, the California-based Internet Corporation for Assigned Names 
and Numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The community has had it (Internic) for a long time, and  
they're used to having it for a reference tool,'' Michael Roberts, 
the group's president, said from Los Angeles. ``Whether this sort 
of brute-force approach to closing it is appropriate, there are a 
lot of questions. The manner in which they did it seemed pretty 
inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts said he expects to talk Friday with Network Solutions  
about its decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is upset because the information directory has  
traditionally been considered a community resource, like a giant 
telephone book for the Web, and because it owns Internic as a 
registered trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our view is, this information has been freely available to the  
Internet community for a long time,'' Burr said. ``If there is some 
reason to change that, we need to be consulted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The change, which occurred overnight last Friday, infuriated  
some Internet groups. It illustrates the challenges of diluting the 
influence of Network Solutions and turning over to private industry 
the job of running the Internet, which is quickly becoming the most 
crucial communications medium for the digital age. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds e-mailed the Commerce Department to complain.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're entering a very uncertain period,'' said Jay Fenello,  
president of Iperdome Inc., an Internet company. ``There are 
serious questions about how this transition will move forward. This 
is just a symptom of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solutions, based in Herndon, Va., has enjoyed a  
lucrative, exclusive government agreement to register Internet 
addresses since 1993. It has assigned more than 4 million Web sites 
and had $93.7 million in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Its decision to quietly steer visitors from Internic to its own  
site comes just before Roberts' group was expected to select five 
companies that will compete with Network Solutions in assigning Web 
addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to get as much visibility with customers as  
they can for as long as they can,'' complained William Walsh of 
Fresno, Calif., who runs DSO Net, another Internet company. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to brand their registrar service as the Internic  
before there are even other registrars that could compete,'' Walsh 
said. ``It may be legal, but it speaks of ethical problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Network Solutions, Chris Clough, said the  
Internic information directory is legally a customer list owned by 
his company. He said the company decided last weekend to 
consolidate several Web sites it maintained, including 
Internic.Net, to anticipate changes in how the Internet will be 
managed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Roberts said late Tuesday that confusion over the switch  
might delay his organization's selection of which companies 
eventually will compete to assign Web addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Some applicants have already complained that the change by  
Network Solutions is causing them technical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sufficiently serious that we're considering delaying our  
deadline to give people more time,'' said Roberts.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Futures Rise on USDA Tender / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures prices jumped early today on the  
Chicago Board of Trade after the government made a large purchase. 
Corn and soybean futures also advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures rose on news the U.S. Agriculture Department would  
buy 1.022 million metric tons of hard red winter wheat for donation 
to needy countries. The Clinton administration has been seeking to 
help beleaguered farmers and countries hit by a global economic 
crisis by buying commodities for donation. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures advanced as the government moved a step closer to  
buying the commodity for donation to Russia as part of a program 
announced in December. Gains were expected to be limited, however, 
on concern potential NATO strikes in Serbia over the Kosovo crisis 
could derail new donation announcements. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures moved higher in step with wheat and corn.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 3 cents to $2.85 3/4 a bushel; May  
corn rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.30 1/4 a bushel; May oats rose 1 1/4 cents to 
$1.17 a bushel; May soybeans rose 4 cents to $4.97 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose .25 cent to 67.65 cents a pound; April  
feeder cattle rose .25 cent to 72.25 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
rose .38 cent to 44.40 cents a pound; May pork bellies rose .60 
cent to 56.60 cents a pound.

	BUYING A USED CAR: Finding a reliable used car at a good price  
can be hard, so Consumer Reports magazine offers some suggestions 
on where to go. New car dealers are usually the safest place, 
because they tend to sell used-cars that are in good conditions, 
but they're often the most expensive, the magazine says. 
Superstores such as AutoNation and CarMax have big inventories of 
good cars, and usually have no-haggle pricing. Used-car lots 
sometimes have bad reputations, but Consumer Reports says you can 
protect yourself by checking on them with the local chamber of 
commerce or Better Business Bureau. If a used car dealer has been 
in the same location for some time, that's a good sign -- a dealer 
that moves around frequently is less likely to be on the up-and-up. 

</P>
<P>
	THE CLOCK IS TICKING! THE CLOCK IS TICKING!: SmartMoney magazine  
has put together a list of offbeat things you might want to 
consider getting or doing to prepare for possible problems caused 
by Y2K computer bugs. For example: an abacus, ``The Foraging 
Gourmet'' cookbook, a kit for starting your own currency, 40 
minutes with a telephone psychic, a package of wheat and a 
family-sized grain mill and an underground shelter. Are they just 
joshing us? Well, they've also included 50 South African gold 
Krugerrand coins, considered a safe haven for investments. So you 
never know.

	HOW NOT TO BE A SELF-SABOTEUR: Even if you're a hard worker, you  
could be sabotaging your own career growth by the way you talk or 
present yourself, says Debra Benton, an executive coach. She says 
there are five common types of self-defeating behavior that 
employees should try to avoid. First, there's talking too fast, 
which makes what you say seem unimportant. Second, talking too much 
-- giving more details than anyone needs or wants. Third, being too 
critical, or passing too many judgments on others. Fourth, being 
too self-critical, or too revealing about your own inadequacies. 
And No. 5: displaying weak body language or using a weak tone of 
voice. Behavior like this, Benton says, can help break a career.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Exhibition Game Defended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Cuban-American members of Congress urged  
the government Wednesday to cancel an exhibition baseball game this 
weekend in Havana between the Baltimore Orioles and Cuba's national 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ranneberger, the Clinton administration's coordinator of  
Cuban affairs, defended the contest as part of a U.S. effort to 
reach out to the Cuban people. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Ilena Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican whose district  
includes thousands of Cuban-Americans and exiles, said Sunday's 
game would not help the Cuban people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only home run will be for the Castro regime as it alone  
reaps the immediate public relations benefits from this game,'' 
Ros-Lehtinen told the House International Relations subcommittee on 
the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	She said playing ball with Cuba ``will only prolong the  
suffering of the Cuban people by legitimizing the regime that 
oppresses them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, said among those  
unable to watch the game will be four leading Cuban opposition 
figures sentenced to prison terms last week for crimes of 
``inciting sedition'' against the Castro regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez said the baseball game was another example of the  
administration's misguided Cuba policy. He also criticized 
President Clinton for not speaking out more forcefully against the 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranneberger noted that plans for the game were made before the  
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may not be the best time for the game,'' Ranneberger  
said. ``But it is part of the process to pursue people-to-people 
ties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These contacts, which also include religious, scientific,  
educational and cultural exchanges, ``expose the Cuban people to 
the values of a free society ... and help them prepare for a better 
tomorrow,'' Ranneberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	A second exhibition game is set for May 3 at Camden Yards.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked about that second game, Ranneberger said security details  
remain to be worked out with Cuban authorities. U.S. officials will 
not agree to limiting access to the Cuban players and will not 
oppose any demand the players might make to remain in the United 
States, he said.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Cites Oscar Favoritism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Fernanda Montenegro, the  
69-year-old star of the foreign film ``Central Station,'' accused 
Hollywood of favoritism in awarding the Oscar to Gwyneth Paltrow 
over her and said ``Life is Beautiful'' wasn't worthy of victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In a televised interview Tuesday, Ms. Montenegro described Ms.  
Paltrow as ``this romantic figure, thin, pure, virginal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have much of this type of actress in American  
cinema,'' she said. ``It's an investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Roberto Benigni's ``Life is Beautiful,'' which competed  
against ``Central Station'' for best foreign film, Ms. Montenegro 
said: ``It didn't deserve to win. I think even Benigni recognized 
this. As a film it was weak. ... I thought it was just him that 
won, not the film itself.''

<HEADLINE> Vaughn Now Walks Among Angels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Mo Vaughn appears to be noticeably trimmer  
this spring. He says no, so it must be the weight off his 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger Clemens told me if you get out of Boston, because of the  
regime that's in control, it adds five years to your career,'' 
Vaughn says. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn has something to prove this year, not just to himself and  
to the Anaheim Angels, but to the Red Sox and all their fans. Just 
like Clemens, he wants to show general manager Dan Duquette and 
chief executive officer John Harrington made a colossal mistake by 
letting him go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think about my friends, my teammates, but I won't miss that  
organization. I don't miss the garbage and I don't miss the people 
running the team,'' Vaughn says on a cloudless spring morning, the 
desert sun starting to warm the dry air. ``It's just something that 
had to happen,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The words start coming quickly. Mo is a man who doesn't play  
games. He can't hide his feelings, even if he tried. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame,'' Vaughn says. ``We could have played for Lou  
Gorman for the rest of our careers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duquette, who replaced Gorman as general manager in January  
1994, didn't aggressively pursue Clemens, who then signed with 
Toronto and won consecutive Cy Young Awards for a record five. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after Clemens left, the Red Sox kept saying they  
wanted to keep Vaughn, but all their offers were months late and a 
few million dollars short, so he signed an $80 million, six-year 
contract with the Angels, who look to him for as a powerhouse on 
the field and off. 
</P>
<P>
	That means: Drive in the runs and drive the rest of the  
clubhouse to excel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything they brought him here for, he's going to give us,''  
says Tim Salmon, a veteran of the Angels' September flops in 1997 
and 1998. ``He's not going to have MVP-type years every year. But 
he brings so much to the table, he's going to make myself, he's 
going to make Darrin Erstad, he's going to make Jim Edmonds have 
those MVP-type years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Clemens, Vaughn brings intensity and all those intangibles  
that baseball managers cite. He had a personal trainer come by at 7 
a.m. every day this spring, bullying the body even before he went 
to the ballpark for BP. 
</P>
<P>
	``He dedicates himself and prepares himself as good as  
anybody,'' Angels manager Terry Collins says. ``He not only drives 
himself to it, he drives everyone to do the same thing. We did our 
homework. We know what he's like. He's not going to hold clubhouse 
meetings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's at those crucial times in games, when players need to suck  
it up to get a hit, or pitchers need to bear down and get an out, 
that Vaughn makes his presence felt. A little word here and there, 
just to let a teammate know this is the time when winning teams 
separate themselves from the rest of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell a player something,'' Collins says. ``But if it  
comes from Mo Vaughn, it means a lot more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim, which has never been to the World Series since starting  
play in 1961, has not been known as a hearty bunch. For years, Gene 
Autry tried to spend for a winner. Now that it's The Walt Disney 
Co.'s team, the Mouse people in charge want to change that 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Up in LA, the Dodgers brought in Kevin Brown for wins and  
toughness in their laid-back clubhouse. It's Vaughn's job to do the 
same down in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's hurt, everyone's sore, probably after a  
week-and-a-half of the season,'' Collins says. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Vaughn comes in. Collins says Vaughn carries a  
message with him everywhere he goes, and doesn't even have to 
verbalize it: 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't make excuses. Play every game to completion. Don't give  
away any at-bats. Watch the batting cage. This guy comes in with a 
purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn has struggled this spring, going 12-for-38 (.316) through  
Tuesday with no homers and nine RBIs. Layered in windbreakers and 
sweatshirts in the early morning cool of the desert spring isn't 
what he's used to, and the high skies seem to have given him 
trouble picking up the ball out of pitchers' hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, it's spring training, so he's not concerned. He  
still has time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he's no longer in the center of the Beantown glare, with  
Red Sox fans wondering if he'll stay or go, with the team hinting, 
making and withdrawing offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always feeling like I had to go out and prove myself to  
the people I worked for,'' Vaughn says. ``There was never a rest 
period, a stable period. If I had stayed, I would have retired 
angry. I didn't want to choose that way to leave the game. I would 
have never had fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll live in Newport Beach, about a half-hour drive from the  
ballpark. It will be quite different from life in Easton, Mass., 
where he wasn't just a ballplayer, he was a civic hero. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox brought up the negatives, the July 1995 bar fight in  
Boston (he was defending a girl friend and no charges were brought) 
and the January 1998 arrest in Dedham, Mass., on a drunken driving 
charge (he was acquitted). After 7 1/2 seasons with the team, he had 
enough. He wanted peace of mind to go along with his millions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not angry about my situation at all,'' he says. ``It was  
worth the struggle. It made me a better person. It made me 
strong.''

<HEADLINE> Japan's Nomura Rating Downgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Two major U.S. credit agencies on Wednesday  
downgraded the ratings of Japanese brokerage giant Nomura 
Securities Co., citing a deteriorating profit growth outlook and 
exposure to potential losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's Investors Service cut Nomura's long-term debt rating to  
``Baa2'' from ``Baa1,'' just one step up from the lowest investment 
grade above junk status. It also placed the brokerage's short-term 
ratings on review for possible downgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Standard &AMP; Poor's lowered Nomura's long-term credit rating to  
``BBB'' from ``A-,'' also one notch away from the lowest investment 
grade above junk. It cut the securities company's short-term rating 
to ``A-3'' from ``A-2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lower credit ratings signal increased risks for investors, which  
tends to increase a company's borrowing costs on capital markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's attributed its move to insufficient restructuring at  
Nomura, heightened competition from rival firms and the impact of 
adverse market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Standard &AMP; Poor's noted Nomura's risk of exposure to losses  
stemming from a Japanese non-bank affiliate and its operations in 
the United States, along with greater competitive threats in its 
home market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Standard &AMP; Poor's believes, however, that its existing  
favorable domestic franchise in both wholesale and retail markets 
... should enable the company to maintain its revised ratings,'' 
the ratings firm said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura, Japan's largest brokerage house, has announced  
restructuring plans to cut 2,000 jobs from its 13,000-person work 
force by 2001. The company reported 207.2 billion yen ($1.76 
billion) in losses for the first half of the fiscal year ending 
later this month.

<HEADLINE> Citibank To Buy Mellon Credit Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citibank, the nation's largest bank, said  
Tuesday it will acquire Mellon Bank's credit card business in a 
deal that restores Citibank's position as the country's largest 
credit card issuer. 
</P>
<P>
	Citibank, which recently switched its allegiance to MasterCard  
from Visa, will take control of Mellon's portfolio of $1.9 billion 
in credit card balances. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	With this acquisition, New York-based Citibank will have about  
$71.5 billion in credit card balances, edging past BancOne's First 
USA subsidiary with $69.9 billion, according to The Nilson Report. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is part of Mellon's strategy to exit nonessential  
businesses. The Pittsburgh-based bank still plans to jettison its 
mortgage business and network services transaction processing unit.

<HEADLINE> Research at VA Hospital Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Citing a need to protect patients in clinical  
studies, the Department of Veterans Affairs is suspending research 
activities at the largest veterans hospital in the country, the Los 
Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the West Los Angeles VA Healthcare Center on  
Monday, Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, undersecretary for health, ordered 
the suspension of research by Friday, saying efforts to improve 
protections for human subjects after repeated warnings were 
``wholly unsatisfactory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans officials said they have no evidence that the  
hospital's oversight of research practices has harmed people. The 
suspension is a ``preemptive'' measure to prevent injuries, 
according to the order. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension could affect 500 studies on humans and animals  
being conducted by more than 100 researchers, Dr. John R. Feussner, 
the agency's chief of research and development, said in today's 
editions of the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The order blocks recruitment of new subjects into existing  
studies, delays decisions on proposed studies and threatens ongoing 
experiments. Any studies that would cause harm if they were stopped 
will be allowed to continue after agency review, Feussner said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related action, the federal Office for Protection From  
Research Risks on Monday suspended the hospital's contract to do 
clinical studies funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical center ``will comply with these orders and cease all  
research activities except for studies explicitly approved by the 
VA headquarters office of research and development,'' said hospital 
spokeswoman Marianne Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Research Risks office, part of the National Institutes of  
Health, cited the facility for poor informed-consent procedures, 
such as not disclosing to mentally ill patients the possible 
hazards of participating in studies in which medications were 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The research probation is not expected to affect ordinary  
patient care at the 1,056-bed facility or its affiliated clinics. 
The facilities serve an area with more than 1 million veterans.

	NATO Set To Attack Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Air raid sirens sounded for several  
minutes today in Pristina, signaling that NATO airstrikes against a 
defiant Yugoslavia could come soon. Belgrade has declared a state 
of emergency to warn citizens of an impending bombing. Yugoslav 
forces scattered to hide from an expected missile attack. A wave of 
U.S. B-52 bombers stationed in Britain flew out of their base this 
morning and are on standby for a strike on Serb targets. But 
Yugoslavia's ambassador to Russia says his country is ready to 
resume peace talks with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, who left 
Belgrade yesterday after failing to reach a deal with President 
Slobodan Milosevic. 

</P>

	Pentagon Prepares Yugoslavia Attack  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Military officials say American and allied  
warships and bombers stand ready today to deliver a ``swift and 
severe'' blow to Yugoslavia, starting with a U.S.-led barrage of 
sea- and air-launched cruise missiles that would target Yugoslav 
air defenses. President Clinton yesterday prepared the nation for 
an imminent attack on Serb targets, saying that although American 
troops would be at risk, the air campaign is necessary for Europe's 
long-term stability. Clinton said American diplomatic efforts had 
reached a dead end and Serb troops were terrorizing and murdering 
civilians in Kosovo. 

</P>
<P>
	Primakov Says Airstrikes Won't Help  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is warning  
that NATO airstrikes against Serb targets would only raise 
international tensions. Primakov abruptly canceled a planned trip 
to the United States after getting word of the failed diplomatic 
effort in Yugoslavia. Primakov, who was to meet with President 
Clinton and Vice President Gore in an effort to secure new loans 
from the International Monetary Fund, said an attack would damage 
relations between Russia and the United States. President Boris 
Yeltsin said Russia ``has been and will be categorically opposed to 
NATO use of force.''

	Court Upholds Pinochet Arrest  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's highest court today upheld Gen. Augusto  
Pinochet's arrest on charges of crimes against humanity, dashing 
the former Chilean dictator's hopes of immediately returning home. 
A House of Lords tribunal ruled that Pinochet is not entitled to 
immunity from arrest, despite his status as a former head of state. 
But the judges ruled that the 83-year-old general cannot be 
prosecuted for any acts alleged before 1988, when Britain signed 
the International Convention Against Torture. He must remain under 
police guard in Britain while Spain seeks his extradition on the 
remaining counts.

	31 Die in Kenya Train Crash  
</P>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- At least 31 people were killed today when  
a passenger train in Kenya derailed. Five people from outside of 
Africa were among those killed in the accident on the edge of Tsavo 
National Park, 155 miles southeast of Nairobi, according to the 
Defense Department. Their nationalities were not immediately 
available. Officials said there could be as many as 100 people 
still trapped in the wreckage.

	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Soldiers searched for more bodies  
today in one of two bus accidents in Pakistan that killed as many 
as 60 people, police said. The army sent in dozens of soldiers to 
dredge the Jehlum canal near Mandi Bahauddin, 90 miles north of 
Lahore, the capital of the Punjab province. The accident occurred 
yesterday. So far, nine bodies have been recovered from the 
fast-moving canal.

	Durable-Goods Orders Drop 5 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- February orders to factories for big-ticket  
durable goods such as aircraft and washing machines recorded the 
sharpest decline in more than seven years, reflecting weakness 
across many industries. Orders slumped 5 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted $191.8 billion in the worst decrease since December 1991. 
The world economic slump that began in Asia nearly two years ago 
has hurt American manufacturers by slicing their export sales and

Miami Heat last night in a matchup of two of the NBA's best teams. 
The Jazz erased an eight-point fourth-quarter deficit to win at 
home for the 24th time in their last 25 games. Utah leads the 
Midwest Division with a 20-6 record, and Miami is first in the 
Atlantic with an 18-7 mark.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Criticize Census Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats claimed victory Wednesday  
after Republican leaders delayed a final vote on a bill that would 
allow local officials to review and challenge census counts before 
they become final. But the measure will be brought up when 
lawmakers return from a weeklong recess that begins Monday, a House 
Government Reform census subcommittee spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt,  
appearing before the House Appropriations subcommittee that funds 
his agency, was criticized for not having a final budget estimate 
for conducting the 2000 census. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, offered by Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., would give local  
officials 45 days to review and challenge census data, if they 
choose to participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say the legislation would not ensure an accurate count  
of the minorities who were missed in the 1990 census. Prewitt said 
the program, which was used in 1990, didn't work well and that 
local officials are helping the bureau update its address lists 
before the count. 
</P>
<P>
	But the program helped correct 80,000 mistakes in 1990 and  
should continue, said Chip Walker, spokesman for the House census 
panel. He said the bill was pulled from the House schedule 
Wednesday because of the debate over a disaster bill and the start 
of NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to continue to push forward. This is something  
that is good for cities,'' Walker said. ``The only way that you can 
catch mistakes is if you allow local officials to review the 
numbers because they know best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's nonvoting  
delegate in Congress, said such a program will not ensure the most 
accurate count possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and the Clinton administration had hoped to improve  
the census by using a scientific method known as statistical 
sampling. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Supreme Court said sampling could not be used for the  
process of allocating the 435 House seats among the states, leading 
the Census Bureau to switch gears toward planning a traditional, 
door-to-door head count that will be used to determine how many 
House seats each state gets. A second count will use sampling to 
find people missed during the first count and produce what 
officials say will be a more accurate census. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our message is clear. We count. Children count. Everybody  
counts, so count everybody,'' Norton said at a news conference. She 
was joined by members of the congressional black, Hispanic and 
Asian-Pacific-American caucuses and representatives of civil rights 
organizations, all of whom oppose the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the  
Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the bureau's funding, 
criticized the administration for what he said was a lack of 
progress on the census. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Census Bureau gambled that the Supreme Court would approve  
sampling and we're now faced with the possibility that the census 
won't be finished on time,'' Rogers said. ``They have no plan. They 
don't know how much it will cost. They're not ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 472.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Makes Case for Yugo Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The biggest obstacle the Clinton  
administration faced in building congressional support for NATO 
airstrikes in Kosovo was explaining why U.S. interests are at stake 
in the Balkans -- and why American military lives should be risked. 
</P>
<P>
	Even backers of airstrikes by the United States and its North  
Atlantic allies conceded that the rationale for U.S. intervention 
was complicated, perhaps not readily obvious. 
</P>
<P>
	But, said the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Sen.  
John Warner, R-Va., ``The case of inaction is unacceptable to the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a tough sale.  
</P>
<P>
	For every reason the administration and its congressional allies  
recited to support bombing Serbian military positions, contrary 
arguments were mounted by skeptics against a new entanglement in 
the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Once President Clinton decided to act, the Republican-led  
Congress rallied behind him, if a little grudgingly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate late Tuesday voted 58-41 in support of a resolution  
``authorizing'' airstrikes that could come as early as today -- and 
which would have occurred even without the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're coming close to starting World War III,'' said Sen. Ted  
Stevens, R-Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration and its allies argued that failure to act now  
against Yugoslavia and its president, Slobodan Milosevic, could 
worsen a severe humanitarian crisis, accelerate Serbian acts of 
genocide against ethic Albanians, hold NATO up to ridicule and even 
spread the war to other countries such as Greece and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a conflict with no natural boundaries,'' Clinton said  
Tuesday in a letter to congressional leaders asking for their 
11th-hour support. ``If it continues, it will push refugees across 
borders and draw in neighboring countries. ... Mr. Milosevic should 
have no doubt about our resolve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about stability in Europe,'' Sen. Joseph Biden,  
D-Del., told the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics said they did not see a compelling national mandate.  
</P>
<P>
	``Many members are now conflicted,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey  
Hutchison, R-Texas, a sponsor of legislation that would have 
blocked funds for the bombing campaign. She did not push her 
legislation in the face of the escalating crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	A big part of the problem: Clinton has done a poor job in  
communicating with the nation and Congress what the U.S. interests 
are in either Kosovo or another former Yugoslav republic, Bosnia, 
said former Rep. Lee Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat who is now a 
scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center, a foreign policy think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of this stems from Clinton's impeachment problems last year  
with the GOP-led Congress, Hamilton suggested. ``These things catch 
up with you when there's a crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other problem, said Hamilton, who was the senior Democrat on  
the House International Relations Committee until he retired last 
year, is that it's hard to make a persuasive case that there is a 
vital U.S. national interest in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nor am I persuaded that it could spill over into Albania and  
Macedonia. And the business of destabilizing Greece or Turkey, I 
don't see that either,'' Hamilton said. ``I fundamentally don't 
agree with this idea that disruption in the Balkans is going to 
cause a conflagration of some kind in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress have argued that the dispute in Kosovo  
is just the latest chapter of a civil war that's been going on in 
the region, in one form or the other, for 600 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has made a strong case to justify such attacks on  
humanitarian grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Yugoslav government in Belgrade stripped Kosovo of its  
autonomy in 1989, Yugoslav army troops and Serbian police 
persecuted the ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo. This escalated 
over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have  
been displaced in a year of fighting between the government and 
rebels seeking independence for ethnic Albanians. Since peace talks 
between the Serbs and ethnic Albanians broke down last week in 
France, Milosevic mounted a new offensive against ethnic Albanian 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics noted that the United States did not act militarily  
to stop ethnic extermination in Cambodia or Ethiopia or Rwanda; and 
did not suggest bombing Russia for ethnic repression in Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Many lawmakers remain fearful that the air campaign could turn  
into another Bosnia -- or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 6,700 American troops remain in neighboring Bosnia as part  
of a NATO peacekeeping force established in 1995, even though 
Clinton initially said the troops would be home in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, in the final analysis, most members of Congress seemed  
willing to give Clinton the benefit of the doubt -- for now -- as 
commander-in-chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, I think the mood was to lock arms,'' House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hastert also invited Clinton to appear before a joint  
House-Senate session afterwards -- to explain his Kosovo policy in 
more detail. Clinton said he would consider it.

<HEADLINE> IOC Cancels Ceremony After Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
on Wednesday canceled the inauguration ceremony for a rebuilt 
bomb-damaged Olympic hall because of bomb strikes in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said it had made the decision to put off the  
ceremony in the Zetra Olympic Hall in Sarajevo in the light of the 
``current political situation in the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came a day after the IOC released plans for the  
inauguration, during which IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch was 
to hand over the keys to the people and sportsmen and women of 
Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO was began bomb strikes Wednesday on sites in nearby Kosovo,  
following the failure of the Yugoslav government to sign a peace 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zetra hall was damaged by fighting during the civil war in  
the Bosnian capital, which played host to the winter Olympics in 
1984. It was rebuilt with $13.5 million from the IOC, sporting 
organizations and governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision was taken in consultation with all the  
authorities concerned, giving due consideration to issues of 
security and logistics,'' an IOC statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the wish of all concerned that this humanitarian project  
be followed through as soon as possible, and that Zetra's 
reconstruction will continue to carry a message of peace and 
reconciliation,'' an IOC statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was to have included a figure skating event, with  
performances by Olympic champions Katarina Witt and Alexei Urmanov.

<HEADLINE> Rudders Faulted in Crashes of 737s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- A federal safety board believes rudder  
changes made in the Boeing 737, the world's most common jetliner, 
haven't fixed control problems with the plane, but the Boeing Co. 
and the Federal Aviation Administration disagree. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, the FAA and the National Transportation Safety  
Board staked out their positions Wednesday, after the safety board 
concluded that rudder problems caused two fatal airline crashes and 
nearly triggered a third. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Higgins, Boeing's vice president of airplane safety,  
told reporters that the 737 has an excellent safety record, with 77 
million departures since it was introduced in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking two out of 77 million, we're talking three out  
of 77 million, we're talking four out of 77 million,'' Higgins 
said, referring to the crashes and rudder-related incidents 
mentioned by the safety board. ``Those are pretty, pretty small 
numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB made its finding at the end of a two-day hearing into  
the cause of the 1994 crash of USAir Flight 427. The plane, a 737, 
suddenly spiraled into a ravine outside Pittsburgh after a flight 
from Chicago. All 132 aboard were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	While not officially on its docket, the board also heard  
evidence about the 1991 crash of United Airlines Flight 585 outside 
Colorado Springs, Colo., which killed all 25 aboard, and a 1996 
incident in which the pilots of an Eastwind Airlines 737 struggled 
to maintain control as they landed in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing presentations from crash investigators, engineers  
and medical doctors, the board voted 4-0 that the probable cause of 
the USAir crash ``was a loss of control of the airplane'' due to a 
jam of a hydraulic valve controlling the plane's rudder. 
</P>
<P>
	That jam caused the rudder, a panel that runs up the tail and  
sweeps the nose left and right, to reverse direction, causing the 
deadly spiral, the board said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 34 findings of fact, the board declared that 737s do not have  
a rudder control system that is ``reliably redundant'' because the 
two existing control systems merge in a single hydraulic valve, 
known as the power control unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The members said further that recent redesigns of the power  
control unit ``do not eliminate the possibility of other potential 
failure modes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Thomas McSweeny, associate FAA administrator for  
regulation and certification, said: ``I have not seen any data, 
from the board or anybody else, that identifies other failure 
modes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The board asked the FAA to convene a panel of engineers,  
including Boeing and NTSB officials, to investigate further rudder 
changes. The board is empowered to make safety recommendations, but 
only the FAA can order them. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB declined to make a recommendation some of its staff had  
proposed: to press Boeing and the FAA to redesign the 737's rudder 
system to separate the hydraulics or split the rudder panel so 
problems with one half would not affect the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Such changes would have cost airlines well over $100 million and  
threatened the flying public with service interruptions as the 
planes were modified. There are 3,100 Boeing 737s in the worldwide 
fleet, so many that 800 are in the air at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hall, chairman of the safety board, said the members wanted  
to leave any necessary changes in the hands of the FAA, Boeing and 
the proposed review committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not in the business of designing rudders. That's  
supposed to be their responsibility,'' he said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the USAir crash outside Pittsburgh, Boeing has redesigned  
the 737 power control unit to prevent the type of jam the safety 
board blamed for the crashes and near-miss. The FAA has given 
airlines until August to install the new devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has also developed a device that will limit the amount of  
rudder a pilot can apply in high-risk situations, and the company 
and the FAA have developed training to help pilots cope with 
unexpected turbulence and other upsets to their aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, McSweeny said Wednesday that the FAA was sending a  
notice to airlines asking them to instruct 737 pilots to fly the 
planes 10 mph faster than they normally would as they ready for 
landing. In cases where pilots lose control of an airplane on 
approach -- as happened with the crashes and near-miss -- extra speed 
can help them recover.

<HEADLINE> Susan McDougal Breaks Court Silence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal occasionally dabbed  
tears from her eyes as she testified that her husband's mental 
illness was the undoing of their marriage and business and 
ultimately led to the Whitewater investigation against President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	A former business partner of Clinton and first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton, Mrs. McDougal testified almost four hours in her 
own defense Tuesday, answering some questions she refused to answer 
before a federal grand jury in 1996 and again last year. 
</P>
<P>
	She was expected to return to the stand today in her trial on  
charges of obstruction of justice and criminal contempt of court 
for refusing to answer grand jury questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Mark Geragos, said the testimony Tuesday was a  
``cathartic'' experience for his client. She has said she refused 
to answer federal grand jury questions because she feared 
retaliation from prosecutor Kenneth Starr if he didn't like what 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way she was going to get out the true story here was  
to tell it in a courtroom,'' Geragos said outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal and her late ex-husband, James McDougal, were  
partners with the Clintons in the Whitewater real estate venture in 
northern Arkansas. The McDougals and then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker were 
convicted of business fraud in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, she refused to answer grand jury questions about the  
Clintons and spent 18 months in jail for civil contempt. She again 
refused to answer the questions in April last year and was indicted 
on two counts of criminal contempt and one count of obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking directly at jurors and choking back tears, Mrs. McDougal  
said Tuesday her ex-husband was ``a control person,'' had a temper 
and experienced mood swings, but would not concede at first that he 
had a problem. She said he suffered from manic depression and had 
serious health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors showed no expression. Some took notes; others rocked  
in their chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal described how she was in awe of her husband,  
trusted him and did not realize until their marriage hit the skids 
and their Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan was being investigated 
by bank examiners that he had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	When McDougal asked her to sign a $300,000 loan to her from  
David Hale's Capital Management Services, she did not question him, 
she said. Hale, a prosecution witness in the 1996 trial, has 
claimed that Clinton pressured him to make the fraudulent loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale has served 21 months of a 28-month sentence for defrauding  
the Small Business Administration through Capital Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said she did not discuss the loan with Clinton,  
answering a question she previously would not answer before the 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	In her testimony Tuesday, she also said Clinton gave truthful  
testimony at her trial. She conceded that she may have mentioned to 
him a Whitewater-related venture that was purchased partly with the 
$300,000 loan. Clinton has denied knowing anything about the 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal described how James McDougal, who also had worked  
on Clinton's gubernatorial staff in Arkansas, ``loved Bill Clinton 
very much.'' But she said her husband became angry with Clinton 
after the thrift failed and McDougal was charged in the late 1980s 
with banking violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said her husband, who was later acquitted of those  
charges, felt abandoned by his friends, including Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	During Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign, she said, McDougal  
told her that Little Rock lawyer Sheffield Nelson, a Republican and 
Clinton foe, arranged for him to be paid if he would talk to a New 
York Times reporter about Whitewater. Mrs. McDougal also testified 
that McDougal told her he discussed Clinton's past ``in a 
conference call with the Bush White House'' during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson did not return a telephone call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Braces for NATO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia warned its citizens of  
impending airstrikes today, and NATO forces prepared for bombings 
after diplomacy failed to find a peaceful settlement in the 
rebellious province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of U.S. B-52 bombers that had been put on stand-by for a  
strike on Serbia flew out of their base in Gloucestershire, 
England, in apparent preparation for a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't immediately known whether the aircraft, believed to be  
armed with cruise missiles, were headed for a base closer to the 
Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Their departure came only hours after British Prime Minister  
Tony Blair declared: ``We must now act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Defense Secretary George Robertson said in an interview  
with the BBC Tuesday night that military action could come today. 
At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, the alliance's top 
policy-making body convened today to assess the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	After declaring a state of emergency -- its first since World War  
II -- Serb forces dispersed to hide from bombings and to try to keep 
the country's grip on Kosovo, where government troops battled 
ethnic Albanian separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have been killed in over a year of  
fighting in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main Yugoslav 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO had threatened bombardment if Milosevic rejected a  
U.S.-brokered plan to provide interim self-rule to the ethnic 
Albanians who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into a European Summit in Berlin, Dutch Prime Minister  
Wim Kok said NATO would first issue a ``verbal warning'' to 
Belgrade that an attack was imminent, giving Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic a last chance to avert it. ``Then we will have a 
first aerial attack,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, there were long lines for gas, and newspapers and  
television instructed citizens on what to do in the event of 
bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Media published instructions from the Belgrade City Council  
warning citizens to prepare food and necessities to take to bomb 
shelters in the event of an air raid, as well a how to signal 
rescue workers from under the rubble of a devastated building. 
</P>
<P>
	``Be calm, do not panic, but be decisive,'' the instructions  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid a sense that military action was inevitable, remaining  
foreign embassy personnel evacuated Yugoslavia today. Children 
attended school and workers went to their offices as usual, but an 
armored personnel carrier was seen driving down a central street. 
</P>
<P>
	``All efforts to achieve a negotiated, political solution to the  
Kosovo crisis having failed. No alternative is open but to take 
military action,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said 
Tuesday night in Brussels after the military alliance resolved to 
act. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's Tanjug news agency said Solana's order for  
airstrikes was based on ``false reports of an alleged humanitarian 
catastrophe in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The irrational decision to attack our country can have tragic  
consequences for the entire region,'' Tanjug said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, who was unable in two days of  
talks to budge Milosevic from his refusal to accept a peace deal 
embraced by Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, said the Yugoslav 
leader understood the implications. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't stand up to brutality and the killing of innocent  
civilians, you invite them to do more,'' President Clinton said in 
a speech to a union federation. ``We have tried to do everything we 
could to solve this peacefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solana directed Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme allied commander in  
Europe, to initiate action with the more than 400 allied aircraft 
and a half dozen missile-carrying ships on alert in the Adriatic 
Sea. Clark had said Monday that the targets had been selected and 
his forces were ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighboring nations were also on alert.  
</P>
<P>
	Albania and Bulgaria received assurances of NATO protection in a  
letter today from Solana. Macedonia also worried about the 
consequences airstrikes would have on its fragile stability, 
especially with more than 10,000 NATO troops in its territory in 
preparation for a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo that has not 
materialized. 
</P>
<P>
	Montenegro, one of two republics in Yugoslavia, refused to join  
in the declaration of a state of emergency. Montenegrin 
authorities, who have criticized Milosevic's tactics in Kosovo, 
announced last month that they would be neutral in any conflict 
with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo's capital, Pristina, was tense but quiet early today.  
Several hundred frightened Albanians left Pristina on Tuesday, 
tugging children and a few hastily packed possessions with them.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Plunge / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell sharply today for a second day  
in a row as investors took profits following a tumble on Wall 
Street. The dollar slipped further against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 503.63, or  
3.14 percent, to end the day at 15,515.47. On Tuesday, the average 
closed down 359.68 points, or 2.20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 117.72 yen at late afternoon, down 0.81 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 118.00 yen overnight. The dollar ranged from 117.25 yen to 
118.52 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the market's fall was exacerbated  
by dealers rushing to reduce their positions ahead of Thursday, the 
last day of trading for delivery of shares in this fiscal year, 
which ends March 31, said Hideyuki Okoshi, deputy manager at Chuo 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic investors and dealers took profits on the market's  
recent rally following the overnight plunge in New York, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
dropped 218.68 points to 9,671.83 at Tuesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 30.12 points, or 2.38 percent, to 1,233.59. 
The TOPIX closed down 6.05 points, or 0.48 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 685.37 million shares, down from 827.34 million shares 
Tuesday. Retreaters overwhelmed advancers 863 to 318, while 147 
issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped back against the yen  
after briefly strengthening in reaction to rising tensions in 
Yugoslavia, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially weakened in New York on Tuesday as U.S.  
stocks tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana ordered airstrikes against  
Yugoslavia, saying Tuesday that efforts to win a negotiated 
settlement over the crisis in the rebellious province of Kosovo had 
failed. He did not hint when military operations would begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Other traders said no comment by Japan's head of the Finance  
Ministry's international bureau Haruhiko Kuroda, in contrast to 
Tuesday's dollar supportive comments by officials, triggered the 
dollar selling. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.16 yen, down  
from 128.96 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.755 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.695 percent,

<HEADLINE> Greenhouse Credits Now Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While no big fan of the Kyoto climate treaty,  
the DuPont Co., says it is on track to cut greenhouse gas emissions 
nearly in half by next year. But will the chemical maker get credit 
for the reductions if the treaty ever is ratified? 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate bill would guarantee that companies like DuPont would  
get credit for making voluntary reductions in climate-changing 
emissions if the treaty goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the legislation, which has bipartisan support, was  
viewed a few months ago as a shoo-in for passage, many 
environmentalists are having second thoughts. And much of the 
business community is shying away because companies fear support 
would mark them as being in favor of international accord on 
climate change reached at Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year a growing number of Fortune 500 companies,  
including DuPont, United Technologies, BP-Amoco and utilities such 
as American Electric Power have made commitments to voluntarily 
curtail the greenhouse emissions they produce -- mainly by increased 
efficiencies that reduce energy use and, in turn curtail carbon 
dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the 1997 Kyoto treaty, which requires greenhouse gas  
reductions, nowhere close to being ratified, these companies worry 
that by making early reductions they may, in fact, eventually be 
put at a competitive disadvantage. Companies that took no voluntary 
action would be able to start at a higher benchmark if the treaty 
is implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	``The least our government can do is to protect those companies  
who have decided on their own to make voluntary contributions to 
the general goal of climate mitigation,'' says Sen. John Chafee, 
R-R.I., a co-sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee, opening a Senate hearing on the bill today, said he was  
aware that some critics had suggested ``this is a dark plot ... a 
big profit scheme'' for industry. Such a view is unfounded, he 
countered. The alternative was ``to do nothing ... to begin dealing 
with what could turn out to be a substantial environmental and 
economic problem,'' said Chafee. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, when a similar bill was introduced,  
environmental groups across the spectrum lauded the initiative, 
which at that time was led by Sens. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and 
Connie Mack, R-Fla., as a sign of Congress would take some action 
on climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	Early action credit would spur companies to address climate  
change without the Kyoto treaty actually in force, the sponsors 
hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	But since then, more than a half dozen environmental groups  
including the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund, 
Natural Resources Defense Council and the Center for International 
Environmental Law have voiced opposition to the bill. For different 
reasons, business groups representing utilities, the petroleum 
industry, manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce have refused to 
endorse it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not supporting it,'' says John Novak, director of  
environmental activities for the Edison Electric Institute, 
although its members, the nation's electric utilities, have claimed 
to have prevented the release of millions of tons of greenhouse 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry sources say that behind the business community's  
opposition is a fear by companies that the bill is another step 
toward ``backdoor implementation'' of the Kyoto treaty already 
signed by Clinton but facing strong opposition in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberman views the early-credit legislation as an attempt to  
unite ``both sides of the global warming wars'' and spur companies 
to take voluntary actions on climate change that they otherwise 
might not. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Claussen, executive director of the Pew Center on Global  
Climate Change, says assurances are needed for companies to commit 
to greenhouse gas reductions, or else these same companies may end 
up at a disadvantage competitively when a treaty is put in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clearly not in our interest for companies that do the  
right thing by voluntarily attempting to slow the rate of 
greenhouse gases entering our atmosphere to be penalized and 
economically harmed for their efforts,'' says Claussen, whose group 
includes 22 major corporations that have pledged voluntary actions 
on climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense  
Fund, is among the legislation's strongest boosters, although he 
says the bill must require that emissions reductions be 
independently verified before credits are given to a company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way of getting the process started,'' said Krupp, who  
acknowledged that many of his colleagues in the environmental 
community have withdrawn their support. 
</P>
<P>
	Many environmentalists argue that it would allow companies to  
use unproven emission reductions to gain credits that eventually 
could be worth millions of dollars in an emissions trading market.

<HEADLINE> House OKs $180M for Its Committees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Tuesday approved $180 million for  
its committee operations after rejecting an attempt by the minority 
Democrats to win a larger share of the funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, passed 216-210, provides for staff salaries,  
equipment and other expenses for 19 House committees during the two 
years of the 106th Congress. The Appropriations Committee is funded 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, who hold 49 percent of the seats in the House,  
objected to a spending distribution where they get only 28 percent 
of the funds, saying they should get at least one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	``If congressional reform means anything, it needs fairness to  
the minority,'' said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans argued that a decade ago, when they were in the  
minority, they only received 20 percent of the funding, and said 
they were working toward a higher proportion for the minority. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic move to revise the bill to change the ratio was  
defeated, 218-205. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget is up 3 percent from the 105th Congress but down $40  
million from the 103th Congress, the last one Democrats controlled.

<HEADLINE> Companies Fined for Super Bowl Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two travel companies and a ticket broker who  
received thousands of dollars from customers for 1997 Super Bowl 
tickets the customers never received will pay $72,500 in 
restitution and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The reimbursements will go to consumers who bought 1997 Super  
Bowl travel packages and game tickets that were never delivered, 
Attorney General Tom Reilly said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement requires National Travel Vacations, a Norwood,  
Mass., tour operator, Sports World Tours Inc. of Portland, Ore., 
and Harvey Zuckerberg, a ticket broker operating out of Maine and 
California, to make restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 customers who purchased Super Bowl packages from  
National Travel Vacations will be reimbursed both the ticket price 
and the travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Most consumers have already been refunded the ticket price. The  
settlement, filed Wednesday in Suffolk Superior Court, also bars 
Zuckerberg from future ticket brokering in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1997 Super Bowl, the attorney general received  
hundreds of complaints from consumers who failed to receive 
promised tickets.

<HEADLINE>  Michelle Kwan Wins Early Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Michelle Kwan began a journey to her  
third title today with a superb performance in her qualifying round 
for the World Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing six triple jumps with ease and grace despite a cold  
for which she had been taking medication, Kwan easily won the 
qualifying group with marks from 5.6 to 5.9. She only did a 
triple-double combination and cut down another triple to a double 
lutz, but was otherwise solid in technique and exquisite in grace. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting her performance were two spiral sequences that  
emphasized the choreographic difference between her and the other 
competitiors. Kwan's marks were far ahead of the next best of the 
group, Vanessa Gusmeroli of France. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today, the second group featuring two of Kwan's top  
rivals, Maria Butyrskaya of Russia and Tatiana Malinina of 
Uzbekistan will be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Also the pairs title will be decided tonight, with Yelena  
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze seeking their second straight 
world title. 
</P>
<P>
	How Kwan would perform after having to take antibiotics was in  
doubt until she took off on her first jump, a triple lutz-double 
toe loop combination that was secure. Then, she went into a long 
back spiral with her leg almost vertical to the ice and her skate 
well above her head. 
</P>
<P>
	She now will have a day off before coming back for Friday's  
short program and repeating the long routine to ``Ariane''' on 
Saturday to gain her third world title. 
</P>
<P>
	Her coach, Frank Carroll, said they hadn't decided whether she  
would practice on her day off. Kwan said she is overcoming the 
cold, but feels only about ``80 percent in energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The qualification counts for 20 percent. A misstep or a missed  
jump could have been costly for Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
	But she now will be equal in points with the winner of the other  
group, no matter who it will be. The key consideration was that she 
would not be trailing anyone entering the short program which could 
cost a skater a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
	That situation happened in the men's event Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Elvis Stojko, the three-time world champion, finished third in  
the qualifying, followed by a third in Tuesday's short program. 
Previously, a third place in the short would still keep him in 
solid contention for his fourth world title. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he needs help -- a lot of it -- if he is to vault past the  
Russians ahead of him in Thursday's free skate. Both Russians won 
their group qualifications on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship is there for either Yevgeny Plushenko or Alexei  
Yagudin to lose. If either wins the long program -- or comes in 
second in the long to Stojko -- the title is his. 
</P>
<P>
	A few mistakes by both would be needed for Stojko to win.  
</P>
<P>
	Hoping for a mistake from the 16-year-old Plushenko would be  
risky. He was impressive with his jumps in the short, skating to 
``Hava Nagila.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin landed a bit off on his opening triple axel-triple toe  
loop combination, but stayed in form for the rest of the 
circus-themed routine, full of vivid and amusing gestures. 
</P>
<P>
	American champion Michael Weiss was fourth after a program that  
was less technically ambitious than the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Yagudin, Plushenko and Weiss, Stojko put a quad in his  
short program, but two-footed it. He characterized this year's 
championships as ``the toughest I've ever encountered by a 
hundredfold.'' He said that he had ``set up some very big 
expectations'' by assuming that his year-old groin injury would 
heal even as he competed. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians also took the lead in the ice dance event with Angelika  
Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov putting in a smooth performance to the 
Paso Double and Tango Romantica. That put them solidly in first for 
the portion, counting 20 percent of the total score. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a tie for second between Canada's Shae-Lynn Bourne and  
Victor Kraatz and France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat. 
Each ranked ahead of the other in one of the dances, although 
Anissina and Peizerat received a first place vote from the French 
judge.

<HEADLINE> Airline Pilots Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Pilot representatives from 11 airlines  
formed a coalition Wednesday to help protect their jobs as air 
carriers around the world forge closer relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``oneworld'' Cockpit Crew Coalition draws its name from the  
oneworld alliance of five airline companies formed earlier this 
year, which groups American, British Airways, Hong Kong-based 
Cathay Pacific, Canadian Airlines and Australia's Qantas. Finnair 
will join later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to those airlines, the pilots group also includes  
crew from Japan Airlines, Aerolineas Argentinas, Iberia, Lan Chile 
and LOT Polish Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliances are becoming increasingly common in the international  
aviation industry, where even leading airlines cannot cover the 
globe single-handedly. Now, labor is getting into the act because 
pilots fear their jobs may be outsourced to cheaper carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have pledged that we will support one another through any  
legal means in case of a job action,'' said Rich LaVoy, president 
of the Allied Pilots Association, which represents pilots at 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	That means that pilots would try to support strikes at other  
airlines by refusing to fly additional routes if asked to, but the 
legality of such actions is murky. 
</P>
<P>
	The outsourcing of jobs was the primary issue behind a sickout  
in February by American Airlines pilots, who were upset about how 
parent company AMR Corp. is integrating pilots from Reno Air. 
Nearly 6,700 flights were canceled, costing American an estimated 
$200 million to $225 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and AMR ended mediated talks without reaching  
agreement this week. They plan to resume talking in early April. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition also said Wednesday that safety is a concern under  
the globilization of airlines, partially because a passenger can 
buy a ticket on one airline, but climb onto the plane of another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through the coalition we'll work to harmonize safety standards  
for the flying public,'' said Bob Weeks, a captain with Canadian 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation that would bar airlines from using a single flight  
number to denote a flight that involves a change of aircraft is 
under consideration by Congress.

<HEADLINE> Research at VA Hospital Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The federal government suspended research at  
the nation's largest veterans hospital, saying officials failed to 
establish procedures to protect patients in clinical studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital on Wednesday fired its acting director of research  
and established an interim board to oversee efforts to restore more 
than 1,000 research projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension of the director, whose name was not released,  
follows five years of warnings that the West Los Angeles VA 
Healthcare Center failed to establish proper review boards to 
oversee research projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension of research, which came Monday, could affect  
hundreds of researchers conducting more than 1,000 studies 
involving humans and animals at the center and its affiliated 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's really no excuse for it. I really have no defense,''  
said Dr. Dean C. Norman, acting chief of staff at the hospital. 
``The institution should have complied with this. This was the 
direct responsibility of the person in charge of research. That 
person has been removed as of today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators said there was no evidence that patients or animals  
involved in research were harmed in any way. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a preventive measure taken after the hospital failed to  
address repeated warnings that it had not complied with patient 
protection rules, said Dr. John R. Feussner, chief of research and 
development at the Veterans Department in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The orders are not expected to affect ordinary patient care at  
the 1,056-bed hospital or its clinics, all of which serve an area 
with more than 1 million veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Research could resume in as little as 30 days if the hospital  
acts quickly to put proper oversight procedures in place, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems included the failure to ensure that each research  
review board included a person with a non-medical background to 
represent the patients' interests. Inspectors found problems with 
the hospital's informed-consent procedure, according to National 
Institutes for Health documents obtained Wednesday through the 
Freedom of Information Act. NIH is a branch of the Department of 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital also did not have procedures guaranteeing that  
problems involving risks to patients were promptly reported to the 
review board. 
</P>
<P>
	NIH officials declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``The science at this site and the scientists and clinical  
researchers at this site are outstanding,'' Feussner said. ``I do 
not see this as a failure of the researchers, I see this as a 
failure of the management process.''

<HEADLINE> McDougal: Husband Made Up Stories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal testified today that her  
former husband, now dead, made up stories implicating President 
Clinton in Whitewater to appease prosecutors and win a lighter 
prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying at her trial for refusing to answer questions before  
the Whitewater grand jury, Mrs. McDougal said James McDougal urged 
her to tell what she called ``stories'' about the president, 
including that Clinton knew about a fraudulent $300,000 loan to his 
Whitewater business partners, the McDougals. Mrs. McDougal said she 
never discussed the loan with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But her ex-husband warned her, ``If you don't tell this story,  
you're going to jail,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDougal, who at first refused to cooperate with Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr, changed his mind after being convicted of 
fraud, Mrs. McDougal said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me this is something he had to do because he did not  
want to die in jail,'' she testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing up to 84 years in prison, he was sentenced to three years  
because of his cooperation with prosecutors. He died in federal 
prison in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said she listened as her ex-husband tried out  
different versions of his ``outlandish'' story that Clinton 
discussed the loan briefly with him and former municipal judge 
David Hale, who made the federally backed $300,00 loan. Hale also 
has said Clinton knew about the loan, but Mrs. McDougal maintains 
he lied, too. 
</P>
<P>
	She recalled McDougal saying as he rehearsed the story, ``I have  
got a whole new twist, what do you think about the way I say this, 
does this sound believable?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal alleged that at one point her ex-husband suggested  
she could get a deal with Starr's office if she simply testified 
that Clinton was present for a discussion about the $300,000 loan. 
``If you come in and say this you can write your own ticket,'' she 
quoted McDougal as telling her. 
</P>
<P>
	During four hours of testimony Tuesday, Mrs. McDougal  
occasionally dabbed tears from her eyes as she testified that her 
husband's mental illness was the undoing of their marriage and 
business, and ultimately led to the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Mark Geragos, said the testimony Tuesday was a  
``cathartic'' experience for his client. She has said she refused 
to answer federal grand jury questions because she feared 
retaliation from prosecutor Kenneth Starr if he didn't like what 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way she was going to get out the true story here was  
to tell it in a courtroom,'' Geragos said outside the courthouse. 
Mrs. McDougal is charged with obstruction of justice and criminal 
contempt of court for refusing to answer grand jury questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal and her late ex-husband were partners with the  
Clintons in the Whitewater real estate venture in northern 
Arkansas. The McDougals and then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker were convicted 
of business fraud in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, she refused to answer grand jury questions about the  
Clintons and spent 18 months in jail for civil contempt. She again 
refused to answer the questions in April last year and was indicted 
on two counts of criminal contempt and one count of obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking directly at jurors and choking back tears, Mrs. McDougal  
said Tuesday her ex-husband was ``a control person,'' had a temper 
and experienced mood swings, but would not concede at first that he 
had a problem. She said he suffered from manic depression and had 
serious health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors showed no expression. Some took notes; others rocked  
in their chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal described how she was in awe of her husband,  
trusted him and did not realize until their marriage hit the skids 
and their Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan was being investigated 
by bank examiners that he had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	When McDougal asked her to sign a $300,000 loan to her from  
Hale's Capital Management Services, she did not question him, she 
said. Hale, a prosecution witness in the 1996 trial, has claimed 
that Clinton pressured him to make the fraudulent loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale has served 21 months of a 28-month sentence for defrauding  
the Small Business Administration through Capital Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal described how James McDougal, who also had worked  
on Clinton's gubernatorial staff in Arkansas, ``loved Bill Clinton 
very much.'' But she said her husband became angry with Clinton 
after the thrift failed and McDougal was charged in the late 1980s 
with banking violations.

<HEADLINE> Report: Renault, Nissan Near Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Renault chairman Louis Schweitzer will arrive in  
Japan on Thursday to sign a deal with Nissan Motor Co. that 
includes his company taking a 35 percent stake in the ailing 
Japanese carmaker, a news report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer will sign the $5 billion deal on Saturday afternoon  
in Tokyo, after Nissan's board of directors meets here to discuss 
Renault's offer, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported without citing 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan spokesman Masataka Saito refused to comment on the  
report. A spokeswoman for Renault would not confirm if Schweitzer 
was coming to Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault made a formal offer to Nissan to buy a stake on March  
16, after talks between Japan's second-largest automaker and 
Germany's DaimlerChrysler AG broke down. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has sought a foreign partner to help it write off its  
tremendous debt of at least $18 billion and return to 
profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Renault will dispatch one of its vice  
presidents to assume Nissan's No. 2 spot and guide the company's 
restructuring efforts, the Nihon Keizai said. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, Nissan president Yoshikazu Hanawa will take a seat  
on Renault's board, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its stake in Nissan, Renault will also take possession  
of about 22 percent of Nissan Diesel, a truckmaker subsidiary, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The past year has seen a wave of big multinational deals in the  
auto industry. Ford said in January it was buying the passenger car 
operations of Volvo AB, Daimler-Benz AG bought Chrysler Corp. last 
year and General Motors Corp. is negotiating with Saab Automobile 
AB to buy the half of Saab that it doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan ranks No. 7 in the world in production of cars and trucks  
and Renault is 11th, according to industry analysts at Ward's 
Automotive International.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes Ads Feature Noted Artists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pablo Picasso appears to be tightening door  
bolts, Salvador Dali operates a welding torch and Vincent van Gogh 
inspects the instrument panel in new ads for the flagship cars from 
Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
	Images of the artists as assembly line workers are appearing in  
ads that began running last week for the new S-Class cars from 
Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. that went on display this month 
in dealer showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign provides the latest example of how advertisers are  
using the images of deceased celebrities to draw attention to their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, movie images of John Wayne were featured in  
beer ads years after his death and a soft drink commercial featured 
clips of the late Humphrey Bogart and Jimmy Cagney. Fred Astaire's 
widow gave permission to an appliance maker to use film that made 
it appear Astaire was dancing with vacuum cleaners as props rather 
than a cane and coat rack. 
</P>
<P>
	Using revered figures can help advertisers strike a bond of  
shared appreciation with potential customers, but it has also been 
criticized as crass exploitation of people no longer able to speak 
for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, Mercedes is drawing from the world of fine art as  
it pitches its top-of-the-line cars, which start at $69,700. The 
S-Class accounted for about 9 percent of the record 170,245 
Mercedes cars sold in the United States last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to convey the meticulous attention to detail and  
craftsmanlike manufacturing skills that go into our vehicles,'' 
said Joe Eberhardt, a marketing executive for the Montvale, 
N.J.-based importer, a division of Germany's DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	The artists are ``immediately recognizable symbols for what we  
wanted to communicate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 30-second and one-minute versions, Mercedes makes it look  
like the world's best-known artists are working in its assembly 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Film of Picasso's face was superimposed over that of an actor  
who was using a wrench to tighten bolts in the door frame of a new 
car. The same for Andy Warhol, who appears to be observing the 
action from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad uses actors resembling Dali, who poses as a welder, and  
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, who pokes around in the engine 
compartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rembrandt van Rijn appears to be inspecting the underside of the  
cars, while van Gogh checks out the instrument panel and Leonardo 
da Vinci drives a finished car away from the assembly line. In each 
case, drawings of their faces done in the artist's style were 
superimposed over actors. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't the first time Mercedes has looked to the past for its  
advertising. In a campaign called ``Born Too Soon,'' it showed 
celebrities like Bing Crosby and Errol Flynn as young men with 
their early Mercedes cars. It has used classic songs in ads like 
Marlene Dietrich's recording of ``Falling in Love Again'' and 
counterculture heroine Janis Joplin's recording of ``Lord Won't You 
Buy Me a Mercedes-Benz?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes is also running a second print and TV ad series that  
show Ernest Hemingway, Jackie Robinson and the Parthenon, 
describing them simply as an author, a ballplayer and a building. 
The S-Class is also shown, identified as a car. ``Sometimes words 
can be hopelessly inadequate,'' the ads say. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials declined to say how much it cost to make or  
run the ads which will run on the NCAA basketball playoffs this 
weekend. They said they secured permission from the estates of the 
artists to use their images. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads were produced by Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS before it was fired  
last month over differences with Mercedes-Benz involving management 
of the account and the process of developing advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes has since hired the agency Merkley Newman Harty to  
create its advertising but the new agency's first work is not 
expected until midsummer or early fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrific conclusion to the relationship we have had  
with the client over the past five years,'' said Lee Garfinkel, 
chairman and chief creative officer for Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS.

<HEADLINE> Tensions Boiling Over at HUD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bureaucrats abandoned the polite language they  
normally use in public when one of the nation's top housing 
officials used a Senate panel hearing to call a government 
investigator reviewing his department ``destructive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Housing Secretary Saul Ramirez said Tuesday that the  
Department of Housing and Urban Development has been working hard 
to root out waste and mismanagement and no longer deserves being 
labeled a ``high-risk'' agency. 
</P>
<P>
	He said department Inspector General Susan Gaffney has taken a  
``destructive, attack approach'' to HUD despite its improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	``HUD simply has not been treated in an evenhanded manner,'' he  
told members of the Senate Banking Committee's panel on housing and 
transportation. ``The perception that there's chaos at HUD is 
really erroneous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gaffney called Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo ``a very  
ambitious man'' who sees her work as an obstacle to his political 
future rather than someone who simply wants to help repair the 
department's tattered reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He obviously has higher ambitions,'' Gaffney told the Senate  
Banking Committee's panel on housing and transportation. ``I think 
he looks at me as a threat, as a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a sometimes acrimonious hearing, Gaffney said HUD has  
made improvements, but staffing cuts and an overly ambitious, 
sweeping attempt at management reform have stumbled -- and may have 
led to more waste. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD has been a favorite target of suspicion by some Republicans  
in Congress, who see it as an example of big, inept and wasteful 
government agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current state of HUD operations is of great concern to  
this subcommittee,'' Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., said. ``Before 
Congress authorizes any additional funding, we must determine the 
level of risk at HUD.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials, however, are quick to claim  
that HUD's designation as a ``high risk'' department stemmed from 
the influence peddling scandals of the Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez said the department has no objections to independent  
reviews by Gaffney's office or the General Accounting Office, 
Congress' investigative arm. But he called the ``high risk'' label 
``somewhat arbitrary'' and ``indefensible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A GAO report released Tuesday said HUD has made credible  
progress, and that it was ``not realistic to have expected that HUD 
would have fully or even substantially implemented the reform 
efforts and seen evidence of their success in the two years since 
our last report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GAO investigator Judy England-Joseph said it's too soon to tell  
whether reforms are working, but the department appears to be going 
in the right direction. ``I'd like to see them stay the course,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Phil Gramm said he wanted to find out whether  
political pressure from the Clinton administration derailed planned 
audits of housing programs to uncover possible criminal wrongdoing 
in Baltimore, New Orleans and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have intensive oversight hearings on this  
matter,'' said Gramm, R-Texas, the chairman of the Senate Banking 
Committee. ``We're going to ask for all documents, all memos, all 
computer records related to the decision not to undertake these 
criminal audits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney said HUD officials told her that any federal  
investigation could spark problems because all three cities were 
headed by black Democratic mayors. Several black leaders and the 
U.S. Conference of Mayors criticized the process used to choose the 
cities at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The audits were never performed, Gaffney said. Investigators  
later refocused the probe and considered conducting investigations 
into housing programs in several other areas, including North Texas 
and Long Island, she said.

<HEADLINE> Privacy Issue Scraps New Bank Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bending to a public outcry over privacy  
concerns, bank regulators have scrapped proposed anti-money 
laundering rules that would have tracked the transaction patterns 
of bank customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Know Your Customer'' rules were put out for public comment  
in December by four federal banking agencies. Since then, the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. alone has received some 225,000 
e-mail messages and letters, nearly all opposing the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates, conservative groups, ordinary people and the  
nation's bankers have complained that the rules would turn every 
bank teller into a spy for Big Brother. They maintained the rules 
were unconstitutional and would violate prohibitions against 
unreasonable search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the Senate joined the deluge of criticism,  
voting 88-0 to express support for a measure directing the 
regulators to drop the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Tuesday after agency officials voted at  
open meetings, the four agencies said they had received ``an 
unprecedented number'' of comments protesting the proposal on 
privacy grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations would have required banks to verify their  
customers' identities, know where their money comes from and 
determine their normal pattern of transactions. The current 
requirements for banks to report any ``suspicious'' transactions to 
law enforcement authorities would have been expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and bankers reacted swiftly and positively to the  
regulators' action. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas, for example, said he was ``glad to know that there are 
regulators who will listen to real people and walk away from a bad 
idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Ogilvie, executive vice president of the American Bankers  
Association, said the rules would have put banks ``in the untenable 
position of invading their customers' privacy and potentially could 
have eroded public confidence in the banking industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators' decision to withdraw the proposal ``does not  
diminish in any manner our long-standing support'' for other 
federal laws designed to fight money laundering, the agencies' 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was issued by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board,  
the Office of Thrift Supervision and the office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency, which oversees nationally chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Money launderers should not be encouraged because the ``Know  
Your Customer'' rules are being scrapped, a senior Treasury 
Department official said. The official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity, said the department is still engaged in ``vigorous 
enforcement'' of existing rules prohibiting money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules were designed to combat money laundering  
techniques used by drug traffickers and other criminals to hide 
illegal profits. Money laundering, which is a major concern of law 
enforcement officials, reached an estimated $30 billion in this 
country last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Laundering includes the use of wire transfers and bank drafts as  
well as ``smurfing,'' the practice of breaking down transactions 
into smaller amounts that do not have to be reported under the Bank 
Secrecy Act.

<HEADLINE> Novartis Edges Merck in Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Swiss pharmaceutical maker Novartis was the  
world's leading seller of prescription drugs last year, edging out 
Merck &AMP; Co., according to a report released Tuesday by market data 
firm IMS health. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis, which makes the top-selling organ rejection drug  
cyclosporine, had $10.639 billion in drug sales in 1998, compared 
to Merck's $10.635 billion, IMS said. Novartis' sales rose 5 
percent last year, aided by strong performance of its anti-fungal 
drug Lamisil and cancer drug Aredia. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based Merck's sales increased 8 percent  
last year, largely from rising sales of the cholesterol drug Zocor 
and the hypertension drug Cozaar. 
</P>
<P>
	British-based drug maker Glaxo Wellcome's sales fell by 1  
percent last year as the company finished third with $10.539 
billion in drug sales. Pfizer's sales rose 21 percent, partly on 
the performance of the blockbuster impotence drug Viagra, as the 
New York-based company moved up two spots to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	How tough was it to move up in the rankings? Warner Lambert's  
sales soared 37 percent, but the company moved only from 16th to 
15th place. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top ten, in descending order, were:  
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, American Home Products, 
Roche, Eli Lilly and SmithKline Beecham. 
</P>
<P>
	The ten leading drug companies accounted for about 36 percent of  
the total drug market, IMS Health said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, global drug sales increased by 7 percent last year, a  
slightly more than the 6.6 percent growth in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Bigotry Measure Defeated in House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Condemning all forms of racism and bigotry  
would normally make for an easy vote in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	But such a measure went down to defeat Tuesday, with Democrats  
and Republicans accusing each other of sinister political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	With almost all Democrats either voting against the bill or  
``present,'' the resolution stating that the House ``denounces all 
those who practice or promote racism, anti-Semitism, ethnic 
prejudice or religious intolerance'' failed to come up with the 
two-thirds majority needed for passage under special House rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 254 in favor, 152 against and 24 voting  
``present.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats charged that the GOP leadership, without consulting  
them, substituted the general language for a Democratic measure 
that would have specifically condemned the Council of Conservative 
Citizens, a St. Louis-based group that critics say has a racist 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	This ``embarrassing substitute,'' said Rep. John Conyers,  
D-Mich., is ``a cover for those Republicans who don't want to 
condemn the CCC because so many Republican leaders have been 
associated with this racist group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Rep. Bob Barr,  
R-Ga., have addressed the group, but have denied knowing of their 
racist statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., the only black Republican in Congress  
and chief sponsor of the GOP bill, said singling out one group 
would ``commit a crime of omission by giving a pass to other groups 
that espouse prejudice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watts said after the vote that he was ``shocked that these  
Democrats decided to play partisan political games with the race 
issue. As someone who has faced the cruel reality of racism in my 
life, I am deeply offended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Poverty Law Center identifies 537 hate groups and  
the GOP language would condemn all of them, Watts said. The House 
Judiciary Committee put out a statement saying it would cover not 
only the CCC but such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, Aryan Nations, 
National Association for the Advancement of White People and the 
Knights of Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr said he condemned the racist positions of the CCC and  
accused the Democrats of hypocrisy for not criticizing a fellow 
Democrat for addressing the same group. ``Practice a little 
consistency,'' said Barr, alleging that Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, D-Mo., spoke to the group. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a CCC spokesman denied that, as did Democratic  
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The original Democratic resolution was offered by Rep. Bob  
Wexler, D-Fla., who said the GOP version was a ``sham'' that was 
``designed only to derail our resolution and if successful hand the 
CCC an unconscionable victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CCC Chief Executive Officer Gordon Baum, in a statement last

<HEADLINE> Brand Vows To Hit Boards Vs. MSU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Elton Brand promised his Duke coaches and  
teammates four months ago he would work harder to get into better 
shape. He plans on keeping another pledge against Michigan State in 
the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I am going to rebound,'' said the 6-foot-8, 270-pound  
Brand, who was dominated on the offensive glass against the 
Spartans in a six-point Duke victory in early December. ``I'm sure 
the discrepancy on the boards will be a little different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was more than a little disparity for a team coach Mike  
Krzyzewski said has developed into one of his best-ever rebounding 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans outrebounded the Blue Devils 41-25 in that Great  
Eight game in Chicago on Dec. 2, including 25-5 on the offensive 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really crushed us on the boards,'' Shane Battier said.  
``Elton wasn't in very good shape when we played last time. Coach 
really got on him and he got on the treadmill and he had a great 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who had three rebounds in that game, was asked if he  
remembered getting any rebounds at all against the Spartans (33-4). 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe one rebound, half a rebound, a tip,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Three games later, Brand was benched by Krzyzewski in a move  
that eventually turned the sophomore's season around. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost three months later, Brand returned to Chicago to play  
DePaul, this time as a star. He had 20 points and 14 rebounds in a 
32-point win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was working so hard to try to be the best, but I was  
tired,'' Brand said of the Michigan State game. ``I missed two 
wide-open layups sprinting down the court. I had the same 
opportunity (against DePaul) and I threw it in with one hand and 
coach was like, `Do you remember that Michigan State game?' Sure 
enough, I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski didn't need to look at the tape again this week to  
recall Michigan State's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``They rebound offensively the best because they made a  
commitment to it -- and they have the players,'' he said. ``They 
keep fresh people in, too. They go eight or nine people deep, and 
as a result they don't have to pace themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke point guard William Avery expects the Spartans to try to  
set the pace on the boards early in Saturday's national semifinal 
game in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to be very hungry and they'll probably feel  
like they can really pound us on the offensive glass,'' Avery said. 
``We just have to do a better job of rebounding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski cautioned against paying too much attention to a game  
played four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is relevant for both of us because we got a chance  
face-to-face to see that `He is that tall' or `He is that big,''' 
Krzyzewski said. ``But we've two different teams. Both of us are so 
much more improved than we were at that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, Krzyzewski doesn't expect Michigan State star  
Mateen Cleaves to shoot 3-for-17 from the field, saying the 
Spartans' offense is flowing much better than months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not forced to put up some of the shots he put up against  
us in December,'' Krzyzewski said. ``Those shots now would be 
passes to somebody. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has great vision in traffic. If you are crossing the street  
in Time Square and you need a safety guard, he'll get you across 
the street unhurt.''

<HEADLINE> Dead Actor Was Due in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A young actor who apparently committed suicide  
by hanging himself in a motel room had been arrested for cocaine 
possession and was supposed to be in court the day his body was 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	David Strickland, 29, who appeared on NBC's ``Suddenly Susan''  
and in the new movie ``Forces of Nature,'' was arrested Oct. 31 for 
possession of cocaine and pleaded no contest on Dec. 21, court 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
	He was put on 36-month probation and ordered into  
rehabilitation. He was to have appeared in a Los Angeles court 
Monday for a progress report. 
</P>
<P>
	His body was discovered early that day by an Oasis Motel  
employee, said police Lt. Wayne Petersen. Angela Cheung, an 
attorney who was representing Strickland, declined comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said there was nothing to indicate foul play. No note was  
found, there was no indication of drugs, and Strickland did not 
place any long-distance calls from his room, Petersen said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found nothing to indicate anything but a suicide,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland played Todd, a music critic in NBC's ``Suddenly  
Susan.'' Warner Bros. and NBC said production of the show was being 
halted indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am devastated by the loss of my best friend whose talent and  
humor graced all who knew him,'' series star Brooke Shields said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was born in Glen Cove, N.Y., and moved to Pacific  
Palisades near Los Angeles while he was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	He later appeared of ``Roseanne'' and ``Dave's World.'' He also  
had recurring roles on ``Sister, Sister'' and ``Mad About You,'' 
playing Paul Reiser's co-worker.

<HEADLINE> Two Securities Firms Merge in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Two second-tier Japanese brokerages plan to merge  
next year in a deal that will create the country's fourth-largest 
brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of New Japan Securities Co. and Wako Securities  
Co. pools a combined $79.85 billion in assets, putting the merged 
company into the league of industry leaders Nomura Securities Co., 
Daiwa Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The two firms plan to reduce their work force to around 5,000  
from the current combined 7,197 employees, but did not specify a 
timetable. They will also slash the number of branch offices in 
Japan to no more than 100 from the current 127. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal strengthens the hand of the Industrial Bank of Japan  
Ltd. at a time when Japanese financial companies are scrambling to 
strike up alliances as the industry deregulates. 
</P>
<P>
	IBJ will control 25 percent of the newly created company  
directly and through affiliates, up from its current 4.9 percent 
stake in New Japan and 4.7 percent share of Wako. 
</P>
<P>
	New Japan and Wako said their successor company will take over  
the IBJ group's retail securities business throughout Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The heads of the two bokers said at a news conference that they  
plan to have the as-yet-unnamed merged entity turn a profit in its 
first year of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies had posted pretax losses for the last business  
year, which ended March 31, 1998. But they denied being forced into 
a merger by the IBJ, saying it was a product of their own 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to carry out the merger while we were in a position  
of strength,'' said Wako President Masaaki Sugishita, who will 
become chairman of the new firm. 
</P>
<P>
	New Japan President Tadashi Kawaguchi will take the post of  
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, New Japan Securities will pull out of overseas markets by  
closing subsidiaries in London, Hong Kong, New York and 
Switzerland. It will also shut representative offices in Frankfurt, 
Beijing, Shanghai and Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts welcomed the move, but said the new company will face a  
tough environment in which to grow as commissions drop from intense 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If New Japan and Wako can carry out further restructuring  
measures, that will boost their profitability to some extent,'' 
said Hideyasu Ban, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, adding the key is 
whether they can boost revenue in their combined retail operations.

<HEADLINE> CBS, TNN Combine of Documentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Minutes into the 13-part ``Century of  
Country'' documentary, it's clear how broad an undertaking it is to 
even define country music, much less tell its story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Country music is the same thing as the blues,'' Waylon  
Jennings opines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Country music is contemporary jazz,'' singer Ray Price  
declares. 
</P>
<P>
	Harlan Howard, the great country music songwriter (``Busted,''  
``I Fall to Pieces''), offers this: ``Basically, it's the people's 
music. We really do deal with divorces and tragedies and so forth. 
And sometimes people think we're kind of hokey. But country music 
is here and it always will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on previews of two episodes -- one covering pioneers like  
Jimmie Rodgers and The Carter Family and the other on bluegrass and 
Western swing -- ``Century of Country'' captures the wide scope of 
country music and celebrates it. 
</P>
<P>
	The documentary touches on women in country music, rockabilly,  
bluegrass, Western swing, the Grand Ole Opry and honky-tonk music. 
Many current stars are interviewed, and the lives of greats like 
Hank Williams Sr., Jimmie Rodgers and Patsy Cline are covered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nashville Network will air the first of 13 weekly one-hour  
segments of ``Century of Country'' at 8 p.m. EST Wednesday (March 
31). The host is actor James Garner and CBS newsman Bob Schieffer 
narrates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Century of Country'' marks the first collaboration between TNN  
and CBS News. Westinghouse Electric Corp., which owns CBS, bought 
TNN in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had more fun,'' said Schieffer, host of the weekly news show  
``Face the Nation'' on CBS. ``Maybe because it was such a break 
after covering Monica Lewinsky and Ken Starr. It was like a 
vacation to me. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I really learned a lot. They have gone out and interviewed  
everybody that you ever heard of, and some that you've never heard 
of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the things Schieffer learned: ``Apparently Jimmie Rodgers,  
who was The Singing Brakeman, was the first person to yodel,'' he 
said. ``You would think it came from ranches or something Western. 
</P>
<P>
	``But apparently he heard some Swedish guy yodel,'' Schieffer  
said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	The series is a step forward for TNN, whose claim to be THE  
country music cable station has slipped since it started showing a 
new version of ``Roller Derby'' and reruns of ``The Waltons'' and 
``Dukes of Hazzard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if you're looking for a critical viewpoint of country music,  
wait until the Bravo cable channel reruns the three episodes of its 
excellent ``Naked Nashville.'' TNN has always been a Nashville 
booster rather than a critic, and ``Century of Country'' sidesteps 
anything that could dampen the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The shows still are a lot of fun, however. For example, it's  
hard to resist the enthusiasm of singer Marty Stuart. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can wear cool clothes,'' Stuart says in the opening  
episode, ``Celebration of Country.'' ``You can wear your hair 
goofy. Girls like you. You get applause. You get to live this nomad 
lifestyle. And you get paid for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the segment on bluegrass, 18-year-old mandolin player  
Chris Thile pays tribute to late bluegrass founder Bill Monroe, 
then reveals he's working on combining bluegrass and classical 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find there's an amazing energy in Bach that is kind of like  
some of the stuff that Bill Monroe was coming out with,'' Thile 
said. ``I wrote a song where I try to get some of that same energy 
with the bluegrass background in it -- sort of a `grassical' song.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Skaggs tries to explain how exciting Bill Monroe and the  
Blue Grass Boys were in their heyday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they were on the stage it sounded like the Beatles were  
on stage,'' Skaggs said. ``I hear these country people screaming at 
the top of their voices hearing this new music that no one had ever 
heard before. It was a new sound, it was a new day for this 
music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schieffer said he came into the assignment thinking he knew  
something about country music from a lifetime of listening. He saw 
Ernest Tubb perform when he was a boy in Fort Worth, Texas, then 
became a fan of Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
	The assignment showed him he had much to learn.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you have just the vaguest interest in country music, you'll  
find this 13 hours just fascinating,'' Schieffer said. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Curbs Kosovo Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With NATO bombardment looming, Yugoslav  
authorities confiscated Western television transmission equipment 
today and reporters fled the troubled province of Kosovo for safer 
ground after being threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	A TV transmission facility at a Belgrade hotel was shut down by  
government officials who ordered personnel to stand facing a wall 
as they took equipment that enabled networks to file reports, said 
Eason Jordan, president of CNN International. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility was operated by the European Broadcasting Union and  
used by CNN and other U.S. television networks, including ABC, CBS 
and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks turned to Yugoslavian state-run television to transmit  
taped and live reports. However, CNN's Christiane Amanpour noted 
that she would be subject to censorship, and the ability to 
transmit reports as often as CNN wanted would be curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leadership is hunkering down and, frankly, doesn't see  
outside journalists as helpful right now,'' Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shutdown also affected Associated Press Television News, but  
it was able to transmit reports through the state-run television, 
said Sandy MacIntyre, managing editor of APTN's field operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some reporters were leaving Kosovo as the situation deteriorated  
there, said CBS spokeswoman Sandra Genelius. CBS was waiting to 
decide whether its reporter, Allen Pizzey, would stay, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN's Brent Sadler reported being threatened by officials when  
he and some colleagues transmitted a report today from the Kosovo 
capital of Pristina. One of the gun-toting men held two bullets in 
his hand, pointed at CNN personnel and said, ``these bullets are 
for you,'' Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadler finished his report anyway and when he emerged from the  
facility, all four tires on his vehicle had been slashed. Sadler 
was staying in Kosovo, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, CNN reporter Christopher Burns left Yugoslavia after  
authorities told CNN that his life may be in danger. Officials have 
been denouncing CNN on Yugoslavian television as ``a factory of 
lies'' and ran a picture of Burns, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a dreadful situation,'' he said. CNN is particularly  
susceptible to trouble because its reports are telecast in 
Yugoslavia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	APTN reporters have elected to stay in Kosovo, concerned that  
trying to leave at night would be too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are acutely aware of the potential danger,'' MacIntyre  
said. ``At the moment, they are remaining in their temporary 
offices.''

<HEADLINE> D-Backs' Bell Looking Good at 2B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- The number two looms big for Jay Bell this  
spring. He's getting more and more comfortable at second base, and 
he's firmly entrenched as the No. 2 hitter in the Arizona 
Diamondbacks' batting order. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the results for the 33-year-old infielder have been  
terrific. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jay's had a great spring,'' manager Buck Showalter said.  
``He's come in physically probably in as good a shape as he's ever 
been in his career. He's had as many at-bats as anybody, probably 
by design, to get him as comfortable as possible at second base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Bell went 3-for-3 with a three-run home run and  
scored four runs in a 14-6 victory over the Anaheim Angels. On 
Wednesday, he was 2-for-4, including a double, with three RBIs, in 
a 7-6, 12-inning loss to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	He also turned a slick double play on a ground ball to third  
baseman Matt Williams. In 16 games, he's hitting .385 in 44 at-bats 
with nine strikeouts and a team-high 13 walks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, the key to spring training is building an approach  
and staying with it as much as you can, finding something that 
works,'' Bell said. ``Hopefully, I can maintain the approach I have 
right now because it's a good one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year was not a good one for Bell. He signed a five-year,  
$34 million contract that was widely viewed as too generous, and 
the spotlight was squarely on him through Arizona's expansion 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He wound up hitting .251, his second-lowest average in a decade.  
While he had 20 home runs, one short of his career best, and a 
career-high 81 walks, his career-high 129 strikeouts and 19 errors 
got more attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell was moved around in the batting order last year, ending up  
more often either hitting sixth or second. Now he's certain to be 
the No. 2 hitter, the same spot he had in most of his eight seasons 
with Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things we talked about over the offseason was  
whether I was going to hit two or six,'' Bell said. ``Buck's pretty 
comfortable with me hitting two, and I'm comfortable hitting two. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hitting No. 6 you have the opportunity to drive in runs, you  
have the opportunity to be the hero a little more. That's always a 
lot of fun. Everybody who steps up to the plate wants to be a hero. 
But runs scored are equally as important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell hopes to cut down his strikeouts by not swinging for the  
fence as often. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can score a lot with two outs, so my approach is  
going to be to not try to get a quick run with two outs and nobody 
on,'' he said. ``I'm just going to try to get on base with the guys 
behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 15 games to go last season, the Diamondbacks shifted Bell  
from shortstop to second base to clear the way for Tony Batista. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year it was a perfect opportunity the last two weeks to  
feel comfortable over there,'' Bell said. ``I was able to come to 
spring training feeling like I understood the position a little 
more. It's nice to be able to dive for the ball and not have to 
jump back up to your feet to make the throw. You can just make an 
easy throw from your knees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect him to divulge any details on the approach to  
hitting that is working so well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a trade secret,'' he said with a smile.

<HEADLINE> Kiwi Air Lines Grounded by FAA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Federal regulators ordered Kiwi  
International Air Lines to stop flying Wednesday, saying the tiny 
discount carrier was ``unable or unwilling'' to fly with top safety 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration also ordered the  
Newark-based carrier, which filed for bankruptcy Tuesday, to 
surrender its operating certificate and cancel its six-city flight 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kiwi is unable or unwilling to provide service with the  
highest possible degree of safety,'' the FAA said in a letter to 
the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said Kiwi's planes were in ``unairworthy condition,''  
that it failed to adequately maintain aircraft and could not 
operate safely without constant monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankruptcy lawyers told a judge the airline would meet Thursday  
with the FAA to try to get it to rescind the order. The airline 
also has 10 days to appeal the FAA's decision to the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's grounding of Kiwi comes a day after the U.S.  
Department of Transportation threatened to shut down the airline in 
three weeks if it didn't come up with a better management plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, Kiwi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,  
declaring nearly $11 million in debt, and said Pan American 
Airlines Inc., the former commercial airline that now flies 
charters, would give it $3 million to allow it to fly its current 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rosemary Gambardella on Wednesday  
scheduled a Monday hearing on Pan Am's petition to buy Kiwi's 
assets. Pan Am, which bases seven planes in Portsmouth, N.H., 
remains ``very interested'' in acquiring Kiwi, Kiwi CEO Gene 
Gillespie said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi planned to meet Thursday with the FAA to try to get it to  
rescind the order, company spokesman Rob Kulat said. The airline 
also has 10 days to appeal the FAA's decision to the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi pilot Robert Link said he was not surprised by the  
grounding, blaming a series of poor managers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem is we were undercapitalized from day one  
and therefore we were handicapped,'' Link said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the FAA revoked Kiwi's flight certificate,  
although the airline has had three other shutdowns in its short 
life, which Kiwi maintained stemmed from paperwork disputes with 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent one came during the winter of 1996 after the  
airline entered its first bankruptcy. It resumed scheduled flights 
in January 1997 while still under Chapter 11 protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA increased its surveillance of the strapped airline early  
this year, spokesman Jim Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its letter to Kiwi, the FAA said Kiwi was operating with only  
three planes; the airline had said it was working with four. The 
company two of the five Boeing 727 planes it lists as available are 
out of service, one because of the company's failure to pay for 
maintenance and the other because of its repossession by a British 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also said high management turnover has affected the  
safety of Kiwi's operations. Seven managers at the airline have 
resigned in the past two months, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi failed to notice an excessive oil leak in one of its  
planes' engines and failed twice to repair it properly, the FAA 
said. It also flew eight flights in March on a plane that had a 
leak in its exhaust duct that was scorching a panel on one of its 
wings, the agency said. FAA inspectors notified Kiwi of the leak 
but the airline failed to repair it, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi then repaired the leak and declared the plane ready for  
service, but the FAA found that the leak remained, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi spokesman Rob Kulat said the problems the FAA listed are  
minor and not unusual for most airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We maintain a perfect safety record,'' Kulat said. ``We've  
flown over 8 million people without incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Newark International Airport on Wednesday, passenger Laura  
Kennedy learned that her 5:50 p.m. flight to Orlando and West Palm 
Beach, Fla., was canceled. Kennedy, 22, said she had driven five 
hours from Elmira, N.Y., to catch the flight, which originally had 
been scheduled to leave at 11:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm stuck,'' said Kennedy. ``I had no idea there was even an  
issue with Kiwi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continental Airlines has agreed to allow Kiwi ticketholders to  
fly standby until April 1. Confirmed tickets can be purchased at a 
discount fare, Continental said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi has struggled since its founding in 1992 by airline  
employees who had lost their jobs at other carriers, mostly Pan Am 
and Eastern. The founders chose the name of a flightless bird for 
their upstart enterprise to symbolize the loss of their wings at 
their old airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak, the airline had 1,200 employees, 15 leased jets and  
flew 65 flights a day. It now employs 500 and flies out of Newark, 
Orlando, Miami and Palm Beach, Fla., and San Juan and Aguadilla, 
Puerto Rico. The airline recently pulled out of Atlanta, Boston, 
Chicago and Flint, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi filed for bankruptcy in September 1996, declaring $20  
million in debt. It was resurrected a year later by Baltimore 
physician Charles Edwards, who bought the airline for $16.5 million 
and took majority ownership of the company from the employees.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin Gets Two Years Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- The NCAA placed Wisconsin on two years'  
probation today for what was described as widespread, unauthorized 
spending of booster club money. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA's Committee on Infractions also required the university  
to continue developing a comprehensive athletics compliance 
education program during the probationary period. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the university must conduct an internal audit,  
focusing on fund-raising activities, file annual compliance reports 
and require the athletics director to attend an NCAA compliance 
seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin officials reported the infractions to the NCAA in  
April, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	James Hoyt, chairman of the athletic board, said Tuesday he  
hoped the penalties would be ``a non-story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An internal audit turned up hundreds of cases of unauthorized  
spending of booster club money on allowable items. Payments were 
made for such things as moving expenses, travel and business 
expenses and tickets to events. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit showed that 77 staff members, including Richter,  
received reimbursements from booster accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Such payments must receive prior approval from the chancellor's  
office, something that was either not done or not done in a timely 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Pat Richter received a written reprimand from  
Chancellor David Ward as a result of the violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Auditors said other payments were improperly funneled from the  
Mendota Gridiron Club to assistant football coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months after bonuses for those coaches were denied by  
Wisconsin officials in December 1996, the coaches were paid 
``appearance fees'' by the booster group for identical amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA rules forbid any outside source from paying or  
supplementing any athletic department staff member's salary.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Focuses on Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton called on Democratic  
business and labor leaders to take advantage of the nation's 
prosperity and push forward on economic initiatives from investing 
in targeted urban areas to expanding trade. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day when a U.S.-led NATO force was preparing to launch  
airstrikes on Kosovo, Clinton headlined two Democratic National 
Committee fund-raisers, bringing in more than $1 million and 
promoting his message on issues from education to Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The president touted the strength of the economy, underscoring  
his belief that a strong economic policy fits in with the values of 
the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible to have a good economic policy .... and have a  
more humane society,'' he said at a dinner Tuesday night for the 
Democratic Business Council at the Mayflower Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that not all Americans have reaped the benefits of the  
nation's prosperity, Clinton highlighted his efforts to give 
businesses an incentive to invest in communities. He cited room for 
growth in the United States' trade alliances with other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democratic Party should not be afraid of trade,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The president also warned that Americans cannot ignore foreign  
policy matters, pointing to the financial crisis in Asia and its 
implications for the United States' economic well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no longer an easy dividing line between our policy at  
home and our policy around the world,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton elaborated on this notion in his remarks about the  
situation in Kosovo. He asserted that Americans should have a 
vested interest in addressing problems in Europe, with many nations 
there being important trading partners for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is terribly important that that we recognize that  
economics cannot exist in a global context in the absence of 
security, peace and freedom,'' Clinton said at a later event at the 
home of former New York Rep. Tom Downey. ``Even though I think 
there is a huge moral component there, it will have direct personal 
benefits to Americans if we have a stable, free, united Europe.''

<HEADLINE> Forgotten Artist Is Now 'Priceless' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the final 22 years of his life, artist  
William Henry Johnson lay forgotten in a Long Island mental 
hospital while hundreds of his paintings rotted in a storage shed. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson died in 1970, alone, bedridden and ravaged by syphilis.  
He fared no better in death: He was buried in a plot marked by a 
number, not a name, in a field of thigh-high weeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, nearly 30 years after his death, reproductions of his  
brightly colored paintings of American life have resurfaced on 
calendars and postcards. And Johnson's art is the center of a 
bitter dispute between his family and the Smithsonian Institution, 
which claims ownership of some 1,100 of his pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum calls the collection ``priceless'' and Johnson is now  
acclaimed as one of the century's most important American artists. 
</P>
<P>
	The painter's relatives filed a $100 million federal lawsuit  
against the Smithsonian and a Manhattan art gallery last year. The 
suit was dismissed but an appeal is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	And so Johnson, whose art was nearly destroyed as junk in the  
1950s, suddenly enjoys a host of benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the many ironies here is that nobody thought his work  
was worth anything when he died,'' said Manhattan art attorney 
Peter Stern, who is representing gallery owner Michael Rosenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Melvin Gibbs, a Florence, S.C. lawyer who is working pro bono  
for the Johnson family, says he smells a conspiracy. He says the 
gallery and the Smithsonian got the art from a nonprofit foundation 
that had illegally obtained it while Johnson was institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Smithsonian is in possession of stolen property,'' Gibbs  
said. ``No one had the right to take away William Johnson's 
possessions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense maintains the Johnson family's claim comes too late  
to have any legal merit. ``This is 50 years later,'' Stern said. 
``The family had sufficient opportunity to get the work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But family members say key details -- even Johnson's 1970 death --  
were concealed from them by state and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know he died until four months after. We thought his  
paintings had been lost,'' said Johnson's niece, Betty Vance. 
</P>
<P>
	The artist's mother did not visit while he was alive, according  
to Vance and Gibbs, because she did not know where her son was 
being kept. When relatives first learned about the paintings, they 
could not afford to retain a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, a federal court judge dismissed the family's lawsuit,  
ruling it untimely and saying it should have been filed in state 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	While few expect the appeals court to reverse the decision, the  
case -- which contains the elements of a classical tragedy -- has 
aroused the interest of the art world and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	``The story is as fascinating and as provocative as his art is  
wonderful,'' said Richard Powell, a Duke University art historian 
who wrote a book about Johnson. ``If there's a lesson in all of 
this, it's that people have no idea what's going to be of value 10, 
20, 30 years from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While William Johnson -- Willie to family and friends -- wasted  
away in the Central Islip Psychiatric Center from 1948 to 1970, he 
didn't paint and rarely spoke. According to a Johnson friend, Helen 
Harrington, who is now dead, the artist believed he could 
communicate with others telepathically. The diagnosis was paresis, 
a disease of the brain caused by syphilis, which rendered him 
mentally incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
	Art historians say his commercial failure was unsurprising given  
the times. 
</P>
<P>
	``He suffered the same prejudices in the art world that  
African-Americans did in society,'' said Elizabeth Broun, director 
of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American Art. ``Galleries 
and museums were just not interested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His most critically acclaimed work came after he moved to Harlem  
from Europe on the eve of World War II. He adopted a simplified, 
folk-inspired style distinguished by brilliant color schemes and 
somewhat distorted forms. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of our first very important African-American  
modernists,'' said Powell. ``He takes the lessons of expressionism 
... and comes up with an artistic response that is really quite 
extraordinary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson moved from expressionist nature landscapes while he  
lived in Scandinavia to impressionistic paintings reminiscent of 
van Gogh before settling on the two-dimensional, non-illusionistic 
approach to painting for which he is best known. 
</P>
<P>
	His subjects ran the gamut: urban couples jitterbugging in  
brightly colored suits and platform shoes; rural farmers in the 
South leading tired mules through plowed fields; black soldiers 
training for -- and dying in -- World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the faces of his subjects are expressionless, dull even,  
as if impervious to either joy or sadness. The hands and feet of 
his farmers are huge, as if swollen by years of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
	While some critics dismissed his flat, two-dimensional figures  
as the work of a primitive, the formally trained artist did taste 
success. His painting, ``Chain Gang,'' was shown at the New York 
World's Fair in 1939 and about the same time, he had several solo 
gallery shows. 
</P>
<P>
	To supplement his income, Johnson worked as a teacher for the  
WPA in Harlem, and later, as a laborer at the Naval shipyards in 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very quiet, very introspective,'' said painter and  
friend Jacob Lawrence, the celebrated artist whose ``Migration'' 
series chronicled the journey of black Americans from the South to 
northern cities to escape segregation and to seek greater 
opportunities. Lawrence was a Harlem child learning how to paint 
when he met Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in his career, when he had little money to buy proper  
canvases, Johnson painted on burlap potato sacks and discarded 
plywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was no stranger to privation. While growing up in  
Florence, his father shoveled coal for the railroads until he 
became ill. Johnson's mother, a maid, became the family's primary 
money-earner. An outspoken young man who refused to quietly 
tolerate the stings of the town's bigotry, Johnson left home at 17 
to enroll in the prestigious National Academy of Design in New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating, he traveled to France in 1926 where he met his  
wife, Danish weaver Holcha Krake. He returned to the United States 
until 1938, fearing the approaching war. 
</P>
<P>
	When Krake died of breast cancer in 1944, Johnson began to  
decline. In 1946, he packed his belongings, demanded the return of 
the art he'd given as gifts and set out for Denmark, apparently 
hoping to marry Krake's sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was welcomed, his marriage proposals were not. Soon,  
with $6,000 in his pocket, he was wandering the streets with his 
art and other belongings. He made his way to Oslo, Norway, where 
police picked him up as he wandered aimlessly around the streets. 
He was shipped back to the United States and institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's family claims the artist's illiterate mother, Alice  
Smoot Johnson, was not given the chance to claim her son's art and 
that the U.S. government purposely concealed information from the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a 1948 letter from the U.S. State Department to the  
Social Security Administration, the government hid the fact that 
Johnson had cash and could easily have afforded to ship his 
paintings to his mother's home in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``In communicating with (Johnson's mother) the department has  
purposely avoided mentioning the fact that when (Johnson) was 
apprehended by the Oslo police ... he had on his person a 
considerable sum of money, reported as amounting to $6,400 in U.S. 
currency,'' wrote state department official E.J. Madill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why,'' asked Gibbs, ``would they keep that a secret? Because  
they didn't want the family to get the art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian and the U.S. attorney's office, which is  
representing the Smithsonian, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	With Johnson in the mental hospital, his art was in legal limbo  
and sat in a waterfront shed for nine years where many pieces were 
ruined by water damage and vermin. 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson's court-appointed caretaker sought to destroy the  
art after failing to find a buyer, he informed a judge that 
Johnson's work was ``of such inferior quality, that no purchaser 
therefore could be or would be found. In brief, these paintings, 
watercolors and prints (are) infantile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1956, the judge agreed to ``abandon (the art) as  
worthless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contents of the storage bin were given to the Harmon  
Foundation -- a nonprofit philanthropic group that had worked with 
black artists, including Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gibbs said Johnson's caretaker allegedly had secretly worked  
out a deal with the foundation to give the pieces away prior to the 
court order -- which he maintains was illegal. The lawyer also 
points out the caretaker did not tell the judge that Johnson's art 
had won prizes and that his wife's family had asked for paintings 
they never received. 
</P>
<P>
	When the foundation ceased most of its operations in 1967, it  
donated the bulk of its Johnsons to the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian's Broun points out that Johnson's work would  
likely still be virtually worthless had the Smithsonian not held 
three major exhibitions and spent $1.8 million restoring hundreds 
of his paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we took the work, it was obscure and had little or no  
value,'' she said. ``We take some pride in ownership for getting 
his work publicized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, she added, the Smithsonian does not wish to set a  
precedent. ``As a public museum, we are not able to take work out 
of the public trust without some court action,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Johnson's body continues to lie in grave No. 5405 --  
in an abandoned cemetery behind the shuttered mental hospital -- a 
number etched into a piece of stone among a sea of similarly marked 
nameless plots of others who died paupers there. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's not yet a household name,'' said Broun, ``we feel he's  
well on his way. Hopefully, it will be for the right reasons.''

<HEADLINE> Lewis-Holyfield Rematch Negotiated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Look for the Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield rematch to happen in  
October or November. There are, however, serious negotiations to be 
held before it happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's better than a 50 percent chance it will be made,''  
said Dino Duva, president of Main Events, who with Panos Eliades of 
Britain promotes Lewis, also of Britain. ``But a rematch is not 
made, I can tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight for the undisputed heavyweight championship between  
Lewis and Holyfield on March 13 in Madison Square Garden isn't 
deserving of rematch on its merits. The decision of a draw in a 
bout that Lewis clearly won, however, will sell a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid several investigations of the decision, including a grand  
jury probe in Manhattan, Don King, the primary promoter of March 13 
fight, recently announced that the two fighters have agreed to 
purses of $15 million each. Holyfield made $20 million and Lewis 
$10 million for the draw, which drew 21,284 fans paying $11 million 
and also reportedly had 1.2 million buys at $49.95 each. 
</P>
<P>
	King made at least $10 million. A rematch would not be set up  
for King to make that much. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be parity across the board,'' Duva said.  
</P>
<P>
	``No deal has been made with King for television,'' said Lou  
DiBella, senior vice president of HBO sports. ``No deal has been 
made for the site and no deal has been made for the date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King said both fighters would like the rematch in September, but  
HBO has a Sept. 18 date for a pay-per-view show featuring Oscar De 
La Hoya of Sept. 18. De La Hoya, the WBC welterweight champion, is 
a major pay-per-view attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The date has to be selected,'' DiBella said. ``It will not  
conflict with De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the fight probably will be held after September.  
</P>
<P>
	Frank Malone, Lewis' manager, has talked about the fight being  
held in Britain,, but Duva said, ``Logistically, it has to be in 
the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duva noted it would get more publicity here and also the time  
difference favors the United States. Pay-per-view matches always 
start around 11:30 in the East. That would be 4:30 a.m. in Britain. 
A fight in Britain also would be outdoors, adding the risk of rain. 
Rainouts cannot exist in the world of pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	It would seem Las Vegas beckons the rematch.  
</P>
<P>
	Selecting a date and a site are the easy part.  
</P>
<P>
	``We made a deal for the first fight knowing it was unfavorable  
to us because we wanted to get a unified champion,'' Di Bella said. 
``We got the short end of the stick, and there still is no 
undisputed champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When we negotiated a deal for the first fight, circumstances  
were different,'' Duva said. Holyfield, the WBA and IBF champion, 
was much more popular in the United States than Lewis, the WBC 
champion, who generally was looked on as a challenger. The 
``robbery'' has boosted Lewis' popularity on this side of the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Duva said the next fight will need parity, ``financial as well  
as non-financial. On behalf of Lennox, it would be very difficult 
if not impossible to accept King as the lead promoter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, the rematch should be a Duva-Eliades-King  
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	While controversy is as much a part of boxing as gloves, DiBella  
wants to guard against suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure the public is comfortable with how the  
fight is administered,'' DiBella said. That means the selection of 
payment of the judges and referee. The three sanctioning bodies 
each selected a judge for the first fight, and the New York 
commission selected referee Arthur Mercante Jr., who did a good 
job. The officials were paid by the promoter, King, which is the 
custom in boxing.

<HEADLINE> Reds Put Three Pitchers on the DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds put Denny Neagle and  
two other pitchers on the disabled list Wednesday and temporarily 
dropped Pete Harnisch from the rotation because of back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds will enter the season with questions about their top  
two starters and uncertainty about one of their more dependable 
setup men in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle has been slowed this spring by pulled leg muscles and  
weakness in his shoulder. Harnisch had his outing on Sunday cut 
short by spasms on the left side of his back and will rest for a 
few days before trying to throw again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds also put reliever Stan Belinda and starter Scott  
Winchester on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday. Belinda has 
biceps tendinitis, a problem unrelated to his multiple sclerosis. 
Winchester is making a comeback from shoulder surgery last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle could be activated at the end of the first week of the  
season. He threw 58 pitches in a ``B'' game on Tuesday and was 
encouraged by his progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle said there were no ill effects a day later.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just have the usual stiffness, maybe a little more than  
normal because I hadn't thrown that much,'' Neagle said. ``But I 
feel pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle figures that if he keeps making progress at the same  
rate, he should miss no more than two regular-season starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting to the point where I feel better and better. My  
velocity is back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Things are more muddled for Harnisch, who was the Reds' top  
winner last season. His back hurt on every pitch last Sunday. As a 
precaution, they've dropped him from his scheduled start Friday and 
will have him rest for a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't bother me when I walk around,'' Harnisch said  
Wednesday, during a break from treatments on his back. ``Hopefully, 
when I start to throw again it will be gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to rest him for a few days, until we get the  
spasms to subside,'' pitching coach Don Gullett said. ``Once we get 
him there, we'll put him back in his routine. I don't anticipate 
any problems with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belinda develops tendinitis in the same part of his right arm  
every spring training. This year, it's taking longer for him to get 
over it. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it's not related to his multiple sclerosis, Belinda  
thinks it could be partly the result of not throwing in a game for 
so long. His season ended last August, when he underwent tests that 
found MS. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it has everything to do with not pitching in a game  
for six months,'' Belinda said. ``It's an arm-strength thing. All 
the throwing I did this winter helped, but until you face hitters 
in a game, you don't really know where you're at. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt great the first five innings, then it slowly started  
settling in. So we're going to take care of it now so we don't have 
to miss much of the season.''

<HEADLINE> Bartender Celebrates 60 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST VIEW, Pa. (AP) -- Beer is to sell, not to drink.  
</P>
<P>
	That motto has served Angelo Cammarata well for the more than 60  
years he has given faithful patrons cold brew, a sympathetic ear 
and a joke or two in his homey ``shot and a beer'' tavern. 
</P>
<P>
	At 85, Cammarata, or ``Camm'' as his customers and neighbors  
affectionately call him, has been anointed the world's oldest 
bartender by the Guinness Book of World Records. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how much longer the good Lord will keep me  
here,'' Cammarata said, sipping ``just plain old Pepsi'' and 
nattily dressed in a striped shirt, blue tie and light blue 
cardigan sweater reminiscent of TV's Mr. Rogers. ``I retired 20 
years ago, but my boys won't let me quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sons, John and Frank, officially run Cammarata's, a simple  
brick, two-story tavern in suburban Pittsburgh with 10-cent chicken 
wings every Monday, a cheeseburger with thick, greasy fries for 
$3.65 and a big-screen TV and a jukebox in the back room. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cammarata, who lives in the apartment upstairs with his  
wife, Mary, still tends bar a few hours each day, particularly for 
the after-work crowd. The Guinness distinction, awarded in January, 
isn't just that he tends bar at his age -- it's that he has done so 
continuously since he was 19. 
</P>
<P>
	He watched televised reports of Neil Armstrong walking on the  
moon in 1969 from behind his U-shaped bar. He was buying produce 
for the bar in Pittsburgh's Strip District when the world learned 
that President Kennedy had been shot in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	He has commiserated with customers suffering from strained  
marriages, troubled children, depleted bank accounts and 
overbearing bosses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got an education in the bar,'' he said. ``You do become a  
kind of psychologist. You have to know your customer. 
</P>
<P>
	``One time many years ago, I told my priest that I considered my  
job almost like his. I listen to their problems, and I don't tell 
anyone else what they tell me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cammarata looks more like a grandfather in his 60s than a  
world-record holder because of his age and occupation. He said he 
likes a highball now and then, but he took his father's advice to 
sell beer rather than drink it. 
</P>
<P>
	He first stepped behind a bar in 1933, minutes after Prohibition  
was repealed. His father, Catino Cammarata, didn't want a minute to 
go by before he started serving beer and liquor in the family's 
grocery store and ice-cream parlor. 
</P>
<P>
	That first day, Cammarata's offered two 12-ounce brews for a  
nickel. A few customers came in with quarters to get the most out 
of the special. 
</P>
<P>
	``A quarter wasn't to be laughed at in those days'' of the Great  
Depression, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tavern has only ever served beer and shots; its blue-collar  
crowd doesn't go for Pink Ladies or Manhattans. 
</P>
<P>
	Cammarata worked for his father until he joined the U.S. Navy in  
1943 for a 29-month tour of duty in World War II. His father died 
during the war; when he returned, he and his three brothers took 
over the tavern. 
</P>
<P>
	Cammarata eventually became the sole proprietor as the grocery  
and dairy businesses were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to West View in 1954. He had learned that the original  
Cammarata's would be torn down to make way for a shopping center, 
and he found a tavern for sale in the working-class suburb with an 
apartment on the second floor to house his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Bezilla, 39, first walked into Cammarata's when he was a  
child. Like his deceased father, Chuck, he is one of Camm's 
regulars, and he said the tavern is as comfortable as home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to stop in and say hello to Angelo,'' Bezilla said.  
``Ang and my dad went to church together, and he's been a good part 
of our family. I started coming here all the time the minute I 
could get in legally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cammarata's longevity behind the bar has brought him other  
accolades. 
</P>
<P>
	He was inducted into Bartender Magazine's Bartenders' Hall of  
Fame in 1987. Four years earlier, on the tavern's 50th anniversary, 
the Allegheny County Commission signed a proclamation declaring 
April 7, 1983, ``Angelo Cammarata Day,'' and the original document 
with its tattered edges remains tacked on a wall above a cigarette 
vending machine in the bar. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in West View have asked him to run for mayor,'' said  
his son, John. ``But he always says no. He says 'I don't want to 
mix my business with politics.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He broke that rule once, successfully lobbying to do business on  
Super Bowl Sunday without buying a Sunday liquor license. 
</P>
<P>
	State law had allowed exceptions if New Year's Day and St.  
Patrick's Day fall on Sundays. Four years ago Cammarata asked for 
the change, which lawmakers approved last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be open 52 Sundays. Sunday is our family day.  
I just want to be open for the most important sports event in this 
country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He nearly gave it up in 1972. His children were settled in their  
adult lives, and he sold the bar, planning to retire. He worked for 
the new owner in the bar with a new name -- Zipia's. His sons bought 
it back in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a tight family,'' John Cammarata said. ``Frank and I  
wanted to keep the family business going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that, Cammarata gave his son an affectionate pat on the  
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen bartenders come and go,'' Cammarata said. ``I raised  
my four children, and put them all through college. I could have 
gotten a job somewhere else, but I'm plenty satisfied with what 
I've got.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tuberculosis Cases Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANTANA, Fla. (AP) -- Tuberculosis cases in the United States  
declined in 1998 for a fifth straight year, but doctors are 
reluctant to cheer the apparent success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spend more in the United States on (thinning) hair care  
treatments than tuberculosis treatment,'' said Ray Collins, 
superintendent of the A.G. Holley State Hospital, the nation's last 
freestanding TB treatment center.

<HEADLINE> Reno To Probe Farm Industry Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm state senators pressing to slow the  
growing number of mergers in agriculture got a boost when Attorney 
General Janet Reno agreed to increase scrutiny of consolidation 
within the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno met in private for more than an hour Tuesday with a  
bipartisan group of senators. She promised to increase antitrust 
scrutiny and recommend legislative changes if necessary, attendees 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Justice Department antitrust chief Joe Klein will travel  
to the Midwest next month to hear more about agricultural 
concentration, senators said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to hear Attorney General Reno express her deep  
concern today about the negative impact concentration in 
agribusiness may have on family farmers,'' said Sen. Chuck 
Grassley, R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're convinced part of the reason we have price collapse is  
concentration in agriculture,'' added Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., an 
organizer of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Republican and Democratic farm state lawmakers worry about  
increasing mergers within the industry. Both the House and Senate 
have held hearings in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Unease about concentration intensified late last year after  
Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis, the nation's largest grain company, 
announced plans to buy the worldwide operations of second-ranked 
Continental Grain Co. The Justice Department is reviewing the 
proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement only increased worries in a sector reeling from  
a year of low prices in both commodities and livestock. Hog prices, 
for instance, dropped in December to as low as $8 per 
hundredweight, the lowest in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Those prices exacerbated concern by some that big companies were  
squeezing out small producers. 
</P>
<P>
	According to USDA figures, as of 1997 the four largest packing  
firms accounted for 80 percent of cattle slaughter, 54 percent of 
hog slaughter and 70 percent of sheep slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration established an interagency panel last  
year to look at concentration. Several agencies within the 
Agriculture Department are conducting their own studies.

<HEADLINE> McDougal: Husband Made Up Stories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal's late ex-husband  
encouraged her to claim she had an affair with Bill Clinton so 
Kenneth Starr's prosecutors could ``get'' the president before the 
1996 election, Mrs. McDougal testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said James McDougal tried out different versions of his  
own ``outlandish'' story about Clinton and a fraudulent loan in an 
effort to satisfy the independent counsel's office and get out of 
having to go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's second day of testimony was filled with  
accusations against Starr's people and her ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Contending McDougal repeatedly tried to get her to lie for  
Starr's office, Mrs. McDougal described to jurors what she said was 
her last conversation with him as she considered cooperating with 
Whitewater prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, James McDougal, convicted and struggling with  
health problems and depression, already was cooperating with 
Starr's investigation of whether Clinton was involved in the 
fraudulent loan. McDougal died in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim told me ... 'You don't have to say that Clinton  
pressured''' a Little Rock judge to make the $300,000 loan that 
benefited Whitewater because ``you can just say you had a sexual 
affair with Clinton,'' Mrs. McDougal told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal is on trial for criminal contempt and obstruction  
of justice for refusing to answer questions before a federal grand 
jury in the Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	She alleged that James McDougal told her that ``there is a man''  
in Starr's office ``named Hickman Ewing'' who ``believes he can get 
Clinton on a sex charge before the election.'' Ewing is Starr's 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her ex-husband told her that if she made the sex  
allegation, ``you can write your own ticket'' for assistance from 
Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the federal courthouse, Ewing said he never talked to  
James McDougal about any sex allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not doing anything along those lines at all,'' said  
Ewing, who oversees Starr's investigation in Arkansas. ``I've never 
heard any discussion along those lines in my office at the time 
frame she was talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing declined to speak about other time frames.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, would not respond to  
reporters' questions about whether his client had an affair with 
Clinton. Geragos said he suspects prosecutors will ask the question 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, Mrs. McDougal got into several contentious  
exchanges with prosecutor Mark Barrett, prompting U.S. District 
Judge George Howard twice to admonish her to answer the question 
and refrain from ``speeches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Ken Starr had a plan and it was to convict me so that  
he could then get testimony against the president,'' Mrs. McDougal 
said in response to a question by Barrett about the 1996 trial in 
which she was convicted of four felonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ken Starr didn't pick the 12 jurors,'' Barrett snapped.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal responded that it was Starr's office that put on  
``perjured'' testimony by prosecution witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, in the earlier testimony, said at another point  
during her ex-husband's cooperation with Starr's office, he told 
her that ``I believe we have got Hillary'' Rodham Clinton because 
prosecutors had found documents on a fraudulent McDougal-controlled 
real estate development south of Little Rock called Castle Grande. 
She did not say whether her ex-husband provided details. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady have steadfastly denied any  
wrongdoing in their Arkansas business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Was her ex-husband ``fabricating'' allegations about the  
Clintons? Geragos asked Mrs. McDougal during her second day of 
testifying in her own defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``If fabricating means make it up as you go, that is what he was  
doing,'' Mrs. McDougal replied. ``He told me this is something he 
had to do because he did not want to die in jail. ... Jim told that 
same bunch of lies until the day he died'' while serving time in a 
federal prison for his 18 felony convictions at his Whitewater 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said she listened as her ex-husband tried out  
different versions of his ``outlandish'' story that Clinton 
discussed the loan briefly with him and Little Rock municipal judge 
David Hale. 
</P>
<P>
	She recalled McDougal saying as he rehearsed the story, ``I have  
got a whole new twist, what do you think about the way I say this, 
does this sound believable?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal alleged at one point her ex-husband suggested she  
could get a deal with Starr's office if she simply testified that 
Clinton was present for a discussion about the $300,000 loan.

<HEADLINE> Skater Goebel Plans Historic Jumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Quadruple jumps are no longer out of  
the ordinary, but Tim Goebel will make history when he performs two 
different ones in the same program. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel said that he will attempt both a quad salchow and a quad  
toe loop in Thursday's free program at the World Figure Skating 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaters have been doing quadruple toe loops in competition since  
Canadian Kurt Browning did the first one at the 1988 World 
Championships in Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
	Although all the other skaters who have completed quads in  
competition -- more than a dozen by now -- have all done toe loops, 
Goebel's is a jump which uses the toe pick to vault up. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old is the only skater to land a quadruple salchow  
in competition. It is coming off one foot and landing on the other 
without the help of a toe pick to gain momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's qualification, he landed his jump cleanly. Currently  
13th after the short program, Goebel is looking to crack the top 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing lose now. I want to move up into the top 10. To  
do that, I'm going to have to do something really outstanding,'' 
said Goebel, who placed third at the U.S. championships last month. 
</P>
<P>
	He has officially done three quadruple jumps. He landed his  
first at the junior Grand Prix finals in Switzerland a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That made him the first American to land one cleanly in  
competition. Olympic champion Brian Boitano performed many in 
practice but never did one in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel felt that doing the first one in competition was more  
satisfying to him than the mark of doing the first one at worlds, 
``but it's a cool little piece of history.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-NFL Player Charged in NJ Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Prosecutors say a former National Football  
League player who admitted to killing seven people also stabbed a 
homeless white man to death as a sacrifice to the leader of a black 
supremacist cult. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Rozier, 43, was charged with murder Tuesday in the 1984  
slaying of Attilio Cicala, who was stabbed near the Yahweh Ben 
Yahweh temple in Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they believed cult members offered Cicala up as  
a sacrifice a few days before the cult's leader was to visit 
Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	Rozier has been jailed in California on $1 million bail. Ray  
Weiss, a spokesman for Essex County prosecutors, said he didn't 
know when Rozier would appear for an arraignment in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Rozier, who also called himself Neariah Israel, or ``Child of  
God,'' was the leader of the Yahweh Ben Yahweh Temple in Newark at 
the time of the killing, prosecutor Patricia Hurt said Tuesday. The 
temple no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahweh Ben Yahweh, which means ``God the Son of God'' in Hebrew,  
is a Black Israelite sect that believes blacks are the lost tribe 
of Israel and that true Jews and white people are devils. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Yahweh, also known as Hulon Mitchell Jr., and six others  
were convicted in 1992 of conspiracy for ordering 14 killings of 
white people and resistant black disciples. 
</P>
<P>
	Rozier, who lives in Cameron Park, Calif., joined the cult in  
the 1980s, after briefly playing as a lineman for the St. Louis 
Cardinals in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted of committing four murders under orders from  
the cult. 
</P>
<P>
	He later admitted to seven killings and was sentenced to 22  
years in prison, but was released after 10 years in 1996, after 
testifying against Yahweh and other followers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rozier became a federally protected witness in 1996, relocated  
to his home in California and changed his name. 
</P>
<P>
	John Armstrong, 40, another cult member, also has been charged  
with Cicala's slaying.

<HEADLINE> Study Backs Longer Clot Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	People recovering from dangerous blood clots in their legs need  
to take clot-preventing drugs for much longer than the standard 
three months to prevent a recurrence, researchers reported today in 
the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Painful clots in a vein deep inside the leg strike more than  
40,000 Americans each year, and at least 15 percent have a 
recurrence only months later. Such clots can kill within hours if a 
large enough piece breaks off, travels to the heart and becomes 
lodged in a lung vein. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors usually treat patients with such deep-vein clots with  
blood-thinning intravenous medicine for a week, then have them take 
an inexpensive clot-preventing pill, warfarin, for three months. 
</P>
<P>
	But after that, these patients still run an increased risk of  
another clot, unless the original one was due to a reversible 
condition, such as an injury, surgery or immobilization. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian researchers compared the three-month treatment with a  
longer course and found a 95 percent reduction in the risk of 
another clot among patients who had been on warfarin for an average 
of 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was supposed to run for more than two years but was  
cut short because the extended treatment proved so effective that 
doctors couldn't justify taking the other patients off warfarin. 
About 5 percent of recurrent clots are fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994-97 study was led by Dr. Clive Kearon, a professor of  
medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 83 patients treated with warfarin for three months and  
then given dummy pills, 17 had another life-threatening leg clot 
during the study and three of them died. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 79 people receiving the longer warfarin treatment, one  
died and one had another clot, although that was after the patient 
stopped taking warfarin because it had caused serious internal 
bleeding. Two other patients getting the longer warfarin treatment 
also suffered major internal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the biggest risk with warfarin, a 50-year-old drug also  
known as Coumadin. But generally, a clot is considered a deadlier 
risk than bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Hobson II, director of vascular surgery at New Jersey  
Medical School in Newark, said patients with deep-vein clots now 
``should know that if somebody has told them three months on 
Coumadin is enough, it isn't.'' He generally keeps his patients on 
the drug for four to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Kearon and other scientists are now doing more studies to  
determine the ideal dose and duration of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Andrew Schafer of Baylor  
College of Medicine in Houston said this is an important study that 
should make doctors start treating deep-vein clots ``as a chronic 
rather than acute disease.''

<HEADLINE> Chase Changes Mind About Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp. named William B. Harrison  
Jr. president and chief executive on Wednesday, indicating the 
nation's third-largest bank is backing off its plans to acquire an 
investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison, 55, succeeds Walter V. Shipley, 63, who will continue  
as chairman of the board. Thomas G. Labrecque, 60, president and 
chief operating officer, will retire. All of the changes are 
effective June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment established Harrison as heir apparent to  
Shipley, who is scheduled to retire within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement quickly created a buzz among bank watchers  
because of a report last week in The Wall Street Journal that 
Shipley had offered the chief executive's job to the heads of 
several New York investment banks, if they agreed to merge with 
Chase. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Shipley reportedly approached several investment banks  
-- including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and Goldman 
Sachs -- he told reporters Wednesday that Chase doesn't need to make 
an acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to have public equity capability at some point, but  
we don't have to do that short term,'' Harrison said, adding, ``I 
am very comfortable we can continue the momentum and meet our 
financial goals without having to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Shipley flatly denied offering the chief executive's  
post as an inducement, it's likely any merger with a Wall Street 
titan would have created a power shuffle at the top of Chase, a 
bank with $366 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison's promotion is ``a very interesting development and  
perhaps indicates that Shipley's overtures weren't accepted,'' said 
Joe Haberman, a vice president at A.T. Kearney who specializes in 
financial services executive searches. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison ``is a long-term banker, he's a good guy, and very well  
respected, but this indicates a different strategy,'' Haberman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison, who has worked at Chase for more than 30 years, has  
been credited with developing Chase's profitable Global Bank, which 
includes international investment banking, securities and currency 
trading and commercial banking. He currently is vice chairman and 
already is a member of the Chase board. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase's stock, which zig-zagged in a narrow range throughout the  
day, finished the day down 18 3/4 cents at $79.37 1/2 a share on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks, brokerages and insurance companies are looking at  
each other's business as the regulatory walls that divided them 
crumble. 
</P>
<P>
	The most clear example is the merger of banking power Citicorp  
with insurance and brokerage giant Travelers Group last year. In 
one fell swoop, Citicorp's Citibank gained access to the insurance, 
mutual funds and investment banking businesses under the Travelers' 
umbrella.

<HEADLINE> Al Unser Jr. Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Al Unser Jr. was released from a hospital  
Wednesday, two days after surgeons inserted a metal plate into his 
broken right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser broke the ankle during a crash on the first lap of the  
Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time Indy 500 winner is expected to stay in Indianapolis  
for the remainder of the week and to start therapy next week, said 
his surgeon, Dr. Terry Trammell of Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser could be back racing in four to six weeks, but won't be  
able to walk for eight to 12 weeks, Trammell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will need to build a carbon fiber brace for the ankle,  
which will allow him to push the pedal,'' said Trammel, adding that 
the veteran driver won't be able to walk to his race car because he 
can't put weight on the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's accident, Unser broke two bones in his ankle and  
also sustained a small break in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	During a two-hour operation Monday, Trammel repaired Unser's  
fractured ankle with a plate and six screws. The knee injury is 
being treated with a brace. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser's car collided with rookie Naoki Hattori in the first turn  
of the Florida race. Hattori suffered a broken leg in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not how I planned to begin the season,'' Unser said  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash was the latest problem for Unser, who hopes to end a  
three-year winless streak this season. He is also coping with his 
12-year-old daughter's sudden paralysis as the result of a viral 
infection on the spinal cord.

<HEADLINE> Andy Williams Enjoys Success in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Decades after his ``Moon River'' had lovers  
swooning, Andy Williams is enjoying a comeback thanks to a greatest 
hits album and a Fiat TV commercial featuring another tune, ``Music 
to Watch Girls By.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To have 20-year-old girls jumping up and down in front of you  
is more effective than Viagra,'' the 70-year-old Williams said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after the 32-year-old song was re-released in Great  
Britain, it entered the British record charts at No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal appearances to promote the album ``In The Lounge With  
... Andy Williams,'' as well as broadcast of the Fiat commercial, 
have made the singer the latest rage abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very flattering to know that my music has stood the test  
of time,'' Williams said. ``It's great to see that a whole new 
generation is going nutty over music that I made 30 years ago.''

	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Even though most of the focus is on  
missing children, the percentage of missing adults is increasing, 
USA Today reported.

<HEADLINE>  Sharks Acquire Habs' Damphousse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Hoping to add some offensive punch as  
they edge toward the playoffs, the San Jose Sharks acquired 
Montreal Canadiens captain Vincent Damphousse just before the trade 
deadline Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for the veteran center, Montreal will receive a  
fifth-round draft pick this year, a second-round pick in 2000 and 
future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the guy's got some darned good credentials,''  
Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi said. ``This guy has played at 
a high level and played for Team Canada, so there's more to him 
than just numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damphousse, who becomes an unrestricted free agent July 1, had  
12 goals and 24 assists in 65 games this season. But he is still 
considered a talented face-off man and defensive forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi, aware of concerns about Damphousse's lackluster play  
this season, said the Sharks were willing to take the chance -- 
because of his track record and because the team did not have to 
give up too much in return. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good risk,'' Lombardi said.  
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Sharks Acquire Habs' Damphousse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Hoping to add some offensive punch as  
they edge toward the playoffs, the San Jose Sharks acquired 
Montreal Canadiens captain Vincent Damphousse just before the trade 
deadline Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for the veteran center, Montreal will receive a  
fifth-round draft pick this year, a second-round pick in 2000 and 
future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the guy's got some darned good credentials,''  
Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi said. ``This guy has played at 
a high level and played for Team Canada, so there's more to him 
than just numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damphousse, who becomes an unrestricted free agent July 1, had  
12 goals and 24 assists in 65 games this season. But he is still 
considered a talented face-off man and defensive forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi, aware of concerns about Damphousse's lackluster play  
this season, said the Sharks were willing to take the chance -- 
because of his track record and because the team did not have to 
give up too much in return. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good risk,'' Lombardi said.  
</P>
<P>
	In his 13th season, Damphousse is just seven games shy of 1,000  
career games. A two-time All-Star, he has 916 career points, 
including 340 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	He has had four 90-point seasons, and has had at least 30 goals  
in five seasons. And he has playoff experience: He was a key member 
of the 1993 Stanley Cup-winning Canadiens.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Recent Editorials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	March 17  
</P>
<P>
	The Sun, Lowell, Mass., on Steve Forbes:  
</P>
<P>
	His novice campaign in 1996 featured $42 million of his own  
money, a dominant idea -- the flat tax -- and constant repetition of 
the slogan ``hope, growth and opportunity.'' American politics 
tends to reward candidates who have been around the track a time or 
two, and Forbes, 51, has clearly learned. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he started early, vigorously courted religious  
conservatives, assembled an experienced staff and established a 
grass-roots organization. His Internet site features an 
old-fashioned pitch for contributions, volunteers and press 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest advantage is the oldest political weapon of all,  
money. Campaign analysts say he may spend $50 million in pursuit of 
the GOP nomination. By contrast, a credible mainstream campaign 
this year would come at around $20 million. Multimillionaire 
publisher Forbes can bankroll his campaign, but because of 
ill-conceived campaign finance laws his rivals must raise their 
funds $1,000 at a time. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 22  
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio Express-News, on starvation in North Korea:  
</P>
<P>
	They are called ``black swallows,'' the starving, stunted and  
orphaned children of North Korea who haunt the country in search of 
food. 
</P>
<P>
	They are the youngest victims of a devastating famine that has  
killed at least 2 million North Koreans since the mid-1990s. 
Two-thirds of all children younger than 7 are malnourished. 
</P>
<P>
	While a series of droughts has contributed to the crisis, much  
famine results from corruption and inefficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, while millions starve, leaders invest in nuclear weapons,  
defying international law. Nonetheless, the United States remains 
its largest donor of food. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, much of the donated food does not reach hungry  
citizens, but winds up in the padded stomachs of the military and 
Communist Party. Because of this, Doctors of the World and Doctors 
Without Borders last summer left North Korea in protest. 
</P>
<P>
	The callousness of North Korean leaders poses a moral dilemma  
for the United States and other nations. Should food donations 
continue even though much of it is diverted from the neediest 
people? Or should such donations cease? ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 19  
</P>
<P>
	The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, on Medicare:  
</P>
<P>
	If the president and Congress would make tough choices on  
difficult issues, there would be no need for bipartisan 
commissions. They don't, so in 1997 Congress created the National 
Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaired by Sen. John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, the 17-member  
panel was charged with redesigning an entitlement program that, 
like Social Security, is popular among older Americans but 
financially unsound. Sen. Breaux and Rep. Bill Thomas, a California 
Republican, proposed to save money through market mechanisms and by 
raising the age of eligibility from 65 to 67. ... 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the president has offered the same response to  
Medicare's financial woes as he has for Social Security's: Dedicate 
a chunk of future budget surpluses to keep the program in business 
a few years longer. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It would be downright irresponsible to let Medicare costs spiral  
until the program goes bankrupt -- and to let millions of additional 
Americans get accustomed to benefit levels that are simply 
unsustainable. If the president doesn't like Sen. Breaux's 
solution, he is obligated to come up with something better. 

</P>

</P>
<P>
	Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, on medical marijuana:  
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one years ago, New Mexico became the first state to  
initiate a pilot program that ultimately concluded what a federal 
study stated only this past week: Marijuana can relieve suffering 
for some ill or terminally ill patients, and that legalizing it for 
medicinal use would not lead to widespread abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. drug policy director Barry McCaffrey hailed ... National  
Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine report as ``the most 
comprehensive analysis of medical marijuana ever done'' and 
supported its conclusions -- a significant endorsement considering 
McCaffrey had commissioned the study to support opposition to 
medical marijuana initiatives in California, Alaska, Arizona, 
Nevada, Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	This study, and McCaffrey's turnaround, should give Congress the  
scientific and political backing it needs to finally eliminate 
federal restrictions on states that allow medical marijuana use. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Congress should change this view ... to reclassify marijuana as  
a Schedule II drug. This change acknowledges a legitimate medical 
use, allowing doctors to prescribe it under tightly-controlled 
conditions, just as they can prescribe cocaine, morphine and other 
drugs with high potential for abuse. Schedule II prescriptions are 
subject to both federal and state review. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 19  
</P>
<P>
	Wheeling (W.Va.) News-Register, on teacher education:  
</P>
<P>
	It's only a matter of time until young people wise up and stop  
using ``The dog ate my homework'' as an excuse for not getting the 
job done. These days, a better line might be, ``Oh, my term paper 
isn't done because my parents wouldn't spend enough money on it.'' 
After all, if young people are learning nothing else, they are 
coming to understand that the standard excuse for any problem, 
particularly if government is involved, is that not enough money is 
being spent. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened again last week, when a national task force of top  
college officials issued a report on what should be done to improve 
teacher-education programs. Spend more money, said the officials. 
...
</P>
<P>
	To be fair, we should note that the report also contained some  
reasonable, productive recommendations such as one that teachers 
should be ``thoroughly prepared in the subject matter they will 
teach.'' The only thing wrong with this picture, of course, is that 
Americans no doubt have thought for many years that education 
schools were turning out teachers who were supposed to be so 
prepared. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Sorry, but we're not buying the task force's report. Instead of  
whining for more money, its members ought to be considering what 
most Americans in private industry had to do years ago: doing 
better work and adapting to changing times. 

</P>
<P>
	March 17  
</P>
<P>
	The Columbian, Vancouver, Wash., on U.S. Forest Service:  
</P>
<P>
	Not since 1982 has the U.S. Forest Service been able to revise  
and bring up to date its rules and regulations for managing 191 
million acres of trees in 155 national forests. Successive efforts 
to do so have crashed into knots of conflicting interests. 
</P>
<P>
	So it may be with the present round of revisions, with new  
management plans for most forests on a 2001 deadline. This time, 
however, the planners and surrounding advocates for various 
interests will have available a 193-page report from 13 scientists 
who were appointed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to cut 
through the knotty interests binding the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists, representing the nation's best academic forestry  
programs, advised that the primary goal of forest management should 
be the long-term health of the forests. 
</P>
<P>
	While it may be difficult to believe that such advice is even  
necessary, it was not uncontroversial; nor will it be met with 
universal acclaim. Several scientists bailed out of the committee 
or prepared minority reports. Groups with particular interests in 
how the forests are managed did their best to shape the final 
product and now are applauding or jeering according to how well 
they did in the shaping. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, environmentalists and recreationalists like the  
recommendation. Loggers and other beneficiaries of the more 
traditional multiple-use context for forest management do not like 
what the scientists had to say. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 17  
</P>
<P>
	Springfield (Ohio) News-Sun, on drug offenses:  
</P>
<P>
	Like most other states, Ohio has emphasized punishment as a  
means of dealing with the drug epidemic. Lawmakers have mandated 
long sentences for people who sell or use drugs, and for those who 
commit other crimes to support drug habits. As a result, the state 
has spent hundreds of millions of dollars building the cells needed 
to house an ever-increasing prison population. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio must turn around its spending priorities in dealing with  
drug abuse. It cannot and should not abandon the fight against drug 
crimes, but that effort should be reorganized. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison cells ought to be reserved for the kingpins and other  
dealers who are getting rich off the suffering of others. The use 
of drug courts should be instituted so court dockets won't be 
clogged with the cases of casual users and addicts who need 
counseling and treatment rather than incarceration. 

</P>
<P>
	March 23  
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Herald, on Argentine President Carlos Menem:  
</P>
<P>
	Changing direction more times than a kid on a seesaw,  
Argentina's President Carlos Menem once again threatens to run for 
a third consecutive term. Forget that the Argentine constitution 
... expressly prohibits a third one. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Mr. Menem acts as if his country's politics is a personal  
playground. ... Maybe Mr. Menem is trying to monopolize the 
spotlight, angling for post-office influence, or deflecting 
attention as he did with talk of ``dollarization.'' ... 
</P>
<P>
	This might be humorous, if Argentina's political leaders didn't  
have better things to do. ... Unfortunately, the judiciary serves 
dangerously at the pleasure of presidential whim. Putting the issue 
before the Argentine Supreme Court risks a ruling that mocks both 
the constitution and rule of law. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Sadly, until democratic institutions and political oppositions  
strengthen, there's little check on politicians that value personal 
power over representative government. 

</P>
<P>
	March 23  
</P>
<P>
	Daily News of Los Angeles, on overlong Oscars:  
</P>
<P>
	At just over four hours, Sunday night's Oscar extravaganza of  
film clips interspersed with live-action speeches was the longest 
and most self-indulgent Academy Awards telecast ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Please, doesn't anyone in Hollywood know how to yell ``cut''  
anymore? 
</P>
<P>
	Get a grip, academy and ABC. Can the clips.  
</P>
<P>
	Let's honor the nominees and the winners.  
</P>
<P>
	Let's celebrate life and the living.  
</P>
<P>
	Let's see more of the likes of Roberto Benigni, who skipped,  
cavorted and careened into our hearts when he won best foreign 
language film for his ``Life is Beautiful,'' which he directed, 
wrote and starred in. ... Benigni's effervescence was a genuine, 
live moment, glorifying the best of moviemaking. 
</P>
<P>
	His spontaneity enlivened a show filled with too much darkness  
and despair at seeing all the talent that's passed away over the 
years. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 24  
</P>
<P>
	The Mirror, London, on Slobodan Milosevic:  
</P>
<P>
	Time has finally run out for the Serbian butcher. Slobodan  
Milosevic got away with mass slaughter in Bosnia and then in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	He was warned and threatened but he faced down the world's great  
powers. Unitl now. There are two alternatives. To walk away from 
what is happening and let Milosevic's killers ravage the country. 
Or to hit back. 
</P>
<P>
	If NATO's forces did nothing, he would not stop at Kosovo. Like  
all dictators, his ambition recognizes no borders. He will move 
into other European countries and won't stop until he is forced to. 
</P>
<P>
	The time to do that is now. Before counless more deaths are  
added to the thousands who have died already. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 24  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Mail, London, on Slobodan Milosevic:  
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic knows perfectly well that two members of the U.N.  
Security Council -- Russia and China -- are bitterly opposed to 
NATO's plans. He knows too that some members of the Alliance, such 
as Italy, are lukewarm over using force. He will certainly try to 
exploit those divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Make no mistake: when the piteous pictures of casualities appear  
on our television screens, Britain and her allies will come under 
increasing pressure to desist. There will be questions in the UN 
over the legality of the actions. And it will be forcefully argued 
that this country has no national interest in the Balkans. One 
thing is clear. This is a dangerous enterprise, with an outcome 
nobody can foresee. Things might have been different had the 
Alliance acted decisively in the first place, instead of relying on 
empty bluster and giving a fatal impression of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	There must be no repitition of that mistake. If the planes go  
in, there can be no half measures or pinpricks. NATO must 
understand that once it opts for military action, it has no choice 
but to strike relentlessly and hard. 

</P>
<P>
	March 23  
</P>
<P>
	The Straits Times, Singapore, on NATO:  
</P>
<P>
	World opinion must wonder why the North Atlantic Treaty  
Organization has not yet acted against a Serbian government that 
thas violated every possible civilized canon in its brutal 
treatment of the Muslim ethnic Albanians who comprise more than 90 
percent of the population of Kosovo province. Similar pussyfooting 
in Bosnia enabled Serbian troops to overrun the United 
Nations-designed safe haven of Srebrenica and massacre its Muslim 
civilians while impotent Dutch peacekeppers stood by. Yugoslav 
president Slobodan Milosevic, the villain of both situations, must 
be laughing up his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has been bombed and besieged for  
far less, the West apparently being more concerned about the Kurds 
in Iraq (but not in NATO-member Turkey), than about Bosnians and 
Albanians. 

</P>
<P>
	March 18  
</P>
<P>
	Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on U.S. economy:  
</P>
<P>
	It has been a `lost decade' for Japan but a decade of dramatic  
prosperity for America. ... It is also true that the bedrock of 
success (in the United States) are the growing seeds of danger: 
overshooting stock prices and ballooning external deficits. That 
the stock market is overheating is indicated by almost every 
relevant barometer, such as corporate asset value, the level or 
earnings and profit forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the stock market keeps on rising, despite fears it might  
crash at any time. The real danger seems to lurk not so much in the 
nonstop ascent itself as in the apparent inability, or 
unwillingness, to stop it. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Even a mild economic slowdown could send foreign investors  
pulling their investments out of the United States. If that 
happens, the dollar would weaken, stock prices would plunge and 
interest rates would soar -- all at the same time. And the slowdown 
could quickly turn into a slump. ...

</P>
<P>
	Bangkok Post, on Burma's refusal to grant visa to dying husband  
of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi: 
</P>
<P>
	The refusal to (lift) Mr. Aris's travel ban even on  
compassionate grounds before last week's firestorm of publiciy was 
predictable. It is part of their psychological campaign against the 
immensely popular and elected political leader of Burma. There are 
two points. The first is the junta's cynical declaration that it 
will use any weapon -- including a grieving, cancer-stricken man 
against his wife. The second is the chilling attitude that the 
government can, and should, control when and how a man and wife can 
meet. 

</P>
<P>
	March 24  
</P>
<P>
	The Australian, Sydney, on Indonesia:  
</P>
<P>
	Gruesome pictures of beheaded Indonesians bear dreadful  
testimony to the dangerous disintegration of the power of the 
republic's central government. 
</P>
<P>
	Violent deaths are occurring daily through the vast archipelago.  
... While many of them are the result of the huge pressures caused 
by Indonesia's economic collapse, hundreds have been killed in 
direct retribution for the transmigration program aggressively 
promoted by the Suharto government, which clamped down hard on 
dissent and expressions of interracial, inter-religious animosity. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be easy to argue that the Jakarta government should be  
more active. But the administration of President B.J. Habibie has 
already moved far more quickly on reform than most expected. The 
proximity of the (June 7) poll has hamstrung Habibie on further 
reforms. The decision of the Indonesian armed forces to wind down 
direct involvement in the political process has left a hiatus in 
civil law enforcement that cannot be easily filled. Depressing as 
it sounds ... prospects for an early end to the killings are not 
good. 

</P>
<P>
	March 22  
</P>
<P>
	Le Temps, Geneva, Switzerland, on the round-the-world balloon:  
</P>
<P>
	For nearly three weeks, that marvellous machine which flew  
through the blue sky carried our dreams and imagination. ... The 
balloonists held the whole world in their hands and offered to 
share it with us. Thanks to them, this earth, for a moment in 
everyone's life, became ours again. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Now they are back. They returned to the ground in their  
miniscule cabin, underneath this balloon which now seems huge and 
clumsy. ... 
</P>
<P>
	You only remember the first. The success of Bertrand Piccard,  
Brian Jones and their team certainly depressed all the balloonists 
who thought they could go round the world before them. But, 
discreetly swallowing their bitterness, they joined in with the 
enthusiasm. This victory belongs to them too. Thanks to them the 
suspense remained intact, the field open, and the dreams 
inexhaustible. ...

<HEADLINE> Inflation-Indexed Bonds Touted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The federal government's new inflation-indexed  
savings bonds haven't attracted a lot of investor attention amid 
today's low-inflation environment. 
</P>
<P>
	But retirees ought to take a close look at them, recommends an  
investment expert at the College for Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors who want a less volatile portfolio or grandparents  
who want to help fund their grandchildren's college education may 
find inflation-indexed savings bonds attractive,'' says Hal 
Lenhart, an academic associate at the college. ``I think they are 
something of a sleeper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Introduced last fall, inflation-indexed savings bonds, commonly  
called I-bonds, are cousins to EE savings bonds, with many of the 
same features such as deferral of federal income tax until 
redemption as well as tax exemption for qualified educational 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, unlike EE bonds, these inflation-indexed bonds have two  
components. 
</P>
<P>
	One component provides a fixed rate of return. This is what you  
earn (before taxes) regardless of what inflation does. According to 
Lenhart, this real return was about 3.3 percent for recently issued 
I-bonds. The rate is adjusted every six months, in May and 
November, and the rate remains the same for the life of any I-bonds 
bought during that six-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	Atop this fixed rate is added an inflation-adjusted component.  
This component is adjusted up or down every six months, in May and 
November, based on the inflation rate over the previous six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest inflation component is 1.75 percent. Thus, total  
yield for recently issued I-bonds is 5.05 percent. This yield is 
higher than EE savings bonds earning around 4.6 percent, though 
less than the 5.65 percent long-term Treasury bonds are earning. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller return of the inflation-indexed bond than Treasurys  
is because the investor is getting the bonus of inflation 
protection, Lenhart says. 
</P>
<P>
	In the current low-inflation environment, it may look smarter to  
stick with higher returning conventional bonds. But if inflation 
were to jump, the indexed bonds would start to look especially 
good. Let's say inflation rises to 2.5 percent (historically it 
averages over 3 percent). Then the inflation bond would yield 5.8 
percent -- higher than the regular Treasury bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenhart likes these bonds for retirees because inflation is  
always a concern for people living on fixed incomes. Even a 
low-inflation environment can eat away at fixed-rate investments 
over time, and a high-inflation environment can devastate fixed 
income. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have traditionally stayed ahead of inflation, but as  
retirees get older they typically shift more and more of their 
portfolio out of stocks into less volatile assets, such as bonds 
and cash. 
</P>
<P>
	I-bonds, consequently, can preserve your purchasing power  
regardless of how high inflation might climb. Furthermore, they are 
less volatile than conventional Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenhart likes I-bonds for another reason, too. ``These are nice  
for grandparents who want to help fund college for their 
granchildren,'' he says. Just as with EE bonds, interest earned on 
the I-bonds is exempt from income tax if it is used to pay for 
qualified education expenses, and as long as the owner's income 
isn't too high. Thus, you could give the I-bonds to your grandchild 
as a gift for school expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Lenhart emphasizes, you can buy up to S30,000 in  
I-bonds a year, which is far more than the maximum S500 you can put 
annually into an education IRA for your grandchild, or even the 
maximum S2,000 you can put annually into a Roth IRA which might be 
used for college. 
</P>
<P>
	A potential drawback is that there may be some gift-tax issues  
involved if you gift over S10,000 a year (S20,000 for you and your 
spouse) in bonds to your grandchild, Lenhart cautions. 
</P>
<P>
	I-bonds currently come in six denominations -- $50, $75, $1OO,  
$500, $1,000 and $5,000. Denominations of $200 and $10,000 are 
expected to be added this May. The bonds are bought at face value 
(EE bonds are bought at half of face value), and the value 
increases each month, with interest compounded semiannually. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenhart adds that the federal government has made I-bonds easy  
to buy with its Treasury Direct program. You avoid a broker 
transaction fee by buying them directly, either by phone at your 
local Federal Reserve branch or through its Web site 
www.publicdebttreas.gov. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Lenhart, ``For someone with 15 years left to save for  
retirement and who needs to be aggressive in their investing, 
inflation-indexed savings bonds probably aren't for them. But for 
retirees moving into less volatile assets or who want to help fund 
their grandchildren's education, these are diamonds in the rough.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. will soon announce further  
Internet-related investments, hoping to further extend its brand 
name online and take advantage of Wall Street's hunger for Internet 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Mel Karmazin told an entertainment industry  
conference Wednesday that the company would announce deals in 
coming months, but would not elaborate on when or where the 
investments might come. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to being one of the biggest players in the  
Internet business,'' Karmazin said. He added that it is a remote 
possibility that CBS could someday spin off its Internet holdings 
into a separate company. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS already owns lucrative stakes in MarketWatch.com Inc. and  
SportsLine USA Inc., which use the CBS name on their popular 
financial news and sports Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	MarketWatch.com stock soared as high as $130 when it went public  
in January but has fallen since to just below $67. Despite the 
decline, however, the money-losing company has been blessed with a 
market value of $784 million. 
</P>
<P>
	SportsLine stock has more than quadrupled since its IPO in  
November 1997, now trading near $44. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinton Vickers, a broadcasting analyst with ING Barings Furman  
Selz, said CBS has previously indicated a desire to boost its 
online holdings but has not made it clear which companies it might 
pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd expect they would do deals similar to SportsLine and  
MarketWatch, where they take an equity stake without having to put 
up much money,'' Vickers said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS and other big media companies have been more rapidly  
embracing the Internet to promote their TV shows, movies and music, 
while developing new sources of advertising revenue and electronic 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, CBS replaced ABC as the exclusive broadcast news  
provider to America Online, the world's largest Internet service 
provider, in a key move to increase its online visibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, rival NBC announced it would buy a minority  
stake in ValueVision, the third largest home-shopping cable 
network, trying to boost its electronic commerce business. ABC and 
ESPN owner Walt Disney Co. two months ago launched the Go Network, 
a Web site it is heavily promoting across its networks. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its broadcast network, CBS owns a huge collection  
of radio and TV stations, an outdoor advertising business and the 
Nashville Network and Country Music Television cable networks.

<HEADLINE> Stokes Named Va. Tech Hoops Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Ricky Stokes, a Virginia native and  
perennial contender for college coaching vacancies, was hired 
Wednesday as Virginia Tech's men's basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very ecstatic,'' Stokes said. ``I'm looking forward to the  
challenge, and I'm ready to take the Virginia Tech men's basketball 
program to new heights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first head job for Stokes, who succeeds Bobby Hussey,  
fired Monday after two seasons in which the Hokies went 23-32 and 
suffered a steep decline in home attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech isn't the first school to think Stokes, 36, can  
inject excitement into its program. The longtime assistant has 
previously turned down jobs at Virginia Commonwealth, Furman and 
East Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes worked this season under Rick Barnes at Texas, which won  
the Big 12 regular season title. He also has worked under Dave Odom 
at Wake Forest, Terry Holland and Jeff Jones at Virginia and Jim 
Larranaga at Bowling Green. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss him,'' Barnes said. ``There is no one more  
deserving or more ready for the challenge of being a Division I 
coach than coach Stokes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes' roots in Virginia basketball are deep.  
</P>
<P>
	A star guard at Highland Springs High School in suburban  
Richmond, he then played in a school-record 134 straight games at 
Virginia from 1981-84. He helped lead the Cavaliers to their only 
Final Four berths, in 1981 with Ralph Sampson at center, and in 
1984 after Sampson had graduated. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes inherits a team that loses only one senior of note,  
scoring leader Eddie Lucas, and should return at least four others 
who saw significant starting time during Hussey's tenure. Virginia 
Tech won seven of its last 11 games after a 6-11 start. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies, however, drew an average of 4,040 fans to  
10,052-seat Cassell Coliseum, the lowest average in the 38-year 
history of the coliseum and more than 1,000 per game fewer than the 
women's team attracted. 
</P>
<P>
	The declining fan interest, more than the record, prompted the  
change, athletic director Jim Weaver said Monday. As recently as 
1995-96, the Hokies finished 23-6 and went to the second round the 
of NCAA tournament while drawing an average of almost 8,400 fans 
for 11 home games at the coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussey, who did not speak with reporters Monday, faxed a  
statement to news outlets Wednesday in which he decried his firing 
as unfair and said he should have been able to coach the last two 
years of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have been given the opportunity to reap the rewards  
with these young men,'' the lengthy statement said. ``When you 
climb the mountain with someone, you would like to enjoy the view 
from the top with them also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hussey said he tried several times last week to schedule a  
meeting with Weaver, but had been told he was not available. He 
learned he was being fired during a meeting with Weaver 4 1/2 hours 
before the school announced the change.

<HEADLINE> State of Television Lamented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Surely you know what appointment TV is. It's  
programming you make a special effort to see. 
</P>
<P>
	But what do you call television that lets you down? Let's call  
it disappointment TV. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance: Sunday's Oscars telecast. Interminable, boring  
and, thanks to potty-mouthed host Whoopi Goldberg, raunchy. It was 
an award-winning disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	But not the only one these days.  
</P>
<P>
	Moderator Ken Bode getting bounced from PBS' ``Washington Week  
in Review.'' That was disappointing. ABC axing the romantic drama 
``Cupid.'' Very disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Walters' interview with Monica Lewinsky. Rosie  
O'Donnell's cold shoulder to that high school band from Georgia. 
O.J. Simpson's new TV gig doing commercials for lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Way disappointing.  
</P>
<P>
	And what about that disappointing new trend where TV networks --  
and I don't mean the Home Shopping Network -- have become product 
retailers, pitching stuff directly at you while you're watching 
their shows! 
</P>
<P>
	Remember NBC's toll-free number to order the soundtrack CD for  
its recent miniseries ``The '60s''? The network's goal, said one of 
its execs, ``is turning viewers into buying customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behold the new NBC: Must-Buy TV! From now on, don't watch the  
programs, watch your wallets. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, raise one last colortini to Tom Snyder, who  
disappointingly gives up the reins to his four-year-old ``Late Late 
Show'' after Friday's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	At 62, this big talker remains a unique TV personality. And as  
the art of TV interviewing submitted to glibness and irony (a 
specialty of his successor, Craig Kilborn), Snyder's self-described 
``old, fuddy-duddy, dinosaur show'' never lost its voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Now his time and talk are just about over.  
</P>
<P>
	And yet ... Snyder leaves with one former fan disappointed not  
so much that he's leaving, as in him. That's because, during an 
interview a year ago, Snyder chose to flat-out lie when asked how 
much longer he would stay on his CBS show. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have said ``I can't discuss that'' or ``I'll let you  
know'' or ``Nice tie.'' Instead, he inventively, elaborately 
streamed out a reply that likened doing his show to having dinner 
in a restaurant. As for calling for the check, ``I don't see it 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Truth was, Snyder's departure -- and his successor -- were already  
nailed down. 
</P>
<P>
	According to people who watch his show, Snyder recently  
expressed some sort of on-air apology to the reporters (there were 
more than one) he deceived. Nice try. But disappointingly too 
little, too late from a man who built a long career on straight 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder soon will be gone. But Bryant Gumbel, disappointingly,  
has already vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately for him, Gumbel isn't paid by the hour at CBS News.  
Nor was he shown the door upon his newsmagazine's demise after a 
dismal single season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly out of the public eye (as well as ``Public Eye'') since  
last September, Gumbel remains on the job, apparently given nothing 
to do and doing it well, while he collects his reported salary of 
nearly $5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's got to be disappointing to CBS shareholders, who  
presumably prefer a better return on their investment. 
</P>
<P>
	It's disappointing, too, to CBS News employees, who might like  
it better if Gumbel were pulling his weight. And maybe even 
disappointing to some viewers, who miss seeing him in action. 
</P>
<P>
	What could be more disappointing? Well, MSNBC.  
</P>
<P>
	With the July 1996 launch of its cable and online components, it  
was billed as a convergence work in progress, a pair of passing 
lanes on the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
	But the current lull in scandals to over-report finds MSNBC  
grinding its gears on the low road, and getting nowhere fast. 
Suddenly deprived of Bill and Monica to jaw about by the hour, the 
network seems more than ever a secondhand outlet for stories 
recycled from ``Today'' and ``Dateline NBC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Little wonder that Fox News Channel has closed in on MSNBC, and  
even beaten it, in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	How has MSNBC responded? Its new hire for a weeknight show  
called ``Equal Time'' is Oliver North, radio talk show host -- and a 
key figure in the Reagan Administration's Iran Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrewd move, MSNBC! If things don't get better soon, North can  
revert to his old ways and shred those disappointing Nielsen 
numbers before anybody sees them. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------

	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`GREAT MINDS': They were the defining events of the 20th  
Century: the development of the computer, the airplane, television, 
the atomic bomb. And behind each discovery was a human story, which

Discoveries.'' Safer profiles 20 remarkable people and interviews 
eyewitnesses to the century's greatest discoveries, ranging from 
Sigmund Freud's granddaughter to Francis Crick and James Watson,

<HEADLINE> Dollar Slips Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen and  
the euro Wednesday, unable to continue a mini-rally that began with 
the American-led NATO bombing of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said they were perplexed by the dollar's weakness  
because the advent of war typically is considered bullish for the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar should be stronger,'' said Hillel Waxman, chief  
foreign exchange dealer at Bank Leumi USA. ``Europe looks like 
junk. Japan still looks like junk ... (yet) we haven't found 
stability here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 117.89  
Japanese yen, down from 118.00. The euro was quoted at $1.0932, up 
from $1.0911. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was falling against the yen and the euro when  
President Clinton announced in late afternoon that bombing had 
gotten underway in Yugoslavia because its leader refused to make 
peace in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar immediately rose following the announcement but fell  
again a short while later. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only is war considered dollar-bullish, but the events  
leading up to the bombing should have pushed the dollar higher 
also. During economic or political turmoil such as war and 
preparation for war, the dollar is considered a safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
	That's especially true about the dollar's trades with the euro,  
since the new currency has mostly fallen since its launch in 
January, Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4645 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4585, and 1.5084 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5086. The British 
pound was quoted at $1.6353, down from $1.6377. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7892 German 
marks, down from 1.7926; 5.9988 French francs, down from 6.0119; 
and 1,769.91 Italian lire, down from 1,774.60.

<HEADLINE> Point Guards a Key to Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Ballhandling and running the offense  
are part of the job. The point guards at the Final Four drive their 
teams emotionally, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Mateen Cleaves guides Michigan State, Scoonie Penn carries Ohio  
State, Khalid El-Amin leads Connecticut and Duke dominates with 
William Avery implementing Mike Krzyzewski's game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This tournament has as good a four point guards as I've seen  
in a long time. They all may do different things, but the common 
ground for them is they all run their teams and have the respect of 
the other players,'' Michigan State's Tom Izzo said Wednesday 
during a conference of the coaches bringing teams to Tropicana 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves and Penn shared Big Ten player of the year honors.  
El-Amin does whatever is necessary to help Connecticut win, and 
Krzyzewski says Avery has improved in his first year as a starter 
as much as any point guard he's ever had. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as us coaches think we feel on the sidelines, somebody  
out on the court can feel the pulse of a team and the other team 
and react instinctively to that feel,'' Krzyzewski said of the role 
of the point guard. ``If you have a good one, it makes you look 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the floor leaders among the finalists leads his team in  
scoring, but there's no question where the Blue Devils, Buckeyes, 
Huskies and Spartans look for guidance in tight situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very simply, the people who have the ball in their hands the  
most time end up controlling the game. That's kind of a simple 
explanation of why all four of us, I'm sure, are here,'' said 
Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly in our case, Khalid has been our energizer. He was  
0-for-12 against Gonzaga and yet down the stretch still was the guy 
who made the difference ... He makes us go, not only physically but 
psychologically. He really truly is the guy the kids turn to for 
energy, for direction, and sometimes for courage. He's that type of 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, too, is Penn.  
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10 junior accompanied coach Jim O'Brien to Ohio State  
from Boston College two years ago and averaged just over 17 points 
and four assists for the Buckeyes after sitting out last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a coaching cliche, but he really is somebody who's  
coaching the guys,'' O'Brien said. ``If I just sat there and kept 
my mouth shut, you know things would get done the way you want them 
to be done because of Scoonie's knowledge of what should get 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun looks at Penn, who the Huskies are familiar with from  
his days in the Big East, and sees a lot of El-Amin, and vice 
versa. He said both players have a rare ability to make everyone 
around them better. 
</P>
<P>
	``You call it charisma, you call it energy, you call it  
leadership, you call it competitiveness. Those are attributes they 
both have and are able to impart to their teammates. That's a very, 
very unusual characteristic to have, not only in sport but in 
life,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves averaged 11.7 points and 7.1 assists to help Michigan  
State with the Big Ten title. An erratic shooter, he makes up for 
it by getting others involved offensively and by spearheading the 
team's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo can't imagine where the Spartans would be without him.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no secret his shot is missing in action one in a  
while, but the rest of his game,'' Izzo said without completing the 
sentence. ``When he turns up the defense, it seems like the rest of 
the players react.''

	NATO Set To Attack Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. B-52 bombers took off from  
their base in Britain today, and air raid sirens sounded in 
Kosovo's capital after NATO gave the go-ahead for allied airstrikes 
on Yugoslavia. British reports said eight B-52 bombers armed with 
20 cruise missiles each flew out this morning. They are on standby 
for a strike on Serb targets. The refusal of Yugoslav leader 
Slobodan Milosevic to sign onto a peace plan, despite threats of 
airstrikes, prompted NATO officials to order allied military 
action. Any attack, officials said, would likely come after dark. 

</P>
<P>
	Pentagon Prepares Yugoslavia Attack  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and allied forces are ready to strike  
Yugoslavia, and military officials say NATO commander Gen. Wesley 
Clark is just waiting for the right moment to order an attack. A 
bombing of Serb targets is likely to begin after dark. The strike 
is expected to begin with a U.S.-led barrage of sea- and 
air-launched cruise missiles that would target Yugoslav air 
defenses. 

</P>
<P>
	Serbs Brace for Bombing Attack  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Streets are unusually deserted and  
people went on last-minute shopping sprees today as Serbs braced 
for an expected NATO attack. Many people stayed home with their 
families and did not send their children to schools, anticipating 
the strikes. The Belgrade city council issued detailed instructions 
in case of bombing. Some said the wait for the airstrikes was the 
most painful element. Graffiti scrawled on a wall on Belgrade's 
main street said, ``Finish this bombing off so I can start painting 
my apartment.''

<P>
	Faulty Rudder Blamed in 737 Crashes  
</P>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board  
today declared that a rudder reversal caused the 1994 crash of 
USAir Flight 427 outside Pittsburgh, as well as a 1991 crash in 
Colorado and another near-crash in 1996. The safety panel said the 
current design of the rudder system on the Boeing 737 -- the type of 
plane involved in all three cases -- is not ``reliably redundant.'' 
The 737 is the only commercial aircraft that has two rudder control 
systems which merge in a single hydraulic valve. The USAir crash 
killed all 132 aboard.

	Court Upholds Pinochet Arrest  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's highest court today upheld Gen. Augusto  
Pinochet's arrest on charges of crimes against humanity, dashing 
the former Chilean dictator's hopes of immediately returning home. 
A House of Lords tribunal ruled that Pinochet is not entitled to 
immunity from arrest, despite his status as a former head of state. 
But the judges ruled that the 83-year-old general cannot be 
prosecuted for any acts alleged before 1988, when Britain signed 
the International Convention Against Torture. He must remain under 
police guard in Britain while Spain seeks his extradition on the 
remaining counts.

	Anti-Apartheid Activist Gets Prison  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- A judge today sentenced former  
anti-apartheid hero Allan Boesak to six years in prison for 
defrauding donors to a charity he headed. Boesak was convicted last 
week on four counts of fraud and theft from foreign donors 
including singer Paul Simon and a Swedish government aid agency. He 
used some of the $400,000, donated to a charity he headed, to buy 
two houses in plush Cape Town suburbs. The judge did acknowledged 
that Boesak played an important part in ridding South Africa of the 
hated system of apartheid.

drag. Charles Rice plans to wear a red, floor-length evening gown, 
red satin shoes, gloves and matching rhinestone jewelry to 
Saturday's prom. Taylor High School Principal Peter Oatman changed 
his mind after conferring with attorneys. ``I should have the 
freedom to express myself,'' said the 18-year-old senior, who is

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Boxing legend Muhammad Ali became the latest  
to question the controversial draw in the recent title fight 
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, calling the result 
``the biggest fix in fight history.'' Ali sent a letter to Senate 
Commerce Committee chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., which said he was 
humiliated the sport ``had sunk to its lowest levels.'' McCain 
introduced a bill earlier this year which would restrict coercive 
option contracts by which promoters control a boxers' career. The 
draw has sparked several investigations.

<HEADLINE> Trial in Wyo. Gay Slaying To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Police stepped up patrols today outside the  
courthouse for the trial of one of two men accused of murdering gay 
college student Matthew Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no protesters before the court session got under way,  
but authorities set aside areas for them during the trial of 
Russell Henderson, 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-gay protesters and gay rights advocates have clashed  
repeatedly over the Shepard case. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson is accused of pistol-whipping Shepard, lashing him to  
a fence in Wyoming's high plains and leaving him to die last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection was to begin today, with opening statements  
scheduled for April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Osborn, who attended grade school with Shepard and remained  
his friend, stopped by the courthouse on his way to work to 
remember Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is: My friend is dead,'' Osborn said.  
``Matt was a person. He wasn't just a gay man. Nothing can bring 
him back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about having to endure the trials of the two murder  
suspects, Osborn said, ``It's going to be very difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and his co-defendant, Aaron McKinney, 21, both face  
the death penalty if convicted in a case that has become a central 
focus for gay rights activists and others seeking stronger bias 
crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Shepard's mother asked Congress and state  
legislatures to enact bias crime laws to deter future acts of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes  
from happening. But they can reduce them,'' Judy Shepard said at a 
news conference in Washington, D.C. ``They can help change the 
climate in this country, where some people feel it is okay to 
target specific groups of people and get away with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only that she  
and her husband ``want to allow justice to run its course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Henderson and McKinney, both high-school  
dropouts, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound 
Shepard out of a bar last October and then kidnapped and beat him. 
The political science major at the University of Wyoming died five 
days later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney is scheduled to stand trial in August.  
</P>
<P>
	After the attack, Laramie found itself portrayed as a backwards,  
homophobic outpost of Wild West-style violence and 
small-mindedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Hoover, a jury consultant based in Raleigh, N.C., said  
jurors may be eager to show that the people of Laramie, population 
26,000, are progressive, law-abiding folks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've got a small town where nothing like this has ever  
happened, then they are definitely going to do their best to 
portray that they care,'' she said. ``They don't want the world to 
think that's the type of thing that happens in their town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City spokesman Randy Vickers said police have set up fences to  
keep news reporters and demonstrators at bay, and access to the 
Albany County Courthouse has been limited to one door, where two 
metal detectors have been installed. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is expected to last five weeks.

<HEADLINE> Textbook Commercialization Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Book covers, lunchroom signs and football  
scoreboards plastered with soda names are nothing new for schools, 
which display the logos in exchange for donations. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say a textbook that uses M&AMP;M candies to help  
students simplify fractions is going too far into the murky 
territory of commercialization. 
</P>
<P>
	The textbook's publishers, McGraw-Hill Inc., received no money  
for the photos of M&AMP;Ms and other popular brand name products used 
to enhance math word problems. But in California, advocates and 
lawmakers are pushing to get the textbook, which is used in at 
least 15 other states, removed from the state's school curricula. 
They want to pass a law banning commercial images in school 
materials that don't serve a specific purpose. The book, called 
``Mathematics: Applications and Connections,'' did pass a review of 
textbooks by the state education department. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another new scheme somebody somewhere has dreamed  
up,'' said Andrew Hagelshaw, of the Center for Commercial-Free 
Public Education in Oakland, Calif. ``It is a stroke of genius 
because students are required to use textbooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Allen, McGraw-Hill's spokesman, said the Nike, Kellogg's  
Cocoa Frosted Flakes and other brand photos and trademark names are 
used simply to give sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders some 
examples they can appreciate. No money changed hands, he stressed, 
and McGraw-Hill does not consider them advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, in one word problem, a student named Will is asked  
to save his allowance for a pair of Nikes, not Rockport or Nine 
West shoes, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The names are picked solely on editorial criteria,'' Allen  
said of the textbook, first published in 1995 and revised for this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Mason, a McGraw-Hill employee who trains teachers on  
how to use the textbook, said teachers and students are more 
focused on math than products. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't even notice these things,'' Mason said. ``They just  
see a book that is engaging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, local ads helped pay for high school yearbooks  
and football stadium scoreboards. For the last 20 years, school 
budgets have gotten tighter, and businesses have gotten more 
aggressive in courting the youth market. 
</P>
<P>
	Channel One, one of the most controversial commercial ventures  
in schools, was launched in 1989. A daily mix of news and 
advertising broadcast to 12,000 schools nationwide, Channel One 
offers free television sets and satellite dishes to schools that 
reserve time for students to watch the show. Some communities have 
curbed its use. 
</P>
<P>
	In other schools, Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola fight for exclusive  
contracts to put machines on campus in exchange for donations and 
some profits. Others raise money by putting company logos in 
hallways or on school buses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've taken the designer label culture one more step,'' said  
Gilbert T. Sewall, the president of the American Textbook Council, 
which reviews social studies and history textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	The critic of such product placements says they do not make the  
word problems any more appealing or concrete or comprehensible to a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be more than enough and entirely proper in a  
word problem to say two cookies instead of two Oreos,'' said 
Sewall. 
</P>
<P>
	Such products can even be harmful, said Hagelshaw, mentioning  
sugary or high-fat snacks, fast food and candy. 
</P>
<P>
	Another critic, Harriet Tyson, the author of ``A Conspiracy of  
Good Intentions: America's Textbook Fiasco,'' said school 
officials, whose jobs are increasingly tied to student test scores 
and school ratings, are often swayed by flashy graphics and 
publishers' focus on education buzzwords. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shallowness is the main problem,'' Tyson said. ``They don't  
search for books children will read, understand and love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But specific products do help connect the math problems to the  
real world, contends Richard Blake, who heads the Association of 
American Publishers' school division, which doesn't issue 
guidelines on using brand names. 
</P>
<P>
	``McGraw-Hill or any other publishers are not interested in how  
many tennis shoes Nike sells, or how many hamburgers McDonald's 
sells,'' said Blake. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking generally, not about the McGraw-Hill book a spokeswoman  
for the nation's largest teachers' union said tight budgets could 
make schools think twice about walking away from the commercialism 
of brand names. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may want to say that philosophically it's not the right  
thing to do,'' said Kathleen Lyons of the National Education 
Association. ``The bottom line is that schools need resources and 
businesses know that.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Offered To Aid VA Nurses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average federal employee got a 3.6 percent  
raise this year, but some nurses who work in VA hospitals got 
nothing or had their salaries cut. Under legislation introduced 
Tuesday, that would change beginning next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill remedies an injustice that has gone on for too many  
years,'' said Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, co-sponsor of a bill 
guaranteeing the nurses would get at least as much of a pay raise 
as other federal workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no way to treat those who care for our nation's ailing  
veterans, and we have an obligation to fix it,'' said Rep. Steve 
LaTourette, R-Ohio, the bill's lead sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	It is legal for hospitals run by the Veterans Health  
Administration to freeze or cut nurses' pay because of a law 
intended to allow bigger-than-average pay raises for nurses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nurse Pay Act of 1990 was meant to give agency  
administrators flexibility to offer competitive wages in a time of 
nursing shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortage then hitting the health-care industry eased shortly  
after the law took effect, but administrators at many department 
facilities either took advantage of the newfound wage flexibility 
to stretch their budgets or interpreted the law as requiring 
rollbacks and freezes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kenneth Kizer, head of the Veterans Health Administration,  
sent out memos last year strongly urging directors of medical 
centers to raise pay in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Most raised pay by an average 3 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	But nurses in Boston; Johnson City, Tenn.; Iowa City, Iowa; and  
Long Beach, Calif. got no raises, and some categories of nurses in 
St. Louis; Wichita, Kan.; Bay Pines, Fla.; and Sheridan, Wyo. had 
their salaries reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital spokesmen said the directors abided by the law, doing  
the required survey of salaries at other area hospitals and 
determining that no pay raises were necessary to keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in his legal rights not to raise it,'' Boston  
spokeswoman Kristine Graney said. ``A survey was done of 
Boston-area hospitals, and the salary range for the VA is right in 
the midlevel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Johnson City, Tenn., it was a different situation.  
</P>
<P>
	``This year in our community there were a lot of cutbacks'' at  
private hospitals, said Susan Moss-Cureton, head nurse at the 
Mountain Home VA Medical Center. ``Our salaries were above average, 
so that we did not warrant an increase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean that Ms. Moss-Cureton agrees her nursing staff  
didn't deserve a cost-of-living adjustment. ``There are some things 
wrong with the system,'' she said. ``I support changing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaTourette's legislation would take the comparable-salary  
surveys out of the hands of medical center directors and transfer 
the responsibility to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

<HEADLINE> Do 'How's My Driving?' Decals Help? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``How's My Driving?'' stickers were once the  
butt of jokes, considered ``Big Brother'' on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the decals are affixed to hundreds of thousands of  
18-wheelers and other commercial vehicles rolling across America. 
And rising cell phone use has resulted in an increase in calls to 
phone numbers displayed on the vehicles -- and the occasional firing 
of an unsafe driver. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade old, ``How's My Driving?'' gets mixed reviews.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not scared of answering to safety,'' said Dan Hallford, a  
trucker from Montgomery, Ala., who thinks they're a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wallace Harris, a driver from Vernon, Ala., doesn't think  
they make the roads any safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get too many people getting mad at truckers and just  
calling in,'' Harris said. ``People will call in and I will have no 
way to defend myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies answer their own complaint calls from motorists.  
Others hire firms like FleetSafe or DriverCheck, both in Atlanta, 
Safety Alert Network in Metairie, La., and DriversAlert in Boca 
Raton, Fla., to collect the comments and compile incident reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Convinced they make drivers more safety-conscious, some  
insurance companies offer discounted premiums to fleets whose 
trucks carry the decals. Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. pays for 
monitoring 30,000 commercial vehicles operated by companies it 
insures, says Paul Farrell, loss control manager. 
</P>
<P>
	And it pays off, he said: ``Fleets that use the program have 20  
percent fewer accidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, skepticism surrounds ``How's My Driving?'' programs.  
</P>
<P>
	``The drivers say `Isn't this Big Brother watching me?'''  
Farrell said. ``The general public -- they may be a little bit wary 
of giving their name and phone number. That information is 
protected, but if somebody's not clued in to how the whole system 
works, they might feel like, `Gee, is there going to be a nasty, 
crazy driver knocking on my door tomorrow?''' 
</P>
<P>
	That misconception didn't dissuade David Reiner from grabbing a  
cell phone in his pickup truck and calling a toll-free ``How's My 
Driving?'' number on the back of a delivery van that braked 
suddenly on a busy road in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiner says the van driver glared at him in his rearview mirror,  
then stomped on his brakes again -- and again -- and again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what I did to make him angry -- but he kept  
slamming his brakes in front of me. It almost seemed like he was 
trying to get me to rear-end him,'' Reiner of Arleta, Calif., told 
a representative of FleetSafe. 
</P>
<P>
	FleetSafe could not disclose what, if anything, happened to the  
van driver. But to help validate complaints, the company asks 
motorists detailed questions about the incident being reported. 
</P>
<P>
	FleetSafe's call center asked Reiner: What type of vehicle was  
it? (``A white van.'') Was the weather clear and dry? (``A little 
cloudy.'') Was traffic light or heavy? (``Moderate.'') His 
complaint then was faxed to the delivery company, which would 
decide whether to discipline the driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, safety directors at some trucking companies worry the  
decals give motorists a venue to vent frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	Bored drivers sometimes call in petty complaints, says Donna  
Eastman, safety director for LaValle Transportation Inc., of 
Potsdam , N.Y., which has 50 trucks displaying the company's phone 
number. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a truck passes their car and it's raining and they get  
their windshield all yucked up, people will call and say 'Well, he 
was really speeding.''' Ms. Eastman said. ``Sometimes you get 
somebody who has a grudge against a driver and are just calling to 
get them in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the exception, not the rule, says Ken Rees, national  
sales manager for DriverCheck. He says trucking companies tell him 
that only a handful of complaints are false, vindictive or invalid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety percent of the incidents are caused by only 10 percent  
of the drivers,'' Rees said. ``The idea is to pinpoint that small 
body of folks and change their behavior through counseling and 
safety programs -- before an accident occurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 90 percent of the drivers are never targets of a  
complaint, says FleetSafe president Richard Lea. About 85 percent 
of the calls concern such things as tailgating, improper lane 
changes, speeding or running stop lights or signs, he says, while 
10 percent are compliments and 5 percent report emergencies or 
other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Truck companies use the reports to spot problem drivers, says  
Jim Reali, regional safety manager for SYSCO Corp., a Houston-based 
company with decals on about 3,000 of its 7,000 trucks. He says the 
company, which received 435 incident reports last year, does not 
usually fire a driver for one complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we start seeing a trend on one employee, he is given a  
reprimand first,'' Reali said. ``Normal policy would be to make 
sure he's retrained or goes through a safe driving course.''

<HEADLINE> Magic To Refurbish Brooklyn Theater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Magic Johnson has agreed to overhaul and restore  
a theater that has been closed for 22 years, the latest addition to 
his chain of movie houses in underdeveloped urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The former basketball great's company, Magic Johnson Theaters,  
will transform the 1920s-era Flatbush Avenue cinema in Brooklyn 
into a cutting-edge 12-screen complex. The $30 million multiplex 
would open in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson announced the deal at City Hall on Tuesday with city  
officials. City and state governments have supported the venture 
with low-interest loans and tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The city plans to sign a long-term lease permitting Johnson and  
his Sony Corp. partners to refurbish the Loews theater, which has 
been owned by the city since 1978 when it was seized for nonpayment 
of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that we are going to have a great success here in  
Brooklyn, a theater that everybody will be proud of and everybody 
will come and support,'' said Johnson, who has built theaters in 
Atlanta, Houston and Los Angeles since he retired from basketball. 
``We will continue to be a community-based theater. That's what we 
do different than any other theater chain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's theaters typically are in neglected black communities  
and offer additional services not usually found at movie theaters, 
such as reading programs for children and free blood pressure 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Loews Kings Theater had 3,200 seats, a pink marble lobby and  
art deco, baroque and Renaissance architecture. Plans call for 
preserving the facade and some interior features, but dividing the 
huge auditorium into a multiplex. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a historical theater,'' Johnson said, ``and we want to  
preserve some of that history that is has but also build a 
brand-new theater.''

<HEADLINE> Freed Inmate Charged With Battery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Former death row inmate Anthony Porter walked out  
of custody for the second time in six weeks, saying he had to ``get 
my life together'' after being jailed on domestic battery charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm innocent and no comment right now,'' said the 43-year-old  
Porter, who came within days of execution and spent more than 16 
years in prison for two killings he didn't commit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got to go home, you understand, and get my life together,''  
he told reporters as he left the Cook County Jail on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, who was freed from death row largely through the efforts  
of a Northwestern University journalism class, was jailed again 
Tuesday on domestic battery charges. Police said he attacked one of 
his daughters, Evelyn Porter, and her mother, Carlia Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was beating my mom,'' the 26-year-old Porter told the  
Chicago Tribune. ``He was punching her in the face and chest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter was released on Wednesday after posting bond. Attorney  
Daniel Sanders said a Porter relative had put up the bond money. 
</P>
<P>
	Another man has said he is responsible for the two 1982 fatal  
shootings for which Porter was convicted. Gov. George Ryan pardoned 
Porter of the killings on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Exhibit of Picasso's Ceramics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- To get a sense of the ceramics of Pablo Picasso,  
imagine the curves of a vase turning into a bikini-clad woman. Or 
picture a plate with fish and fork baked on its surface, or a 
pitcher spouting the beak and plumes of a fantastic bird. 
</P>
<P>
	The full range of the cubist master's ceramics -- some of his  
most playful and accessible works -- are on display until June 6 at 
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in an exhibition called ``Picasso: 
Painter and Sculptor in Clay.'' The show features work that was 
long derided by critics as superficial. 
</P>
<P>
	Organized by the Royal Academy of Arts in London, the exhibit  
includes more than 175 rarely exhibited works that Picasso made 
after World War II in southern France. 
</P>
<P>
	``Picasso's involvement was so profound and personal -- as well  
as being unfashionable at the time -- that, until recently, it went 
unrecognized as a significant part of his oeuvre,'' writes his son, 
Claude Picasso, in an essay introducing the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	Gouging scenes of bullfights into flat plates, washing blue  
tints of cubist nudes over tiles, or wrapping a yellow bikini 
around a red earthenware vase, Picasso made thousands of ceramics 
that bear his iconic imagery and signature techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are the bleak wartime images he produced while trapped in  
Nazi-occupied Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``Picasso's years in the south of France were among his  
happiest, and exuberant joy and Mediterranean light are reflected 
in the painted three-dimensional sculptures he created in clay,'' 
writes Philippe de Montebello, director of the Met. 
</P>
<P>
	Picasso began working intensively in ceramic in 1946 at the  
Madoura pottery workshop in Vallauris at the invitation of owners 
Georges and Suzanne Ramie. 
</P>
<P>
	Painting and sculpting vessels made by Madoura artisans, he  
reinvented the technical aspects of painting on clay, decorating 
press-molded plates by mixing enamels with oxides and glazes whose 
colors surfaced only after firing. 
</P>
<P>
	He molded fish and a lemon slice, and fried eggs and sausage,  
onto platters to create his version of the Spanish ``platos de 
engano'' (``plates to fool the eye''), and he created large-scale 
mosaics out of a few multicolored tiles. 
</P>
<P>
	He pulled hips and breasts from curvy vases fresh off the  
potter's wheel, and made sketches for skilled Madoura artisans to 
turn into jugs he would later paint as kneeling goats or birds 
being tossed into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carried away by his vital need to discover all, he suddenly  
succumbed with infinite delight to the temptation ... to penetrate 
the mystery of earth and fire,'' wrote Georges Ramie in his 1974 
book, ``Picasso's Ceramics,'' published in French the year after 
Picasso died at 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Picasso worked in what Ramie called a fury of incessant  
activity, creating so many pieces that were stacked in piles on the 
floor -- despite their value. 
</P>
<P>
	The artist remade classical ceramic forms in his own image. He  
painted his profile on fragments like those found in Etruscan 
tombs, sculpted his lovers into hourglass-shaped Tanagra vases of 
the Hellenistic period, molded his beloved flute players around 
Greek-style amphorae. 
</P>
<P>
	Picasso put much of his daily life into the ceramics, incising  
the ballet of the Sunday bullfights he saw, reprinting the 
communist newspapers he read, pressing the bones of fish he ate for 
lunch into wet clay. In his clay works, he both celebrated and 
dominated his companion, Francoise Gilot, mother of Claude. 
</P>
<P>
	He glorifies her beauty throughout his clay works, but painted  
her portrait on the flame side of two casserole pots. William S. 
Lieberman, a curator of the Met exhibit, notes that what appears to 
be a birthmark at the corner of her mouth in an earthenware mask 
actually represents the burn mark left on Gilot after Picasso once 
took a cigarette to her face. 
</P>
<P>
	This full view of Picasso's life today emerges from the ceramic  
medium, which London-based scholar Marilyn McCully notes, enabled 
Picasso to paint in the round: fish swimming, snakes slithering 
down jugs, mythological figures chasing one another around a vase. 
</P>
<P>
	And it is thanks to this new appreciation of his long ignored  
work that visitors to the exhibit, which ends in New York City, can 
also see an extra dimension of Picasso's work, the original way he 
shaped ceramic forms. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Picasso had the ability to respect and follow the  
traditions of ceramics from ancient times through its present 
popular form, he was also able to reinvent the medium with enormous 
enthusiasm and originality by painting and sculpting in clay on his 
own terms,'' says McCully.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs Minn. Indians' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a case closely watched by Indian tribes,  
the Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the Chippewas' right to hunt 
and fish on 13 million acres of public land in central Minnesota 
free of state regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight Chippewa bands got the hunting and fishing privileges  
under an 1837 treaty, and neither a presidential order in 1850 nor 
Minnesota's statehood took them away, the court said in a 5-4 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``After an examination of the historical record, we conclude  
that the Chippewa retain the ... rights guaranteed to them under 
the 1837 treaty,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has been hotly debated in Minnesota, largely because  
of fears that the Indians would take too much fish from Lake Mille 
Lacs, one of the state's prime walleye lakes. Gov. Jesse Ventura 
recently drew criticism for saying that Indians who assert treaty 
rights ``ought to be back in birch-bark canoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to move forward and not look behind us,'' he said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was a welcome victory for Indian tribes nationally,  
who had been losing some key legal battles with state and local 
governments, including a 1996 Supreme Court decision that gave 
states the upper hand in conflicts over Indian gambling operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Many tribes in the Midwest and Pacific Northwest claim special  
rights to hunt and fish off their reservations. ``There's no 
question that this is a decision that has far-ranging impact,'' 
said Ron Allen, president of the National Congress of American 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision shows ``treaties still have the power and vigor  
they had when they were signed,'' said Mark Jarboe, a Minneapolis 
attorney who specializes in Indian law. Each treaty case is 
different, however, and must be decided on its own merits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa sued the state in 1990,  
challenging its authority to impose hunting and fishing regulations 
on tribal members. The federal government and seven other Chippewa 
bands in Minnesota and Wisconsin joined the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later  
sided with the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty gave the Chippewa Indians the rights to hunt and fish  
``during the pleasure of the president'' on land it ceded to the 
federal government. But Minnesota's lawyers contended that 
President Zachary Taylor ended those rights when he ordered the 
Chippewas to leave the land 13 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chippewas opposed the removal order, and the federal  
government never enforced it. The bands continued to hunt and fish 
in the ceded territories. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor said Taylor didn't have the authority to remove the  
Chippewas, and she also rejected the state's arguments that the 
hunting and fishing privileges would have ended when Minnesota 
became a state in 1858. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian treaty rights can be revoked only when Congress clearly  
states its intent to do so, and the legislation admitting Minnesota 
into the union made no mention of them, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the four dissenting justices, Chief Justice William  
Rehnquist said Taylor's order ending the Chippewas' treaty 
privileges was valid, adding, ``There is simply no principled 
reason to invalidate the 150-year-old executive order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Minnesota vs. Mille Lacs Band, 97-1337.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Figure Tried for Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Whitewater figure David Hale tricked  
state regulators by putting $150,000 into his insurance company's 
bank account to show it was financially stable -- then withdrawing 
the money days later, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawyers for Hale told jurors at the start of trial Tuesday  
that their client did nothing illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an innocent explanation for everything the state is  
going to show you,'' said defense attorney David Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale is accused of lying to the state Insurance Department about  
the financial health of the National Savings Life Insurance 
Company. Because of two guilty pleas in the federal Whitewater 
case, he faces an enhanced sentence of eight years in state prison 
if convicted, instead of a three-year maximum. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Larry Jegley told jurors that Hale shuffled money in  
and out of the company to deceive the insurance regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening statement, Bowden said Hale's prosecution was  
over a technicality and that no one lost money and that no one ever 
had a claim denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale pleaded guilty in the Whitewater case to two felonies and  
served 21 months of a 28-month sentence. He was a key witness 
against then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and James and Susan McDougal at 
their 1996 fraud trial. All three were convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The McDougals were business partners with President Clinton and  
Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater land development. Hale had 
once claimed Clinton pressured him to make an illegal loan. Clinton 
denied the allegation.

<HEADLINE> Fifth Alaska Avalanche Victim Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- The death toll in a weekend avalanche  
rose to five Wednesday as searchers found the body of one of two 
missing men who had been snowmobiling in Turnagain Pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Air Force Tech Sgt. Victor Jones was found after  
searchers found his snowmobile under four feet of densely packed 
snow, State Trooper spokesman Greg Wilkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was the fifth person found dead after being buried by a  
mile-wide wall of snow that roared down a mountainside on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 350 searchers who swarmed over the avalanche debris  
zone were concentrating on the upper part of the ridge, looking for 
Aaron Arthur, 29, of Palmer, who also disappeared in the avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur's snowmobile was found shortly after the avalanche, but  
eyewitnesses said his body was thrown when the 30-foot wall of snow 
hit him. 
</P>
<P>
	Trooper First Sgt. Paul Burke said the search would continue  
Thursday, but he was not sure how long it would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The avalanche hit about 55 miles south of Anchorage.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Gloomy in the Face of Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Streets were unusually deserted,  
people went on last-minute panic shopping sprees and cars queued 
for gasoline in Belgrade today as gloom engulfed Serbs awaiting 
NATO strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	People showed a mixture of defiance and fear toward the Western  
military alliance, aware it could strike any moment against Serbian 
strategic targets for their leaders' rejection of a U.S.-sponsored 
peace plan for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``This waiting for strikes is killing me,'' said Jasmina  
Perunovic, a 26-year-old medical student in the Serbian and 
Yugoslav capital. ``If they want to bomb us, they should do it now 
so we end this painful wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graffiti scrawled on a wall on Belgrade's main street said,  
``Finish this bombing off so I can start painting my apartment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents who rely solely on state-run media, however, were  
not even aware of imminent strikes, because the Tuesday night order 
by NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana for the attack to begin was 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	But Belgraders who watch foreign news broadcasts on satellite  
broadcasts went on last-minute shopping sprees for flour, cooking 
oil, sugar and other staples. They waited for hours in gasoline 
queues, while the authorities banned the sale of diesel because all 
its supplies are intended for the Yugoslav army. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people stayed home with their families and did not send  
their children to schools, anticipating the strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgrade city council issued detailed instructions in case  
of bombing, including the sound and length of air raid sirens, as 
well as how to rescue someone from the basement of a collapsed 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomb shelters, unused in emergency since World War II when both  
Germans and Americans bombed Belgrade, were cleaned up during the 
last NATO threat in October. Most have been turned into cafes or 
discos, as the Serbs never anticipated they would ever again face 
the possibility of strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the danger, supporters of hardline Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic were defiant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American cowards will fire their missiles from a  
distance,'' said Milan Stanic, a worker. ``If they are so brave, 
why don't they come here and fight us like real men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of Milosevic think NATO strikes will actually help him  
cement his strongman rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, he'll purge all the media, jail opposition leaders and  
impose total dictatorship and there will be no West to help us,'' 
said student Zoran Dimitrijevic, 24. ``If the Americans think they 
will bend Milosevic with the bombs, they are dead wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the ultranationalist Radicals, allied with  
Milosevic, have reportedly been preparing their gangs -- dreaded 
``troikas''-- to strike at well-known pro-Western Belgraders, 
foreigners and foreign journalists as soon as the first NATO bomb 
falls on Serbian soil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darkness will cover Serbia for the decades to come and no one  
will be here to switch the light on,'' Dimitrijevic said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Criticizes Aid to N. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans registered doubts  
Wednesday about the Clinton administration's plan to send $60 
million in food aid to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite U.S. concern over North Korea's totalitarian rule, the  
country now is the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid in East 
Asia, said Rep. Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the House 
International Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid announced Monday brings the total to $225 million for this  
year, said Gilman, R-N.Y. Yet, he said, nuclear blackmail by North 
Korea is ``virtually certain to come at some future point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's evident that the administration has adopted a policy of  
accommodation to engage and ultimately to moderate Pyongyang's 
reckless behavior, and that seems to be failing,'' Gilman said at a 
hearing on U.S. policy toward the communist state. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats at the hearing disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut said the administration had  
done an ``excellent job'' in getting North Korea to agree to 
nuclear and missile inspections and in responding to the 
humanitarian plight of the country's people. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., accused Republicans of trying to  
boost North Korea as a major adversary. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me that the majority is inclined to want to  
recreate a Cold War environment with whatever new recreated Soviet 
Union it can find,'' Pomeroy said. He Gilman's prediction of 
certain confrontation is ``clearly unfounded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration insists the stepped-up food aid  
announced Monday and the inspection agreement achieved last week 
are unrelated. But two top Asian experts told the committee that's 
not the way North Korea sees it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't get it. They look at you as probably the biggest  
sucker of all time that would give them money as they threaten you 
with military action,'' said James Lilley, a longtime U.S. diplomat 
now an analyst with the American Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Times, meanwhile, reported Wednesday that vital  
parts of a 50-megawatt North Korean nuclear reactor have been 
missing since international inspectors first visited the site at 
Yongbyon under the 1994 nuclear-freeze agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman called the report and other evidence of continued nuclear  
weapons activity in North Korea ``distressing.''

<HEADLINE> Spartans Look Strong for Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan State is hoping to beat Duke and  
then either Connecticut or Ohio State for the NCAA basketball 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if top-ranked Duke sends the Spartans packing Saturday  
night, Michigan State fans can take heart. With only three players 
graduating and some hot new prospects headed for campus, another 
NCAA run next year looks likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot depends on who leaves from this team,'' said Bob  
Gibbons, who ranks college recruits at All Star Sports Publications 
in Lenoir, N.C. ``But from a talent standpoint, they could be even 
stronger next year than this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant athletic director John Farina said he's upbeat about  
next year's team, even as he's hoping this year's team wins the 
national title. 
</P>
<P>
	``The future does look pretty bright,'' he said. ``With the  
number of key players coming back and the incoming class rated in 
the top 10, it appears things will be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seniors Antonio Smith, Jason Klein and Thomas Kelley are the  
only three players who definitely won't be returning. Junior Mateen 
Cleaves, the team's first-team All American, has not decided 
whether to return for his senior year or go to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Cleaves' defection would be partly offset by the  
strength of new recruits, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
	He points to newcomers such as Jason Richardson, a 6-foot-6  
forward at Saginaw Arthur Hill who received the Mr. Basketball 
award Monday and will join the Spartans next season. Last fall, 
Gibbons ranked Richardson eighth among recruits nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Another new force next fall will be Mike Chappell, a 6-9 forward  
from Southfield Lathrup High who transferred to Michigan State last 
summer after playing for Duke two years. He'll still have two years 
of eligibility left. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the team next year will be freshmen Jason Andreas, a  
6-10 center from Sugar Creek, Ohio, and Adam Wolfe, a 6-8 forward 
from Westerville South High School in Ohio. Redshirt David Thomas, 
a 6-7 swingman, will play as a junior next year. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Spartans will still have 3-point whiz A.J. Granger,  
bench star Morris Peterson and starters Andre Hutson and Charlie 
Bell on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the Spartans don't win any more games in the NCAA  
tournament, making it to the Final Four will help coach Tom Izzo 
and his staff recruit more top prospects, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't put a market value on how much that means in  
exposure and with future recruits. Every kid in Michigan has now 
got to be dreaming of being a Spartan,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State is in the same position Michigan was in during  
the early 1990s, when the Fab Five had every high school basketball 
player mimicking their baggy shorts and longing to wear maize and 
blue, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michigan State was really unable to break through'' in  
recruiting those years, he said. ``Michigan had such a stranglehold 
on the top prospects in your state. It was a great imbalance 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All that has changed. The Wolverines finished 12-19, missing a  
postseason berth for the first time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	And Izzo's years of recruiting in Michigan's shadow are over, at  
least for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's noteworthy that the Spartans are now the dominant  
recruiting school in Michigan,'' Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
	That could help them in future years pull in Marcus Taylor of  
Waverly High School near Lansing, now ranked among the top juniors 
in the country. Or young up-and-comers such as Robert Whaley of 
Benton Harbor and Kelvin Torbert of Flint Northwestern, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michigan State has had an outstanding recruiting class this  
year,'' Gibbons said. ``It could be the beginning of not going 
every 20 years'' to the Final Four, but much more often.

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Hasek Out With Bad Twist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek  
practiced with the team Wednesday, a day after suffering a twisted 
back in a collision during a game against New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the injury did not appear to be serious, Hasek was  
taken out of the lineup for Wednesday's game at Detroit as a 
precaution, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek was skating back in the crease when he was hit by Devils  
rookie Brendan Morrison with 49 seconds remaining in overtime 
Tuesday. The goaltender laid on the ice for several minutes before 
getting up and finishing the game, which ended 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody hit my head, and I felt a big pain between my  
shoulders,'' Hasek said after the game. ``I was afraid to move. Now 
I can move everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek returned to the Sabres lineup March 19 after taking a  
month off with a strained groin. Buffalo went 5-4-3 during his 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres Wednesday recalled rookie Martin Biron to back up  
Duane Roloson against Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Otter-Fishermen Battle Rages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A relocation plan aimed at protecting the  
threatened southern sea otter and helping shell fisherman has 
failed, according to a draft report from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid concern that hungry sea otters would harm the $100  
million-a-year shellfish industry, 140 animals were moved to a 
sanctuary at San Nicolas Island south of Ventura nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also maintained an ``otter-free'' zone for fishermen,  
meaning that animals spotted there were captured and returned to 
the island. A 50-pound sea otter gobbles up more than 100 pounds of 
sea urchins, lobster and crabs each week; fishermen saw the animals 
swallowing potential profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But only about 15 sea otters were left on the island in  
December, according to the draft report sent to experts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	About half swam back to their original home in Monterey. The  
rest died or are unaccounted for, said Fish and Wildlife 
spokeswoman Jane Hendron. 
</P>
<P>
	The service said that efforts to keep otters on the island  
maintain the otter-free zone could kill them. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommended the relocation program be scrapped and  
new ways be found to save the southern sea otter. In California, 
there are just under 2,000 animals left, down from a 1998 herd of 
2,377. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time we implemented it, we did what we thought would  
work,'' Hendron said. ``Generally, in a translocation program, the 
animals that arrive first form a nucleus group, and that did not 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draft report has been sent to experts for comment, and new  
rules for managing the sea otter are expected before the end of the 
year, Hendron said.

<HEADLINE> Iran-Contra Counsel Backs Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawrence Walsh, who investigated the Reagan  
administration on charges of arms-for-hostages trading, told a 
Senate panel today that Congress should renew, but narrow, the 1978 
law that authorized his job. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iran-Contra prosecutor said no investigation of a president  
would carry credibility without the law because that would present 
the attorney general with a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The appearance of an attorney general selecting the person to  
investigate himself or the president who appointed him lacks the 
public credibility of an appointment by someone less interested in 
the outcome,'' Walsh said in remarks prepared for the Senate 
Governmental Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh's probe of Reagan and other White House aides turned many  
Republicans against the Watergate-inspired law, which expires on 
June 30. Now, angered by Kenneth Starr's investigation and the 
historic impeachment trial it inspired, many Democrats have joined 
GOP colleagues in opposition. Other than a small group of 
moderates, no real support has emerged in either party for renewing 
the law. Even among those who believe such a statute is necessary, 
no consensus has surfaced on how to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Chairman Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., suggested that Congress  
might consider shelving the issue until partisan passions left over 
from Clinton's impeachment trial subside. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps regardless of what we do, we should wait and not try  
to meet the June 30 deadline,'' Thompson said as he opened today's 
hearing. Former Sen. Howard Baker, R-Tenn., who saw the law in 
action as Reagan's chief of staff, made the same recommendation 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walsh said the public will not trust the outcome of such  
probes without the law in some form. He said ``stripping the act to 
its essentials and then renewing it would be in the national 
interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the changes Walsh suggested were applying the law only to  
the president and attorney general rather than the dozens of 
high-ranking officials it covers now. Such investigations, he 
added, should be reserved for allegations of abuse of public 
office. Investigations of matters that occurred before a president 
was elected or an attorney general appointed should be left for 
prosecution under the normal justice system only after they leave 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prosecutorial disadvantage of stale evidence is outweighed  
by the national interest in an uninterrupted presidency by a person 
elected by the people,'' Walsh said.

<HEADLINE> Aw To Sell Sing Tao Holding Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- A beleagured Hong Kong tycoon plans to sell her  
publishing interests to an investment bank in a $67 million deal 
designed to rescue her from bankruptcy claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Sally Aw agreed Wednesday to sell her 50.02 percent stake in  
Sing Tao Holding Ltd. to a subsidiary of Lazard Asia Ltd. after 
talks collapsed with a bidding group led by U.S. financier Sam 
Zell. 
</P>
<P>
	Sing Tao publishes the Chinese-language Sing Tao Daily News as  
well as the English-language Hong Kong Standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Aw had previously turned down an overture from Lazard in favor  
of the bid from Zell and his partners, but regulators killed the 
deal because it involved an offer for just part of Sing Tao rather 
than all shares as required under Hong Kong takeover rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders are expected to meet as early as next month to  
decide whether to accept Lazard's offer, being made through 
subsidiary Astral Light Investment, a source close to Sing Tao said 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	If the deal succeeds, it could end a running drama that pitted  
two prominent Hong Kong families against one another. 
</P>
<P>
	Aw, the heiress to a Hong Kong fortune that began with a  
cure-all ointment known as Tiger Balm, may avoid further legal 
proceedings in a suit filed by another wealthy Hong Kong family 
after selling her shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Aw was sued in bankruptcy court on Jan. 7 by Yosham Ltd., a  
private investment group run by Charles Ho, a Hong Kong tobacco 
tycoon's grandson who reportedly had lent Aw $37.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Yosham filed the suit after Aw turned down an initial offer from  
Lazard, but now is expected to withdraw the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Aw's troubles have not been confined to bankruptcy court. Three  
executives of the Hong Kong Standard recently were jailed for 
inflating circulation figures to cheat advertisers. Aw was named as 
a co-conspirator although she never was indicted, 
</P>
<P>
	Aw, 67, recently agreed to sell the historic Tiger Balm Gardens  
-- a private park featuring statues of Chinese deities -- to property 
tycoon Li Ka-shing.

Republicans narrowly muscled $1.3 billion in aid for Central 
America, U.S. farmers and others through the House on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With some conservatives upset that the bill was not fully paid  
for, the GOP's slender majority forced party leaders to frantically 
hunt for support even after the official 15 minutes for the vote 
had elapsed. It took switches by several lawmakers -- including 
Reps. James Rogan, R-Calif., Scott McInnis, R-Colo., and Earl 
Pomeroy, D-N.D. -- for the measure to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation was approved 220-211, barely averting an  
embarrassing defeat for new House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., 
on the year's first spending measure. Voting ``yes'' were 210 
Republicans and 10 Democrats, while 11 Republicans, 199 Democrats 
and one independent were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a very difficult year'' for spending bills  
because of tight spending limits enacted two years ago, House 
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., said after 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House budget office, said  
the tight, partisan vote ``underscores the need to work together'' 
when Congress and the Clinton administration seek to write 
compromise legislation in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is similar to a $2.5 billion package the Senate  
approved Tuesday. It, too, faces a veto threat because of its 
spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	With Congress slated to begin a two-week Easter recess this  
weekend, it seemed all but certain that lawmakers would not ship a 
House-Senate compromise bill to President Clinton until next month 
at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little dissent in the House over the intent of the  
bill, which included $968 million for Central American victims of 
Hurricane Mitch and other natural disasters, $152 million for U.S. 
farmers hurt by low export prices, and $100 million to buttress 
Jordan under its new King Abdullah. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, the fight was over Republican plans to pay for part of  
the bill by cutting programs. These cuts would include $648 million 
from U.S. funds that back loans by the World Bank and other 
international organizations, $150 million from a program that 
purchases nuclear materials from Russia, and $30 million from U.S. 
food aid shipped abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to House leaders, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin  
said reducing U.S. backing for multinational banks ``has rightly 
become a concern of the markets'' and he reiterated earlier 
administration veto threats. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Congress is choosing to follow a path once again of  
confrontation with the president,'' said Rep. David Obey of 
Wisconsin, the Appropriations Committee's top Democrat. ``It is 
setting up the bill to be vetoed, which will be of no help to 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Democrats said the measure would also hurt U.S. influence  
abroad, damage farm exports, and increase the possibility of a 
nuclear threat from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said their cuts were far preferable to Clinton's  
plan to pay for most of the measure by using this year's expected 
$111 billion federal surplus. And they practically dared Clinton to 
cast a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let him cut off the aid to these needy and desperate people in  
Central America,'' said Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala. ``In my 
opinion, he will not do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic attempt to remove most of the GOP cuts from the  
measure was rejected by a near party-line vote of 228-201. An 
effort by conservatives led by Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., to 
increase the bill's savings was rejected by 264-164. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have criticized Congress for its delay  
in passing the bill. Hurricane Mitch battered Honduras and other 
Central American countries last October, killing 9,000 and 
destroying hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses. The rainy 
season begins in several weeks, leaving little time for farmers to 
plant crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert lunched with Clinton at the White House during the day  
and discussed the prospects for a bipartisan overhaul of Medicare 
and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton indicated that Democratic congressional leaders were  
resisting efforts to overhaul Medicare in particular, said one GOP 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. A White House 
official declined to characterize the lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	As the House considered the disaster bill, partisan battles  
began in the Senate over a GOP-written $1.74 trillion budget for 
fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate delivered a slap at Clinton with a 99-0 rejection of  
his plan to put part of the Social Security surpluses in 
government-controlled stock market investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The House planned to begin debating a similar budget on  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats unveiled their own budget, which, unlike  
Clinton's budget, would neither spend Social Security surpluses nor 
raise cigarette taxes. Democrats said their plan would spend more 
than Republicans would for schools, defense, veterans and 
agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Russell Gunn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With his braided hair, baggy jeans and boots,  
trumpeter Russell Gunn looks better suited for a rap music video 
than a jazz club. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunn, 27, grew up in the hip-hop culture.  
</P>
<P>
	But he is also an heir to the rich local heritage of East St.  
Louis, Ill., the hometown he shares with jazz trumpet legend Miles 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	When he first arrived on the New York scene five years ago, Gunn  
encountered some skeptics who thought he couldn't possibly be a 
serious jazz musician. 
</P>
<P>
	But once the young Gunn put his horn to his lips, such doubts  
vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynton Marsalis -- the leading upholder of the jazz tradition --  
tapped Gunn to be a featured soloist on his Pulitzer Prize-winning 
jazz oratorio ``Blood on the Fields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marsalis first noticed his fellow trumpeter during a visit to  
Gunn's East St. Louis high school. 
</P>
<P>
	He says his young protege has ``a great sound -- he plays fast  
and still can play real good in the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Marsalis -- Wynton's brother Branford -- recruited Gunn  
for Buckshot LeFonque, his acid-jazz band, which wove together 
jazz, R&AMP;B, rock and hip-hop. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gunn was developing his own musical blend with his  
sextet. He recorded three mostly straight-ahead jazz albums for 
smaller labels before making his major label debut with 
``Ethnomusicology, Volume One,'' released this month by Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ethnomusicology'' is the ``hip-hop meets jazz'' record Gunn  
said he was born to make. 
</P>
<P>
	With his fiery trumpet, Gunn improvises over the rhythms of  
today-- hip-hop, D.C. go-go, house music -- with the texture enhanced 
by DJ Apollo on turntables and samples from such rappers as Jeru 
the Damaja, Kurtis Blow and Run-DMC. 
</P>
<P>
	But this is no forced marriage of musical styles. Most of the  
tunes are Gunn originals, and there are no familiar jazz standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It disturbs me a lot when people are still playing music from  
50 to 60 years ago like it's some brand new stuff. ... I mean where 
is your individuality?'' said Gunn, in a telephone interview from 
his new home in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	1. Jazz and hip-hop might seem an odd couple. How do you make  
this marriage work in your music? 
</P>
<P>
	Gunn: First of all, they are definitely not an odd couple. I  
think the reason that it works so well the way we do it is because 
I actually live in both the jazz and hip-hop worlds, and that's why 
I know how to put them together. ... I believe in both of them. 
Hip-hop is a way of life, a culture. I'm not doing it for commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	All black people's music is the same thing. The way we talk may  
be a little different. ... But we're all talking the same language: 
R&AMP;B, jazz, hip-hop, it's all the same music to me. 
</P>
<P>
	2. What was your first musical love? Jazz or rap?  
</P>
<P>
	Gunn: It was definitely rap. ... One of my main influences was  
LL Cool J and his first album, 'Radio.' When I was 14 or 15, I 
really put in a lot of time with the rapping. I spent most of the 
time I was awake constructing rhymes or perfecting an existing 
rhyme. 
</P>
<P>
	But I made a deal with myself that by the time I was 16, if  
nothing really came out of what I was doing, then I was going to 
give it up and do something else. So I made a conscious decision to 
stop rapping. I was also in the high-school jazz band, and we would 
go around to all these different places, and I saw all these people 
who appreciated jazz. East St. Louis wasn't a big rap town. I 
figured there might be a future in playing trumpet as opposed to 
being a rapper from East St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	3. You went to the same high school as Miles Davis. Was he a big  
influence? 
</P>
<P>
	Gunn: When I first started playing jazz, he wasn't an influence.  
I just really didn't understand it. It wasn't until I was a little 
older -- maybe in my early 20s -- that I began to discover his 
playing. ... The things Miles was doing incorporating the popular 
rhythms of the day was a big influence on me. During the late '60s, 
'70s, he started incorporating funk and hard rock-sounding things 
into his music. 
</P>
<P>
	The thing about that is it's really not a Miles Davis thing.  
It's definitely a Midwestern thing. Most musicians from the Midwest 
are open to various influences basically because of the location. 
It's right in the middle of the country, so there's no sole 
influence. Everything comes through. 
</P>
<P>
	4. You've titled your CD ``Ethnomusicology,'' which sounds like  
a college course. What lessons are you trying to teach? 
</P>
<P>
	Gunn: Ethnomusicology is the study of the music of any  
indigenous culture. So my 'Ethnomusicology' is just the study of 
black people's music in America. ... What I try to do is deal with 
what I know best, everything I grew up listening to: swing; house 
music, which is definitely a Midwestern thing that grew out of 
disco; go-go, which is a Washington, D.C., regional thing; and a 
kind of hip-hop with a New York flavor. ... Even though the tune 
might have a different rhythmic undertone, we approach it as an 
improvising musician would. This album is a combination of a lot of 
different black music. ... You don't need to study music or know a 
lot about jazz or funk to understand what's going on. The only 
thing you need to appreciate this album is an open mind. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Have you found that your hip-hop style of dress has caused  
people to misunderstand who you are and what you're capable of 
doing? 
</P>
<P>
	Gunn: Well, of course. It's the same way people misunderstand  
anybody who dresses in the hip-hop fashion. That's not just a jazz 
problem, that's an American problem. ... When I moved to New York, 
even though everybody dresses like that, I would go to a club, and 
just because I was a jazz musician, I wasn't supposed to be that 
way. ... People were kind of stuck with that mentality that jazz 
musicians should have that 1950s look: a suit and tie, your low-cut 
haircut. I couldn't get called up on the jam sessions. It wasn't 
like I was a bum. I was always well-groomed and dressed nice. I 
never could understand it, but people are just basically ignorant. 
But luckily there were people who looked past that, and they looked 
at my ability rather than my appearance.

<HEADLINE> Police Dispatcher Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A man working his first day as a state  
police dispatcher was arrested right after he typed his name into a 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory Zeoli was being trained to use a computer system that  
holds records of outstanding arrest warrants. The system 
immediately matched his name and birth date to a warrant listing a 
charge of passing bad checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd think he would have known,'' said state police Lt. Ralph  
Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeoli, 23, was arrested on the spot Saturday and turned over to  
police in Newington, where the warrant originated. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how Zeoli passed the initial background check  
required of state police dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeoli did not respond to telephone calls for comment today.

<HEADLINE> City Blamed for NCAA Bus Signs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The city wanted to make it easier  
for people attending the Final Four to find downtown shuttle stops 
for this weekend's tourney. 
</P>
<P>
	So workers posted signs -- to the ``NCCA'' event.  
</P>
<P>
	Of course, they should say NCAA.  
</P>
<P>
	And actually, they shouldn't say either.  
</P>
<P>
	The city learned it's not allowed to use the association's  
acronym. It's a trademark, and the NCAA planned to use it on its 
own Final Four transportation system for officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to be able to fix that,'' Mayor David Fischer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Add one more mistake. The shuttle's fare is not necessarily $1 a  
round trip, as the sign states. It's 50 cents each time a person 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was human error,'' said Angelo Rao, the city's head of  
traffic engineering and parking. ``They were honest mistakes. 
Simple as that. No excuses.''

	NATO Jets Bomb Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO forces led by the United States  
today launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia, with dozens of cruise 
missiles and the first use of the B-2 stealth bomber in combat. It 
followed months of threats to attack Serbs to force peace in 
Kosovo. In Belgrade, witnesses reported eight explosions, some near 
the Batajnica military airport and at least one near a power plant. 
Detonations went off in Pristina, Kosovo. In neighboring 
Montenegro, another part of Yugoslavia, an army military barracks 
in Danilovgrad was in flames after being hit. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Explains Attack  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton called the NATO assault on  
Yugoslavia a ``stand against ethnic violence and atrocity'' in 
Kosovo. The president is expected to deliver a more detailed 
explanation of the campaign against the Serbs tonight during an 8 
p.m. EST televised address from the White House. As Clinton spoke 
this afternoon, bombs rained on Yugoslavia to punish Belgrade's 
hard-line refusal to make peace with ethnic Albanians in the 
southern Serbian province of Kosovo. 

</P>

	Yugoslavian Neighbors Go On Alert  
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Military forces in the nations surrounding  
Yugoslavia are on alert because of NATO airstrikes against Serb 
forces. The most immediate worry appeared to be the possibility of 
refugees fleeing Serbia and the war-torn province of Kosovo, where 
ethnic Albanians have fought Serb-led Yugoslav forces for more than 
a year. But some leaders said a battle in Yugoslavia ``could engulf 
the whole Balkans.'' Shelters and camps were set up in northern 
Albania to handle more refugees and hospitals were stocked with 
extra supplies.

	McDougal: Husband Made Up Stories

<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal testified today that her  
former husband, now dead, made up stories implicating President 
Clinton in Whitewater to appease prosecutors and win a lighter 
prison sentence. Testifying at her trial for refusing to answer 
questions before the Whitewater grand jury, Mrs. McDougal said 
James McDougal urged her to tell what she called ``stories'' about 
the president, including that Clinton knew about a fraudulent 
$300,000 loan to his Whitewater business partners, the McDougals. 
Mrs. McDougal said she never discussed the loan with Clinton.

400 people to Kenya's Indian Ocean coast derailed along a curve 
before dawn today. At least 32 people were killed and over 100 were 
injured, Kenyan officials said. Passenger cars of the 
Nairobi-to-Mombasa train tumbled onto the dusty scrubland and 
crashed into each other in the dark just before the Tsavo River,

against anthrax. Up to 200 service members have refused to take the 
vaccine. The Pentagon has said that 220,000 have been vaccinated. 
At a House hearing, many critics of the Pentagon's mandatory policy 
also testified, raising concerns over whether the vaccine would

Union leaders said the open-ended strike would continue tomorrow 
and be expanded, warning that the country will suffer severe 
gridlock if the government doesn't answer workers' demands for wage 
increases. Nearly 400,000 state employees took part in the strike.

<HEADLINE> Duke Women's Coach Won't Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Not that she minds, but Gail Goestenkors is  
not getting a whole lot of sleep lately. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't slow down now,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The coach of Duke's women's basketball team is riding one  
powerful wave, and sleep merely gets in the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Her team cut down the nets in Greensboro Coliseum shortly before  
midnight Monday after jolting Tennessee in the East Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	That sent the Duke women to their first Final Four, where they  
joined the men for a double dose of basketball craziness on the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Goestenkors was back at her office by 7:30 a.m. Tuesday,  
breaking down game film of Georgia, the opponent in Friday's 
national semifinal in San Jose, Calif. She slept less than two 
hours before heading back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're so close to something you've worked so hard for, I  
don't think I can take time to breathe right now,'' she said. 
``I'll have plenty of time to look back and enjoy everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goestenkors -- known as Coach G in the spirit of Coach K, her  
counterpart Mike Krzyzewski -- is sure her players won't let down 
after denying the Lady Vols a shot at a fourth straight national 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're going to have trouble getting our feet  
back down on the ground,'' Goestenkors said. ``This was a big win 
for us, but I don't think it was as big as everyone else thinks 
that it was across the nation. Our goal was not to beat Tennessee -- 
our goal was to win the national championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Goestenkors said the victory should earn her players the  
respect she thinks they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the kids right before the game, `Nobody thinks we're  
going to win this game and that makes me very upset.' I used much 
stronger language than that,'' Goestenkors said. ``I was angry. I'd 
been talking to reporters across the country and everybody said, 
`Well, I hope you make it a good game.' 
</P>
<P>
	``That wasn't enough for us. There was a little bit more, not  
because of who we were playing, but because of how we were being 
perceived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke started the season in San Jose, losing by 30 to Connecticut  
and beating Stanford by 20 in an early-season tournament. 
Goestenkors said the goal is to bring the season full-circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've known from Day 1 what that trip was all about,''  
Goestenkors said. ``It wasn't the best trip. That Connecticut game 
was the worst game of our season. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the game, I told them, `Well, now we know how bad we can  
be, and we've got the entire rest of the season to find out how 
good we can be.' And I don't think there would be anything more 
fitting than to make our last game our best game in San Jose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils rode a gleaming bus to the Raleigh-Durham  
International Airport on Wednesday morning, finishing a frantic 24 
hours of interviews, student adoration, schoolwork and packing for 
the trip to California. 
</P>
<P>
	Goestenkors was still running on adrenaline as she boarded the  
bus in front of Cameron Indoor Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great,'' Goestenkors said. ``I've been waiting for this  
all my life.''

<HEADLINE> Pilot Dies in Small Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULUTH, Minn. (AP) -- A preproduction model of a new small plane  
crashed next to a federal prison building during a test flight, 
killing the pilot. No one on the ground was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Anderson, chief test pilot for Cirrus Design Corp., was  
trying to make an emergency landing when the plane crashed Tuesday 
at the federal minimum-security prison near Duluth International 
Airport, said company spokesman Chris Maddy. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson declared an emergency when the plane was 5 miles away  
from the airport. The Cirrus SR20, a single-engine, four-seat 
plane, crashed about 400 feet short of the airport's nearest 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddy did not know the reason for the emergency.  
</P>
<P>
	Cirrus Design was founded as a kit plane manufacturer in 1984,  
and the SR20 is to be the first plane it assembles and sells as a 
finished product. Deliveries were scheduled to begin this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddy said it was unclear how the crash will affect Cirrus'  
schedule for marketing the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The SR20 is to be equipped with a built-in parachute that could  
lower a plane to the ground in an emergency. However, the plane 
that crashed did not have one of the parachutes and Maddy said it 
was too early to tell if it would have saved Anderson's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, 33, an Air National Guard major, died during surgery  
at St. Luke's Hospital in Duluth, a hospital spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Recalling Buckeyes' Last Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Fred Taylor coached Ohio State to the  
national championship game in 1960, 1961 and 1962, winning an NCAA 
title in 1960 in his very first season as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some whispered it didn't take much coaching,  
considering how the Buckeyes had Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek in 
the lineup. Couldn't just about anybody with a whistle scribble 
enough Xs and Os for that team to win 30 games? 
</P>
<P>
	But when Taylor guided Ohio State back to the Final Four in 1968  
without a marquee player, the doubts ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always kidded coach Taylor that that team put him in the  
Hall of Fame,'' said Bill Hosket, captain of the '68 team. ``When 
you have Lucas and Havlicek, you're expected to go to the NCAA 
tournament. But to get there with four centers and Denny Meadors -- 
that showed he could coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those unranked and unknown Buckeyes are much like the current  
Ohio State team. This year's Buckeyes will end Ohio State's 31-year 
Final Four drought when they take on Connecticut on Saturday night 
in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot in common,'' Hosket said, comparing the '68  
and '99 Buckeyes. ``We both were sort of unexpected visitors to the 
Final Four, we both had great chemistry and we both were well 
coached. Just like the current team, we just exceeded everybody's 
expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1968 Buckeyes started the 6-foot-7 Hosket, 6-7 Dave  
Sorenson, 6-5 Steve Howell and 6-3 Jody Finney, along with point 
guard Meadors. Off the bench came Mike Swain, Ed Smith, Bruce 
Schnabel, Jim Geddes, Dan Andreas and Craig Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
	The freshmen team, in the days when freshmen weren't eligible to  
play four seasons, actually had more stars. It included future NBA 
player Jim Cleamons along with a guard named Rex Kern, who would 
quarterback Ohio State to the national championship in football 
later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes tied Iowa for the Big Ten title, but since the  
conference could send only one representative to the 23-team NCAA 
field, Ohio State met the Hawkeyes in a playoff game in West 
Lafayette, Ind. Ohio State won 85-81 and then edged East Tennessee 
79-72 in the regional semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, the Buckeyes had to play Dan Issel and Kentucky -- which  
was hosting the Mideast Regional on its home floor in Lexington. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Sorenson took an inbounds pass from Hosket and banked  
in a short jumper with three second left to give Ohio State a 
stunning 82-81 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of silent,'' Swain said of the response from the  
Wildcats' partisan crowd. ``A kid who had been on the team, Darrell 
Brautigam, put me up on his shoulders so we could go out and cut 
the nets down. But a cop came out and said to get away from them. 
They wouldn't even let us cut their nets down in Kentucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That victory vaulted the Buckeyes into a killer Final Four that  
featured No. 1 Houston, No. 2 UCLA and No. 3 North Carolina -- and 
changed Swain's travel plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was also on the baseball team,'' said Swain, who now sells  
school rings in the Cleveland area. ``I had a plane ticket to go to 
Florida for spring training with the team. I was more than happy to 
go to Columbus and then on to L.A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston had Elvin Hayes, who had 39 points and 15 rebounds in  
January as the Cougars beat UCLA and coach John Wooden before 
52,693 fans at the Astrodome. Lew Alcindor, who later became Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar, was no match for Hayes with 15 points and 12 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The second NCAA semifinal was Round 2 of Houston and UCLA, No. 1  
vs. No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played North Carolina in the first game and it was sort of  
like a junior varsity game,'' Hosket said. ``Everybody wanted the 
rematch. And the tournament was in L.A., so it was a huge event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina featured Charlie Scott and Larry Miller and was  
coached by Dean Smith. The Tar Heels pressed the slower Buckeyes, 
built an early lead and were never threatened. Miller had 20 points 
and Bill Bunting 17 points in North Carolina's 80-66 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA then routed Houston 101-69. Alcindor had 19 points and 18  
rebounds while holding Hayes to 10 points and five rebounds. 
Houston was playing without starting point guard George Reynolds 
because the NCAA did not then permit junior-college transfers to 
play in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	In the championship game, the Bruins rolled over North Carolina  
78-55 for their fourth title in five years and second in a string 
of seven in a row under Wooden. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship game then was preceded by a consolation game  
between the semifinal losers. Houston, which came into the Final 
Four 31-0 and ranked No. 1, ended with back-to-back losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State downed the Cougars 89-85 behind Howell's 26 points  
and 13 rebounds. Sorenson had 19 points and Hosket 19 points and 17 
rebounds. Hayes was back in form with 34 points and 16 rebounds, 
but still ended his college career on a down note. 
</P>
<P>
	``The highlight of that tournament for me was beating Kentucky  
on its home floor, and then beating Houston to feel like we 
belonged,'' Hosket said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are great memories. I just told someone the other night  
that these kids on this year's Ohio State team are creating their 
own memories now. Regardless of what happens from now on, they'll 
have these memories the rest of their lives.''

<HEADLINE> Reno To Probe Farm Industry Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm state senators pressing to slow the  
growing number of mergers in agriculture got a boost when Attorney 
General Janet Reno agreed to increase scrutiny of consolidation 
within the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno met in private for more than an hour Tuesday with a  
bipartisan group of senators. She promised to increase antitrust 
scrutiny and recommend legislative changes if necessary, attendees 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Justice Department antitrust chief Joel Klein will travel  
to the Midwest next month to hear more about agricultural 
concentration, senators said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to hear Attorney General Reno express her deep  
concern today about the negative impact concentration in 
agribusiness may have on family farmers,'' said Sen. Chuck 
Grassley, R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're convinced part of the reason we have price collapse is  
concentration in agriculture,'' added Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., an 
organizer of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Republican and Democratic farm state lawmakers worry about  
increasing mergers within the industry. Both the House and Senate 
have held hearings in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Unease about concentration intensified late last year after  
Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis, the nation's largest grain company, 
announced plans to buy the worldwide operations of second-ranked 
Continental Grain Co. The Justice Department is reviewing the 
proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement only increased worries in a sector reeling from  
a year of low prices in both commodities and livestock. Hog prices, 
for instance, dropped in December to as low as $8 per 
hundredweight, the lowest in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Those prices exacerbated concern by some that big companies were  
squeezing out small producers. 
</P>
<P>
	According to USDA figures, as of 1997 the four largest packing  
firms accounted for 80 percent of cattle slaughter, 54 percent of 
hog slaughter and 70 percent of sheep slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration established an interagency panel last  
year to look at concentration. Several agencies within the 
Agriculture Department are conducting their own studies.

<HEADLINE> Upcoming Celebrity Birthdays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Ewan McGregor  
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Born in Crieff, Scotland, on March 31, 1971,  
Ewan McGregor spent his early years, he says, ``running about the 
hills, riding horses and firing catapults at girls.'' The most 
trouble he got into was ``denting some rental cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obsessed with the films of the 1920s, '30s and '40s, McGregor  
decided to become an actor when he was 9. At 16, he left home to 
work at the Perth Repertory Theater but soon skipped down to London 
to study acting. 
</P>
<P>
	His big break came with the British television series,  
``Lipstick on Your Collar.'' His movie debut followed. He had one 
line in ``Being Human,'' which starred Robin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Breakthrough:* His career got a big boost with his performance  
in ``Shallow Grave.'' But it was his role as a wry junkie in the 
1996 film ``Trainspotting'' that brought him to prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	McGregor's other films include ``Brassed Off,'' ``A Life Less  
Ordinary,'' ``The Pillow Book,'' ``Velvet Goldmine'' and ``Little 
Voice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His upcoming films include ``Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom  
Menace,'' ``Eye of the Beholder'' with Ashley Judd and ``South From 
Hell's Kitchen'' with Bridget Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
	McGregor plays a young Obi-Wan Kenobi in the ``Stars Wars''  
prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Quote:* ``People like Jimmy Stewart would make three to four  
movies a year. It was almost like repertory theater, but in movies. 
That was my idea of what being an actor was like, so I guess I'm 
just trying to do the same thing.''

<HEADLINE> Chase Manhattan Bank Names CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp. named William B. Harrison  
Jr. president and chief executive, a move today that signaled the 
nation's third-largest bank is backing off its plans to acquire an 
investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison, 55, succeeds Walter V. Shipley, 63, who will continue  
as chairman of the board. Thomas G. Labrecque, 60, president and 
chief operating officer, will retire. All of the changes are 
effective June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement quickly created a buzz among bank watchers  
because Shipley reportedly had offered the chief executive's job to 
the heads of several New York investment banks, if they agreed to 
merge with Chase. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a very interesting development and perhaps indicates  
that Shipley's overtures weren't accepted,'' said Joe Haberman, a 
vice president at A.T. Kearney who specializes in financial 
services executive searches. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison ``is a long-term banker, he's a good guy, and very well  
respected, but this indicates a different strategy,'' Haberman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Shipley reportedly has approached several investment  
banks -- including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanely Dean Witter and 
Goldman Sachs -- he told reporters in a telephone conference call 
today that Chase doesn't need to make an acquisition. He also 
denied offering the chief executive's post as an inducement. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison echoed Shipley's comments.  
</P>
<P>
	``We do not have to do a merger to be successful,'' he said,  
adding, ``I am very comfortable we can continue the momentum and 
meet our financial goals without having to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chase stock slipped in afternoon trading on the New York Stock  
Exchange, dropping 25 cents to $79.31 1/4 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	As the regulatory walls dividing banks from brokerages and  
insurance companies crumble, companies are looking for strategic 
partners in new lines of business. 
</P>
<P>
	The most clear example is the merger of banking power Citicorp  
with insurance and brokerage giant Travelers Group last year. In 
one fell swoop, Citicorp's Citibank gained access to the insurance, 
mutual funds and investment banking businesses under the Travelers' 
umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gave Citibank a wide competitive edge over its  
cross-town rival Chase.

<HEADLINE> Carlos Baerga Starts Over With Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- For a guy starting over at the bottom,  
Carlos Baerga was in a great mood. 
</P>
<P>
	The second baseman was smiling and unfailingly upbeat Wednesday  
morning when he showed up at the Cincinnati Reds training complex 
to try to resurrect his fading career. 
</P>
<P>
	He took batting practice, fielded grounders and even signed some  
autographs for a handful of fans who remembered his glory days in 
Cleveland -- three All-Star games, one World Series, seemingly 
unlimited potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after the Indians gave up on him and traded him to  
the New York Mets, the 30-year-old Baerga is barely hanging on. The 
St. Louis Cardinals waived him last Wednesday rather than keep him 
on the opening day roster at $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he accepted a nonguaranteed minor-league contract  
with the Reds, who consider him a low-risk reclamation project. For 
the first time since 1990, Baerga is out of the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit tough, when you're used to being in the big  
leagues,'' Baerga said. ``But you have to realize that sometimes 
you have to start again. Sometimes you have to do what you did 
before to get back on track. If I have to go that way, I'm going to 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has no choice. He will start the season at Triple-A  
Indianapolis knowing that nothing is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to be blocking the way of a prospect at  
Triple-A,'' general manager Jim Bowden said. ``If at some point we 
get him into shape, he might help the major league club. If not, he 
also may be a player we could trade down the road for a younger 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His shape is the big thing.  
</P>
<P>
	The Reds have assigned one of their trainers to help Baerga get  
in shape. Conditioning coordinator Lance Sewell set up a program to 
help Baerga lose weight and get stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga has thick thighs and an ample midsection, but doesn't  
understand the concerns about his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overweight stuff -- I've been like that all my career,''  
Baerga said. ``I'm a guy who always comes to spring training like 
that and I lose weight. So I don't worry about that. I know I'm 
going to be ready when I need to be ready -- my bat and my legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't anywhere near ready enough for the Cardinals, who  
watched him go 2-for-15 in six games and cut him loose. By dumping 
him last Wednesday, St. Louis owed him only 30 days' pay, or 
$163,394. 
</P>
<P>
	His production has declined since 1995, prompting the Indians  
and Mets to decide they could do better. When the Cardinals saw him 
in spring training, they decided he wasn't worth the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go to spring training and play (six) games and they just  
decide they're going to let me go. That was kind of surprising,'' 
Baerga said. ``I've never been in this situation before.''

<HEADLINE> Risk for Alzheimer's Is Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers have found a way to identify some  
people at high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, a discovery 
that takes on added significance as scientists attempt to find a 
way to delay the onset of the devastating disease. 
</P>
<P>
	A study published in the March issue of the Archives of  
Neurology defined ways to diagnose people with mild Alzheimer's and 
mild cognitive impairment, a condition that often precedes 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers led by Ronald C. Petersen at the Mayo Clinic in  
Rochester, Minn., gave participants a battery of neuropsychological 
tests, then assessed the results of each one and diagnosed the 
patients as being healthy, having mild cognitive impairment or 
suffering from mild Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
	They then followed the progress of the subjects -- 76 with mild  
cognitive impairment, 106 with mild Alzheimer's and 234 healthy 
control subjects -- over seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen said mild cognitive impairment was already a recognized  
syndrome, but the researchers developed more rigorous guidelines 
for diagnosing it, based on a battery of neuropsychological tests. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview from Washington, where he announced  
both the results of the study and the start of a new one, Petersen 
said mild cognitive impairment is the diagnosis when memory 
problems are severe enough to interfere with the lives of people 
who otherwise are functioning normally. 
</P>
<P>
	People with this impairment, researchers found, develop  
Alzheimer's at a rate of about 12 percent a year, meaning nearly 50 
percent of a group diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment will 
develop Alzheimer's within four years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said the normal population develops Alzheimer's  
at a rate of about 1 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no cure for Alzheimer's, but scientists are studying  
whether certain treatments, if used early enough in the progression 
of the disease, can delay its onset significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first step in backing up the chain of pathological  
events that leads to Alzheimer's disease,'' said Bill Thiese, vice 
president for medical and scientific affairs of the Alzheimer's 
Association, which is based in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The study being launched will seek to determine whether vitamin  
E or the drug donepizil, both of which are used in Alzheimer's 
treatment, will delay the onset of Alzheimer's in people with mild 
cognitive impairment. Petersen said results will not be available 
before 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Alzheimer's is an incurable brain disorder afflicting an  
estimated 4 million Americans. Thiese said costs associated with 
treating Alzheimer's are currently about $100 billion a year and 
could rise to as much as $400 billion by 2050. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has the potential to overwhelm both our societal and  
personal resources,'' said Thiese, who was not involved in the 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to recognize that this takes a terrific toll on  
the people who suffer from it and their families,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> IBM PC Business Lost $1B Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM lost nearly $1 billion selling personal  
computers last year, sharply higher than each of the previous two 
years, the world's largest computer company disclosed in a federal 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
	The pretax loss reinvigorated suggestions from Wall Street on  
Wednesday that IBM get out of the PC business that it pioneered and 
instead focus on selling corporate machines, software and computer 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM has not previously disclosed its PC losses, but new  
accounting rules stipulate that companies give more detailed 
financial results to investors. The late Tuesday filing showed IBM 
lost $992 million in 1998, $161 million in 1997 and $39 million in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said  
IBM's range of businesses was too broad to efficiently sell 
personal computers and still make money. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of PCs have fallen sharply over the past two years,  
narrowing the profits manufacturers make on the machines. Profits 
are greater on selling powerful computers to businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``IBM is not a consumer company,'' Milunovich said. ``They need  
to focus on corporate computing. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Justice OKs SBC-Ameritech Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- SBC Communications' planned merger with  
Ameritech Corp., which would create the nation's largest local 
telephone company, has been conditionally approved by the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's action Tuesday removed a big hurdle to the  
merger, but it still must be approved by the Federal Communications 
Commission, which is reviewing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Valued at $57 billion when it was announced in May, the merger  
would unite two local Bell companies that control 57 million phone 
lines spread through 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department approved the merger as long as the  
companies sell cellular properties in each of 17 markets. Once that 
is done, SBC also can proceed with another deal to buy the cellular 
telephone operations of Comcast Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC and Ameritech have agreed to the condition and will sell one  
of two cellular properties in each of those markets in Illinois, 
Indiana and Missouri. Markets include the major metropolitan areas 
of Chicago and St. Louis, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without these divestitures, consumers would have paid higher  
prices or received lower-quality services,'' said Joel I. Klein, 
chief of the antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups and long-distance companies wanted the  
Department of Justice to block the merger, arguing it would thwart 
local phone competition and thus the prospect of lower prices. 
They'll continue to pursue that option at the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Divestiture of the cellular properties was a no-brainer. We  
are deeply disappointed that the DOJ didn't do a lot more than 
that,'' said the Consumer Federation of America's Mark Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, which has expressed doubts about companies' need to get  
big to compete, hasn't ruled out any options, including imposing 
conditions on the merger or blocking it. SBC and Ameritech, 
however, are confident the FCC will approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts believe the FCC will impose conditions, but Ameritech's  
general counsel, Kelly Welsh, said ``it's too early to predict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio-based SBC Communications Inc. and Chicago-based  
Ameritech, supported by major telephone unions, said the merger 
would be good for consumers and competition. The merger, they said, 
will spur local phone competition and possibly lower prices, 
accelerate the roll-out of high-speed Internet access and data 
services and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also gives them the financial clout and efficiencies of size  
to provide local phone service in 30 markets outside their combined 
13-state local region. Such a move would have SBC-Ameritech 
competing against fellow Bell companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents contend the merger would create a too-powerful company  
that would discourage rivals from offering local phone and other 
competing services in SBC-Ameritech's local phone region. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states in the proposed merger are Arkansas, California,  
Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Illinois, 
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> House Approves $1.3B Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a veto threat and conservative unease,  
Republicans narrowly muscled $1.3 billion in aid for Central 
America, U.S. farmers and others through the House on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With some conservatives upset that the bill was not fully paid  
for, the GOP's slender majority forced party leaders to frantically 
hunt for support even after the official 15 minutes for the vote 
had elapsed. It took switches by several lawmakers -- including 
Reps. James Rogan, R-Calif., Scott McInnis, R-Colo., and Earl 
Pomeroy, D-N.D. -- for the measure to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation was approved 220-211, barely averting an  
embarrassing defeat for new House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., 
on the year's first spending measure. Voting ``yes'' were 210 
Republicans and 10 Democrats, while 11 Republicans, 199 Democrats 
and one independent were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a very difficult year'' for spending bills  
because of tight spending limits enacted two years ago, House 
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., said after 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House budget office, said  
the tight, partisan vote ``underscores the need to work together'' 
when Congress and the Clinton administration seek to write 
compromise legislation in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is similar to a $2.5 billion package the Senate  
approved Tuesday. It, too, faces a veto threat because of its 
spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	With Congress slated to begin a two-week Easter recess this  
weekend, it seemed all but certain that lawmakers would not ship a 
House-Senate compromise bill to President Clinton until next month 
at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little dissent in the House over the intent of the  
bill, which included $968 million for Central American victims of 
Hurricane Mitch and other natural disasters, $152 million for U.S. 
farmers hurt by low export prices, and $100 million to buttress 
Jordan under its new King Abdullah. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, the fight was over Republican plans to pay for part of  
the bill by cutting programs. These cuts would include $648 million 
from U.S. funds that back loans by the World Bank and other 
international organizations, $150 million from a program that 
purchases nuclear materials from Russia, and $30 million from U.S. 
food aid shipped abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to House leaders, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin  
said reducing U.S. backing for multinational banks ``has rightly 
become a concern of the markets'' and he reiterated earlier 
administration veto threats. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Congress is choosing to follow a path once again of  
confrontation with the president,'' said Rep. David Obey of 
Wisconsin, the Appropriations Committee's top Democrat. ``It is 
setting up the bill to be vetoed, which will be of no help to 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Democrats said the measure would also hurt U.S. influence  
abroad, damage farm exports, and increase the possibility of a 
nuclear threat from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said their cuts were far preferable to Clinton's  
plan to pay for most of the measure by using this year's expected 
$111 billion federal surplus. And they practically dared Clinton to 
cast a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let him cut off the aid to these needy and desperate people in  
Central America,'' said Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala. ``In my 
opinion, he will not do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic attempt to remove most of the GOP cuts from the  
measure was rejected by a near party-line vote of 228-201. An 
effort by conservatives led by Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., to 
increase the bill's savings was rejected by 264-164. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have criticized Congress for its delay  
in passing the bill. Hurricane Mitch battered Honduras and other 
Central American countries last October, killing 9,000 and 
destroying hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses. The rainy 
season begins in several weeks, leaving little time for farmers to 
plant crops. 
</P>
<P>
	As the House considered the disaster bill, partisan battles  
began in the Senate over a GOP-written $1.74 trillion budget for 
fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	That measure prompted a fight between Republicans saying they  
would cut taxes and leave Social Security surpluses untouched, and 
Democrats saying that instead of tax reductions, more must be done 
to strengthen Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The House planned to begin debating a similar $1.74 trillion  
budget later Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats unveiled their own budget, which unlike  
Clinton's budget would spend none of the Social Security surpluses 
nor raise cigarette taxes. Democrats said their plan would spend 
more than Republicans for schools, defense, veterans and 
agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cherry Trees Saved in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The originals of Washington's cherry trees,  
known for exploding into a sea of pink and white blossoms every 
spring, are dying off after more than 80 years. Now, scientists 
have developed genetic copies to keep the line going. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and Interior Secretary Bruce  
Babbitt on Wednesday presented the 500 saplings, which were 
developed from cuttings of the original trees. They will join the 
more than 3,700 cherry trees encircling the Tidal Basin near the 
Jefferson Memorial and lining the grounds of the Washington 
Monument. 
</P>
<P>
	``Future generations will be seeing genetic copies of the  
original trees,'' Glickman said. ``This will allow us the 
opportunity to keep the original Japanese cherry trees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about renewal,'' added Babbitt.  
</P>
<P>
	Only 125 of the 3,000 Yoshino cherry trees given to the United  
States by Japan in 1912 remain. Yoshino cherry trees live an 
average of 47 years; the remaining original trees are now 87 years 
old. Other cherry trees have been added over the years, many times 
to replace originals that died. 
</P>
<P>
	But two years ago, scientists at the National Arboretum began  
looking at ways to use the original trees to develop replacements. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollination wasn't an option because although it would produce a  
tree that looked identical, it would lack the exact genetic makeup. 
So scientists turned their attention toward attempting to grow new 
trees from 4- to 6-inch cuttings from the originals. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists spent six months performing DNA fingerprinting to  
identify the original trees before taking the cutting samples. 
</P>
<P>
	The saplings, now 2 years old, will soon be planted around the  
Tidal Basin and in Washington's East and West Potomac parks near 
the originals. 
</P>
<P>
	The cherry trees are the main attraction of the annual Cherry  
Blossom Festival, which begins Sunday and lasts two weeks. Each 
year, thousands of visitors flock to the city and attend parades 
and festivals to celebrate the cherry trees' limited period of full 
bloom. This year's peak bloom period is predicted to be April 1-8. 
</P>
<P>
	``We Japanese are very much excited to learn the trees ... have  
been so well looked after,'' said Hideaki Kobayashi, a Japanese 
official who attended the ceremony. ``This will remind us of the 
good will of our two countries for years to come.''

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes Have Roles in Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Don't tell Ohio State it's little  
more than two stars and a faceless supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Johnson, for one, bristles when he hears the words ``role  
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like that word,'' he said. ``This is a team. I don't  
really feel one person or three people can win a game. It's all a 
collective effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim O'Brien has two outstanding players in Scoonie Penn  
and Michael Redd, but they are not the only pieces in the puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a collection of guys who do a couple of things pretty  
well and have some limitations,'' he said. ``Where you have a gain, 
sometimes you have a loss. So you just have to keep weighing the 
trades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Ohio State plays Connecticut in the national semifinals on  
Saturday night, the players in the background might well decide the 
outcome. And their parts are clearly defined: 
</P>
<P>
                           *The Mop-up Man    	
</P>
<P>
	Jason Singleton seldom wanders far from the basket on offense,  
unless it's to set a crunching pick or to set up a teammate with a 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about a 15-foot jumper he hit earlier in the season, the  
6-foot-5 senior said he couldn't remember ever shooting that far 
from the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
	He almost always draws the toughest defensive assignment from  
the opposing frontline. 
</P>
<P>
	``His importance has not really been appreciated enough by  
people outside the coaching staff,'' O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jason, he's like the Robin of our team,'' said Penn, who along  
with Redd is its Batman. ``He does all our dirty work.'' 
</P>
<P>
                         *The Shot-blocker    	
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, during an 8-22 season the Buckeyes were forced to  
play zone every game because they couldn't keep up with fast point 
guards and Johnson was constantly in foul trouble, trying to block 
every shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Penn, who sat out his transfer year from Boston  
College, has shored up the perimeter defense. And Johnson, a 6-11 
junior, has picked his spots and has been a major factor in Ohio 
State's remarkable turnaround to a 27-8 record. In the South 
Regional final win over St. John's, he swatted seven shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ken Johnson and Jason Singleton have been playing phenomenal  
for us,'' said Redd, the Buckeyes' leading scorer. ``They haven't 
been recognized until now. But it's a great combination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson seldom takes an ill-advised shot, yet scored 12 points  
against St. John's. But nobody talks about his offense. 
</P>
<P>
                           *The Defender    	
</P>
<P>
	How many other teams dramatically change their starting lineup  
after 31 games? That's what O'Brien did when he inserted freshman 
Brian Brown in place of Jon Sanderson before the NCAA first-round 
game with Murray State. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown handles the ball, allowing Penn and Redd to scissor  
through picks for open shots or beat defenders backdoor. He also 
guards the top perimeter threat, shielding the Buckeyes' big two 
from foul trouble and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie and Mike, they've been carrying this team all season  
long offensively,'' Brown said. ``But Scoonie and Mike couldn't be 
here without us.'' 
</P>
<P>
                           *The Minutemen    	
</P>
<P>
	When O'Brien needs someone to muscle the other team's big man,  
he can call on the broad-shouldered Sanderson. If the offense is 
stagnant, he brings in 6-7 junior-college transfer George Reese. 
Senior Neshaun Coleman is the team's 3-point specialist and 
freshman Boban Savovic spells the guards and has broken open a 
couple of games with perimeter shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien says it's been easy to align the parts and keep everyone  
happy. No one can argue with the result. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an egoless collection of guys for the most part,'' he  
said. ``Everyone has an ego, but it has never been a problem with 
these guys to understand who the marquee players are. That's a 
tribute to our team.''

<HEADLINE> Indiana Football Player Stabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- A cornerback for Indiana was stabbed in  
the abdomen following fighting among Hoosiers football players and 
fraternity members. 
</P>
<P>
	Two skirmishes broke out Monday after a classroom confrontation  
earlier in the day and a contentious pickup basketball game weeks 
earlier, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis Randle El, brother of Hoosiers quarterback Antwaan Randle  
El, was stabbed and underwent surgery Monday in Bloomington 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in stable condition Tuesday and is expected to be  
released within a week and recover fully, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two others, defensive back Kyle Moffatt and fraternity member  
Ramone Demming, were released from the hospital after being treated 
for minor injuries during the fight at an apartment complex north 
of campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Phi Beta Sigma fraternity member Richard Gilliam was charged  
with two felonies -- aggravated battery and battery with bodily 
injury, in connection with the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Moffatt, a sophomore from Indianapolis, was arrested on charges  
of false informing and battery, both misdemeanors. Another football 
player, Damian Gregory, was charged with residential entry, a 
felony, and misdemeanor battery. 
</P>
<P>
	All three posted bond and were released Tuesday from Monroe  
County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just really escalated over minor stuff into major issues --  
no doubt about it,'' Bloomington Police Capt. William Parker said. 
``Some guys said something back and forth to each other in a class. 
I think they were sort of challenging each other. This also has to 
do with a pickup basketball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoosiers football coach Cam Cameron said his office will work  
with the dean of students. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point in time ... we'll take appropriate action,'' he  
said. ``I treat these students just like I treat my sons, and I 
believe in discipline. We'll deal with this in an appropriate 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how many football players and fraternity members  
were involved, but Bloomington police reported several officers 
were needed to separate the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bloomington police arrived at the apartment complex,  
fraternity president Damon Meadows told them several members had 
been attacked by football players. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraternity member Dante Wilson told officers he and a football  
player had been in an altercation during and after a class Monday. 
The football player and others went to Varsity Villas later and a 
fight broke out, Wilson told police. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time officers arrived, the fight had ended. But later in  
the evening, fighting broke out again at the apartment. Before 
police arrived and broke it up, Randle El had been stabbed and 
Moffatt had a cut to his head that required stitches.

<HEADLINE> Witness: Six Flags Workers Stood By </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Amusement park employees discouraged bystanders  
from trying to save a woman trapped underwater after a ride 
malfunctioned and did not immediately try and help her themselves, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident at Six Flags Over Texas on Sunday resulted in the  
woman's death and injuries to 10 other people. 
</P>
<P>
	One witness, a certified dive instructor trained in water  
rescue, said Tuesday that employees apparently made no immediate 
attempt to enter the water and told patrons to stay back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard from the staff, the uniformed park staff, `Ma'am, do  
not go in the water,''' said Wendy Crown, 44, who was visiting the 
park with her 7-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	Six Flags spokeswoman Nancy St. Pierre said employees of the  
Roaring Rapids ride, in which large, round boats go through a 
series of rapids, are told to stay on the dock and activate an 
in-house emergency response system during a mishap. Help arrived 
within two minutes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a great number of employees converge on the scene and  
begin the rescue efforts almost immediately,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve people were aboard the raft-like boat that separated from  
its inner-tube base as it overturned. Ms. Crown said she and others 
disregarded staff instructions to stay out of the 4-foot-deep water 
because every minute was crucial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The staff had said, `Wait for the (paramedics) to get on site  
until you go into the water.' That didn't make sense because timing 
is essential,'' said Ms. Crown, who gave mouth-to-mouth 
resuscitation to the 28-year-old Arkansas woman who later died. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. St. Pierre confirmed another passenger's contention that  
there were no life preservers, ropes or a pole that could have been 
used to assist anyone who might fall into the water. She said such 
a review of procedures has been launched. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at everything that occurred, everything that  
went on,'' she said. ``I'm not going to be speculating on who 
should have done what or what should have occurred.''

<HEADLINE> Ron Howard Wins El Nino Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- El Nino forced Ron Howard and his family out  
of a rental home. Now, a jury has awarded the director for the 
inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, his wife Cheryl and Imagine Entertainment were awarded  
$605,000 in damages Monday in their countersuit against Jeff 
Greene, a Malibu real estate investor and landlord. 
</P>
<P>
	The Howards and their four children moved into the rental in  
December 1997, during his work on the upcoming movie ``EDtv.'' But 
they had to move out the next month because of massive leaks and 
flooding during El Nino-driven storms. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene sued for breach of contract, attempting to collect rent  
for the entire term of the lease. Howard and Imagine countersued 
and won. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron and Cheryl Howard are very appreciative of the jury's  
careful consideration of the issues raised at the trial,'' said 
Imagine's attorney Kurt Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said Imagine will return to court to seek an additional  
award of attorneys' fees and costs. Greene's telephone number was 
not listed.

<HEADLINE> Buckeye Worries Are Hoops and Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Boban Savovic's thoughts this week  
alternate between basketballs and bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Ohio State freshman from Serbia is busy preparing for  
Saturday's Final Four game with Connecticut in St. Petersburg, 
Fla., his heart and mind are thousands of miles away in war-torn 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Savovic grew up in Montenegro, a province just north of Albania  
and west of Kosovo on the Adriatic Sea. His parents, Nikola and 
Olivera, live in the city of Herceg-Novi, within 100 miles of the 
most intense fighting between Serbians and ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO bombings began Wednesday in Kosovo.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no fighting in the cities now. It is all in the  
mountains. But it is war, so they are in danger,'' Savovic said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old speaks to his parents by telephone twice a week  
but he has not seen them in more than 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Savovic's parents haven't seen him play since he immigrated to  
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	He had hoped his parents would be able to see the Final Four  
game on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talk to them, but they say they won't (see it),'' he said.  
``It won't be shown. I really don't know the reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard Scoonie Penn said Savovic has talked to teammates  
about the devastation in Yugoslavia, but remains upbeat. He said it 
won't affect Savovic's play Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He talks about it sometimes,'' Penn said. ``He talks about how  
they're at war, and how his friends may die. Boban is a kid who's 
been through a lot. Boban is a very mature freshman in terms of 
life experiences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Savovic just hopes for peace.  
</P>
<P>
	``My country has been at war for the last 10 years and I don't  
know why. Who knows why?'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lions Sign Tight End David Sloan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Unrestricted free agent tight end David  
Sloan re-signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6, 254-pound Sloan has spent four years with the  
Lions, but has been hobbled by knee injuries for two of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sloan took over the Lions' starting job midway into his rookie  
season in 1995 and finished with 17 catches for 184 yards and a 
touchdown. He tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee 
in the fourth game of 1996 and missed the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Sloan started 12 games, playing in 14, and had 29  
catches for 264 yards. But he underwent arthroscopic surgery on 
both knees during the offseason and missed the start of training 
camp and was on the physically unable to perform list for the first 
six weeks of last season. He finished the year with 11 catches for 
146 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Sloan was selected in the third round of the 1995 draft out of  
New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract were not disclosed.

	NATO Jets Blast Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO warplanes and missiles attacked  
targets throughout Yugoslavia, striking at army barracks, power 
plants and air defenses. It was a bid to force Serbs to cease an 
onslaught against Kosovo Albanians. Scores of cruise missiles and 
dozens of warplanes attacked, including six U.S. B-52 bombers and 
two B-2 stealth bombers, appearing in combat for the first time. 
Explosions resounded near Yugoslavia's capital of Belgrade and 
Kosovo's capital of Pristina. The center of Belgrade was quiet and 
unhit. The Yugoslav army declared a state of war shortly after the 
first wave of NATO attacks. Early Thursday, the state-run media 
reported that the air alert had been called off. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton To Explain Attack  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was set to make a national  
TV address at 8 p.m. EST to explain NATO's airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia. ``Only firmness now can prevent greater catastrophe 
later,'' Clinton said at the White House during the day. He 
acknowledged the risk of allied losses in the bombing of Serb 
forces. Defense Secretary William Cohen said there was some 
air-to-air combat, but ``our aircraft have safely returned.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Russia Halts NATO Partnership  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin pulled Russia out of its  
partnership with NATO today and warned of possible further steps to 
protest the airstrikes against Yugoslavia. He called the attacks 
deeply troubling. If the conflict grows, Russia reserves the right 
to take ``adequate measures, including of a military character, to 
ensure its own and general European security,'' Yeltsin said after 
airstrikes began. 

</P>

	Pinochet Arrest Is Upheld  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's highest court today denied Gen. Augusto  
Pinochet of Chile immunity from arrest, but threw out almost all 
the charges leveled against him. The former dictator now faces only 
three of 32 counts for crimes allegedly committed during his 
1973-90 regime: torture, conspiracy to torture and conspiracy to 
murder. In a 6-1 decision, the House of Lords dismissed the 
remaining 29 counts in a Spanish warrant seeking his extradition. 
Pinochet, 83, remains in Britain under guard.

	Rudder Faulted in Crashes of 737s  
</P>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Boeing 737 rudder problems caused two  
fatal airline crashes and nearly triggered a third, a federal 
safety board concluded today. It said a redesign being implemented 
in the world's most widely used jetliner isn't enough to protect 
the flying public. Although the Boeing Co. and the Federal Aviation 
Administration contend the rudder problems are already being 
eliminated, the National Transportation Safety Board called for 
them to work together to devise further improvements.

	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Federal regulators today ordered Kiwi Air  
Lines to stop flying. It said the tiny discount carrier was 
``unable or unwilling'' to fly with top safety standards. The 
Federal Aviation Administration ordered the Newark-based carrier, 
which filed for bankruptcy yesterday, to cancel its six-city flight 
schedule.

	Dow Ends Down 4.99

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed narrowly mixed today after a  
lackluster session as traders recovered from yesterday's big drop. 
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 4.99 to close at 9,666.84 
after trading in a narrow range all day. NATO's launching of air 
strikes against Yugoslavia had no apparent effect on the stock 
market. On the NYSE, gainers led losers 1,512-1,440. The Nasdaq was 
at 2,365.25, up 42.41.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS stock rose nearly 4 percent today after the

Chief executive Mel Karmazin said he wants to further extend the 
CBS brand name online. ``We are committed to being one of the

<HEADLINE> Michelle Kwan Wins Early Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Michelle Kwan began a journey to her  
third title today with a superb performance in her qualifying round 
for the World Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing six triple jumps with ease and grace despite a cold  
for which she had been taking medication, Kwan easily won the 
qualifying group with marks from 5.6 to 5.9. She only did a 
triple-double combination and cut down another triple to a double 
lutz, but was otherwise solid in technique and exquisite in grace. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting her performance were two spiral sequences that  
emphasized the choreographic difference between her and the other 
competitiors. Kwan's marks were far ahead of the next best of the 
group, Vanessa Gusmeroli of France. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today, the second group featuring two of Kwan's top  
rivals, Maria Butyrskaya of Russia and Tatiana Malinina of 
Uzbekistan will be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Also the pairs title will be decided tonight, with Yelena  
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze seeking their second straight 
world title. 
</P>
<P>
	How Kwan would perform after having to take antibiotics was in  
doubt until she took off on her first jump, a triple lutz-double 
toe loop combination that was secure. Then, she went into a long 
back spiral with her leg almost vertical to the ice and her skate 
well above her head. 
</P>
<P>
	She now will have a day off before coming back for Friday's  
short program and repeating the long routine to ``Ariane''' on 
Saturday to gain her third world title. 
</P>
<P>
	Her coach, Frank Carroll, said they hadn't decided whether she  
would practice on her day off. Kwan said she is overcoming the 
cold, but feels only about ``80 percent in energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The qualification counts for 20 percent. A misstep or a missed  
jump could have been costly for Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
	But she now will be equal in points with the winner of the other  
group, no matter who it will be. The key consideration was that she 
would not be trailing anyone entering the short program which could 
cost a skater a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
	That situation happened in the men's event Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Elvis Stojko, the three-time world champion, finished third in  
the qualifying, followed by a third in Tuesday's short program. 
Previously, a third place in the short would still keep him in 
solid contention for his fourth world title. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he needs help -- a lot of it -- if he is to vault past the  
Russians ahead of him in Thursday's free skate. Both Russians won 
their group qualifications on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship is there for either Yevgeny Plushenko or Alexei  
Yagudin to lose. If either wins the long program -- or comes in 
second in the long to Stojko -- the title is his. 
</P>
<P>
	A few mistakes by both would be needed for Stojko to win.  
</P>
<P>
	Hoping for a mistake from the 16-year-old Plushenko would be  
risky. He was impressive with his jumps in the short, skating to 
``Hava Nagila.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin landed a bit off on his opening triple axel-triple toe  
loop combination, but stayed in form for the rest of the 
circus-themed routine, full of vivid and amusing gestures. 
</P>
<P>
	American champion Michael Weiss was fourth after a program that  
was less technically ambitious than the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Yagudin, Plushenko and Weiss, Stojko put a quad in his  
short program, but two-footed it. He characterized this year's 
championships as ``the toughest I've ever encountered by a 
hundredfold.'' He said that he had ``set up some very big 
expectations'' by assuming that his year-old groin injury would 
heal even as he competed. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians also took the lead in the ice dance event with Angelika  
Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov putting in a smooth performance to the 
Paso Double and Tango Romantica. That put them solidly in first for 
the portion, counting 20 percent of the total score. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a tie for second between Canada's Shae-Lynn Bourne and  
Victor Kraatz and France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat. 
Each ranked ahead of the other in one of the dances, although 
Anissina and Peizerat received a first place vote from the French 
judge.

<HEADLINE> Final 4 Has Roots at Georgia Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- The rims at Big Oak Park are thicker and 2  
inches higher than normal, and jumpers from the corner are often 
blocked by a low-hanging pine tree that is always considered in 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	The aging concrete slab has no out-of-bounds lines, free throw  
lines or 3-point lines and it's full of cracks that make life 
difficult for ballhandlers. Avoid all those obstacles and there are 
defenders who pound anyone going to the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
	This is where Ricky Moore and William Avery learned the skills  
that propelled them to a state title at nearby Westside High and 
college stardom. Now, the one-time teammates and neighbors are on 
opposite sides of the Final Four, one game from playing each other 
for the NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the time if you were just an ordinary player and you  
didn't know many people out there and if you lost, you'd probably 
go home, because there was no chance that you'd get back on the 
court,'' said Moore who will start at shooting guard for 
Connecticut Saturday against Ohio State. ``You had guys coming from 
all over Augusta to play at Big Oak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery, who lives down the street from Moore, runs the point for  
Duke, which plays Michigan State and is favored to win the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	If Duke and UConn advance to Monday night's final, Avery and  
Moore will be facing each other in an organized game for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery said that even at Big Oak, he and Moore would rarely guard  
each other, although their one-on-one battles after practice are 
legendary at Westside. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're real good friends, but we've never competed against each  
other -- not even on the playground have we been on opposite 
teams,'' Avery said. ``It would be different. We know each other so 
well, each of us would probably be able to stop each other right 
away because we know what the other one is going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery is thought to be the better outside shooter. As a  
sophomore, he patrolled the perimeter for Westside while Moore did 
most of the penetrating. They led the Patriots to a 33-1 record and 
the 1995 Class AAA state title. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery honed his stroke at Big Oak, not the most friendly  
shooter's court, with the low branches and the high, stiff rims -- 
adjusted to discourage damaging dunks. 
</P>
<P>
	Things are even tougher inside during brutal games of ``21.'' No  
one calls fouls, meaning you score or you lose the ball, no matter 
how hard you get hit. 
</P>
<P>
	This is where Moore learned his slashing style, and his  
trademark defense. Former coach Ken Wright said Moore probably 
developed his quickness trying to get out of the way of older 
brother Otis, who played tight end at Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ricky was probably the best all-around ballplayer I've ever  
coached, and William was probably the best offensive player I've 
ever seen,'' said Wright, who now coaches in Gatlinburg, Tenn. 
``There was no way to stop them both. And they both worked so hard, 
that they pushed each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright remembers Moore getting up at 5 a.m. to work out before  
school, then ``playing like it was a game in practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Then, since he had a single mom, he would go out and work a  
part-time job after practice,'' Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery, who went to prep school for his senior year to prepare  
academically for Duke, worked just as hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember catching him out at 11 one night, well past  
curfew,'' Wright said. ``He was out on the court, working on his 
moves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the summers, the two players still make the five-minute walk  
to Big Oak for pickup ball and cookouts. It's just a short drive 
from the site of next month's Masters, but this neighborhood is a 
world away from the opulence of the Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	Kids and adults at the courts are quick to associate themselves  
with the local heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like my boy Avery'' said one youngster swishing a long  
jumper from the dirt ringing the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ricky's my cousin, and he's going all the way,'' 15-year-old  
Jaymes Faulk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Reynolds, about 6-foot-2 and 260 pounds, remembers Avery  
and Moore begging to get into games as kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got beat on like everybody else,'' he said. ``But that  
made them mentally tough. And you can see where it's taken them.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Grows Jalapenos in Arizona / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Once a month, state Rep. Gene Nicholas  
escapes the heat of the North Dakota legislature to tend to 
something hotter -- his jalapeno farm in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good reason to go to Phoenix in the wintertime,'' says  
Nicholas, who seeded 600 acres of jalapenos on his farm about 30 
miles south of Phoenix last year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's big compared to your average pepper farm, which is only  
about 30 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have to continually look at diversifying. I think  
agriculture is always changing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Roger Johnson said more  
farmers are taking a closer look a high-value crops because ``so 
much isn't profitable anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they have some risk-taking capacity, some money and are  
able to absorb some of that risk, they're seriously considering 
it,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jalapenos could be grown in North Dakota, but a long growing  
season is needed to make the peppers profitable, Nicholas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, Nicholas and his partner employ between 80 and 250  
migrant workers to pick the peppers. Some end up as Jalapeno 
Poppers, a cheesy finger food. Most of his jalapenos end up in 
salsa, a spicy tomato dip for chips. 
</P>
<P>
	He sells them to Pace Foods, a division of Campbell Soup Co. of  
Camden, N.J., which makes picante and salsa sauces. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Kilpatrick, a Campbell spokesman, said the company  
contracts with pepper growers in California, Florida, Texas and New 
Mexico as well as Arizona. Some of its supply is grown in Mexico, 
Kilpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a very critical part of the Pace product, having fresh  
jalapenos,'' Kilpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas, who has been in the hot pepper business for three  
years, thinks the vegetable has potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably more profitable than grain farming,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he describes the jalapeno enterprise as ``a more capital  
intensive'' type of farming, compared to the agriculture in North 
Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have higher input cost, but you got a little more  
potential on an acre,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fertilizer and water are expensive. Costs per acre can run about  
$3,000, compared to probably $125 an acre for wheat in North 
Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The jalapeno transplants are seeded with a planter similar to a  
tree planter, only it can plant six rows at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Nicholas is using a sprinkler system instead of  
relying on ground water to irrigate the crop. He also has tried 
mechanical harvesting, with a combine built specially for jalapeno 
harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
	The peppers get picked about six to seven times a year. Nicholas  
planted in February and plans to start harvesting in the first of 
June. Then, the plants are cut down. They grow back and are picked 
again three or four times at the end of September or October before 
freezing in December.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Tutor: I Wrote for Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- A woman who claims to have written a school  
paper for former Minnesota basketball player says coach Clem 
Haskins told her the player ``needed a lot of help'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said that when she said she wouldn't continue to write  
papers for athletes, she was told she would not continue to work as 
an athletic department tutor. 
</P>
<P>
	In a copyright story Wednesday, the St. Paul Pioneer Press  
reported that Alexandra Goulding, a graduate student, wrote one 
paper for ex-Gopher Courtney James. 
</P>
<P>
	When Goulding told Haskins she wouldn't do it again, Haskins  
responded that James, needed the help with his classwork. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Goulding said, team academic counselor Alonzo  
Newby told her she would not be offered a contract to continue 
working as an athletic department tutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Jan Gangelhoff, a one-time tutor and former  
academic counseling department office manager, said she wrote about 
400 papers for 20 players from 1993 to 1998. Her sister, Jeanne 
Payer, also did work for players. 
</P>
<P>
	Goulding, a doctoral candidate in sociology, said Newby watched  
her write the paper on her first day as a tutor in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Goulding said she discovered that James' paper was due the next  
day, and that he was not proficient in typing or putting his 
thoughts on paper. She said she sat down at the computer and began 
typing the paper with James beside her. 
</P>
<P>
	``From yes and no statements from him, I created the  
sentences,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goulding said she then told Newby that ``I cannot and will not  
write his papers. I said you will have to get him some remedial 
tutoring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goulding said she later repeated these concerns to Haskins.  
Goulding said she does not believe Haskins witnessed her writing 
the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Rosenbaum, attorney for Newby, said he needs to investigate  
the latest allegations. Ron Zamansky, who represents Haskins, said 
the coach stands by his earlier statement denying wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Minnesota President Mark Yudof declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Goulding showed the Pioneer Press a Dec. 1, 1995, pay stub for  
$50 that she said she received for the 2 1/2 hours with James. She 
said she wrote a one-page paper about his goals in college for a 
remedial English class. The stub says the work was for academic 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	James, now with Fort Wayne of the CBA, told the newspaper: ``I  
don't remember that name. I don't recall any names of any of the 
tutors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James left Minnesota after the 1996-97 season, choosing to turn  
pro instead of serving a season-long suspension after being 
convicted of assault in August 1997.

<HEADLINE> Jesse Jackson Shuns Bid in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Civil rights activist and two-time  
presidential candidate Jesse Jackson has decided not to mount a 
campaign for the White House in 2000, The Associated Press has 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not running. All of us have been talking to him,'' a  
source within Jackson's close circle of political advisers said 
Tuesday. The source spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said Jackson wants instead to devote his attention to  
his campaign to pressure Wall Street into providing more start-up 
capital to minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reverend Jackson doesn't have to be a candidate to make an  
impact,'' the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	The news of Jackson's decision not to challenge Vice President  
Al Gore for the Democratic nomination was to be delivered today, 
first on the campaign Web site of his son, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., 
D-Ill., and later at a Chicago news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said Jackson had discussed the matter with President  
Clinton when he joined him on Air Force One on the way back from a 
fund-raising trip to Florida last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson himself said on Black Entertainment Television's ``Lead  
Story'' over the weekend that he was ``not very motivated to at 
this point'' to seek the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I have not decided altogether to say yes or no, I'm  
inclined not to,'' Jackson said on the program Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters in Chicago on Tuesday, Jackson would not  
reveal his plans, saying only, ``We intend to impact public policy 
in a major way in 1999 and 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Current and former Jackson advisers said if he were to run it  
would be with the goal of winning the nomination and not merely to 
ensure discussion of issues he cares about. He is said to be 
concerned that the newly condensed primary season, which requires 
candidates to raise greater amounts of money sooner, could inhibit 
his ability to be a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Jackson has not begun building the kind of  
organization needed to mount a serious presidential run, nor has he 
begun raising money for a bid, people close to him said. 
</P>
<P>
	Disclosing his intentions first on the Internet follows in the  
footsteps of Republican Steve Forbes, the only other candidate to 
make an official announcement via a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jackson bowing out, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey  
would remain Gore's only declared competitor so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Other prominent Democrats who have opted out of the race are  
Sens. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, John Kerry of Massachusetts and 
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, as well as House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, a 57-year-old preacher who calls both Chicago and  
Washington home, has never held public office but remains one of 
the country's best-known black political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's first White House bid in 1984 was followed by a second  
populist campaign in 1988. In both races, he was the field's most 
liberal voice, and was credited with increasing black voter 
turnout. Nearly every presidential election season since has seen 
him at least contemplate a rerun. 
</P>
<P>
	Active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s, Jackson  
founded Operation PUSH in 1971, and still runs the now-merged 
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, a Chicago-based nonprofit organization 
seeking economic and political empowerment for minorities. Jackson 
also is the author of two books, the host of the CNN talk show 
``Both Sides with Jesse Jackson'' and Clinton's envoy for democracy 
in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this decade, Jackson was the District of Columbia's  
``shadow senator,'' advocating for statehood and voting 
representation in Congress for the nation's capital city.

<HEADLINE> Gay Attack Trial Opens in Wyoming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- One of two men arrested in the beating  
death of gay college student Matthew Shepard merely watched while 
the other man pistol-whipped Shepard and left him to die, a defense 
attorney said Wednesday as jury selection began. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defense will contend that Russell did not participate in  
the beating and did not share in the proceeds of the robbery,'' 
said Wyatt Skaggs, the lawyer for 21-year-old Russell Henderson. 
Skaggs also said the slaying wasn't premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked potential jurors not to punish his client to redeem  
this small town's image in the eyes of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing ``has literally injected into our community a  
feeling of guilt. The press wants us to think that we are somehow 
responsible for what went on Oct. 6,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are any of you here going to judge this case because you feel  
guilty and want to make a statement to the nation?'' he asked the 
prospective jurors. They replied, ``No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha told the prospective jurors that Shepard  
was ``not the same as you and I'' but that every individual should 
be treated equally under the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as  
homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar 
Oct. 6, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to a 
fence in the cold. The University of Wyoming student died five days 
later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The crime led to demands for stronger hate-crime laws around the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney will be tried later. Both men could get the death  
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaggs also told the jury candidates that the case ``is not  
about lifestyles.'' ``This case is not about hate. All crimes ... 
aren't about hate. They all come down to some real simple 
motives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One prospective juror, a man in his 40s, objected quickly: ``No,  
I disagree. ... I think Matthew Shepard's lifestyle was part of 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the day, 15 of the 71 prospective jurors in the  
first pool had been dismissed, many for financial, medical or 
child-care related decisions. Jury questioning for the rest of the 
week will be closed to the public. Opening statements are set for 
April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospective jurors will be questioned individually in the  
judge's chambers.

<HEADLINE> Military Munitions Train Derails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHELBYVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A train carrying Marine Corps  
munitions derailed today, forcing the evacuation of a rural 
quarter-mile area. No one was reported hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Six containers carrying munitions split open when eight cars  
from the CSX Transportation Inc. train jumped the tracks about 
12:30 a.m., railroad spokeswoman Jane Covington said. 
</P>
<P>
	The train was headed from Jacksonville, Fla., to Louisville,  
Ky., she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities don't know what caused the accident about 55 miles  
southeast of Nashville, or where the train was headed. It also 
wasn't immediately clear what kind of munitions were on board. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation was a precaution, said Kurt Pickering, a  
spokesman for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. Only a few 
people were evacuated.

<HEADLINE> Teen Can Wear Gown to Prom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PIERSON, Fla. (AP) -- School officials reversed their decision  
and will allow a teen-age boy to attend his high school prom in 
drag. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Rice plans to wear a red, floor-length evening gown, red  
satin shoes, gloves and matching rhinestone jewelry to Saturday's 
prom. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Principal Peter Oatman told the 18-year-old Taylor  
High School senior he would be refused entrance to the prom if he 
showed up in drag. 
</P>
<P>
	Oatman backed down after conferring with Superintendent Bill  
Hall and school district attorneys, as well as reviewing news 
accounts of his initial decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said Rice gets to don his gown for the prom only because  
the principal let him wear skirts and dresses to special events in 
the past. Because of these prior episodes, the school system would 
have had a weak case if the matter had gone to court, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have the freedom to express myself,'' said Rice, who  
is gay.

<HEADLINE>  Court Upholds Pinochet Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's highest court today upheld Gen. Augusto  
Pinochet's arrest on charges of human rights violations, dashing 
the former Chilean dictator's hopes of immediately returning home. 
But the tribunal negated most of the charges lodged by Spain in 
seeking his extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	The general still could end up in the dock, but not for torture  
offenses committed before 1988, when Britain signed an 
international law banning the practice. Pinochet surrendered the 
presidency in 1990 after 17 years of hard-line rule, and remained 
in charge of the army for eight more years. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling appeared to mark the first time a national court had  
denied a foreign head of state immunity from prosecution, Lord 
Chief Justice Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson said. Many experts have 
suggested successful prosecution of Pinochet would render all world 
leaders vulnerable to charges filed by other governments. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 6-1 decision, a House of Lords tribunal ruled that Pinochet  
is not entitled to immunity from arrest, despite his status as a 
former head of state. But it also threw out all but three of the 30 
charges in a Spanish warrant seeking his extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges said the 83-year-old general can be prosecuted for  
three counts alleging numerous cases of conspiracy to torture and 
one case each of torture and murder conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is very happy because this ruling has made justice,'' said  
retired Gen. Luis Cortes, who talked to Pinochet by phone from 
Chile. ``He now has no doubts whatosever that he will come back 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browne-Wilkinson said that due to the substantial reduction in  
charges, Home Secretary Jack Straw should reconsider whether the 
extradition request should proceed. Pinochet must stay in Britain 
during the battle over his extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after the ruling, Pinochet's lawyers filed an appeal  
of Straw's December decision to allow the extradition process to 
move forward. The High Court said it would be considered Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a  
long-time Pinochet ally, called on Straw to allow Pinochet to 
return to Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law lords have now confirmed that almost all the charges  
brought against Senator Pinochet are inadmissible,'' Thatcher said. 
``In these circumstances, it is quite wrong to keep him here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Straw's office said he would have no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	In Chile, the decision was greeted with elation by both the  
general's supporters and detractors, each of whom found elements to 
celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 anti-Pinochet activists who gathered under drizzle in  
Madrid, Spain, cheered the ruling which was broadcast live on 
Spanish radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we have achieved a victory despite the limitations of  
the decision,'' said Carlos Slepoy, an Argentine lawyer in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups welcomed the ruling, contending the decision  
to throw out the bulk of the Spanish warrant did not significantly 
weaken the case against Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have to remember that most people get extradited  
on one or two counts -- not dozens,'' said Reed Brody of the New 
York-based Human Rights Watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 on the Spanish warrant, which  
alleged abuses committed by his secret police after he toppled 
Chile's elected president, Marxist Salvador Allende, in a bloody 
1973 coup. 
</P>
<P>
	After Pinochet was arrested while recovering from back surgery  
at a London hospital, his lawyers immediately challenged his 
detention, contending a former head of state cannot be prosecuted 
in a foreign court for acts committed while in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet prevailed in the High Court on Oct. 28, but prosecutors  
then appealed to the House of Lords. 
</P>
<P>
	During a 12-day hearing, which ended Feb. 4, lawyers for Spain  
and human rights groups argued that the abuses Pinochet was accused 
of constituted such grievous crimes that they fell outside 
international immunity protections. 
</P>
<P>
	They also contended that the International Convention Against  
Torture -- a human rights agreement signed by 110 nations, including 
Britain, Spain and Chile -- was created so officials accused of 
torture could be prosecuted by any nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges agreed with Pinochet's lawyers that the general could  
not be prosecuted for any crimes alleged before 1988, when Britain 
signed the torture convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Chile had argued that Britain and Spain were  
meddling in what should be a matter for Chilean courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest deliberations marked the second time Pinochet's fate  
rested with the House of Lords. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 25, a separate panel ruled against the general. But its  
3-2 decision was thrown out after the discovery that one of the 
judges who voted against Pinochet had close ties with the human 
rights group Amnesty International, a participant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were killed or  
disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police during his 
1973-90 regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who remains a senator-for-life, relinquished power in  
1990, and stepped down last year as the army chief.

</P>
<P>
	Vaughn has something to prove this year, not just to himself and  
to the Anaheim Angels, but to the Red Sox and all their fans. Just 
like Clemens, he wants to show general manager Dan Duquette and 
chief executive officer John Harrington made a colossal mistake by 
letting him go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think about my friends, my teammates, but I won't miss that  
organization. I don't miss the garbage and I don't miss the people 
running the team,'' Vaughn says on a cloudless spring morning, the 
desert sun starting to warm the dry air. ``It's just something that 
had to happen,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The words start coming quickly. Mo is a man who doesn't play  
games. He can't hide his feelings, even if he tried. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame,'' Vaughn says. ``We could have played for Lou  
Gorman for the rest of our careers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duquette, who replaced Gorman as general manager in January  
1994, didn't aggressively pursue Clemens, who then signed with 
Toronto and won consecutive Cy Young Awards for a record five. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after Clemens left, the Red Sox kept saying they  
wanted to keep Vaughn, but all their offers were months late and a 
few million dollars short, so he signed an $80 million, six-year 
contract with the Angels, who look to him for as a powerhouse on 
the field and off. 
</P>
<P>
	That means: Drive in the runs and drive the rest of the  
clubhouse to excel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything they brought him here for, he's going to give us,''  
says Tim Salmon, a veteran of the Angels' September flops in 1997 
and 1998. ``He's not going to have MVP-type years every year. But 
he brings so much to the table, he's going to make myself, he's 
going to make Darrin Erstad, he's going to make Jim Edmonds have 
those MVP-type years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Clemens, Vaughn brings intensity and all those intangibles  
that baseball managers cite. He had a personal trainer come by at 7 
a.m. every day this spring, bullying the body even before he went 
to the ballpark for BP. 
</P>
<P>
	``He dedicates himself and prepares himself as good as  
anybody,'' Angels manager Terry Collins says. ``He not only drives 
himself to it, he drives everyone to do the same thing. We did our 
homework. We know what he's like. He's not going to hold clubhouse 
meetings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's at those crucial times in games, when players need to suck  
it up to get a hit, or pitchers need to bear down and get an out, 
that Vaughn makes his presence felt. A little word here and there, 
just to let a teammate know this is the time when winning teams 
separate themselves from the rest of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell a player something,'' Collins says. ``But if it  
comes from Mo Vaughn, it means a lot more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim, which has never been to the World Series since starting  
play in 1961, has not been known as a hearty bunch. For years, Gene 
Autry tried to spend for a winner. Now that it's The Walt Disney 
Co.'s team, the Mouse people in charge want to change that 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Up in LA, the Dodgers brought in Kevin Brown for wins and  
toughness in their laid-back clubhouse. It's Vaughn's job to do the 
same down in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's hurt, everyone's sore, probably after a  
week-and-a-half of the season,'' Collins says. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Vaughn comes in. Collins says Vaughn carries a  
message with him everywhere he goes, and doesn't even have to 
verbalize it: 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't make excuses. Play every game to completion. Don't give  
away any at-bats. Watch the batting cage. This guy comes in with a 
purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn has struggled this spring, going 12-for-38 (.316) through  
Tuesday with no homers and nine RBIs. Layered in windbreakers and 
sweatshirts in the early morning cool of the desert spring isn't 
what he's used to, and the high skies seem to have given him 
trouble picking up the ball out of pitchers' hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, it's spring training, so he's not concerned. He  
still has time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he's no longer in the center of the Beantown glare, with  
Red Sox fans wondering if he'll stay or go, with the team hinting, 
making and withdrawing offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always feeling like I had to go out and prove myself to  
the people I worked for,'' Vaughn says. ``There was never a rest 
period, a stable period. If I had stayed, I would have retired 
angry. I didn't want to choose that way to leave the game. I would 
have never had fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll live in Newport Beach, about a half-hour drive from the  
ballpark. It will be quite different from life in Easton, Mass., 
where he wasn't just a ballplayer, he was a civic hero. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox brought up the negatives, the July 1995 bar fight in  
Boston (he was defending a girl friend and no charges were brought) 
and the January 1998 arrest in Dedham, Mass., on a drunken driving 
charge (he was acquitted). After 7 1/2 seasons with the team, he had 
enough. He wanted peace of mind to go along with his millions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not angry about my situation at all,'' he says. ``It was  
worth the struggle. It made me a better person. It made me 
strong.''

<HEADLINE> Jesse Jackson Won't Run in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jesse Jackson said Wednesday he won't make a  
third run for the White House in 2000, opting instead to 
concentrate on his push to get corporate America to invest in 
minority businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time spent running for president is time that cannot be  
spent doing something else,'' Jackson told attendees at a luncheon 
for the Chicago-based Lasalle Street Project, one of several 
organizations his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition is setting up to encourage 
investment in non-white and poor communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got so many issues I want to raise. I've got so many  
battles left to fight,'' the longtime civil rights activist said. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes building on Rainbow/PUSH's two-year-old Wall  
Street project, which has already seen results. AT&AMP;T, for example, 
has committed to have $1 billion in bonds brokered through Blaylock 
&AMP; Partners L.P., a black-owned brokerage firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainbow/PUSH also has purchased stock in 50 high-tech companies  
in an attempt to get them to put more non-whites and women on their 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the world of venture capital to be opened to women,  
blacks, browns, Asians and Native Americans and new immigrants -- 
people with ideas, talent and networks that can build a stronger 
America,'' Jackson said in his speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Jackson said a presidential campaign would sap energy  
from those efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who met last week with President Clinton, said the  
president was surprised to hear he wasn't running -- a decision 
Jackson says he made independently. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never sought to influence my political decision,'' Jackson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jackson out of the race, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New  
Jersey remains the only declared competitor to front-running Vice 
President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson praised Gore and Bradley but declined to endorse either  
man. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who has for years cultivated a friendship with Jackson in  
part to prevent a primary challenge that might complicate Gore's 
standing in the Democratic Party's liberal wing, praised Jackson as 
``a strong voice for justice and progress in America for decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He will play a major role in shaping the politics and policy  
dialogue in 2000 -- and beyond,'' a statement from Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Wilhelm, a Chicago businessman and former chairman of the  
Democratic National Committee, said Jackson's decision could give 
Gore a boost in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of practical politics, this really opens the door for  
Al Gore,'' said Wilhelm, who attended Wednesday's luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, a 57-year-old preacher who calls both Chicago and  
Washington home, has never held public office but remains one of 
the country's best-known black political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	His first White House bid in 1984 was followed by a second  
populist campaign in 1988. In both races, he was credited with 
increasing black voter turnout.

<HEADLINE> Court Explores Media, Police Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court appeared determined  
Wednesday to stop police from letting TV cameras and other news 
media accompany them into people's homes to observe arrests or 
searches. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice David H. Souter balked most emphatically at being told  
``media ride-alongs'' can help deter crime and police excesses, and 
should trump concerns for personal privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the help provided here?'' he asked. ``I don't see why  
you have to take the news media people into someone's home ... it 
sounds like fluff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When a lawyer contended that such ride-alongs are commonplace,  
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor shot back in incredulous tones, ``Ride 
right into the house?'' She later called one such incident ``an 
amazing invasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In all, six of the court's nine members asked pointed questions  
or voiced concerns, suggesting a willingness to let people sue law 
enforcement officers who let journalists enter someone's home. 
</P>
<P>
	For such liability to exist, the court must rule that police  
with court warrants violate the Fourth Amendment's protection 
against unreasonable searches and seizures when they take 
journalists with them. If so, another legal issue looms: Can the 
journalists be punished financially, too? 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four news organizations, including The Associated Press,  
have sided with law enforcement officers in two cases from Maryland 
and Montana the court will decide by late June. They cite the news 
media's role as a watchdog, but First Amendment rights were barely 
mentioned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly new, the police practice of letting journalists accompany  
them has been given higher visibility in recent years by true-life 
television programs that focus on police work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only authority police have is to enter the home, (not)  
bring along the media on a news-gathering expedition,'' Washington 
lawyer Richard Willard argued. He represents a Maryland couple 
photographed by The Washington Post in their nightclothes as 
sheriff's deputies and federal agents unsuccessfully searched for 
their fugitive son. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles lawyer Henry Rossbacher sounded a similar theme in  
arguing for a Montana couple whose ranch was raided by about 20 
federal agents because they were suspected of killing eagles. He 
said the agents, who were accompanied by a Cable News Network 
camera crew, ``came to search for poison; they brought along the 
press to search for TV footage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Richard Cordray of Grove City, Ohio, who represents the  
federal agents in both cases, urged the court not to ban every 
instance of the news media entering someone's home at the 
invitation of police. But, under persistent and rapid-fire 
questions from the bench, he was hard-pressed to explain when such 
access is justified. 
</P>
<P>
	No one doubted that police are free to take along some outsiders  
to help them -- such as translators or owners of searched-for stolen 
property -- but Willard contended that journalists do not offer 
police that kind of specific assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Justice Antonin Scalia asked Cordray, the federal  
agents' lawyer, whether police officers with court warrants could 
elect to take along their sisters-in-law as well as the news media. 
``Personally, I'd rather have your sister-in-law come along,'' 
Scalia said as the courtroom exploded in laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 80-minute argument session, only Chief Justice William H.  
Rehnquist asked questions that consistently portrayed the police 
conduct in a positive light. Comments and queries from Justices 
Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer were 
far more critical. 
</P>
<P>
	The court could use the Montana case to draw a distinction  
between entering a residence and other types of private property, 
such as ranchland. 
</P>
<P>
	And even if the justices decide that such news media access can  
violate privacy rights, they still must determine whether those 
rights were ``clearly established'' when the Maryland and Montana 
raids occurred -- in 1992 and 1993, respectively. If not, the 
officers cannot be forced to pay any damages. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Maryland case, Montgomery County deputies and deputy U.S.  
Marshals took along a Washington Post reporter and photographer 
when they entered the Rockville home of Charles and Geraldine 
Wilson early one morning. The photographs were never published. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montana case arose from a raid at Paul Berger's sheep and  
cattle ranch. Berger was acquitted of all charges except improper 
use of a pesticide, a minor offense, and CNN eventually used 
footage of the raid as part of its coverage of government efforts 
to protect endangered species.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Tossed Out After Called Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- This wasn't the exit Sammy Sosa's used to  
making. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season's NL MVP was ejected in the seventh inning of the  
Chicago Cubs exhibition game Wednesday night after getting called 
out on strikes. The last pitch was high and to the outside, and 
when umpire Travis Katzenmeier called it a strike, Sosa looked at 
him, shook his head and turned toward the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	As he walked back to the dugout, Sosa tapped his bat on the  
ground. That apparently was enough for Katzenmeier, who tossed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just said, `No way. That's not a strike,''' Sosa said of  
what he did to set off Katzenmeier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa also said he was wrong for getting upset.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went a little bit out of control,'' he said. ``Everybody who  
knows me knows I don't do that. It was a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa has been ejected once in his major league career.

<HEADLINE> Izzo: Early Matchups Key in Final 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The last time Michigan State and Duke met,  
the Blue Devils held point guard Mateen Cleaves to 3-of-17 shooting 
and only nine points. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State coach Tom Izzo admitted after that Dec. 2 game in  
Chicago that Cleaves pressed too much and his shooting was off. 
</P>
<P>
	But Izzo sees a difference now in his star playmaker. And he  
says his Spartans are pitching in as a team to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mateen is a lot better now than he was then,'' Izzo  
said. ``I really think A.J. Granger has stepped it up a couple of 
notches. I think Andre Hutson is getting better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granger scored 14 points in Sunday's 73-66 win over Kentucky in  
the NCAA Midwest Regional, with three 3-pointers. Hutson also 
scored 14 points, while Cleaves had 10 points and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Spartans are mentally and physically preparing to take  
on the Blue Devils for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's NCAA semifinals, No. 1-rated Duke (36-1) and No. 2  
Michigan State (33-4) face off at Tropicana Field after Connecticut 
(32-2) takes on Ohio State (27-8). The winners of Saturday's games 
will meet for the NCAA championship final Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	As in Sunday's game against Kentucky, the Spartans fell behind  
13 points against Duke. But in a move that has become a Spartans 
trademark this season, they battled back, closing to 58-55 with 
6:08 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Spartans then built on their comeback to beat  
Kentucky. They weren't so lucky against the Blue Devils, who shut 
down the Spartans after Cleaves missed several shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite losing, the Spartans ended the Duke game with a 36-20  
edge in rebounds, which would help them Saturday if they can repeat 
the feat. So far this season, they've outrebounded their opponent 
in 35 of their 37 games while winning 33 times. 
</P>
<P>
	They also do a good job of contesting baskets. They've allowed  
60 or fewer points in eight of their last 10 outings. In their four 
NCAA games so far, they've held their opponents to just 38.5 
percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be tougher against Duke, which has averaged 93 points  
this season compared to Michigan State's 72. But Izzo, while 
acknowledging his team faces a huge challenge, remains optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to find a way to check 'em,'' he pledged.  
</P>
<P>
	That may require some extra maneuvers in practice, which Izzo  
plans to keep as normal as possible before the team leaves Thursday 
for Florida. Despite the experience he gained in their first 
matchup, Izzo isn't preparing the Spartans for the Blue Devils team 
they played in Chicago, but the one awaiting them in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're a lot better team than we were in December, and  
I think they're a lot better team than they were in December,'' he 
said. ``So we're going to have to make some strides this week.''

<HEADLINE> Susan McDougal Breaks Court Silence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal occasionally dabbed  
tears from her eyes as she testified that her husband's mental 
illness was the undoing of their marriage and business and 
ultimately led to the Whitewater investigation against President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	A former business partner of Clinton and first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton, Mrs. McDougal testified almost four hours in her 
own defense Tuesday, answering some questions she refused to answer 
before a federal grand jury in 1996 and again last year. 
</P>
<P>
	She was expected to return to the stand today in her trial on  
charges of obstruction of justice and criminal contempt of court 
for refusing to answer grand jury questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Mark Geragos, said the testimony Tuesday was a  
``cathartic'' experience for his client. She has said she refused 
to answer federal grand jury questions because she feared 
retaliation from prosecutor Kenneth Starr if he didn't like what 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way she was going to get out the true story here was  
to tell it in a courtroom,'' Geragos said outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal and her late ex-husband, James McDougal, were  
partners with the Clintons in the Whitewater real estate venture in 
northern Arkansas. The McDougals and then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker were 
convicted of business fraud in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, she refused to answer grand jury questions about the  
Clintons and spent 18 months in jail for civil contempt. She again 
refused to answer the questions in April last year and was indicted 
on two counts of criminal contempt and one count of obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking directly at jurors and choking back tears, Mrs. McDougal  
said Tuesday her ex-husband was ``a control person,'' had a temper 
and experienced mood swings, but would not concede at first that he 
had a problem. She said he suffered from manic depression and had 
serious health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors showed no expression. Some took notes; others rocked  
in their chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal described how she was in awe of her husband,  
trusted him and did not realize until their marriage hit the skids 
and their Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan was being investigated 
by bank examiners that he had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	When McDougal asked her to sign a $300,000 loan to her from  
David Hale's Capital Management Services, she did not question him, 
she said. Hale, a prosecution witness in the 1996 trial, has 
claimed that Clinton pressured him to make the fraudulent loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale has served 21 months of a 28-month sentence for defrauding  
the Small Business Administration through Capital Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said she did not discuss the loan with Clinton,  
answering a question she previously would not answer before the 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	In her testimony Tuesday, she also said Clinton gave truthful  
testimony at her trial. She conceded that she may have mentioned to 
him a Whitewater-related venture that was purchased partly with the 
$300,000 loan. Clinton has denied knowing anything about the 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal described how James McDougal, who also had worked  
on Clinton's gubernatorial staff in Arkansas, ``loved Bill Clinton 
very much.'' But she said her husband became angry with Clinton 
after the thrift failed and McDougal was charged in the late 1980s 
with banking violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said her husband, who was later acquitted of those  
charges, felt abandoned by his friends, including Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	During Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign, she said, McDougal  
told her that Little Rock lawyer Sheffield Nelson, a Republican and 
Clinton foe, arranged for him to be paid if he would talk to a New 
York Times reporter about Whitewater. Mrs. McDougal also testified 
that McDougal told her he discussed Clinton's past ``in a 
conference call with the Bush White House'' during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson did not return a telephone call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Sharks Unsure About Zyuzin Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The FBI and members of the NHL's  
security office reportedly are investigating alleged links between 
the Russian mafia and the new agent for missing San Jose Sharks 
defenseman Andrei Zyuzin. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Post in Canada reported the inquiries in its  
editions Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyuzin, 21, remains suspended by the Sharks after missing the  
team flight to Boston on Friday. He went missing after firing agent 
Jay Grossman and switching to Vitaly Shevchenko, a native of 
Ukraine who is a Canadian citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources told the Post that the FBI was called in when the Sharks  
learned who had replaced Grossman. Shevchenko, who lives near San 
Jose, is well-known in hockey circles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI is heavily involved,'' one source said.  
</P>
<P>
	A second source confirmed the NHL's involvement.  
</P>
<P>
	Shevchenko is not certified by the NHL Players' Association. He  
lost his certification by failing to pay his dues. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL teams are prohibited by the collective bargaining agreement  
from dealing with agents who are not certified, so the Sharks have 
not been in contact with Shevchenko or Zyuzin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is the agent won't let us talk to Zyuzin, and we  
can't talk to him,'' Sharks assistant general manager Wayne Thomas 
told the San Francisco Chronicle. ``I can't really comment, I don't 
know. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing isn't good at all. I don't think any time of year  
the timing would be good, but not when we're in a playoff race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks beat Toronto 8-5 Wednesday night and hold the seventh

<HEADLINE> Iran-Contra Counsel Backs Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress should narrow but not kill the law  
that authorizes independent counsels to investigate high-ranking 
government officials, Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, whose seven-year inquiry into arms-for-hostages trading  
by the Reagan administration turned many Republicans against the 
1978 law, told a Senate committee the Watergate-inspired law gave 
credibility to investigations of presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Letting the Independent Counsel Act expire on June 30 would lead  
to a conflict of interest in presidential investigations because 
the attorney general, who is appointed by the president, would 
oversee the inquiry, Walsh told the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Democrats angered by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's  
investigation of President Clinton and the subsequent Senate 
impeachment trial have joined GOP colleagues in opposing the law's 
renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for a small group of moderates, the law appears to have  
little support. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, the committee chairman, suggested Congress  
might consider putting the issue aside until the partisan passions 
from the trial subside. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps regardless of what we do, we should wait and not try  
to meet the June 30 deadline,'' said Thompson, R-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Howard Baker, a one-time chief of staff to Reagan,  
made the same recommendation last month. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walsh said the public would not trust an independent  
prosecutor's findings without some form of the current law. A 
special counsel should have the power only to investigate 
allegations of abuse of office made against presidents and 
attorneys general for actions during their terms, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department could handle cases involving other  
officials, Walsh said.

lackluster session as traders, chastened by Tuesday's big drop, 
refrained from placing any big bets.

<HEADLINE> Reds Put Neagle, Belinda on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Denny Neagle is improving, but not  
enough to avoid the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle threw 32 strikes out of 58 pitches Tuesday in a ``B''  
game that amounted to his biggest test of the spring. The 
Cincinnati Reds left-hander gave up three hits over four innings, 
including Terry Steinbach's homer 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds put him on the 15-day disabled list today, along with  
reliever Stan Belinda and pitcher Scott Winchester. Belinda, who 
has multiple sclerosis, is bothered by a sore arm, and Winchester 
is in rehabilitation from shoulder surgery last August. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Reds got Neagle from Atlanta in November in a trade,  
they figured him for a regular in the rotation. Instead, he pulled 
thigh muscles during a drill in the first full-squad workout, 
temporarily sidelining him. 
</P>
<P>
	There was another setback when strength tests found weakness in  
the back of his pitching shoulder. He was put on a workout program 
and held back while he builds up the muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't thrown in a regular spring game -- the ``B'' game on  
Tuesday was his toughest test yet -- and figured he was headed for 
the DL.

	Kiwi Air Lines Grounded by FAA  
</P>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Federal regulators ordered Kiwi  
International Air Lines to stop flying today, saying the tiny 
discount carrier was ``unable or unwilling'' to fly with top safety 
standards. The Federal Aviation Administration also ordered the 
Newark-based carrier, which filed for bankruptcy yesterday, to 
surrender its operating certificate and cancel its six-city flight 
schedule. The agency's grounding of Kiwi comes a day after the U.S. 
Department of Transportation threatened to shut down the airline in 
three weeks if it didn't come up with a better management plan.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. announced today it will cut  
up to 20 percent of Netscape's staff, or up to 500 workers, as it 
absorbs the pioneering software maker in a $10 billion acquisition. 
AOL also plans to cut 350 to 500 workers from its own 10,000-person 
staff. The cuts in Netscape's 2,500-person work force, mainly in 
its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters, should hit such 
back-office operations as accounting but largely leave alone 
Netscape's coveted group of 550 software developers and managers, 
financial analysts said. AOL closed down 3 1/8 at 117 7/8.

is backing off its plans to acquire an investment bank. William B. 
Harrison Jr. succeeds Walter V. Shipley, who will continue as 
chairman of the board. The changes are effective June 1. The 
announcement quickly created a buzz among bank watchers because of 
a report last week in The Wall Street Journal that Shipley had 
offered the CEO's job to the heads of several New York investment 
banks, if they agreed to merge with Chase. Although Shipley 
reportedly approached several investment banks, he told reporters 
today that Chase doesn't need to make an acquisition. Chase closed

acquire from BCE a 65 percent interest in BCE Mobile

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators of both parties want to help  
companies by cutting the fees they pay the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, most of which end up in the government's general 
coffers. SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt today endorsed the idea, which 
has backing from Wall Street and political traction at a time of a 
big federal budget surplus, now at an estimated $111 billion. As 
the stock market has boomed, the SEC has collected nearly five 
times what the market watchdog agency needs in fees from publicly

Securities Co. pools a combined $79.85 billion in assets, putting 
the merged company into the league of industry leaders Nomura 
Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co. The 
deal strengthens the hand of the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd.,

But the Nasdaq composite turned in a stronger day, finishing up

	LONDON (AP) -- U.S. telecommunications company MediaOne Group  
Inc. and Britain's Cable and Wireless PLC said today they are 
considering the sale of One 2 One, Britain's fourth-biggest mobile 
phone operator. The companies said another possibility may be to 
spin off One 2 One through initial public offering of its stock. A 
sale could fetch $18 billion, the Financial Times newspaper 
reported. It would be the first time that a British mobile phone 
company has changed hands. Launched in 1993, One 2 One now has 2 
million subscribers and covers 96 percent of Britain's population. 
MediaOne stock closed down 1 1/4 at 66 1/4.

	Durable-Goods Orders Drop 5 Percent

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- February orders to factories for big-ticket  
durable goods such as aircraft and washing machines slumped 5 
percent to a seasonally adjusted $191.8 billion in the worst 
decrease in seven years. The drop, however, followed significant 
gains of 3.3 percent in January and 3.4 percent in December and 
left orders still above the November level, the Commerce Department 
said today. A huge swing in civilian aircraft orders, up from $4.9 
billion to $11.5 billion in January and down to $7.9 billion in 
February, largely -- but not entirely -- explains February's decline.

	More Consumers Fall Behind on Loans

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' confidence in the economy and  
appetite for borrowing increased in the final three months of 1998, 
pushing the delinquency rate on consumer loans and credit cards to 
a 15-month high. The seasonally adjusted percentage of credit-card 
accounts 30 or more days past due rose to 3.45 percent in the 
October-December quarter, from 3.28 percent the previous quarter,

<HEADLINE> NJ Benefit Glitch Unrelated to Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A computer glitch that caused $23 million  
in food stamps to be given out prematurely in New Jersey was not 
connected to Y2K millennium bug problems as first suspected, 
computer experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was one of human error and hardware on a computer  
that controls the automated food stamp accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	A finance computer erroneously deposited $23 million worth of  
April food stamp allotments into about 140,000 automated accounts 
on Sunday -- 11 days early. 
</P>
<P>
	Recipients of this accidental generosity quickly spent about $5  
million of the premature allotment, said Jacqueline Tencza, 
spokeswoman for New Jersey's Department of Human Services. State 
officials, acting on calls from some confused recipients, corrected 
the problem Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey has done away with the paper food stamp program for  
most recipients, replacing them with electronic debit cards which 
people can use at supermarkets like a bank card. The debit cards 
use a computer transmission to deduct food stamps from an 
individual's account and then report the balance remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Human Services spokesman Ed Rogan had said the glitch was caused  
by new ``Y2K'' software designed to protect computer records from 
disruption when the calendar changes to Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have not yet decided whether to penalize recipients  
who spent their April allotments already. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly recognize this was a state error and we have some  
responsibility in that,'' she said Tuesday. ``At the same time, 
people do have to be accountable for their actions.''

<HEADLINE>  Sharks Acquire Habs' Damphousse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Hoping to add some offensive punch as  
they edge toward the playoffs, the San Jose Sharks acquired 
Montreal Canadiens captain Vincent Damphousse just before the trade 
deadline Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for the veteran center, Montreal will receive a  
fifth-round draft pick this year, a second-round pick in 2000 and 
future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the guy's got some darned good credentials,''  
Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi said. ``This guy has played at 
a high level and played for Team Canada, so there's more to him 
than just numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damphousse, who becomes an unrestricted free agent July 1, had  
12 goals and 24 assists in 65 games this season. But he is still 
considered a talented face-off man and defensive forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi, aware of concerns about Damphousse's lackluster play  
this season, said the Sharks were willing to take the chance -- 
because of his track record and because the team did not have to 
give up too much in return. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good risk,'' Lombardi said.  
</P>
<P>
	In his 13th season, Damphousse is just seven games shy of 1,000  
career games. A two-time All-Star, he has 916 career points, 
including 340 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	He has had four 90-point seasons, and has had at least 30 goals  
in five seasons. And he has playoff experience: He was a key member 
of the 1993 Stanley Cup-winning Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
	Damphousse should join the Sharks on Wednesday, the team said.

<HEADLINE>  Sharks Acquire Habs' Damphousse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Hoping to add some offensive punch as  
they edge toward the playoffs, the San Jose Sharks acquired 
Montreal Canadiens captain Vincent Damphousse just before the trade 
deadline Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for the veteran center, Montreal will receive a  
fifth-round draft pick this year, a second-round pick in 2000 and 
future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the guy's got some darned good credentials,''  
Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi said. ``This guy has played at 
a high level and played for Team Canada, so there's more to him 
than just numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damphousse, who becomes an unrestricted free agent July 1, had  
12 goals and 24 assists in 65 games this season. But he is still 
considered a talented face-off man and defensive forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi, aware of concerns about Damphousse's lackluster play  
this season, said the Sharks were willing to take the chance -- 
because of his track record and because the team did not have to 
give up too much in return. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good risk,'' Lombardi said.  
</P>
<P>
	In his 13th season, Damphousse is just seven games shy of 1,000  
career games. A two-time All-Star, he has 916 career points, 
including 340 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	He has had four 90-point seasons, and has had at least 30 goals  
in five seasons. And he has playoff experience: He was a key member 
of the 1993 Stanley Cup-winning Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
	Damphousse should join the Sharks on Wednesday, the team said.

<HEADLINE>  Carlos Baerga Starts Over With Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- For a guy starting over at the bottom,  
Carlos Baerga was in a great mood. 
</P>
<P>
	The second baseman was smiling and unfailingly upbeat Wednesday  
morning when he showed up at the Cincinnati Reds training complex 
to try to resurrect his fading career. 
</P>
<P>
	He took batting practice, fielded grounders and even signed some  
autographs for a handful of fans who remembered his glory days in 
Cleveland -- three All-Star games, one World Series, seemingly 
unlimited potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after the Indians gave up on him and traded him to  
the New York Mets, the 30-year-old Baerga is barely hanging on. The 
St. Louis Cardinals waived him last Wednesday rather than keep him 
on the opening day roster at $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he accepted a nonguaranteed minor-league contract  
with the Reds, who consider him a low-risk reclamation project. For 
the first time since 1990, Baerga is out of the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit tough, when you're used to being in the big  
leagues,'' Baerga said. ``But you have to realize that sometimes 
you have to start again. Sometimes you have to do what you did 
before to get back on track. If I have to go that way, I'm going to 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has no choice. He will start the season at Triple-A  
Indianapolis knowing that nothing is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to be blocking the way of a prospect at  
Triple-A,'' general manager Jim Bowden said. ``If at some point we 
get him into shape, he might help the major league club. If not, he 
also may be a player we could trade down the road for a younger 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His shape is the big thing.  
</P>
<P>
	The Reds have assigned one of their trainers to help Baerga get  
in shape. Conditioning coordinator Lance Sewell set up a program to 
help Baerga lose weight and get stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga has thick thighs and an ample midsection, but doesn't  
understand the concerns about his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overweight stuff -- I've been like that all my career,''  
Baerga said. ``I'm a guy who always comes to spring training like 
that and I lose weight. So I don't worry about that. I know I'm 
going to be ready when I need to be ready -- my bat and my legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't anywhere near ready enough for the Cardinals, who  
watched him go 2-for-15 in six games and cut him loose. By dumping 
him last Wednesday, St. Louis owed him only 30 days' pay, or 
$163,394. 
</P>
<P>
	His production has declined since 1995, prompting the Indians  
and Mets to decide they could do better. When the Cardinals saw him 
in spring training, they decided he wasn't worth the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go to spring training and play (six) games and they just  
decide they're going to let me go. That was kind of surprising,'' 
Baerga said. ``I've never been in this situation before.''

<HEADLINE> Hall of Famer Brett Teaches Royals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAINES CITY, Fla. (AP) -- With a team full of young, untested  
players, the Kansas City Royals are turning more to George Brett 
for help this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett often can be found by Kansas City's batting cage, giving  
hitting tips and advice. He also hits grounders, throws batting 
practice and works with individual players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm lovin' this,'' Brett said. ``What a great way to make a  
living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since he finished his Hall of Fame career in 1993, Brett has  
made annual stops at the Royals' spring training to work with 
players. The stops usually were brief. Bob Boone wasn't receptive 
to much more during his years as manager, but Tony Muser has a 
different attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some guys will listen, some won't,'' said Brett, the team's  
vice president for baseball operations. ``But I'm careful not to 
overstep my bounds. I'm not the hitting coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most veterans are quick to grab him for help.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has so much knowledge of the game,'' third baseman Joe  
Randa said. ``Getting that kind of information from someone like 
George is a bonus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, who will be inducted in the Hall this summer, won three  
batting titles, had 3,154 hits and a career average of .305 . 
</P>
<P>
	His older brother, Ken, a former big-league pitcher, will  
introduce him at the July 25 induction ceremony because, ``he's 
been in the same foxholes as I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett admits he still gets tears in his eyes when he thinks  
about being in the Hall of Fame. And he's very nervous about the 
acceptance speech he must give at Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never practiced a speech,'' he said, ``but I think I'll  
practice this one. This is the most emotional moment I'll ever 
experience. Everything else compared to this is an ant hill. This 
is colossal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But being elected to the Hall hasn't changed Brett's nature.  
``I'm the same old dirt bag I've always been,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is why he enjoys helping at spring training. But he also  
knows his credentials won't do him any good if the hitting messages 
he delivers can't be understood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ted Williams was probably the greatest hitter of all times,''  
he said, ``but I've been told he was a terrible hitting coach. I 
try to keep it simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett follows the lead of his teacher, Charley Lau, the late  
Royals hitting coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get caught up in hard-core mechanics,'' Brett said.  
``There is no perfect swing. Everyone has a different stance, so 
how could there be a perfect swing? If there was, everyone would 
use it.''

<HEADLINE> Pam Tillis in `Smokey Joe's Cafe' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- How many people get the chance to savor the  
``ice cream on the pie of life''? 
</P>
<P>
	That's how country singer-songwriter Pam Tillis describes being  
the first guest star in ``Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' a Broadway revue of 
Leiber and Stoller songs. The show, featuring classic songs written 
by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, recently celebrated its fourth 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Tillis had her first country hit ``Don't Tell Me What to Do'' in  
1991. She has been touring steadily ever since. The Country Music 
Association named her female vocalist of the year in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	So how does performing on Broadway fit into her country music  
career? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not to the exclusion of my regular career,'' she says.  
``It's in addition to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tillis hastens to explain that she's not tired of country music;  
she just wanted to branch out. When she heard the show was looking 
for guest stars, she told her agent to get on the phone -- and 
quickly! 
</P>
<P>
	She will appear in ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' until April 4. Lou  
Rawls, Gladys Knight and Tony Orlando will follow. 
</P>
<P>
	Tillis is in the Broadway show for a brief time because she has  
other commitments. But she isn't closing the door to a return 
engagement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Originally, they were going to stop the show and introduce me.  
I said, `What I really want to do is be part of the cast.' I'm 
featured in four songs and I have a big number in the second half. 
And I sing with the cast. ... Which I love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her hit records include ``Maybe It Was Memphis,'' ``Walk in the  
Room,'' ``Mi Vida Loca'' (My Crazy Life), ``All the Good Ones Are 
Gone,'' ``Land of the Living,'' ``Spilled Perfume'' and ``I Said a 
Prayer for You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' Tillis is ``letting it twang every now  
and then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She adds: ``I'm just me. I'm not the twangiest country singer  
out there. You're going to hear rhythm 'n' blues and rock 
influences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tillis is the oldest of six children, all involved in music. Her  
father is country singer-songwriter Mel Tillis. She will perform 
with him at his theater in Branson, Mo., for a 10-week period 
starting in late spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year at her father's theater, Tillis performed two shows a  
week -- both on the same day -- and also did tour dates. Going back 
and forth from Branson was an experience she describes as ``a tough 
commute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never wanted to ride on any coattails,'' she says,  
explaining that last year was the first time she had performed with 
her father. ``I wanted to wait to be established on my own. It went 
really well. We sold out a lot of shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Tillis finishes touring in July, ``I'm looking forward to  
writing and being in the studio for the back half of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She hopes to find time to make a tribute CD to her father,  
singing his songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like Leiber and Stoller songs. It depends on how you play  
them. I know it can be very hip.''

<HEADLINE> Carson Has Heart Bypass Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Johnny Carson underwent successful  
quadruple heart bypass surgery and doctors expect him to recover 
fully, a hospital spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Carson, 73, was taken from his Malibu home to Saint John's  
Health Center at 3:30 a.m. Friday and doctors performed the surgery 
a few hours later, Lindi Funston said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The operation went very well and his heart is functioning  
normally,'' Ms. Funston said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Carson had the surgery to treat coronary artery disease  
and he is expected to be released in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Carson Productions spokesman Jeff Sotzing confirmed the  
information released by the hospital but refused to disclose 
additional details. 
</P>
<P>
	Carson retired as host of NBC's ``Tonight Show'' in May 1992. He  
was host of the late-night program for 30 years before Jay Leno 
took over.

<HEADLINE> Majerus Says He's Staying in Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah basketball coach Rick Majerus is  
staying put. 
</P>
<P>
	Majerus told KUTV in Salt Lake on Tuesday night that he has  
withdrawn his name from consideration for Notre Dame's vacant head 
coaching position and doesn't plan to field other offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm delighted about coming back next year, and I can say that  
with certainty,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, Majerus turned down San Diego State's offer to  
take over its moribund men's basketball program. He had been San 
Diego State's No. 1 choice since Fred Trenkle announced Feb. 11 
that he was resigning at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still led the rumor list to succeed John MacLeod at Notre  
Dame, with hazy reports of meetings between Majerus and Notre Dame 
officials. Majerus had said several times that he was 99 percent 
sure he would coach at Utah next season -- with Notre Dame making up 
the other ``1 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he has ruled out the Irish altogether.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Chippewa Indian Hunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eight bands of Chippewa Indians can continue  
to hunt and fish on 13 million acres of public land in Minnesota 
without state regulation, the Supreme Court ruled today in a case 
that attracted the attention of tribes nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 5-4 vote, the court said that neither an 1850 presidential  
order nor Minnesota's statehood in 1858 stripped the Chippewas of 
the hunting and fishing privilege they received in an 1837 treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``After an examination of the historical record, we conclude  
that the Chippewa retain the ... rights guaranteed to them under 
the 1837 treaty,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Indian law experts had said the court's decision could  
affect the security of other Indian treaty rights. The Chippewas 
were supported in friend-of-the-court briefs submitted by the 
National Congress of American Indians, Affiliated Tribes of 
Northwest Indians and 32 individual tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa sued the state in 1990,  
challenging its authority to impose hunting and fishing regulations 
on tribal members. The federal government and seven other Chippewa 
bands in Minnesota and Wisconsin joined the lawsuit. Nine counties 
and eight private landowners intervened on the state's side. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge ruled in 1994 that the package of rights  
guaranteed by the Chippewas' 1837 treaty with the United States 
``continues to exist,'' and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the nation's highest court said those courts were  
correct. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1837 treaty gave the Chippewa Indians the rights to hunt and  
fish ``during the pleasure of the president'' on 13 million acres 
it ceded to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's lawyers contended that an order President Zachary  
Taylor signed 13 years later took those rights away and ordered the 
Chippewas removed from the previously ceded lands. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chippewas opposed the removal order, and the federal  
government never enforced it. The bands continued to hunt and fish 
in the ceded territories -- an expanse of land in central Minnesota 
that includes Lake Mille Lacs, one of the state's prime walleye 
lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor wrote that Taylor's order requiring the Chippewas'  
removal from the land was not authorized by federal law, and that 
other provisions in Taylor's order revoking the hunting and fishing 
rights could not stand separately. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's lawyers also contended that the hunting and fishing  
privilege free of state regulation ended when Minnesota became a 
state in 1858 and entered the union on an equal footing with all 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
	However, O'Connor said Indian treaty rights can be revoked only  
when Congress clearly states its intent to do so. The legislation 
admitting Minnesota into the union did not mention Indian treaty 
rights, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Statehood by itself is insufficient to extinguish Indian  
treaty rights to hunt, fish and gather on land within state 
boundaries,'' O'Connor wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Her opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H.  
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices  
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the four, Rehnquist said Taylor's order ending the  
Chippewas' treaty privileges was valid, adding, ``There is simply 
no principled reason to invalidate the 150-year-old executive 
order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Minnesota vs. Mille Lacs Band, 97-1337.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra Expected To Heal Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Boston manager Jimy Williams relaxed in  
his office and smiled as he discussed the return of his best 
hitter. Nomar Garciaparra's elbow injury is minor and Williams' 
mood is brighter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being selfish, I'm certainly going to think we need this kid  
to win games, which is not an untrue statement,'' Williams said 
before his Red Sox faced Minnesota on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra wasn't back in town in time to play in that  
exhibition game. But he was expected to work out with the team 
Thursday after spending two days on the West Coast getting medical 
opinions on the elbow of his throwing arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main ligament on the inside of the elbow seemed perfectly  
fine,'' team physician Arthur Pappas said. ``One of the muscles 
coming from the area has a little inflammation and I expect that 
will quiet down. I anticipate Nomar will be back playing in the 
not-too-distant future, playing shortstop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the injury should heal completely.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams doesn't expect to use Garciaparra on his first day back  
with the team but there appears little doubt he will be ready to 
play shortstop before Boston begins its regular season on April 5 
in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to rush him in and play him nine innings right  
away,'' Williams said. ``I don't really have a specific game plan 
yet (but) it's nice to see that type of player back on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially since Mo Vaughn, Boston's top slugger, signed after  
last season with the Anaheim Angels. That left Garciaparra, who hit 
35 homers last season, as the team's only fearsome power hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	But he hasn't played shortstop since March 11 when he apparently  
hurt his elbow on a relay throw. He did play several games at 
designated hitter, but his condition was uncertain until he met 
Monday with Dr. Tony Daly, the Los Angeles Clippers' team 
physician, who performed an MRI and an examination. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra also saw Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Angels' physician, on  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deep down, the team's got to be a little concerned with a guy  
like that,'' said Red Sox infielder Lou Merloni, perhaps 
Garciaparra's closest friend on the team. ``You get one of the big 
guns on your team, now he's having problems throwing the ball, you 
want him in your lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, 25, was the AL's rookie of the year in 1997. Last  
season, he was second on the team with a .323 batting average and 
led Boston with 122 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams wanted to talk with Garciaparra before deciding when to  
use him again but was confident he'd be in shape since he was 
playing as a designated hitter and throwing lightly before leaving 
for the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all look forward to watching him play but we want to watch  
a healthy Nomar play,'' Williams said. ``He can feel free and 
positive when he makes plays out there, not restricted, so from 
that standpoint maybe that second opinion really helped him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pappas had some advice for Red Sox fans worried about the team's  
best hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't panic,'' he said. ``I think Nomar will be fine, and  
we'll have him back in the lineup, and he'll play the way he always 
plays, very well.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Destroyers Fire at Vessels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The chase of two suspected spy ships that intruded  
into Japan's waters and then fled toward North Korea has deeply 
alarmed many here, renewing calls today for Japan to bolster its 
defense capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The two ships, first spotted early Tuesday, were pursued through  
Japanese waters for about 24 hours by the coast guard and navy 
destroyers, which repeatedly fired warning shots. It was Japan's 
first such use of military ships since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi defended the dispatch of the  
military ships and said further study was needed for future 
response to intruders. Last week, Japan's Parliament began debate 
on bills to strengthen the country's military alliance with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we could not stop or inspect the suspicious ships, it  
was significant in clarifying our nation's commitment to 
security,'' Obuchi said. The chase was called off early today after 
the ships left Japanese waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they could not positively identify the  
nationality of the boats but said they bore false names, had 
suspicious antennas, no visible fishing gear and no national flags. 
Tokyo officials said they believed the ships were from North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said Tokyo will press for North  
Korea to hand the ships over if they enter North Korea's waters. 
Officials refused to confirm a report by the Kyodo News agency that 
Japanese radar tracked the vessels entering North Korean waters 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said the United States was ``seriously  
concerned'' about the incursion of the two ships into Japanese 
waters. ``We are working together with Japan to obtain more 
information,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said  
the United States had made surveillance aircraft available to Japan 
in tracking the ships. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea also said today it was closely monitoring the  
situation. South Korean military officials said they have no 
information on the mysterious ships. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no response for North Korea.  
</P>
<P>
	Japan is bound by a pacifist constitution that calls for  
avoiding the use of force unless it is clearly in self defense. 
Obuchi said the destroyers were called upon because the coast guard 
vessels were too slow. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo is wary of displaying its military powers for fear of  
angering its Asian neighbors, many of whom harbor bitter memories 
of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	But since North Korea fired a missile over Japan that landed in  
the Pacific Ocean last summer, the Japanese are increasingly 
worried about their vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Agency head Hosei Norota said the destroyers gave up the  
pursuit because of fears the chase could ``incite the intruders and 
escalate the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that before the ships were called off, Japanese radar  
detected aircraft leaving a base in North Korea and heading toward 
the ships.

<HEADLINE> Analysts: Boeing Unlikely To Suffer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Industry analysts believe a federal finding that  
a flawed rudder system led to two fatal crashes of Boeing 737s is 
unlikely to hurt Boeing in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	``The potential impact on Boeing, short of grounding the  
aircraft or requiring a whole new tail section be put on every 
aircraft, would be minimal,'' said Paul Nesbit, analyst at JSA 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board conclusion ``is  
certainly not good news and it could conceivably have some 
influence on future sales,'' he said Wednesday. ``However, the 
record of that aircraft is an enviable one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is this is not going to have a great big impact,''  
agreed Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen &AMP; Co. ``Boeing and the 
whole industry are safety conscious -- it's not like they are trying 
to run away from problems like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing contends the 737 is one of the safest airplanes in the  
sky, having carried more than 5 billion passengers on 77 million 
flights during the past three decades. The plane is the world's 
most popular commercial jet, with 3,300 in service. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB on Wednesday concluded two days of hearings into the  
cause of the 1994 crash of USAir Flight 427 near Pittsburgh. It 
directed Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, which both 
contend the rudder problems are being eliminated, to work together 
to devise further improvements for the Boeing 737. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB findings came at a time when Boeing is recovering from  
billions of dollars in losses resulting from production snarls 
after its 1997 purchase of McDonnell Douglas. It still is laying 
off thousands of employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The board decided that a jammed hydraulic valve that controls a  
plane's rudder led to crashes near Pittsburgh in 1994 and Colorado 
Springs, Colo., in 1991 and was responsible for the problems on a 
1996 flight in which pilots struggled to maintain control as they 
landed in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	In 34 findings of fact, the board declared that 737s do not have  
a rudder control system that is ``reliably redundant'' because the 
two existing control systems merge in a single hydraulic valve, 
known as the power control unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing said it believes it has corrected the problem with  
modifications now being made to early models of the twinjet. 
</P>
<P>
	But Charles Higgins, Boeing vice president of airplane safety  
and airworthiness, said the company would work with the FAA and 
outside experts to launch a new round of testing and research to 
determine what more might be done to improve rudder safety. Boeing 
is to report back to the NTSB in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing argues the 737 is one of the safest airplanes in the sky,  
having carried more than 5 billion passengers on 77 million flights 
during the past three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1982, there have been five fatal accidents involving 737s  
among U.S. airlines, the NTSB says. There are 3,100 of the jets in 
use worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no finer airplane in the air,'' said John Nance, an  
aviation analyst and author who also is a 737 airline pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Nance said he was disappointed at the NTSB ruling. He said he  
supports further study of the rudder system, but is leery of a 
major retrofit to the 737 fleet. ``You run the risk of introducing 
a new problem in a new design,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Training that pilots now receive to handle similar emergencies  
may do as much or more to prevent a reoccurrence of the USAir 
crash, Nance said. 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins declined to estimate what the new research and any  
additional modifications might cost Boeing and the airline 
industry. To date, he said, the investigation and 737 changes have 
cost Boeing and its suppliers about $130 million, and the airlines 
$20 million to $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not that big of a deal,'' said von Rumohr. He and  
Nesbit said Boeing has contingency funds to handle such expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, Boeing's commercial airplane division has  
suffered from snarled production lines, delayed deliveries and the 
expense of merging with McDonnell Douglas. Company officials say 
they have gotten a handle on the problems, and all of Boeing 
managed a profit of $1.1 billion on revenue of $56.2 billion in 
1998.

<HEADLINE> Ali Calls Holyfield-Lewis a 'Fix' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Muhammad Ali became the latest to question the  
controversial draw in the recent title fight between Evander 
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, calling the result ``the biggest fix in 
fight history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Senate Commerce Committee chairman John McCain,  
R-Ariz., Ali said he was humiliated that the sport ``had sunk to 
its lowest levels'' and added ``it was clear to all who watched 
that the deciding victor of the match was England's Lennox Lewis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draw in the heavyweight unification title fight between  
Holyfield and Lewis on March 13 in New York sparked investigations 
by a New York City grand jury, a New York state Senate committee, 
the New York State Athletic Commission and the Nevada Gaming 
Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a boxing fan, introduced a bill earlier this year which  
would restrict coercive option contracts by which promoters control 
a boxers' career, such as contracts forcing a boxer into a 
long-term deal in exchange for a shot at a world title. McCain 
named the bill for Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the former three-time heavyweight boxing champion of the  
world, I believe I have the credibility to say Lennox Lewis won 
this bout without question and should have been named the clear and 
decided victor,'' Ali wrote. ``What occurred once the 12-round 
event concluded will surely go down in the boxing annals as the 
biggest fix in fight history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Ali added his support to McCain's bill, which is  
aimed at protecting boxers from exploitation and requiring more 
openness from promoters about their financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	It would require promoters and organizers of major boxing events  
to disclose more financial information and to inform state boxing 
commissions of charges, costs and fees they take out of a boxer's 
purse. Identical legislation passed the Senate last October by 
voice vote, but the House did not take up the measure before the 
session ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation has taken on added importance, Ali said, in  
light of the disputed draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Professional boxers have for too long been the target of  
unscrupulous managers and promoters,'' Ali wrote. ``As witnessed 
(March 13), the three sanctioning organizations that award the 
title belts have joined the list of abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pray justice will be done and somehow along the way, honor  
can be restored to this sport,'' Ali added.

<HEADLINE> Ron Howard Returns to Comedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- When Ron Howard stood at the free-throw  
line as a high school basketball player in the early 1970s, 
opposing crowds razzed him with chants of ``Opie! Opie! Opie!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, who recalled that story for the screenwriters of his new  
movie, ``EDtv,'' knows a thing or two about the power of celebrity. 
After all, he's been one nearly all his life. 
</P>
<P>
	So it was a no-brainer five years ago when he decided to direct  
``EDtv'' after hearing a one-paragraph description of an obscure 
French-Canadian film called ``Louis XIX: King of the Airwaves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result is Howard's first comedy since ``Parenthood'' a  
decade ago, and stars Matthew McConaughey as a San Francisco video 
clerk who reluctantly agrees to let cameras follow his every move 
for a round-the-clock cable TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	If that premise sounds familiar, it did to Howard, too, and not  
just because TV viewers watched him grow up as Opie Taylor on ``The 
Andy Griffith Show'' and later as teen square Richie Cunningham on 
``Happy Days.'' Howard didn't scrap his latest film, even after he 
learned of ``The Truman Show,'' Peter Weir's critically acclaimed 
movie about a man who slowly realizes his whole life has been 
televised. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thematically they're night and day,'' Howard says. ``In one,  
this guy is trapped in a Twilight Zone-like existence. Ours is a 
contemporary comedy about somebody who wants to be famous and then 
realizes he gets more than he bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I have any fear it's that some people may say, 'I've  
already seen that ground covered.''' 
</P>
<P>
	What Howard wanted to capture most was the sense of ownership  
and entitlement the public often feels for celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of ``EDtv'' is interspersed with scenes of everyday people  
-- sorority sisters, a gay New York couple, adolescent boys -- as a 
kind of Greek chorus commenting on Ed's love for his brother's 
girlfriend, Shari (Jenna Elfman). At one point, a USA Today poll 
splashes the headline, ``Is Shari good enough for Ed?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to get across the sense of what it's like when a lot  
of people know you and you don't know them,'' Howard says. ``The 
whole nation has become a small town and everybody knows your 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the dark undercurrent of ``The Truman Show,'' Howard  
says ``EDtv'' is not an indictment of reality-based television but 
a movie that presents issues without judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a quintessential Howard film -- a sentimental ensemble fable  
about love, brotherhood and family. Those themes have been 
prevalent in nearly all of his 13 movies, from ``Splash'' to 
``Cocoon'' to his Academy Award-nominated ``Apollo 13.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally you'd say Ron couldn't relate to you because he's  
always been famous,'' says Lowell Ganz, who wrote ``EDtv'' with 
Babaloo Mandel. ``Despite the fact that he's always been a 
celebrity, he seems to understand the human experience. He knows 
what people feel in their daily lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the reason may be that althoughhe was acting from age 5,  
Howard grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Burbank, Calif., 
as the son of a local theater director. He attended public schools 
with his brother Clint, a bit actor who in a sly piece of casting 
portrays the ``EDtv'' director. 
</P>
<P>
	Actors say they love performing in Howard's films because his  
characters feel real. And as a former actor, Howard can identify 
with them; for ``EDtv'' he worked with McConaughey for hours trying 
to get him to remember exactly what it felt like the moment he 
realized he was famous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron, like all good directors, has a great sense of truth,''  
says Martin Landau, who portrays Ed's stepfather. ``There's a lot 
of guys out of MTV who can direct for a minute-and-a-half and they 
can be pretty interesting with a camera, but can they tell a 
story?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard's next project may be his most challenging, a live-action  
version of ``The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,'' starring Jim Carrey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to deal with the psychology of the Grinch,''  
Howard says. ``Like, why would anyone choose to live in a cave?'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his own fame, Howard says he still finds it odd sometimes  
when people approach him for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every once in a while they mix my whole career into a few  
sentences like, 'Hey Opie, have you seen the Fonz? You did a good 
job directing 'Apollo 13. 
</P>
<P>
	But would America be riveted watching Howard's life 24 hours a  
day? Occasionally, he admits it can be exciting: swapping 
director's stories with Steven Spielberg or seeing a sneak preview 
of the new ``Star Wars'' movie. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, says, the 45-year-old, who lives on the East  
Coast with his wife of nearly 25 years and their four children, 
``Would they really want to see me make oatmeal in the morning or 
watch me get the kids off to school?''

<HEADLINE> Families Impatient With 737 Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Ralph Dickerson still refuses to board a  
Boeing 737, even though it's been more than four years since his 
daughter died in a plane crash. His wife has given up flying 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dickersons' confidence in airplanes and the government  
remains low even as federal safety investigators wrapped up their 
probe into what caused a 737 to plunge into a hillside ravine near 
Pittsburgh on Sept. 8, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board determined today that  
the crash was caused by rudder problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something that takes 4 1/2 years means people are dragging their  
feet,'' Dickerson said Tuesday. ``Can you imagine 800 planes flying 
with passengers not knowing'' if the equipment is sound? 
</P>
<P>
	The 737 is the world's most common jetliner, with some 3,100 in  
use worldwide and 800 in the air at any given time. The National 
Transportation Safety Board has been eager to find out what went 
wrong to determine whether wholesale design changes are needed to 
prevent similar accidents in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Marla Dickerson and 131 other people were killed in the crash of  
USAir Flight 427 in Aliquippa, Pa. Her parents took a train from 
New York to join other family members angry, frustrated or 
impatient with the pace of the probe, the longest in the NTSB's 
31-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four and a half years is an awful long time to find out how  
your husband died,'' said Joanne Shortley of Pittsburgh, whose 
husband was on Flight 427. ``It's a long time not to have 
closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators long have suspected the 737's rudder system but  
were stymied by lack of information because the plane's flight data 
recorder only recorded 11 parameters Q too few as far as the safety 
board is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	While family members awaited word on the cause of the crash,  
they avoided flights when possible, especially those that use 737s. 
Some have even changed flights to avoid the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan Garber, whose older son was on the flight, drove six  
hours to the hearing from Dayton, Ohio, with his younger son. He 
has a pending lawsuit against the Boeing Co., which says its own 
investigation has found no supporting physical evidence for a 
problematic rudder reversal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori Fulton of Canonsburg, Pa., who lost her first husband,  
scoffed at the notion that aviation accidents are rare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone has to find out what's going on with the rudder  
system,'' she said. ``To everyone else it might be rare, but to all 
of us it's the event that changed our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board reserved a special section for some 100 family  
members in attendance. Family members watched attentively as 
investigators made detailed presentations on aircraft mechanics and 
simulations of the doomed flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the relatives already have gotten used to watching and  
hearing about the crash, although Angelina Hall of Las Vegas was 
saddened and ``sorry my mother had to endure what she did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Menarcheck and her two children wore buttons with a  
picture of their father, William Jr., who was returning home on 
business when the plane crashed. They remained hopeful that the 
hearings would settle the matter once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to know why and what they are going to do about  
it,'' said William Menarcheck III, 18, of Hopwood, Pa. ``It feels a 
lot better than not knowing what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And while several relatives criticized the length of the  
investigation, a few family members were actually glad the board 
took this long. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad they kept it open and got the job done as  
opposed to (finishing earlier) to say `I don't know,''' said Joan 
Kafcas, whose husband died in the crash.

<HEADLINE> No Socks, No Notre Dame for Majerus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Rick Majerus readily admits he's not a  
button-down kind of basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't wear socks. I don't even wear socks when it gets warm,  
and I think those guys have socks with all kinds of logos on 
them,'' the Utah coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	And so Majerus removed himself from consideration for the Notre  
Dame coaching job after realizing he wouldn't fit in with the 
school's image. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody at Notre Dame has a tie rack in their  
wardrobe, and I don't even have a tie in my wardrobe,'' Majerus 
told ESPN Radio Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Majerus fit the general criteria Notre Dame had established in  
its search for a replacement to the deposed John MacLeod. He had 
coached at a private school (Marquette) and was undoubtedly 
successful, having led Utah to the 1998 NCAA tournament 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	But Majerus has confessed to being somewhat of a fallen Roman  
Catholic with a penchant for cowboy boots - not exactly a dream 
candidate for the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Tribune, citing a source close to Majerus, said  
Notre Dame had problems with Majerus, too. The paper said the 
school's disapproval was based on excerpts from his recently 
released book, ``My Life On A Napkin.'' In it, Majerus wrote that 
it would be hypocritical for him to discipline an athlete for 
academic fraud because of the cheating he had done as a Marquette 
student. 
</P>
<P>
	Majerus has more pressing matters on his mind now that Notre  
Dame is no longer a consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have a good club next year, how good is anybody's guess  
right now,'' he said. ``I'm more concerned with what beach I'm 
going to lay on right now than the inevitable arrival of next 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame, meanwhile, was still considering Princeton's Bill  
Carmody, Xavier's Skip Prosser and Delaware's Mike Brey. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame athletic director Mike Wadsworth, who had recommended  
Majerus' hiring, said he wants a coach in place by April 7, the 
national signing day for high school recruits.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Prices Tumble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Tokyo and Hong Kong led sharp falls on Asian  
stock markets Wednesday, triggered by a tumble on Wall Street, 
worries over rising tensions in Yugoslavia and expectations of poor 
annual earnings results. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts across the region said investors were using the  
overnight drop in New York as an excuse to sell shares, which some 
believed had become overpriced in the recent rally through Asia 
Pacific exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	``They felt the market had overheated,'' said Yoshihiro Ito,  
general manager of Okasan Securities, in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo shares, having rallied on renewed hopes of an imminent  
economic recovery, suffered a second straight day of dramatic 
falls. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 503.63  
points, of 3.1 percent, to end the day at 15,515.47. On Tuesday, 
the average closed down 359.68 points, or 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks started to fall from the outset. The plunge was  
exacerbated in the afternoon by dealers rushing to reduce their 
positions ahead of Thursday, the last day of trading for delivery 
of shares in this Japanese fiscal year, which ends March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian markets were rattled by Tuesday's 2.2 percent fall by the  
Dow Jones industrial average, its second-worst performance this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	On the currency market, the U.S. dollar fell against the  
Japanese yen after a brief rally in reaction to rising tensions in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 117.72 yen, down 0.81 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 118.00 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares skidded for a second day, with the  
blue-chip Hang Seng Index plunging 329.67 points, or 3 percent, to 
10,711.34. On Tuesday, the Hang Seng had fallen 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Student Guilty in Baby's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTICELLO, Ark. (AP) -- A college student charged with stuffing  
her newborn into a campus trash bin pleaded guilty Tuesday to abuse 
of a corpse and negligent homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are asking that Tremaine Ingram get six years in  
prison at sentencing April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Her baby boy was found dead at the University of  
Arkansas-Monticello in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The former pre-law student was originally charged with  
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	According to her lawyer, Ms. Ingram went into a state of  
emotional turmoil after she was rebuffed by the reputed father of 
her child. She gave birth June 1 while standing and the baby fell 
headfirst on her dormitory room floor, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Believing the baby to be dead, she placed him in a paper bag,  
then went to dinner and a meeting before she put the body in the 
trash, where it was discovered the next day, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the baby was born alive because it had oxygen  
in its lungs and bruises on its head.

<HEADLINE> Prevention Curbs U.S. Fire Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Carmen Grabowski was deciding what to wear  
to church the next morning when the fire alarm sounded around 
midnight in her suburban Philadelphia apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Crying and coughing in the thick smoke, the elderly woman  
escaped through a window of the four-story building with the help 
of firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smoke was coming under the door. I was scared to death,'' Mrs.  
Grabowski said. ``We were very lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All 90 residents of the Springton Manor Apartments survived last  
weekend's blaze. More than luck was at play: Since the 1970s, home 
fire deaths have plunged 44 percent across the nation with advances 
in fire prevention -- especially smoke detectors -- and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say without hesitation that smoke alarms in a home can  
make the difference between life and death,'' said Paul Healy, 
spokesman for the Philadelphia-area Red Cross. ``It's a critical 
thing in keeping families alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Home fire deaths dropped from 6,015 in 1978 to 3,360 in 1997,  
the most recent year measured by the National Fire Protection 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Functioning smoke detectors are the most important contributor  
to the sharp drop, said Michael Karter of the NFPA, a Quincy, 
Mass.-based research organization. Smoke alarms reduce the risk of 
death in a fire by 40 to 50 percent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, 93 percent of homes now have smoke alarms, according  
to the U.S. Fire Administration. But the number is somewhat 
misleading -- officials estimate 30 percent of the devices don't 
work, either because of malfunctions or simple failure to install 
fresh batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, where fire deaths have dropped 20 percent in  
the past decade, safety programs have been particularly effective 
in cities that mandate smoke detectors in homes and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia, which began requiring the detectors in 1995,  
reported a 62 percent decline in apartment fire deaths in the past 
five years. In Pittsburgh, fire deaths have dropped 70 percent 
since 1989, the year before the city began requiring smoke 
detectors in all buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are installing more smoke detectors and changing the  
batteries,'' Philadelphia Fire Chief Henry Dolberry said. ``They 
are more aware of their fire safety and smoke detectors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, work remains to increase fire safety in low-income homes,  
where fires are more common, and for elderly people and children, 
who are more likely to die in fires. 
</P>
<P>
	``The incidence of fires -- while not necessarily fatal fires --  
is tied to income levels,'' Karter said. ``Households that have 
fires tend to be the kind of households that would be less likely 
to buy or use smoke detectors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though only 7 percent of U.S. homes do not have smoke detectors,  
those structures accounted for 58 percent of all reported fires, 
the U.S. Fire Administration says. Karter said low-income housing 
often is old or poorly managed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very cognizant that more needs to be done in the home  
and in certain sectors,'' said Julie Reynolds of the NFPA. But, she 
added: ``The overall trend is fire deaths going down, and that is 
wonderful.''

<HEADLINE> House Debates Disaster Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a White House veto threat, Republican  
leaders began pushing a $1.3 billion package through the House 
today that would help Central America recover from Hurricane Mitch 
and dispense money to U.S. farmers and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats mostly agreed on how the money would  
be spent. But they were clashing over how the legislation should be 
paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	When President Clinton requested the aid a month ago, he  
proposed paying for it mostly out of this year's anticipated 
federal surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	He has threatened to veto the House measure -- and a $2.2 billion  
version approved Tuesday by the Senate -- because Republicans would 
instead cut programs Clinton likes. These include food stamps and 
funds for purchasing weapons-grade plutonium and uranium from 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It signals that we are committed to changing the way things  
are done in Washington, to living within our means,'' said Rep. 
Porter Goss, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats and administration officials said the cuts were  
unwise. Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, contrasted GOP calls for 
spending billions on a new anti-missile defense system with their 
proposal to cut $150 million from the program that purchases 
nuclear materials from Russia to reduce that nation's nuclear 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards said cutting that program would be ``unwise, dangerous,  
and I hope and pray not catastrophic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate approval marked a rebirth for a measure that only Monday  
seemed destined to remain unfinished for another month. The major 
obstacle was removed after Republicans deleted language seeking to 
block U.S. military involvement in the Kosovo crisis. Instead, the 
Senate adopted a separate, bipartisan measure supporting U.S. 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate passage came after senators added $40 million for  
families of victims of the Feb. 3, 1998 accident in which a Marine 
jet cut the cable of an Italian ski gondola, killing 20 skiers. The 
House bill contains no such language. 
</P>
<P>
	The $40 million for the gondola accident -- up to $2 million for  
the family of each victim -- was added by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., sponsor of the measure, said it would  
``permit the United States to shoulder unambiguously its 
responsibility, uphold the honor of the United States military both 
at home and abroad, and begin to ease the grieving of 20 families 
who lost their loved ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement distributed at the Capitol, families of the  
accident's German victims called for ``compassion'' as the 
compensation measure moves through Congress. They also asked the 
Marines to continue to investigate the mishap. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb's amendment provides the money but gives Defense Secretary  
William Cohen 90 days to decide whether to make the payment. 
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said officials there would want to 
examine the provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators also used a voice vote to approve a block of provisions  
won by senators for their home states. These included up to $500 
million worth of guaranteed loans for oil and gas companies by Sen. 
Pete Domenici, R-N.M.; $125 million to reduce royalty payments by 
oil and gas companies using public lands by Sen. Jeff Bingaman, 
D-N.M.; and $70 million in help for the livestock industry by 
Bingaman and Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with House passage, it seemed unlikely that lawmakers could  
write a compromise and send it to Clinton by the end of the week. 
It also seemed unlikely that they could resolve the veto threats 
Clinton has issued against both disaster bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate bills contain nearly $1 billion to help  
Central America recover from several recent natural disasters. Most 
of the money would go to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa 
Rica, battered last October by Hurricane Mitch, which killed 9,000 
people and caused tremendous damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Both bills also contain funds to support Jordan, American  
farmers and a variety of other items. The Senate measure has $140 
million to help U.S. steel companies hurt by low-cost imports, 
while the House would replace a Corporation for Public Broadcasting 
satellite.

<HEADLINE> Gay Slaying Jury Selection Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A prosecutor asked 71 prospective jurors  
today to set aside the emotions of pity and rage if chosen for the 
trial in the death of gay college student Matthew Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha also told the panel to remember that  
Shepard, who was beaten and left tied to a fence in near-freezing 
weather last fall, was ``a victim that was different, a victim that 
was not the same as you and I.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he emphasized that the Constitution requires all people to  
be treated fairly under the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Rerucha's statements came as the trial of Russell Henderson  
began in Albany County District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	During his comments to potential jurors, defense attorney Wyatt  
Skaggs shifted the blame for the killing to Henderson's 
co-defendant, Aaron McKinney, who was to be tried later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  
Shepard,'' Skaggs said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also warned jurors they would be seeing ``really, really  
graphic'' photos during the trial. As he said this, Matthew 
Shepard's mother, Judy, who was in the last row of the courtroom, 
slowly looked down. 
</P>
<P>
	By the lunch break, 10 prospective jurors had been dismissed for  
various reasons, including health and business issues. One woman 
was dismissed for child care reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	During the morning session, Henderson, 21, showed little emotion  
and occasionally looked at the pool of possible jurors seated in 
the courtroom's spectator section. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and the 21-year-old McKinney both face the death  
penalty if convicted in a case that has become a central focus for 
gay rights activists and others seeking stronger bias crime 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements were scheduled for April 6.  
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Henderson and McKinney, both high-school  
dropouts, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound 
Shepard out of a bar last October and then kidnapped and beat him, 
leaving him lashed to a fence. Shepard, a political science major 
at the University of Wyoming, was not found for hours and died five 
days later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the attention given the case, there were only a few  
spectators in the courtroom. Fenced-off areas for protesters 
outside were empty. Still, police stepped up patrols today outside 
the courthouse because anti-gay protesters and gay rights advocates 
have clashed repeatedly over the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Osborn, who attended grade school with Shepard and remained  
his friend, stopped by the courthouse on his way to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is: My friend is dead,'' Osborn said.  
``Matt was a person. He wasn't just a gay man. Nothing can bring 
him back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about having to endure the trials of the two murder  
suspects, Osborn said, ``It's going to be very difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Shepard's mother asked Congress and state  
legislatures to enact bias crime laws to deter future acts of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes  
from happening. But they can reduce them,'' Mrs. Shepard said at a 
news conference in Washington, D.C. ``They can help change the 
climate in this country, where some people feel it is okay to 
target specific groups of people and get away with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only that she  
and her husband ``want to allow justice to run its course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City spokesman Randy Vickers said police have set up fences to  
keep news reporters and demonstrators at bay, and access to the 
courthouse has been limited to one door, where two metal detectors 
have been installed. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is expected to last five weeks.

<HEADLINE> J.P. Morgan, DKB Set Up Invest Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Wall Street investment bank J.P. Morgan and Co.  
said Wednesday its investment management unit has formally agreed 
to set up a joint venture with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. to sell 
mutual funds in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3 billion yen ($25.5 million) venture, first announced last  
October, was tentatively scheduled to begin developing and 
marketing investment trusts to retail clients in May, J.P Morgan 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Investments trusts in Japan are similar to mutual funds sold in  
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The tie-up gives the investment management arm of J.P. Morgan  
greater access to a personal savings pool estimated at $9 trillion 
through DKB's network of branch offices across Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai-Ichi Kangyo, one of the country's largest banks, hopes to  
gain know-how from J.P. Morgan in developing the latest financial 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture, to be owned equally by both companies, has been  
named Dai-Ichi Kangyo J.P. Morgan Investment Management Co.

<HEADLINE> Baylor Brings Reputation to Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- As line drives rocketed from his bat,  
touching down in all corners of the outfield, Brian Jordan turned 
to the large, imposing man leaning against the batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Baylor inched forward, a foot propped on the metal railing,  
a small grin curling his lips. 
</P>
<P>
	``How about that, Don?'' Jordan said, obviously pleased with the  
results of a one-on-one session with Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a big difference from yesterday, isn't it?'' Baylor  
said, remembering how his student merely grazed the soft, 
batting-practice tosses a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves are hoping Baylor has that sort of impact on  
every hitter in the lineup. Despite setting a franchise record with 
215 homers, they decided a different approach was needed on 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager John Schuerholz wanted a hitting coach who could  
command enough respect from the players to break bad habits. He 
wanted someone who preached a more complete style of hitting, not 
just the home-run-or-bust philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted someone like Don Baylor.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to stay away from strikeouts and put the ball in  
play a little bit more,'' said Baylor, who landed with the Braves 
after six years as manager of the Colorado Rockies. ``When you do 
that, you're going to score more runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That sounds out of character from a guy who hit 338 homers  
during his playing career and put together teams in Colorado that 
usually ranked among the NL lead in that category. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, for instance, the Rockies hit 183 homers in the thin  
air of Coors Field, ranking fourth in the league even though they 
lost Andres Galarraga and his 44 homers to the Braves. But did you 
know Colorado also paced the NL with a .291 team average and was 
the only team with fewer than 1,000 strikeouts? 
</P>
<P>
	``It drives a manager crazy when a guy leads off the inning with  
a triple and the guy is still standing there at the end of the 
inning,'' Baylor said. ``You've got to put the ball in play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike his laid-back predecessor, Clarence Jones, Baylor  
saunters around the spring training field barking out orders, 
constantly referring to a couple of slips of paper he keeps in his 
hands at all times. Hitters that barely seemed to notice Jones now 
stop and listen when the 49-year-old Baylor talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's intense,'' third baseman Chipper Jones said. ``I think we  
have some players that need a hands-on guy. C.J. was great at what 
he did. But it just seemed like players would stay in slumps for 
long periods of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor doesn't believe in taking a day off. From his viewpoint,  
improvement usually comes with hard work and repetition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some guys like to go when they feel like it. I'm not a  
feel-like-it instructor,'' Baylor said. ``I believe in going every 
day until I say we're calling it off. It's a long spring. It's a 
long season. But you've got to stay on top of the hitting game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of his major projects is first baseman Ryan Klesko, whose  
production has declined since a 34-homer, 93-RBI season in 1996. 
With Galarraga out for the season after being diagnosed with 
cancer, Klesko is being counted on to play every day and take up 
some of the offensive slack. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could be a big, breakout year for him,'' Baylor said. ``I  
think he can hit with good power to all fields. That's what he did 
when he hit 34 home runs. But last year, it looked like he was 
trying to pull every single pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe Baylor can do for Klesko what he did for Galarraga.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Baylor was a hitting coach on his way up with the St.  
Louis Cardinals, while the Big Cat was a hitter on his way down. 
One night, the big first baseman actually had tears in his eyes, 
thinking his career was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``They jammed him so much,'' Baylor recalled. ``Everybody jammed  
him. You didn't even need a good fastball to jam him. The next day, 
we went to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Baylor's instruction, Galarraga opened up his stance and made  
it more difficult for teams to pitch him on the inside half of the 
plate. Hitting .189 through mid-July, he improved to .301 over the 
final 45 games of the '92 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga followed Baylor to Colorado and, at age 32, suddenly  
became one of the game's most feared hitters. The Big Cat won the 
NL batting title in 1993 and averaged 44 homers and 137 RBIs over 
the past three season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don just decided to change his whole stance, change his whole  
approach,'' said Jordan, who was with the Cardinals in 1992 and got 
a firsthand look at the metamorphosis. ``It was like, boom, the Big 
Cat had a great career after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being fired by the Rockies, Baylor looked forward to being  
reunited with one of his favorite players in Atlanta. Then, just 
days before the start of spring training, cancer stepped in the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, who lost his own mother to cancer when she was 59,  
doesn't care if Galarraga returns to the batter's box next season. 
Survival would be the best comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	As for his own future, Baylor wants to manage again some day but  
it's not a high priority. He's disappointed that he didn't get a 
chance to build on the success he had in Colorado -- leading the 
Rockies to the playoffs in only their third season -- but his 
reputation seems intact. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they wanted to change the clubhouse chemistry, but  
then I read the other day where they said if things are going well, 
you really don't need clubhouse chemistry,'' Baylor said. ``So that 
was really just bull. They were just looking for something 
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surely, his name will be mentioned every time there's a manager  
on the hot seat. There are even whispers that Schuerholz hired 
Baylor as the successor-in-waiting to Cox, who will be 58 in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor scoffs at the idea.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I will learn a lot from Bobby,'' he said. ``These guys  
have won seven years in a row.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Explains Reasons for War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With maps to show Americans where the war is,  
President Clinton invoked the national interest and the cause of 
future peace to tell them why it is. 
</P>
<P>
	He seeks and he needs to enlist the nation in support of the  
U.S.-led air raids that were exploding against Serbian targets in 
defense of Kosovo, even as he spoke Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's nationally televised address, his first on the Balkan  
crisis, came six hours after the NATO raids began -- an air campaign 
with no end date. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration needs public backing to sustain it, and to  
keep at it, especially if American airmen are killed over what used 
to be Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems remote, and Clinton came late to the task of bringing  
it home as an operation serving U.S. interests. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 15-minute summation of what he's been saying piecemeal and  
to Congress, Clinton said ``our mission is clear,'' to demonstrate 
the NATO commitment to peace so that Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic will back down and accept a settlement with Kosovo 
Albanians, to deter Serb offensives in Kosovo and ``if necessary, 
to seriously damage'' the Serbian military. 
</P>
<P>
	That could take time, especially if the defiant Milosevic stays  
that way and NATO persists to the third aim, essentially, 
undermining his military forces, not only blocking them in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A geography lesson came with the policy address: Kosovo is 160  
miles from Italy, 70 miles from Greece, marked on the TV map with a 
big red arrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Another map, with red dots on the ethnic Albanian towns the  
Serbs have attacked, and arrows showing the movement of fleeing 
refugees. Clinton used that one to make the point that the conflict 
could spread to other nations, as wars have widened from the 
Balkans before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let a fire burn here in this area and the flames will  
spread,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd said Tuesday that his policy was ``the best of a lot of bad  
alternatives,'' a bit of candor he dropped in making his case on 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
	There's already skepticism enough. Certainly in the Senate,  
where a resolution authorizing air and missile strikes was approved 
after Clinton had said it was going to happen. Until then, 
Republicans were threatening to balk at the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Congress, they're always wary of anything that might seem  
to deny support to U.S. forces committed to conflict abroad. So the 
Senate voted 58-41 on Tuesday to OK air raids. 
</P>
<P>
	The House didn't deal with the policy, but voted to salute and  
support the U.S. forces carrying it out. The vote Wednesday night 
was 424-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Those resolutions, like others adopted before in times of  
conflict and crisis, are not binding. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, like all post-World War II presidents, maintains that  
he does not need congressional authorization to use U.S. forces 
abroad, but welcomed the support. Just as George Bush did after a 
52-47 vote for his Persian Gulf War policy in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the House guardedly approved Clinton's plan to  
send 4,000 American troops to join a planned NATO peacekeeping 
force in Kosovo. That is moot at this point because Milosevic 
blocked the settlement, Serbia pressed its Kosovo offensive, and 
that triggered the air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that if there is a peace accord, he'd send American  
forces to help enforce it. ``But I do not intend to put our troops 
in Kosovo to fight a war,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The path to this crisis began six months ago, with a cease-fire  
agreement that didn't hold. But Clinton had other problems at that 
point -- scandal, impeachment and Iraq -- and the administration 
didn't do much to explain the Balkan threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, on Dec. 17, two days before the House impeached him, the  
president ordered air strikes in another theater, against Iraq for 
Saddam Hussein's interference with U.N. inspections designed to 
deny him weapons of mass destruction. Those air strikes were 
limited, three days of raids by U.S. and British warplanes. There 
is still a low profile air war over Iraq; allied planes enforcing 
no-fly zones there have hit anti-aircraft and radar sites with more 
than 250 missiles and bombs, inflicting more damage than the 
initial round of raids. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no American casualties, no downed planes, no  
fliers lost or captured over Iraq. So there has been little notice 
of those operations at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Casualties change attitudes, and sometimes affect policy. Even  
with the warnings of risk from Clinton and the Pentagon, losses 
over Kosovo would make more difficult the president's effort to 
rally and sustain support for a faraway conflict. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> 99' Women's Final Four Suspenseful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The women's Final Four has a new -- and many would say welcome --  
twist this year. 
</P>
<P>
	There's actually some suspense over who'll win the national  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the case last year, when Tennessee stormed into the  
Final Four with a 37-0 record, then blew away Arkansas and 
Louisiana Tech to win its third straight NCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee didn't even make the Final Four this year, leaving it  
to Louisiana Tech, Purdue, Duke and Georgia to decide matters in 
San Jose, Calif., this weekend. In a Left Coast Final Four, the 
Lady Vols were left out, eliminated by Duke in the East Regional 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duke showed us that this game is getting spread out,''  
Louisiana Tech coach Leon Barmore said. ``It's so good for the 
game. Everybody has some hopes and dreams, and it's not going to be 
the same team all the time. And that is so good to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech (30-2) plays top-ranked Purdue (32-1) in the  
second semifinal Friday night, a showdown between the only No. 1 
seeds left in the tournament. Georgia (27-6) and Duke (28-6), both 
No. 3 seeds, meet in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wide open now,'' Louisiana Tech's Monica Maxwell said.  
``It's anybody's championship to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech, making its 10th Final Four trip, is the only  
school in the field that has won a national championship. The Lady 
Techsters won the first NCAA title in 1982 and also won in 1988. 
They lost to Tennessee 93-75 in last year's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia made it for the third time in five years and the fifth  
time overall, while Purdue is making its second Final Four trip. 
Duke is a Final Four rookie, but after knocking off Tennessee 69-63 
on Monday night, the Blue Devils won't be backing down from anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, there's school pride to uphold. Duke is the first program  
to have its men's and women's teams in the Final Four since Georgia 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that if the men's program could do it here, the women's  
program could do it here,'' said coach Gail Goestenkors, who has 
been at Duke since 1992. ``That's what we're on the verge of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's loss deprived the Final Four of the game's biggest  
star, Chamique Holdsclaw. But there's still plenty of star power in 
the field, starting with Purdue's outstanding senior duo of 
Stephanie White-McCarty and Ukari Figgs. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty, like Holdsclaw, was a unanimous All-American this  
year and has led her team to 30 straight victories. She and Figgs 
combined for 22 of Purdue's final 26 points Monday night as the 
Boilermakers came from behind to beat Rutgers 75-62 in the Midwest 
Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Barmore said he voted for White-McCarty as the nation's No. 1  
player over Holdsclaw because ``she took a less talented team than 
Tennessee, and look where they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech is the most athletic team in the field. Forward  
Amanda Wilson was a second-team All-American, guard Tamicha Jackson 
can break down just about any defense and Maxwell has played well 
in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia has its sophomore twins, Kelly and Coco Miller, while  
Duke is a well-balanced team built around 6-foot-6 Michele VanGorp, 
a third-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue's tournament run has extended the tenure of coach Carolyn  
Peck, who is leaving at the end of the season to become the coach 
and general manager of the WNBA's Orlando Miracle. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the Boilermakers' ride has been smooth, it hasn't  
always been that way for White-McCarty and Figgs, who have played 
under three coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Lin Dunn was dismissed after their freshman season, and most of  
the players transferred. Dunn's replacement, Nell Fortner, stayed 
only one year before being named coach of the U.S. national team. 
Peck was Fortner's assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't look at the past, we don't look what we've been  
through,'' Figgs said. ``We just play for now. We know that none of 
the things we've been through are going to hurt or help us now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interestingly, two of the players who left Purdue are now  
standouts at Duke -- VanGorp and Nicole Erickson. They could meet up 
with their old team in the championship game.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Probing Mexico Border Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Customs Service is investigating an  
incident in which a five-man Mexican military unit may have crossed 
into the United States near San Mogul, Ariz., while in pursuit of 
drug traffickers, the State Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman James P. Rubin said shots were fired in the direction  
of a U.S. Customs officer. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Mexican military commander told U.S. Customs  
officers at the border crossing that his unit had captured two 
traffickers and seized a pickup load of marijuana at the border. 
</P>
<P>
	The commander denied having crossed the border in pursuit of a  
second truck that escaped into the United States, Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> D-Backs' Johnson Might Miss Start </HEADLINE>

	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Randy Johnson might miss his next  
exhibition start because of a twinge in his left groin, Arizona 
Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Randy Johnson might miss his next  
exhibition start because of a twinge in his left groin, Arizona 
Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The big left-hander is scheduled to start Friday against the  
Chicago Cubs in Mesa. It would be Johnson's only Phoenix-area start 
of the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
	The discomfort surfaced when Johnson worked out on Tuesday at  
the Diamondbacks' training facility in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today he was throwing at 8:30 this morning and felt it a  
little bit so we shut it down,'' Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Johnson doesn't pitch against the Cubs, he may throw a few  
pitches in a minor league game in Tucson, Showalter said. A 
decision is expected by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter said the problem isn't serious but there was no sense  
in taking any chances with the start of the season less than two 
weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is scheduled to make his final exhibition start March 31  
against the Colorado Rockies at Tucson Electric Park, then go 
against Kevin Brown in the season opener at Dodger Stadium on April 
5. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has pitched 13 innings in four starts, going 1-0 with a  
3.46 ERA and 16 strikeouts.

<HEADLINE> Diagnostic Equipment Plant To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OBERLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Moving to consolidate some operations,  
Bayer Diagnostics plans to close its medical equipment research 
office and manufacturing plant in Oberlin within two years, 
affecting 375 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer's Chiron Diagnostics unit will offer 90 researchers  
transfers to Tarrytown, N.Y., by the end of the year, the company 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will offer transfers elsewhere to manufacturing  
employees and expects to transfer its production operations to 
Dublin, Ireland, by 2001. The Oberlin plant is located 35 miles 
southwest of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolf Classon, president of Bayer Diagnostics, said it was  
necessary to create a single production facility for large 
diagnostic medical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiron Diagnostics makes diagnostic equipment for the medical  
industry. Bayer Diagnostics is owned by Bayer Group, which is a $31 
billion chemical and pharmaceutical company based in Leverkusen, 
Germany.

<HEADLINE> New Efforts at Exposing New Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wherever she happens to be performing, rock 'n'  
roll singer Mary Cutrufello can never be certain that the local 
music store has her record in stock or that the clerks even know 
who she is. 
</P>
<P>
	So it was a real boost when the 311-store Best Buy music chain  
made her one of its featured artists in a campaign aimed at 
promoting young talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutrufello's debut album and the work of seven other artists are  
prominently displayed in each store, their discs are discounted and 
Cutrufello starred in a television commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a publicity stunt that's also a symptom of something gone  
awry. Best Buy's campaign, and a just-introduced Billboard 
publication on new musicians, speaks to a growing concern about the 
music industry's failure to support and develop new talent. 
</P>
<P>
	For every Jewel and Alanis Morissette who become big stars,  
dozens more talented musicians falter. Experts blame tightened 
radio playlists that offer fewer chances for new artists to be 
heard, and the tendency of record companies to concentrate on a few 
superstars that can make money in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want new faces to rally around,'' said Billboard  
editor-in-chief Timothy White. ``When you have so few people -- good 
or bad -- that people are paying attention to, it makes the music 
industry seem so claustrophobic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new quarterly publication, The Billboard WeatherBureau,  
features reviews, features and trend stories just on new artists. 
It's designed for an industry audience and people intensely 
interested in music. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a certain irony: so much music goes unnoticed partly  
because there's so much music out there. Some 28,000 CDs were 
released last year, said Gary Arnold, Best Buy's senior vice 
president of merchandising. That's triple the figure of a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few dedicated fans are familiar with more than a small  
fraction of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be a daunting task to go through all of it and see what  
you might like,'' Cutrufello said. ``It's hard to keep up. Not that 
you slavishly follow what other people say, but if there's someone 
you can trust telling you something's good, that really helps. It's 
like a good club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best Buy is trying to act as that filter. In addition to the  
displays, the chain will have listening posts so fans can sample 
featured artists, and also hopes to sponsor concert tours soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Cutrufello, a rock singer whose style is inspired by  
Bruce Springsteen, Best Buy has targeted dreamy rocker Rufus 
Wainwright, country singer Kelly Willis, New York swing band Blues 
Jumpers and other newcomers Thievery Corporation, David Garza, 
Patricia Barber and Remy Zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the artists, like Wainwright, have been critically  
acclaimed, and others are virtual unknowns who record for 
independent labels. Willis isn't exactly new -- she released three 
albums in the early 1990s -- but her latest Rykodisc album is her 
first in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so much unheard music out there that's really good,  
I'm grateful and applaud anybody who's going to try to help improve 
things,'' the Austin-based Willis said. ``It will definitely help 
to have your CD in a visible spot ... It's just that much more of a 
chance that they will give you a listen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a second chance for Cutrufello. Her debut last summer was  
accompanied by a certain amount of critical fuss, but she lost any 
chance for commercial momentum when her record company was 
swallowed up in the Universal Music Group consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
	Best Buy has two primary motivations. Someone who tries a new CD  
and enjoys it is likely to come back for more, of course. And it 
helps to cultivate a reputation where music fans can find something 
new, since most music fans see that as a weakness of big chains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for records that people are passionate about,''  
said Best Buy's Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
	Billboard saw the same industry void when it decided to launch  
its new publication. It has been a common complaint that companies 
don't have the patience to stick with artists and help them 
develop, dropping them if there's no quick success. 
</P>
<P>
	A mission statement in the magazine's first issue says  
WeatherBureau ``will report only on those emerging artists we seek 
to recommend, with all our coverage non-aligned and our reviews 
free of the crass grading symbols that demean artists and critics 
alike. We want to alter the way everyone looks at the new music 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
	White said he hoped it acted like some cold water to the face of  
the music business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to have much of a record industry if it's just  
down to 10 or 15 superstar acts and the rest just get swept away,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Search Still On for Snowmobilers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURNAGAIN PASS, Alaska (AP) -- Rescuers digging through a  
mile-wide wall of snow blamed for killing four people over the 
weekend were slowly losing hope of finding two snowmobilers still 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of four Alaska men have been recovered since the  
avalanche roared down a steep mountainside Sunday and filled a 
ravine to a depth of 30 feet in places. 
</P>
<P>
	Still missing today were Tech Sgt. Victor Jones of Elmendorf Air  
Force Base and Aaron Arthur, 29, of Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big accident -- it's a very long fracture,'' said  
Jill Fredston of the Alaska Mountain Safety Center. ``And the thing 
that makes (the search) very hard is that we had multiple 
parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As wet, clumpy snow fell Tuesday at the site 55 miles south of  
Anchorage, nine teams of searchers plunged 10-foot poles into the 
snowy debris, trying to locate the men. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are relying on a jumpy videotape of the avalanche to  
provide clues about where to look. 
</P>
<P>
	Many snowmobilers on Sunday were powering up the mountainsides  
to see who could leave the highest track -- a game called 
``highmarking.'' The practice may have triggered the slide, said 
Greg Wilkinson of the Alaska State Troopers. 
</P>
<P>
	If the death toll rises to six, the avalanche will be the  
nation's deadliest since March 1982, when seven people were killed 
at Alpine Meadows ski resort in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadliest avalanche in U.S. history was in 1910 at Stevens  
Pass, Wash., when a slide struck a train and killed 96, according 
the American Association of Avalanche Professionals in Bozeman, 
Mont.

<HEADLINE> Flight Attendants Settlement Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A state appeals court has upheld a $349 million  
class action settlement to nonsmoking flight attendants who sued 
cigarette makers claiming that working on smoky airplanes made them 
sick. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was first proposed in October 1997 as defense  
lawyers for the tobacco companies were presenting their case. 
Circuit Judge Robert Kaye approved it in February 1998, but some 
flight attendants objected. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the class representatives approved, and strongly  
endorsed, the settlement,'' Judge Robert Shevin wrote in the ruling 
filed Wednesday at the 3rd District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal judges said the settlement was ``fair, adequate, and  
reasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The objectors' complaint that they must now bring individual  
lawsuits does not render the settlement inadequate,'' Shevin wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal calls for $300 million to fund a foundation to sponsor  
research on diseases suffered by the attendants. The rest of the 
money goes for attorney fees and costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement provides no money for individual flight  
attendants, but allows them to use evidence from the trial in their 
individual cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also relieves them of the burden of proving  
cigarette smoking caused their illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight attendants sued the nation's four largest cigarette  
makers -- Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson and 
Lorillard -- saying secondhand smoke on flights gave them lung 
cancer and other diseases. Smoking on domestic flights was banned 
in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Energy Futures Retreat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil and petroleum products retreated for a second day  
Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange as market 
participants began a waiting game to determine whether oil 
producers are serious about cutting supply. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, grain and soybean futures retreated, as did  
copper. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices slipped after investors turned more skeptical about  
promised cuts by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries and other world producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers have pledged to slash some 2.1 million barrels daily  
from world output, which analysts say will sharply boost prices if 
it occurs. But oil producers are notorious for not meeting 
commitments, a factor that recently helped lead to some of the 
lowest prices in nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also gave back early gains tied to industry figures that  
implied gasoline demand last week rose to a record-high 9 million 
barrels a day. Market participants said the figures from the 
American Petroleum Institute likely would be revised since it would 
be unusual to set a record before the peak driving seasion even 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses were narrowed late in the session, however, on news that  
Mexico had defaulted on contracts for delivery of crude to American 
buyers, declaring a force majeure as a sign that the non-OPEC is 
moving to cut its output totals in line with the recent agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for May delivery fell 17 cents to $15.34 a  
barrel; April heating oil fell 1.17 cents to 40.49 cents a gallon; 
April unleaded gasoline fell .89 cent to 48.02 cents a gallon; 
April natural gas fell .5 cent to $1.759 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures retreated on the Chicago Board of  
Trade on fears that NATO attacks on targets in Yugoslavia would 
sour relations between the United States and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia officials sharply denounced the U.S.-led attacks on  
Wednesday despite President Clinton's efforts to placate them and 
explain that the attacks might help end bloodshed in the Kosovo 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	The war of words between Russia and the United States is likely  
to put on hold new talks aimed at American food donations to the 
cash-starved country, market participants feared. 
</P>
<P>
	American farmers have been counting on the Clinton  
administration to take large surpluses on their hands in the form 
of donations to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the attacks erased wheat futures' early gains that came  
after the U.S. Agriculture Department began taking bids to buy 
1.022 million metric tons of hard red winter wheat for donation to 
needy countries. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat fell 2 3/4 cents to $2.80 a bushel; May corn fell 1/2 cent  
to $2.28 a bushel; May oats rose 1 cent to $1.16 3/4 a bushel; May 
soybeans fell 5 1/2 cents to $4.87 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bones Revives Career From Bullpen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Ricky Bones was the ace of the  
Milwaukee Brewers staff three springs ago. He already had won 44 
games in the major leagues, earned a berth in the All-Star game and 
was preparing for this second straight opening day start. 
</P>
<P>
	His career then took a dramatic detour. After bouncing from  
Milwaukee to New York to Cincinnati to Tucson to Kansas City over a 
two-year period, the right-hander found himself in Salt Lake City 
last spring, taking lengthy bus rides with the Minnesota Twins' 
Triple-A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was difficult, but who said life is easy? I looked at it in  
a positive way. It made me a better and stronger person,'' Bones 
said. ``I gained some positive thoughts through that -- it helped me 
grow as a person and as a pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His faith was rewarded when the Kansas City Royals called him up  
from Triple-A Omaha last June after signing him to a minor league 
contract. Bones made 32 relief appearances with the Royals, 
performing impressively enough to entice the Baltimore Orioles to 
sign him as a free agent in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``His versatility is very valuable,'' said Orioles pitching  
coach Bruce Kison, who also left the Royals for Baltimore during 
the offseason. ``He has the ability to be a spot starter, long 
reliever or middle reliever. He can save a pitching staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bones' status as the No. 1 starter on the Brewers' staff ended  
during the 1996 season, when he went 7-14 and lost his spot in the 
starting rotation. It was the start of a downward slide that didn't 
end until last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pitchers go through good and bad years. I went through a tough  
stretch there,'' he said. ``When that happened, people lost 
confidence in my pitching. I wasn't a hot pitcher anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bones, 29, resuscitated his career by accepting the role of a  
relief pitcher. It was not an easy adjustment -- his inability to 
make the transition cost him a job in Cincinnati in 1997, when he 
went 0-1 with a 10.19 ERA to earn his first trip to the minors 
since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put me in the bullpen and I wasn't ready mentally to make  
that change,'' he said. ``Last year in Kansas City, though, I 
prepared myself to do both jobs and it all worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bones went 2-2 with a 3.04 ERA, picked up his first career save  
and allowed only nine of 28 inherited runners to score. The Royals 
wanted him back and the Seattle Mariners expressed interest, but 
Bones opted to sign a one-year contract with the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in my career I wanted to be with a team that has  
a chance to reach the playoffs,'' Bones said. ``I've put everything 
else behind me. Right now I'm just looking forward to good 
things.''

<HEADLINE> Victory Gallop Learns Dubai Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Victory Gallop is learning  
his way around the Nad Al Sheba dirt track. Jerry Bailey already 
knows it. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the Belmont Stakes and runner-up in the Kentucky  
Derby and Preakness in 1998 will race for the first time outside 
the United States on Sunday in the $5 million Dubai World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old colt will be ridden by Bailey, who won the  
inaugural World Cup on Cigar in 1996 and also won the race in 1997 
on Singspiel. 
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop jogged Wednesday, the only one of three U.S.  
horses in the race to work out. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Silver Charm, the 1997 Kentucky Derby and  
Preakness winner, walked the shedrow Wednesday at the quarantine 
center. Under the lights Tuesday, the 5-year-old horse worked 
five-eighths of a mile in 57.69 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Malek, the other U.S. contender and fourth-place finisher in the  
race last year, took a brisk gallop Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Adiyat, a magazine published by the Emirates horse racing  
authority, reported that an unknown bettor had placed $50,000 on 
Malek at odds of 5-1. The bet was made outside the Emirates, where 
no wagering on racing is not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen horses, 10 of them entries from the world-famous  
Godolphin Racing stable of Dubai's ruling Al-Maktoum family, will 
compete in the 1 1/4-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the three U.S. challengers, the only other overseas  
contender is Britain's Running Stag. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-weighted horse at 130 pounds is Intikhab, owned by the  
Al Matoums. Silver Charm will carry 128 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Preacher Guilty in Church Torching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A former preacher distraught when his  
married lover broke off their eight-year affair could be sentenced 
to 15 years in prison for torching the Mormon church where she was 
the organist. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Gene Grassie, 49, was convicted Tuesday of setting a fire  
that caused $2.5 million in damage to the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints in Roswell. Sentencing was set for June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a man who's successful, at the top of his whole life --  
and then he just loses it,'' said prosecutor Bob Gorence. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution said Grassie, a former Church of Christ  
minister, was embittered against Mormon doctrine because he 
believed Sharlene Jensen's faith prevented her from leaving her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jensen testified Grassie seemed to suffer a breakdown after  
she told him she was breaking off the relationship. Once, she said, 
``he called me and said he was sitting in his pickup on the edge of 
a cliff crying hysterically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense said prosecutors had presented evidence of Grassie's  
emotional response to the breakup, but no real evidence that he 
committed the arson. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government wishes for you to assume Gene Grassie guilty.  
... It's like `Help us, here -- fill in the gaps for us,''' defense 
attorney Michael Stout said in closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somewhere along the line you have to show evidence of the  
crime itself,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides burning the Roswell church, Grassie was convicted of  
vandalism at Mormon churches in Alto, Alamogordo and Artesia and of 
burning a car belonging to Mrs. Jensen's son. Prosecutors said 
Grassie harassed the Jensens, painting graffiti insulting Mrs. 
Jensen and writing a letter to her husband, in hopes of breaking up 
the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a situation of a campaign of violence. This was a  
very singular campaign directed at very singular targets -- the 
Jensen family, the Mormons and their faith,'' Gorence said in 
closing arguments.

</P>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- George C.S. Benson, founding president  
of Claremont McKenna College, author of books on American 
government and politics, and a Pentagon official in the Nixon 
administration, died Monday. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson became the first president of what was then Claremont  
Men's in 1946. Its name was changed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson also played a leading role in founding Harvey Mudd and  
Pitzer College, as well as in bringing the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic 
Garden to Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired from the college presidency in 1969 to become deputy  
assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs in the Nixon 
administration. Benson worked to persuade universities to retain 
Reserve Officer Training Corps programs at a time when they were 
under attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson was the author of eight books on American government and  
politics, including ``The New Centralization,'' published in 1941.

 *Sir Michael Caine    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Michael Caine, chairman of the food and  
agri-business company Booker PLC and the driving force behind 
Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for fiction, died Saturday. He 
was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Caine died of cancer in London, the company said.  
</P>
<P>
	Possessed of a strong social conscience and a keen mind, Caine  
believed companies should be active beyond business and saw the 
$32,000 Booker Prize as an encouragement to new writing in Britain 
and its former colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered Britain's highest literary honor, it has recognized  
novelists such as Salman Rushdie, Iris Murdoch, Ian McEwan and 
Peter Carey. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize, modeled on France's Prix Goncourt, was established in  
1968 when Caine was an executive and board member of Booker PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Caine was born in Hong Kong, the son of Sir Sydney Caine, who  
was director of the London School of Economics and a colonial civil 
servant. He was educated at Oxford University and George Washington 
University in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	After working for the British Embassy in Washington, he joined  
Booker in 1952 and worked for the company in Guyana, Trinidad and 
southern Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	After joining the board in 1964, he helped the company -- whose  
core business was Caribbean sugar -- diversify in the face of the 
loss of its colonial fiefdoms. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as chief executive from 1975-79 and then as chairman  
until his retirement in 1993. He was knighted in 1988.

	GOLD CANYON, Ariz. (AP) -- Former Rep. Patricia Goodrich, who  
served for a decade in the Wisconsin Legislature and later headed a 
state agency, died here Sunday. She was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich had been suffering from a neurological disease that  
causes degeneration of the part of the brain responsible for muscle 
coordination. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich, a Republican, represented the 72nd Assembly District  
in Wisconsin, now the 41st, for five terms from 1974-84. 
</P>
<P>
	She later was appointed by Gov. Tommy Thompson to be secretary  
of the state Department of Health and Social Services and served in 
that post from 1988-91.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Milton S. Gould, who co-founded one of New York  
City's most politically connected and ethnically balanced law firms 
during his storied 65-year legal career, died Sunday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Gould won millions of dollars for stockholders of the Fifth  
Avenue Coach lines following its takeover by the city and helped 
restore the reputation of former Israeli Defense Minister Ariel 
Sharon in libel actions against Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Gould began practicing law at the old-line firm White &AMP; Case in  
the 1930s, a time when largely Protestant establishment firms were 
notorious for shunning Jewish lawyers. When he learned that he was 
to be forbidden contact with clients and would only be given 
research duties, he quit and joined the Jewish firm Kaufman, 
Weiztner &AMP; Celler. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1964, Gould's firm, then known as Gallop, Climenko &AMP; Gould,  
merged with a Catholic firm run by William Shea. Shea, Gallop, 
Climenko &AMP; Gould combined Shea's reputation as a back-room dealer 
with Gould's prominence as an effective litigator. Shea emerged as 
the firm's media star, especially after his efforts to replace the 
outgoing Brooklyn Dodgers led the city to name the Mets' Stadium 
after him. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men ran the firm together for twenty years, purposefully  
maintaining a close balance of Christian and Jewish lawyers. Ten 
years after they ceded power to younger partners, the firm was 
dissolved in 1994.

	Hall, who spent a half-century in journalism, came from a family  
with a newspaper tradition. He spent his boyhood working in the 
back shop of The Alexander City Outlook, where his father, E. Cody 
Hall Sr., was editor. An uncle, Grover C. Hall, won a Pulitzer 
Prize in 1928 for anti-Ku Klux Klan editorials while editor of The 
Montgomery Advertiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall worked briefly for The Associated Press in Memphis, Tenn.,  
before joining the Star as a police reporter. Later, as city 
editor, he directed the Star's coverage of the burning of a bus 
carrying freedom riders through Anniston in 1961.

</P>
<P>
	Johnson ordered the attacks after the torpedo boats fired on two  
U.S. destroyers on Aug. 4, 1964. Three days later, Congress passed

the authority to escalate U.S. involvement in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>

Fleet. At the height of the Vietnam War, he was commander in chief

<HEADLINE> Meola To Miss Half Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City Wizards goalkeeper Tony  
Meola will have arthroscopic surgery on his left knee next week and 
probably will miss half the MLS season. 
</P>
<P>
	Meola, 30, was hurt during practice on March 17, crumpling to  
the ground as he tried to plant his foot and turn to kick a ball. 
Three days earlier, he chipped a tooth and needed 51 stitches to 
repair cuts sustained during a collision in a game between the 
United States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Meola, the U.S. starter at the 1990 and '94 World Cup, returned  
to the national team in January after a 4 1/2-year absence and played 
in games against Bolivia, Germany and Mexico. He has 29 shutouts in 
90 international appearances, but is behind Leicester City's Kasey 
Keller and Liverpool's Brad Friedel on the U.S. depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) might be torn worse than  
thought,'' Meola said Tuesday. ``We won't know until they look at 
it. Everybody's preparing for the worst, which is three, four 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meola was acquired by the Wizards along with defender Alexi  
Lalas from the New York-New Jersey MetroStars on Jan. 20 for 
midfielder Mark Chung and goalkeeper Mike Ammann.

<HEADLINE> Pam Tillis in `Smokey Joe's Cafe' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- How many people get the chance to savor the  
``ice cream on the pie of life''? 
</P>
<P>
	That's how country singer-songwriter Pam Tillis describes being  
the first guest star in ``Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' a Broadway revue of 
Leiber and Stoller songs. The show, featuring classic songs written 
by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, recently celebrated its fourth 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Tillis had her first country hit ``Don't Tell Me What to Do'' in  
1991. She has been touring steadily ever since. The Country Music 
Association named her female vocalist of the year in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	So how does performing on Broadway fit into her country music  
career? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not to the exclusion of my regular career,'' she says.  
``It's in addition to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tillis hastens to explain that she's not tired of country music;  
she just wanted to branch out. When she heard the show was looking 
for guest stars, she told her agent to get on the phone -- and 
quickly! 
</P>
<P>
	She will appear in ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' until April 4. Lou  
Rawls, Gladys Knight and Tony Orlando will follow. 
</P>
<P>
	Tillis is in the Broadway show for a brief time because she has  
other commitments. But she isn't closing the door to a return 
engagement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Originally, they were going to stop the show and introduce me.  
I said, `What I really want to do is be part of the cast.' I'm 
featured in four songs and I have a big number in the second half. 
And I sing with the cast. ... Which I love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her hit records include ``Maybe It Was Memphis,'' ``Walk in the  
Room,'' ``Mi Vida Loca'' (My Crazy Life), ``All the Good Ones Are 
Gone,'' ``Land of the Living,'' ``Spilled Perfume'' and ``I Said a 
Prayer for You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' Tillis is ``letting it twang every now  
and then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She adds: ``I'm just me. I'm not the twangiest country singer  
out there. You're going to hear rhythm 'n' blues and rock 
influences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tillis is the oldest of six children, all involved in music. Her  
father is country singer-songwriter Mel Tillis. She will perform 
with him at his theater in Branson, Mo., for a 10-week period 
starting in late spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year at her father's theater, Tillis performed two shows a  
week -- both on the same day -- and also did tour dates. Going back 
and forth from Branson was an experience she describes as ``a tough 
commute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never wanted to ride on any coattails,'' she says,  
explaining that last year was the first time she had performed with 
her father. ``I wanted to wait to be established on my own. It went 
really well. We sold out a lot of shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Tillis finishes touring in July, ``I'm looking forward to  
writing and being in the studio for the back half of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She hopes to find time to make a tribute CD to her father,  
singing his songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like Leiber and Stoller songs. It depends on how you play  
them. I know it can be very hip.''

<HEADLINE> Carson in Hospital After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Johnny Carson is expected to be  
hospitalized for a few days after successful quadruple heart bypass 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The 73-year-old entertainer was taken from his Malibu home to  
Saint John's Health Center early Friday, and doctors performed the 
surgery a few hours later, hospital spokeswoman Lindi Funston said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Carson had the surgery to treat coronary artery  
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``The operation went very well and his heart is functioning  
normally,'' Ms. Funston said.

	NATO Launches Airstrikes on Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Making good on months of threats,  
NATO launched airstrikes on Kosovo tonight to punish Yugoslavia and 
its hard-line leader for refusing to make peace in the southern 
Serbian province. Detonations went off in Pristina, lighting the 
hills over the darkened Kosovo capital. In Belgrade, witnesses 
reported eight explosions, some near a military airport and at 
least one near a power plant. In neighboring Montenegro, which with 
Serbia forms Yugoslavia, an army military barracks in Danilovgrad 
was in flames after being hit.

	U.S. Uses B-2 Stealth Bomber in Attack  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American-led NATO assault on Yugoslavia  
today marked the first use of the B-2 stealth bomber in combat. The 
first wave of airstrikes involved dozens of cruise missiles and 
one-ton bombs.

	Clinton Defends Assault on Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton called today's NATO assault  
on Yugoslavia a ``stand against ethnic violence and atrocity.'' 
``Kosovo's crisis is full-blown,'' the president said in brief 
remarks at the White House. ``And if we do not act now, clearly it 
will get worse. Only firmness now can prevent greater catastrophe 
later.'' He promised a more complete explanation in an 8 p.m. EST 
Oval Office address to the American public.

	Yugoslavian Neighbors Go On Alert  
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Military forces in the nations surrounding  
Yugoslavia are on alert, preparing for fallout from NATO 
airstrikes. The most immediate worry appeared to be the possibility 
of refugees fleeing Serbia and the war-torn province of Kosovo, 
where ethnic Albanians have fought Serb-led Yugoslav forces for 
more than a year. But some leaders said a battle in Yugoslavia 
``could engulf the whole Balkans.'' Shelters and camps were set up 
in northern Albania to handle more refugees and hospitals were 
stocked with extra supplies.

	Yugoslavia Curbs Kosovo Coverage  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yugoslav authorities are cracking down on  
Western television broadcasts as an allied attack began. A TV 
transmission facility at a Belgrade hotel was shut down by 
government officials who removed equipment while ordering personnel 
to stand against a wall, a CNN official said. CNN's Brent Sadler 
reported being threatened by officials when he and some colleagues 
transmitted a report today from the Kosovo capital of Pristina. 
Another CNN reporter, Christopher Burns, left Yugoslavia, after 
being told his life may be in danger.

	Ocalan To Be Tried on Island  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A Turkish court ruled today that Kurdish  
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan must stand trial on a heavily guarded 
prison island because of safety concerns. Ocalan has been the sole 
inmate on the island since his capture on Feb. 15 by Turkish 
commandos in Kenya. The army has been at war for 15 years in 
southeastern Turkey with autonomy-seeking rebels of Ocalan's 
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. Close to 37,000 people have died 
in the conflict.

	Kiwi Air Lines Grounded by FAA  
</P>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration grounded  
Kiwi International Air Lines today, saying the tiny discount 
carrier was no longer able to fly safely. The Newark-based carrier 
filed yesterday for Bankruptcy Court protection from its creditors. 
The FAA ordered it to immediately surrender its operating 
certificate. Its six-city schedule was suspended immediately. The 
FAA said Kiwi's planes were in ``unairworthy condition,'' that it 
failed to adequately maintain aircraft and follow up on maintenance 
discrepancies in FAA audits.

	Wisconsin Gets Two Years Probation  
</P>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin's athletic program was placed on  
two years' probation today for what the NCAA described as 
widespread, unauthorized spending of booster club money. The 
school's teams were spared penalties concerning postseason 
tournaments, television appearances and scholarship allotments. The 
NCAA said the university must conduct an internal audit, focusing 
on fund raising, and develop a program on compliance of NCAA rules.

<HEADLINE> Race Tracks OK Online Betting Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Wanna bet on horses? Maryland bettors may be  
able to do so on their home computers beginning May 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Pimlico Race Course and Laurel Park have reached an agreement  
with Youbet.com, a Los Angeles-based company, to provide online 
betting as well as handicapping information and audio and video 
from races. Both tracks are owned by the Maryland Jockey Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Subscribers would have to pay a monthly fee to get race  
information through secured software. 
</P>
<P>
	Youbet.com officials said they plan to take bets on the  
Preakness on May 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland officials say profit isn't their motive, but more to  
see if and how this new kind of betting will affect the state's 
race tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really aren't looking at the venture right now as making  
money or not making money. We're going to analyze what kind of 
effect it is going to have on Maryland,'' said James Mango, chief 
administrative officer for the tracks. ``We're trying to 
self-defend ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But track officials hope having this kind of betting in place  
locally will keep other states from grabbing racing revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Youbet.com deal expires at the end of the year,  
Maryland Jockey Club officials will have a chance to see if it 
really has an impact on Maryland before making a long-term 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Youbet.com already webcasts races from about 20 tracks. Although  
Youbet.com posted losses of $11.2 million on revenues of $98,000 
for the nine-month period that ended last September, industry 
experts expect online gambling to be big business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other jurisdictions have said, `Let's make a deal,' and roll  
with it. Our approach is to see how it works before we strike a 
long-term deal,'' Mango said. 
</P>
<P>
	The local tracks would get a percentage of the total wagers,  
much like the split of revenues from a simulcast. It's unclear, 
however, what percentage Maryland tracks would get. 
</P>
<P>
	With simulcast races, usually 3 percent of wagers is split  
evenly between the tracks and their purse account, which 
distributes it to horse owners, trainers and jockeys that finish 
fourth or better in a race. 
</P>
<P>
	Although laws passed in 1984 permit betting over the phone,  
including online betting, there are no regulations governing these 
kind of enterprises because there has been little interest so far. 
The writing of regulations has also been delayed while Gov. Parris 
Glendening reviews gambling issues. 
</P>
<P>
	But Youbet.com can bypass the lack of regulations because it's  
routed through a Pittsburgh-area harness race track, The Meadows, 
said Bruce Spizler, an assistant Maryland attorney general and 
counsel to the Maryland Racing Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	A study commission on horse racing recommended Friday that  
regulations be written soon to permit Internet and telephone 
wagering. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor has not yet had an opportunity to look at those  
recommendations, said Karen Napolitano, a spokeswoman for the 
Department of Licensing, Labor and Regulation, which oversees the 
racing industry.

<HEADLINE> Forgotten Artist Is Now 'Priceless' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the final 22 years of his life, artist  
William Henry Johnson lay forgotten in a Long Island mental 
hospital while hundreds of his paintings rotted in a storage shed. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson died in 1970, alone, bedridden and ravaged by syphilis.  
He fared no better in death: He was buried in a plot marked by a 
number, not a name, in a field of thigh-high weeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, nearly 30 years after his death, reproductions of his  
brightly colored paintings of American life have resurfaced on 
calendars and postcards. And Johnson's art is the center of a 
bitter dispute between his family and the Smithsonian Institution, 
which claims ownership of some 1,100 of his pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum calls the collection ``priceless'' and Johnson is now  
acclaimed as one of the century's most important American artists. 
</P>
<P>
	The painter's relatives filed a $100 million federal lawsuit  
against the Smithsonian and a Manhattan art gallery last year. The 
suit was dismissed but an appeal is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	And so Johnson, whose art was nearly destroyed as junk in the  
1950s, suddenly enjoys a host of benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the many ironies here is that nobody thought his work  
was worth anything when he died,'' said Manhattan art attorney 
Peter Stern, who is representing gallery owner Michael Rosenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Melvin Gibbs, a Florence, S.C. lawyer who is working pro bono  
for the Johnson family, says he smells a conspiracy. He says the 
gallery and the Smithsonian got the art from a nonprofit foundation 
that had illegally obtained it while Johnson was institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Smithsonian is in possession of stolen property,'' Gibbs  
said. ``No one had the right to take away William Johnson's 
possessions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense maintains the Johnson family's claim comes too late  
to have any legal merit. ``This is 50 years later,'' Stern said. 
``The family had sufficient opportunity to get the work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But family members say key details -- even Johnson's 1970 death --  
were concealed from them by state and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know he died until four months after. We thought his  
paintings had been lost,'' said Johnson's niece, Betty Vance. 
</P>
<P>
	The artist's mother did not visit while he was alive, according  
to Vance and Gibbs, because she did not know where her son was 
being kept. When relatives first learned about the paintings, they 
could not afford to retain a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, a federal court judge dismissed the family's lawsuit,  
ruling it untimely and saying it should have been filed in state 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	While few expect the appeals court to reverse the decision, the  
case -- which contains the elements of a classical tragedy -- has 
aroused the interest of the art world and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	``The story is as fascinating and as provocative as his art is  
wonderful,'' said Richard Powell, a Duke University art historian 
who wrote a book about Johnson. ``If there's a lesson in all of 
this, it's that people have no idea what's going to be of value 10, 
20, 30 years from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While William Johnson -- Willie to family and friends -- wasted  
away in the Central Islip Psychiatric Center from 1948 to 1970, he 
didn't paint and rarely spoke. According to a Johnson friend, Helen 
Harrington, who is now dead, the artist believed he could 
communicate with others telepathically. The diagnosis was paresis, 
a disease of the brain caused by syphilis, which rendered him 
mentally incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
	Art historians say his commercial failure was unsurprising given  
the times. 
</P>
<P>
	``He suffered the same prejudices in the art world that  
African-Americans did in society,'' said Elizabeth Broun, director 
of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American Art. ``Galleries 
and museums were just not interested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His most critically acclaimed work came after he moved to Harlem  
from Europe on the eve of World War II. He adopted a simplified, 
folk-inspired style distinguished by brilliant color schemes and 
somewhat distorted forms. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of our first very important African-American  
modernists,'' said Powell. ``He takes the lessons of expressionism 
... and comes up with an artistic response that is really quite 
extraordinary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson moved from expressionist nature landscapes while he  
lived in Scandinavia to impressionistic paintings reminiscent of 
van Gogh before settling on the two-dimensional, non-illusionistic 
approach to painting for which he is best known. 
</P>
<P>
	His subjects ran the gamut: urban couples jitterbugging in  
brightly colored suits and platform shoes; rural farmers in the 
South leading tired mules through plowed fields; black soldiers 
training for -- and dying in -- World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the faces of his subjects are expressionless, dull even,  
as if impervious to either joy or sadness. The hands and feet of 
his farmers are huge, as if swollen by years of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
	While some critics dismissed his flat, two-dimensional figures  
as the work of a primitive, the formally trained artist did taste 
success. His painting, ``Chain Gang,'' was shown at the New York 
World's Fair in 1939 and about the same time, he had several solo 
gallery shows. 
</P>
<P>
	To supplement his income, Johnson worked as a teacher for the  
WPA in Harlem, and later, as a laborer at the Naval shipyards in 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very quiet, very introspective,'' said painter and  
friend Jacob Lawrence, the celebrated artist whose ``Migration'' 
series chronicled the journey of black Americans from the South to 
northern cities to escape segregation and to seek greater 
opportunities. Lawrence was a Harlem child learning how to paint 
when he met Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in his career, when he had little money to buy proper  
canvases, Johnson painted on burlap potato sacks and discarded 
plywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was no stranger to privation. While growing up in  
Florence, his father shoveled coal for the railroads until he 
became ill. Johnson's mother, a maid, became the family's primary 
money-earner. An outspoken young man who refused to quietly 
tolerate the stings of the town's bigotry, Johnson left home at 17 
to enroll in the prestigious National Academy of Design in New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating, he traveled to France in 1926 where he met his  
wife, Danish weaver Holcha Krake. He returned to the United States 
until 1938, fearing the approaching war. 
</P>
<P>
	When Krake died of breast cancer in 1944, Johnson began to  
decline. In 1946, he packed his belongings, demanded the return of 
the art he'd given as gifts and set out for Denmark, apparently 
hoping to marry Krake's sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was welcomed, his marriage proposals were not. Soon,  
with $6,000 in his pocket, he was wandering the streets with his 
art and other belongings. He made his way to Oslo, Norway, where 
police picked him up as he wandered aimlessly around the streets. 
He was shipped back to the United States and institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's family claims the artist's illiterate mother, Alice  
Smoot Johnson, was not given the chance to claim her son's art and 
that the U.S. government purposely concealed information from the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a 1948 letter from the U.S. State Department to the  
Social Security Administration, the government hid the fact that 
Johnson had cash and could easily have afforded to ship his 
paintings to his mother's home in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``In communicating with (Johnson's mother) the department has  
purposely avoided mentioning the fact that when (Johnson) was 
apprehended by the Oslo police ... he had on his person a 
considerable sum of money, reported as amounting to $6,400 in U.S. 
currency,'' wrote state department official E.J. Madill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why,'' asked Gibbs, ``would they keep that a secret? Because  
they didn't want the family to get the art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian and the U.S. attorney's office, which is  
representing the Smithsonian, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	With Johnson in the mental hospital, his art was in legal limbo  
and sat in a waterfront shed for nine years where many pieces were 
ruined by water damage and vermin. 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson's court-appointed caretaker sought to destroy the  
art after failing to find a buyer, he informed a judge that 
Johnson's work was ``of such inferior quality, that no purchaser 
therefore could be or would be found. In brief, these paintings, 
watercolors and prints (are) infantile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1956, the judge agreed to ``abandon (the art) as  
worthless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contents of the storage bin were given to the Harmon  
Foundation -- a nonprofit philanthropic group that had worked with 
black artists, including Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gibbs said Johnson's caretaker allegedly had secretly worked  
out a deal with the foundation to give the pieces away prior to the 
court order -- which he maintains was illegal. The lawyer also 
points out the caretaker did not tell the judge that Johnson's art 
had won prizes and that his wife's family had asked for paintings 
they never received. 
</P>
<P>
	When the foundation ceased most of its operations in 1967, it  
donated the bulk of its Johnsons to the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian's Broun points out that Johnson's work would  
likely still be virtually worthless had the Smithsonian not held 
three major exhibitions and spent $1.8 million restoring hundreds 
of his paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we took the work, it was obscure and had little or no  
value,'' she said. ``We take some pride in ownership for getting 
his work publicized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, she added, the Smithsonian does not wish to set a  
precedent. ``As a public museum, we are not able to take work out 
of the public trust without some court action,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Johnson's body continues to lie in grave No. 5405 --  
in an abandoned cemetery behind the shuttered mental hospital -- a 
number etched into a piece of stone among a sea of similarly marked 
nameless plots of others who died paupers there. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's not yet a household name,'' said Broun, ``we feel he's  
well on his way. Hopefully, it will be for the right reasons.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Lorazepam Blocks Seizures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	An anti-anxiety drug called lorazepam can prevent repeat  
seizures in alcoholics, according to a study in today's New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't get this, you're more than 10 times more likely  
to have another seizure,'' said Dr. Gail D'Onofrio, a professor of 
emergency medicine at Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
	Seizures cause tremors and loss of consciousness and can lead to  
death or serious injury. They occur -- usually during alcohol 
withdrawal -- in about 1 million of the 10 million adult American 
alcoholics, sending about 400,000 to emergency rooms each year, 
according to D'Onofrio. About 60 percent of those have multiple 
seizures, usually within six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Onofrio ran the study during the mid-1990s, while she was an  
emergency room doctor at Boston Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	She found that only three of the 100 alcoholics who were given  
lorazepam after being brought to the ER following a seizure had 
another one within six hours, compared with 21 of the 86 patients 
given dummy pills. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven other members of the comparison group and one of those  
given lorazepam were back in the ER with a second seizure within 48 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Seizures can prove fatal if a victim falls and hits his head or  
is stricken while driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Other drugs tested have failed to block recurrences, so  
emergency room doctors either admit such patients to the hospital 
for observation, inflating the cost of care, or release them and 
cross their fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a significant improvement,'' and many ER doctors will  
adopt it, said Dr. Richard Fuller, director of clinical and 
prevention research at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism.

<HEADLINE> AOL Cuts 20 Pct. of Netscape Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. announced today it will cut  
up to 20 percent of Netscape's staff, or up to 500 workers, as it 
absorbs the pioneering software maker in a $10 billion acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL also plans to cut 350 to 500 workers from its own  
10,000-person staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts in Netscape's 2,500-person work force, mainly in its  
Mountain View, Calif., headquarters, should hit such back-office 
operations as accounting but largely leave alone Netscape's coveted 
group of 550 software developers and managers, financial analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts underscore the risks in one of the software industry's  
biggest marriages, which was completed last week to create a new 
Internet behemoth with two of the leading Web destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, based in Dulles, Va., is the largest online service and  
Internet access provider. Netscape's founders created the first 
widely used software for finding and retrieving information off the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's challenge is to cut jobs without hurting morale and  
spurring defections of the Netscape software designers it hopes to 
enlist to enhance its Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood at Netscape was uncertain but hardly dismal late  
Tuesday. Several workers, contacted by telephone, expressed 
optimism they could easily get other jobs in Silicon Valley, a 
booming engine of U.S. economic growth. Many will be able to 
exercise options to buy stock that could yield handsome profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said they might find jobs in one of the acquiring  
companies. In addition to AOL, Sun Microsystems Inc., a maker of 
business computers and software, is a partner in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are three different companies involved here, and there  
is quite a good chance that one layoff at Netscape could mean a new 
job at AOL or Sun. In that case, it's not exactly a layoff,'' said 
Pierre Theveny, Netscape's information system manager in Paris. 
Theveny said he had not heard yet whether he would be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry some people have lost their jobs but I suspect these  
people will be well taken care of -- they also have stocks,'' said 
one employee who works in Netscape's electronic-commerce unit, who 
like other workers, requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is we don't need two CFOs or two general counsels or  
two heads of (human resources),'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Ullas Naik, an analyst with First Albany Corp., said he expected  
the companies to spare departments such as marketing because they 
target such different customers. 
</P>
<P>
	While Netscape created the tool for people to surf the Net and  
makes software for corporate computer networks, AOL supplies neatly 
organized channels of information for Internet beginners who 
otherwise might be groping their way through. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AOL fell $5.68 3/4, or 5 percent, to $115.31 1/4 today on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

to go global by merging with SBC Communications, is buying 20 
percent of Bell Canada for $3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Wednesday with Bell Canada parent BCE Inc.  
fills a key gap in the North American operations of SBC and 
Ameritech. It also follows AT&AMP;T's purchase of a stake in a rival 
Canadian phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC, the leading provider of local phone service in the southern  
and western United States, already owns 10 percent of Mexico's 
largest phone company. Ameritech, meanwhile, is the biggest foreign 
investor in European phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	By joining with Bell Canada, the combined SBC-Ameritech network  
could provide nearly seamless service across North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The SBC-Ameritech merger, which still must be cleared by the  
Federal Communications Commission, passed a big hurdle Tuesday when 
the Justice Department said it would not object if the companies 
sold off overlapping cellular operations in 17 markets. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of Wednesday's deal, Bell Canada will acquire from BCE a  
65 percent interest in BCE Mobile Communications, 21.5 percent of 
Teleglobe Inc., and a stake in six regional Canadian 
telecommunications companies, three of which are merging into a 
company called AtlanticCo. 
</P>
<P>
	BCE will use the proceeds from the transaction to invest  
primarily in high-growth sectors such as electronic commerce, 
satellite services and systems integration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This partnership assures Bell Canada's place at the forefront  
of the global communications industry, while keeping Bell Canada 
firmly under Canadian control,'' said Jean C. Monty, BCE president 
and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Valued at $57 billion when it was announced in May, the merger  
of San Antonio-based SBC and Chicago-based Ameritech would unite 
two companies that control 57 million phone lines spread through 13 
states.

<HEADLINE> D-Backs Give Korean Righty $2.4M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- South Korean pitcher Byung-Hyun Kim is  
guaranteed $2.4 million under the four-year contract the 
20-year-old right-hander agreed to with the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, who struck out 15 in 6 1-3 innings playing for South Korea  
against a U.S. national team last year in Tucson, gets a $2.25 
million signing bonus and is guaranteed yearly salaries of at least 
$38,100, the minor league minimum for players who have been on 
40-man rosters for more than one season. The total guarantee in the 
deal, which was agreed to last month, comes to $2,402,400. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim helped South Korea to the finals of last year's World  
Championships in Italy, giving up one earned run in five innings 
against Cuba, and he struck out 12 in six perfect innings against 
China in the semifinals of last year's Asian Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim is expected to be in Tucson by Friday or Saturday,  
Diamondbacks general manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has his visa. He's saying his goodbyes and getting his  
plane ticket,'' Garagiola said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim could start the season at Class A High Desert or Double-A El  
Paso.

<HEADLINE> ABC Wins Ratings Week With Oscar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The success of NBC's ``Providence'' gave TV  
networks hope that viewers were receptive to midseason replacement 
series. Last week's results prove there are no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC won the ratings race on the strength of the Oscars, but it  
ditched the mystery series ``Strange World'' after it finished a 
disastrous 91st place in last week's Nielsen Media Research 
rankings. It will be replaced by ``NYPD Blue'' reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS pulled ``The Magnificent Seven'' last week following a poor  
run. And NBC yanked ``Lateline'' after it finished tied for 82nd 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Two positive signs from last week: CBS's ``Payne'' finished a  
strong 12th during its premiere last week, and ``Rescue 77'' proved 
to be the WB's third most popular show for the week in its debut. 
</P>
<P>
	More high-profile premieres are on the way. Two new ABC  
comedies, ``The Norm Show'' and ``It's Like, You Know,'' take to 
the air tonight. Fox debuts ``Futurama,'' an animated series by the 
creator of ``The Simpsons,'' on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC won last week's Nielsen competition with a 10.0 rating and  
17 share. NBC was second with an 8.4 rating and 14 share, CBS had 
an 8.0 and 13 and Fox was at 5.6 and 9, Nielsen said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academy Awards had a 28.6 rating and 46 share on Sunday  
night. While this represented an 18 percent drop from 1998, when 
``Titanic'' won best picture, it was on par with other Academy 
Awards telecasts from the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB led the three developing networks last week with a 3.2  
rating and 5 share. UPN had a 1.9 rating and 3 share. Pax TV 
benefited from reruns on rival networks to finish with an unusually 
strong 0.9 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news race with an 8.0  
rating and a 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second with 
an 7.6 and 16, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 6.9 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of March 15-21, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were ``Academy Awards,'' ABC, 28.6; ``Oscar Preview 
Show,'' ABC, 18.1; ``Friends,'' NBC, 16.6; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 14.4; 
``Frasier'' special, 14.0; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 13.9; ``Barbara Walters 
Special,'' ABC, 12.7; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 12.4; 
``ER,'' NBC, 12.1; ``NCAA Basketball Post-Game Show,'' CBS, 11.6.

<HEADLINE> Colin McRae Wins Portuguese Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARROSAS, Portugal (AP) -- Britain's Colin McRae won his second  
consecutive title since becoming a Ford driver when he captured the 
Portuguese Rally on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Scot, who led the event from start to finish,  
was chased to the finish line by Carlos Sainz of Spain who chipped 
21 seconds off McRae's overnight lead and finished second in a 
Toyota, 12 seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
	Frenchman Didier Auriol, also in a Toyota, was third, 16 seconds  
off the winning time. Richard Burns of Britain took fourth place in 
his Subaru Impreza, 55 seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
	World champion Tommi Makinen, who dropped to over two minutes  
off the pace in the first leg because of a broken transmission on 
his Mitsubishi Lancer, drove at a blistering pace and won three of 
the final leg's four stages to finish fifth, 1:04 behind McRae. 
</P>
<P>
	Makinen still leads the championship standings with 22 points,  
two ahead of McRae, who moved into second place with the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In the manufacturers championship, Toyota extended its lead to  
33 points while Ford moved into second place with 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
	McRae, the 1995 world champion, also won last month's Safari  
Rally. He withdrew from the Swedish Rally with engine problems and 
finished third in Monte Carlo, but Ford cars were disqualified over 
the size and positioning of their water pump.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Says Airstrikes Won't Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's prime minister, who returned home early  
today after calling off a trip to the United States, said NATO 
airstrikes against Yugoslavia would only raise international 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not think that the strikes will help stabilize the  
situation in Kosovo,'' Yevgeny Primakov said today upon his 
arrival. ``On the contrary, it will be destabilizing, and damage 
will be inflicted both on our relations with the United States and 
with stability in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO strikes appeared imminent after Yugoslavia rejected the  
terms of a peace settlement in Kosovo, the province where Yugoslav 
forces are battling ethnic Albanian guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said today the raids could  
begin within a ``few hours,'' although he did not give the basis 
for making such a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov also said that if Yugoslavia is attacked, Russia might  
push for the lifting of the international arms embargo against the 
country. Russia could even consider withdrawing from the embargo 
unilaterally, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Military action against Yugoslavia has no justification,  
legal, political or moral,'' Ivanov said. 
</P>
<P>
	On, Tuesday evening, Primakov's plane was over the Atlantic  
Ocean and headed to Washington when the prime minister spoke with 
Vice President Al Gore, who said airstrikes were likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Gore, `Think it over once more. You have not calculated  
all the consequences,''' Primakov said, according to the ITAR-Tass 
news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov did not want to be in Washington once it seemed clear  
his visit would coincide with NATO raids on Yugoslavia, a longtime 
Russian ally. His plane turned around and headed back to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov spoke with Russian President Boris Yeltsin by phone  
early today and the two planned to meet later to formulate the 
Russian response. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin sent a message to President Clinton on Tuesday saying  
Russia ``has been and will be categorically opposed to NATO use of 
force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's ambassador to Russia, Borislav  
Milosevic, claimed his country was ready to resume peace talks with 
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia wants to ``peacefully solve the problems and continue  
talks on the political agreement,'' said Milosevic, the brother of 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Holbrooke said Tuesday that the Yugoslav president was  
not interested in discussing the main points of the proposed peace 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	When the United States and Britain bombed Iraq in December,  
Russia recalled its ambassadors to those countries, but they 
returned to their posts about a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Russia would step up  
its combat readiness, and ``will respond adequately'' if NATO 
attacks, but Moscow has no effective means to prevent the raids. 
</P>
<P>
	When planning the Washington trip, Primakov had hoped to focus  
on winning new loans from the International Monetary Fund to help 
revive Russia's ailing economy. Primakov had planned to meet IMF 
chief Michel Camdessus during his time in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov said he still expected to meet with Camdessus in the  
next few days, most likely in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Booker Prize Chair Caine Dies at 71 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Michael Caine, chairman of the food and  
agri-business company Booker PLC and the driving force behind 
Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for fiction, has died. He was 
71. 
</P>
<P>
	Caine died of cancer Saturday in London, the company said.  
</P>
<P>
	Possessed of a strong social conscience and a keen mind, Caine  
believed companies should be active beyond business and saw the 
$32,000 Booker Prize as an encouragement to new writing in Britain 
and its former colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered Britain's highest literary honor, it has recognized  
novelists such as Salman Rushdie, Iris Murdoch, Ian McEwan and 
Peter Carey. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize, modeled on France's Prix Goncourt, was established in  
1968 when Caine was an executive and board member of Booker PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	He chaired the Booker Prize Management Committee for 23 years,  
hosting the annual award dinner that is now televised live. 
</P>
<P>
	Caine had no interest in creating best sellers and was  
unconcerned that some winners were obscure. 
</P>
<P>
	He once wrote that when the Booker Prize was launched, British  
``literature looked a bit peaky and down. The Booker has cheered it 
up, made it a bit more vibrant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poet Philip Larkin, a judge in 1977, threatened to throw  
himself out of a window if a book that he favored was not 
short-listed. John Berger, the 1972 winner, used his acceptance 
speech to denounce Booker's colonialist past as an owner of West 
Indian sugar plantations. 
</P>
<P>
	Caine was born in Hong Kong, the son of Sir Sydney Caine, who  
was director of the London School of Economics and a colonial civil 
servant. He was educated at Oxford University and George Washington 
University in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	After working for the British Embassy in Washington, he joined  
Booker in 1952 and worked for the company in Guyana, Trinidad and 
southern Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	After joining the board in 1964, he helped the company -- whose  
core business was Caribbean sugar -- diversify in the face of the 
loss of its colonial fiefdoms. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as chief executive from 1975-79 and then as chairman  
until his retirement in 1993. He was knighted in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Caine is survived by a son and a daughter from his first  
marriage to Janice Mercer, and by his second wife, Baroness 
Nicolson, a former lawmaker. Funeral details were not immediately 
available.
