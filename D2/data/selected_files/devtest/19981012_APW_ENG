	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO gearing up for airstrikes,
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslavia's president met Sunday
for 11 hours of ``intense'' and ``at times very heated'' talks in a
final push to solve the Kosovo crisis through diplomacy.
	   Following the marathon session with President Slobodan
Milosevic, Holbrooke returned to his hotel at 5:30 a.m. (0330 gmt)
Monday after three hours on the telephone with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger.
	   Holbrooke said he would meet Milosevic again at 10 a.m. (0800
gmt) to continue the search for a peaceful settlement.
	   Although he refused to discuss the substance of his talks,
Holbrooke described the meeting Sunday as ``intense indeed and at
times very heated.'' He noted that the effort was underway while
``in another part of Europe, NATO continues to move toward a
totally different outcome,'' meaning military strikes if
negotiations fail.
	   Holbrooke's talks were continuing hours before a planned NATO
meeting in Brussels, Belgium, during which the alliance is expected
to issue an ``activation order'' for air action unless diplomacy
produces a breakthrough.
	   In Washington, Berger told CNN that Milosevic ``is not in
compliance as of this point.''
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's demand that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   Those demands include an immediate cease-fire, a withdrawal of
special troops in the province, allowing refugees to return home
and beginning talks with ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
About 90 percent of its 2 million people are ethnic Albanian, and
most of them want independence or substantial self-rule.
	   Meanwhile, journalists heard sporadic gunfire Sunday and saw
white and gray smoke rising from about six houses in the ethnic
Albanian village of Makrmalj, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) west
of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels say the activity was part of a Serb
police operation. Police prevented the journalists from getting
closer than about a half-mile from the village.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 anti-tank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   In Bucharest, the Romanian government agreed to allow NATO to
use its airspace in ``emergency and unpredictable situations'' if
the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, warned
neighboring countries Sunday that a NATO attack could plunge the
entire region into conflict.
	   ``Bombs cannot bring peace, bombs can only bring conflicts, war
and instability, not only in Kosovo but in a wider Balkan region,''
Bulatovic told recruits at an army barracks in northern Yugoslavia.
``It would be in nobody's interest to make the Balkans a powder keg
again.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range and preparing
them for attacks were clearly designed to convince Milosevic of
Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands.
	   After a late-night session with Milosevic, an exhausted-looking
Holbrooke insisted early Sunday ``nothing has changed'' in the
Yugoslav leader's stand. Holbrooke called the situation ``very
serious.''
	   A statement from Milosevic's office, issued after the talks and
distributed by the government's Tanjug news agency, said all U.N.
conditions have been met for a political settlement.
	   But Milosevic seemed to be separating U.N. demands from the U.S.
insistence on verification.
	   Serb sources said on condition of anonymity that Milosevic had
refused to budge on a monitoring force. Washington is pressing for
the force because they say Milosevic has broken promises in the
past.
	   A source close to Milosevic indicated that he was ready to
comply with other conditions.
	   International efforts to end the seven-month crisis have
accelerated following allegations that Serb police massacred scores
of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will
bring a humanitarian disaster if thousands remain homeless by the
first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. The Clinton
administration, however, believes it does not need a new U.N.
resolution for the attacks.
	   Russia, which fiercely opposes NATO airstrikes, called its NATO
representative and ambassador to Belgium back to Moscow on Sunday
for emergency consultations on the potential attacks.
	   ``Everything should be done to prevent bombing,'' Dmitry
Yakushkin, President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, told reporters in
Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where the Russian leader was visiting.
	   But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who is accompanying
Yeltsin, said a Russian military response to NATO strikes is ``out
of the question,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

Japanese upper house approves bank failure measures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's upper house of Parliament on Monday voted
into law a plan to use at least 10 trillion yen (dlrs 86 billion)
in taxpayer money to clean up the nation's massive bad debt problem
and deal with failed banks.
	   The package, which was passed by the more powerful lower house
on Oct. 2, marks a major step in Japan's battle against its deepest
recession since the end of World War II.
	   With Japan under pressure to turn around its economy and help
Asian neighbors, the bills also are a major victory for Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi and end a fierce dispute between his ruling
party and the opposition.
	   The so-called financial stabilization plan creates a special
committee to oversee the clean up of the nearly dlrs 1 trillion in
bad debts weighing on the nation's financial system.
	   With new loans hard to get, business has been suffering,
especially small and medium-size companies. Unemployment is at a
record high, bankruptcies are soaring and consumer spending is
falling.
	   Under the new law, the government would set up an organization
similar to the U.S. Resolution Trust Corp. in the 1980s U.S.
savings and loan crisis to buy bad debt from banks.
	   The committee created by the new package has the authority to
pursue three courses of action when dealing with a failed bank: to
nationalize the bank temporarily through the government's purchase
of its shares; to order the liquidation of the institution; or to
transfer the bank's operations to a public bridge bank.
	   It was unclear, however, what standards would be used to decide
which banks would fall under each method. But the pool of public
money to help will total more than 10 trillion yen (dlrs 86
billion).
	   The bills also abolish a 13 trillion yen (dlrs 113 billion) fund
that previously was used to pump public money into the banking
system to recapitalize banks.

Patriots rout Chiefs; Eagles win Bad Bowl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late games &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FOXBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ Robert Edwards became the first
player since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger with touchdowns in his first
five pro games, and Drew Bledsoe threw three TD passes in New
England's 40-10 victory over Kansas City on Sunday.
	   The Patriots (4-1) scored on seven consecutive possessions after
punting on their first one. The Chiefs (4-2) helped them score with
a fumble, a roughing-the-passer penalty and two fourth-down
failures.
	   Kansas City began the game with the NFL's second-best pass
defense, allowing 129.6 yards per game, and second best overall
defense, giving up an average of 240. By halftime, Bledsoe had
thrown for 174 yards and the offense had 246, and the Patriots
extended the lead to 37-0 in the third quarter.
 &UR; Eagles 17, Redskins 12 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Philadelphia won the first matchup of 0-5 teams
in NFC East history as Rodney Peete ran for a touchdown and threw
for another in a victory that gave Washington its worst start in 37
years.
	   Washington benched Trent Green, brought back Gus Frerotte and
got a sack from Dana Stubblefield. None of it was enough to beat
the Eagles, who breathed some life into what had been a hopeless
season and just might have saved coach Ray Rhodes' job.
	   Green had a miserable day, falling down for a ``sack'' at
midfield on a drive that eventually led to the Eagles' first
touchdown. Frerotte, benched in the season opening loss to the
Giants, didn't fare much better, although he did direct a late
touchdown drive that made it a 5-point game with 2:46 remaining.
 &UR; Bengals 25, Steelers 20 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Neil O'Donnell rescued Cincinnati's final 93-yard
drive with a long fourth-down completion, then surprised a relaxed
Pittsburgh defense with a 25-yard touchdown pass to Carl Pickens in
the closing seconds.
	   The Steelers (3-2) seemed to have the victory in hand when Norm
Johnson kicked a 40-yard field goal for a 20-18 lead with 1:56
left. A holding penalty on the kickoff left the Bengals (2-3) at
their 7-yard line with no timeouts left.
	   Six plays later, O'Donnell threw a desperation pass on fourth
down that Pickens caught for a 50-yard gain.
	   After Corey Dillon's run got the clock moving, the Bengals lined
up and motioned for a clock-stopping spike. But O'Donnell instead
lobbed the decisive pass to Pickens, who once again beat Dewayne
Washington with 14 seconds to go.
 &UR; Cowboys 27, Panthers 20 &QC; 
	   In Irving, Texas, Jason Garrett threw two touchdown passes and
Deion Sanders made a critical interception with two minutes left,
but Dallas' win wasn't secure until Steve Beuerlein's last pass
sailed out of the end zone as time ran out.
	   Beuerlein, making his first appearance of the season because
Kerry Collins decided he didn't want to play, completed 22 of 31
passes for 286 yards and three touchdowns against the dazzled
Dallas defense.
	   Sanders intercepted Beuerlein's pass with 1:55 to play, but
Carolina got the ball back with 51 seconds left for a last-ditch
drive to the Dallas 37, where Beuerlein let fly on a desperate
heave that overshot his three receivers with the clock showing
0:00.
	   The Cowboys (4-2) never previously beat the Panthers, whose
winless streak this season stands at five.
 &UR; 49ers 31, Saints 0 &QC; 
	   In New Orleans, Steve Young had his fifth straight 300-yard
passing game and became the 20th player in NFL history to throw for
30,000 yards in San Francisco's rout of New Orleans.
	   Chris Doleman's four sacks moved him into fifth place on the
career list, and the 49ers (4-1) won by their second largest margin
against the Saints (3-2).
	   Young, who left after one series in the fourth quarter,
completed 21 of 40 passes for 309 yards and three touchdowns. He is
now tied with Joe Montana for most consecutive 300-yard passing
games.
	   The Saints (3-2) showed no signs of the scrappy play that helped
them open with three straight victories and take the New England
Patriots to the wire last week.
 &UR; Oilers 12, Ravens 8 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Eddie George ran for 121 yards and quarterback
Steve McNair had a 40-yard touchdown run as Tennessee overcame 141
yards in penalties to outlast Baltimore.
	   The Oilers (2-3) were penalized 13 times, but they managed to
win as the Ravens (2-3) went 1-for-15 on third down and mustered a
mere 36 yards on the ground.
	   Ravens running back Priest Holmes, who ran for 173 yards in his
debut against Cincinnati two weeks earlier, finished with 29 yards
on 14 carries.
 &UR; Bills 31, Colts 24 &QC; 
	   In Indianapolis, Doug Flutie passed for two touchdowns and set
up two short scoring runs by Antowain Smith for Buffalo.
	   The 35-year-old Flutie, back in the NFL after eight years in the
Canadian Football League, entered the game in the first quarter
after Rob Johnson was sacked and left with sore ribs.
	   Flutie, who had passed for only 158 yards as a backup this
season, his first in the NFL since 1989, was 23-for-28 for 213
yards with no sacks or interceptions. Peyton Manning, the top pick
in this year's draft, was 20-for-41 for 235 yards, but was
intercepted twice. He has thrown an NFL-high 14 interceptions for
the Colts (1-5) this season.
	   The Bills (2-3) erased a 9-0 Indianapolis lead.
 &UR; Broncos 21, Seahawks 16 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, John Elway returned to Denver's lineup and threw two
touchdown passes against Seattle.
	   Elway got a lot of help from Terrell Davis, who became the
Broncos' career leader in rushing touchdowns with 44 to give Denver
a 21-10 lead on the third play of the fourth quarter with a 2-yard
run.
	   Davis, the NFL's leading rusher, had his third career 200-yard
rushing game. He carried 30 times for 208 yards, while Elway was
13-for-27 for 185 yards and two TDs, with two interceptions, one of
which was returned for a touchdown by Darrin Smith.
	   The defending Super Bowl champion Broncos (6-0) beat the
Seahawks (3-3) for the fifth straight time and for the 10th time in
12 meetings. Seattle lost its third consecutive game.
	   In St. Louis, St. Louis forced five turnovers by the New York
Jets to snap an eight-game losing streak at home.
	   Amp Lee, playing a prominent role at running back due to
injuries, ran for two touchdowns, and St. Louis played error-free
ball.
	   Jets quarterback Glenn Foley, who missed the previous two games
with a rib-cage injury, had a miserable day. Foley was 5-for-15 for
76 yards and two interceptions, each of which led to a St. Louis
touchdown, before coach Bill Parcells yanked him in favor of Vinny
Testaverde with 3:13 to go in the third quarter and the Jets (2-3)
trailing 23-3.
 &UR; Raiders 7, Chargers 6 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, after 58{ minutes of offensive
ineptitude by both teams, third-string quarterback Wade Wilson gave
Oakland an unlikely victory over San Diego.
	   After the Raiders went the entire second half without making a
first down, Wilson threw a 68-yard scoring pass to a wide-open
James Jett with 1:28 left.
	   Wilson, who replaced Donald Hollas early in the fourth period,
was 0-for-6 until completing his bomb to Jett.
	   The game included 27 punts and five interceptions. Oakland's Leo
Araguz had 16 punts, one short of the NFL record.
 &UR; Cardinals 20, Bears 7 &QC; 
	   In Tempe, Arizona, linebacker Ronald McKinnon had three
interceptions and returned a blocked punt 31 yards, and little-used
Mario Bates scored two touchdowns for St. Louis.
	   McKinnon, who also caused a fumble, had one interception in the
first quarter, another at the end of the second and the last in the
third.
	   Then he topped himself in the fourth quarter when Chicago's
Ricky Bell blocked a punt by Scott Player. McKinnon grabbed it out
of the air, shook off a tackler at the sideline, and cut back to
midfield to gain a Cardinals first down.
	   He got his first carry as a Cardinal in the first quarter and
scored on a pair of 2-yard runs in the second quarter.
 &UR; Falcons 34, Giants 20 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Chris Chandler threw for two
touchdowns and ran for another, and Antonio Edwards scored on a
2-yard fumble return as the Falcons gave coach Dan Reeves a victory
in his first game against the Giants since they fired him in 1996.
	   The Falcons (4-1) are off to their best start since 1995, when
they last made the playoffs, and are tied for first place with San
Francisco in the NFC West.
	   The loss was the second straight for the defending NFC East
champion Giants (2-4).

Former Australian captain dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian cricket captain
Ian Johnson has died aged 80, Australian Cricket Board chairman
Denis Rogers said Monday.
	   Rogers said Johnson died in hospital on Friday after a long
period of poor health.
	   Johnson, a member of the Invincibles side that was unbeaten on
the 1948 tour of England, played 45 tests between 1945 and 1957,
scoring 1,000 runs at 18.52 and taking 109 wickets at 29.19.
	   He captained Australia from 1954-57, leading the team in the
1954-55 Ashes series against England in Australia and on tours to
the West Indies (1954-55), England (1956) and Pakistan and India
(1956-57).
	   ``Ian was the off-spinner for the great Australian teams
immediately after the Second World War and a wonderful ambassador
for our country as captain,'' Rogers said. ``The sides he led to
the West Indies and Pakistan and India were the first official
tours to each of those regions and he built the foundations for the
relationships that exist today between Australia and our fellow
test nations.''
	   Johnson was a fighter pilot for the Royal Australian Air Force
during World War II and became a cricket administrator after
retiring from play. He was secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club
for 25 years.
	   In 17 Tests under Johnson's captaincy, Australia won seven
matches, lost five and drew five.
	   At the time of his retirement, he was only the fifth Australian
to complete the ``double'' of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in Test
cricket.

period. He scored the Flyers' final goal with a slap shot from the
right circle 50 seconds into the third.
	   John LeClair, seeking his fourth straight 50-goal season, scored
his first with 6{ minutes left in the first period as the first
line of Lindros, LeClair and rookie Mike Maneluk accounted for
seven of the Flyers' 11 points.
	   New Flyers goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck had a solid home debut,
giving up only Paul Kariya's goal in the first period en route to a
21-save performance.
 &UR; Senators 4, Coyotes 1 &QC; 
	   In Phoenix, Bruce Gardiner had a goal and an assist as Ottawa
beat Phoenix to open the season with consecutive wins for the first
time in franchise history.

Stocks surge on passage of banking reform bills, dollar falls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with early afternoon Nikkei moving higher on
upper house passage of bank bills, latest dollar and bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks surged in Monday afternoon trading,
lifted by the passage in Parliament of bills designed to address
the nation's ailing banks. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average rose 612.82 points, or 4.76
percent, moving to 13,492.79 by early afternoon. On Friday, the
index had tumbled 146.09 points, or 1.12 percent, closing at
12,879.97 _ its lowest finish since December 1985.
	   Also in early afternoon trading, the dollar bought 115.90 yen,
down 1.30 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late
Friday level in New York of 116.95 yen.
	   Share prices continued to rally after Japan's upper house of
Parliament voted into law a plan to use public funds to clean up
the country's massive bad debt problem and deal with failed banks,
traders said.
	   The package, which was passed by the more powerful lower house
on Oct. 2, marks a major step in Japan's determination to bail the
nation out of its deepest recession since the end of World War II.
	   The market started higher on expectations that the government
would soon expand a pool of public funds to assist ailing Japanese
banks, traders said.
	   Also supporting the market was Friday's rally in blue chips on
Wall Street.
	   ``The impact from the rise in New York stocks is more than
expected,'' said Setsuo Nagao, a manager at the equity division of
Tokyo Securities.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 167.61, or 2.17 percent,
to 7,899.52 points, a gain of 114.83 for the week and just shy of
7,908.25 where it began the year.
	   Japanese media reported over the weekend that the ruling and
opposition parties have agreed to expand to 67 trillion yen (dlrs
577 billion) the pool of public funds to boost the capitalization
of weak banks
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 38.05 points, or 3.87 percent, to 1,020.55. On
Friday, the TOPIX fell 19.00 points, or 1.93 percent.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar moved lower on
selling from Japanese institutional investors and possibly by hedge
funds in a thin local market, traders said.
	   Last week, the dollar dropped nearly 14 percent, falling as low
as 111.45 on Thursday before recovering somewhat.
	   The selling was fueled largely by hedge funds moving to dump
dollars in uncertain markets amid hopes for greater efforts by
Japan to mend its weak economy and the gloomier outlook for the
U.S. economy.
	   Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the Japanese Finance Ministry's
international bureau, said Monday that volatility like that which
took place last week was undesirable.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.860 percent from Friday's finish of 0.790
percent, driving its price down to 108.39 yen from 109.08.

Jones denies bribery allegations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details; quotes including comment from Allan Border &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian batsman Dean Jones
has denied allegations made by former Pakistan player Sarfraz Nawaz
that he was forced to retire from cricket because he was involved
in illegal betting.
	   Jones was responding to claims made by Sarfraz in sworn
testimony to the Pakistan High Court's inquiry into match fixing in
Lahore.
	   When asked what other countries had done to players involved in
betting, Sarfraz told the inquiry, ``In other cricket playing
countries, if the players are found to be involved in match-fixing
and betting, they are made to retire or face the consequences.
Dennis Lillee and Rodney Marsh were banned for six months and Dean
Jones was made to retire.''
	   Jones told Monday's Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, ``That's
absolute nonsense. And any inquiry to the Australian Cricket Board
will also give you the same answer.''
	   Lillee and Marsh placed a winning bet at 500-1 on England to win
the Headingley Test against Australia in 1981. But neither player
was banned, nor received any disciplinary action.
	   Jones said apart from rejecting an offer of U.S. dlrs 50,000 in
Colombo, Sri Lanka in 1992, his involvement with illegal bookmakers
was ``absolute zilch.''
	   He was considering whether he could take legal action against
Sarfraz.
	   Graham Halbish, the Australian Cricket Board chief executive at
the time of the 1994 match-fixing allegations, said there was never
any suggestion Jones was involved in betting other than the offer
he rejected in Sri Lanka.
	   ``There was never any discussion at the board about Dean other
than the instance he made public himself,'' Halbish told the
newspaper.
	   Allan Border, who was Jones' captain throughout his test career,
said the Safraz claims were ``absolute rubbish.''
	   ``I would trust Deano with my life _ he gave 100 percent for
Australia to try and win,'' Border said Monday. ``Sarfraz is
renowned for making ridiculous statements and this is another one.
Even in Pakistan, he is a bit of a standing joke.''
	   ACB chief executive Mal Speed also rejected the allegations.
	   ``It didn't happen, Dean wasn't forced to retire because of
match-fixing allegations,'' Speed told a Melbourne radio station.
``It was the selectors' decision at the time, there's never been
any charge or suggestion that Dean's been in any way involved.''
	   Jones played 52 test matches, scoring 3,631 runs at 46.55. Jones
traveled to South Africa in 1994 with the touring Australians and
played most of the limited overs games but suddenly retired from
international cricket while on tour when dropped before the tests.
	   His forthright opinions then virtually ensured he would never
return to any Australian team when he criticized teammates,
officials and the Australian Cricket Board. Jones retired from all
cricket earlier this year.
	   ``Obviously I'm livid, I can only say it's absolute nonsense
what he (Sarfraz) said,'' Jones said Monday. ``Anyone who has
played with or against me knows what I'm like when I played my
cricket. It's a bit of an insult towards me but I've just got to
leave it in the hands of the legal people.''

Japanese upper house approves bank failure measures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES amount of money to be used not specified in
legislation; ADDS reference to LTCB, details, quote, background,
byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's upper house of Parliament on Monday voted
into law a plan to use taxpayer money to clean up the nation's
massive bad debt problem and deal with failed banks.
	   The package, which was passed by the more powerful lower house
on Oct. 2, marks a major step in Japan's battle against its deepest
recession since the end of World War II.
	   With Japan under pressure to turn around its economy and help
Asian neighbors, the bills also are a major victory for Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi and end a fierce dispute between his ruling
party and the opposition.
	   The so-called financial stabilization plan creates a special
committee to oversee the clean up of the nearly dlrs 1 trillion in
bad debts weighing on the nation's financial system.
	   Also set up would be an organization similar to the U.S.
Resolution Trust Corp., created during the 1980s U.S. savings and
loan crisis to buy bad debt from banks.
	   With new loans hard to get, business has been suffering,
especially small and medium-size companies. Unemployment is at a
record high, bankruptcies are soaring and consumer spending is
falling.
	   Growth shows no sign of coming back soon. The Economic Planning
Agency announced last week that the economy would shrink by 1.8
percent this year, and the head of the agency said on Sunday that
it could shrink next year as well.
	   The legislation passed Monday does not specify the amount of
money to be used. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party originally
proposed using 10 trillion yen (dlrs 86 billion), but reportedly
agreed with opposition parties over the weekend to increase that to
50 trillion yen (dlrs 435 billion).
	   The new committee has the authority to pursue three courses of
action when dealing with a failed bank: to nationalize the bank
temporarily through the government's purchase of its shares; to
order the liquidation of the institution; or to transfer the bank's
operations to a public bridge bank.
	   It was unclear, however, what standards would be used to decide
which banks would fall under each method.
	   Despite the clearing of the latest hurdle, the complicated
implementation of the plan was expected to be the center of another
protracted struggle between the LDP and the opposition.
	   ``It is one thing to pass a package of measures ... and it is
quite another to make sure they are workable,'' LDP lower house
member Nobuteru Ishihara was quoted as saying in the Asahi
newspaper Monday.
	   The first test case of the new legislation will be the troubled
Long-Term Credit Bank, which has been rumored to be on the verge of
collapse since summer. LTCB, one of Japan's biggest lenders, is
struggling under the weight of failed real estate loans.
	   In June, LTCB announced it was in talks to merge with Sumitomo
Trust _ a move that was widely regarded as a government-directed
bailout. But under the new legislation, the bank will be
nationalized temporarily and its bad loans will be sold, Kyodo News
agency reported.
	   The bills also abolish a 13 trillion yen (dlrs 113 billion) fund
that previously provided public money to be pumped into the banking
system to recapitalize banks.
	   Attention will now focus on the parliamentary debate regarding a
bill that would allow the government to pump capital into the
banking system as a means of easing the nation's credit crunch.
	   The ruling and opposition political camps have moved closer
toward an agreement on this issue in recent days.

Bear kills woman picking berries in Siberia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A brown bear attacked two women picking berries in
Siberia, killing one of them and injuring the other, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said Monday.
	   The two women from the Ovgort settlement went to the tundra to
pick blueberries and cranberries when they were attacked near some
homes, the news agency said. One died instantly; the other was
rushed to a hospital by neighbors who came to her aid.
	   Local hunters say the bear may have been roused from an early
hibernation.

Hong Kong poll shows half of business leaders expect economy to
</HEADLINE>
weaken

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's economic decline is expected to
continue in the next six months, half of 150 leading firms in the
territory said in a poll released Monday.
	   Jointly conducted by brokerage Nomura International and the
South China Morning Post, the polls is the first in a series to be
carried out quarterly to gauge business and economic sentiment.
	   ``The results are negative. More than 50 percent of firms say
the economic outlook will deteriorate in the next six months,''
Nomura's Greater China economist Kevin Chan said.
	   Hong Kong fell into a recession in the second quarter, with the
economy shrinking by 5 percent. It is expected to contract by at
least 4 percent this year, while unemployment is at a 15-year high
of 5 percent.
	   But most respondents expected the growth in unemployment to
ease. More than two-thirds said they would not lay off workers in
the next six months, and only 19 percent expected more layoffs in
their companies.
	   About 33 percent said they did not expect economic conditions to
change in the period, while 11.9 percent said the economy would
pick up.
	   ``Overall, it's bearish, but responses from China-related
companies were least bearish, followed by property, banks, and
private listed companies,'' Chan said.
	   Hong Kong could be facing negative inflation next year, pushing
real interest rates higher, he said, noting that 60 percent of the
firms said property prices would fall.
	   Of the 50 listed companies polled, half said their net profit
margins would decline, indicating that earnings forecasts for 1999
are ``overly optimistic,'' Chan said.
	   Despite high interest rates, firms are still willing to invest
and are optimistic in the long term, he said.
	   ``A lot of firms would like to diversify away from properties,''
he said.
	   All the banks surveyed said interest rates would remain constant
over the next six months, the Post reported.
	   More than two-thirds of those polled said they agreed with the
government's highly criticized efforts to ward off financial
turmoil by intervening in the stock and futures markets. But many
said that the move should have been better planned and implemented.
	   During two weeks in late August, the government spent an
estimated U.S. dlrs 15 billion buying up stocks and futures to
stabilize the markets in an effort to drive out what it called
``market manipulators,'' or speculators.
	   Questionnaires were sent to 300 leading companies, and the 150
respondents included 50 listed companies, including a majority of
the 33 members of the blue-chip Hang Seng stock index.

Taiwan calls for new thinking ahead of meetings with China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Premier Vincent Siew urged China to sweep
away obstacles to a restoration of dialogue during crucial meetings
this week, and said Taiwan would not rule out discussing any issue.
	   Those contacts mark the start of a ``new stage'' in relations
frozen for three years by China's suspension of dialogue, Siew said
in an address Monday to a 12-member delegation led by senior envoy
Koo Chen-fu.
	   Koo's delegation departs for China on Wednesday.
	   ``We hope that the two sides will use new thinking and a new
approach to face the issues (and) rebuild a framework for relations
suited to the conditions of separation between the two sides,''
Siew said.
	   The premier's comments appeared to be a final appeal for China
to seize the opportunity of Koo's visit to pave the way for
restoring formal talks.
	   China has made negotiations conditional on Taiwan agreeing to
discuss political issues relating to their reunification, but the
island has urged agreement be first reached on practical matters to
build trust.
	   Siew reiterated comments he made in February that Taiwan would
be willing to discuss any matter that aided peaceful relations and
eventual reunification. But he added that Taiwan would not be
dictated to by Beijing, and said the sides should regard each other
as equals.
	   Though careful not to promise results, Taiwan has expressed
cautious optimism over Koo's visit. At the least, contacts should
``nurture a pleasant atmosphere (and) advance constructive
relations,'' Siew said.
	   Receiving a letter of authorization to represent Taiwan in the
informal meetings, Koo told reporters he felt the mission was a
``great responsibility.''
	   Koo's first top will be in Shanghai, where he will meet Wang
Daohan, his Chinese counterpart. Jan Jyh-horng, a deputy secretary
general of Koo's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation,
departed for China's commercial capital Monday morning to make
final preparations for the visit.
	   The Shanghai meeting will be the first between the elder
statesmen since 1993 talks in Singapore that marked the first
formal contact between the sides since they split politically amid
civil war in 1949.
	   Based on the agreement they reached, the sides held talks on
practical issues such as recognition of legal documents, until
China backed out in June 1995 in anger over Taiwan's efforts to
raise its international profile.
	   China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to
foreign relations and refuses to recognize the government in
Taipei.

Foreign oil companies donate money to areas hit by forest fires
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ American oil companies donated dlrs 50,000 to
communities in the Russian Far East seriously damaged by forest
fires, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Monday.
	   The money from Exxon Neftegaz Ltd., Mobil and Texaco will be
used to help rebuild communications and power lines on Sakhalin
Island and provide humanitarian aid to residents, the news agency
said.
	   The companies are exploring for and developing oil and gas off
Sakhalin, where the seabed is believed to hold billions of barrels
of oil and huge deposits of natural gas.
	   Forest fires across the Far East have destroyed some 1.5 million

fires have killed huge amounts of local wildlife, and threaten the
rare Amur tiger, of which fewer than 500 are believed to exist.

From the labs into the spotlight: the Nobel Medicine Prize

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ After a burst of worldwide attention,
Nobel Medicine Prize winners go back to their laboratories and some
are hardly heard of again by the public.
	   Still, last year's winner bucked that trend.
	   Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California-San
Francisco was in the news just this month, as one of those whose
work may lead to a rapid test that determines if slaughtered cattle
have the dreaded Mad Cow Disease microbes. Such a test could reduce
consumer nervousness about eating beef.
	   Prusiner won the Nobel for his discovery of prions, the rogue
proteins that cause the disease.
	   The winner of this year's prize, worth dlrs 978,000, will be
announced Monday by the Nobel Committee of the Karolinska
Institute, Stockholm's renowned medical facility.
	   Winners generally aren't known outside the medical community,
although the list of laureates contains a few familiar names
including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA
researchers Francis Crick and James Watson.
	   Generally, they are researchers who have made discoveries that
sound small on paper but carry large consequences.
	   The award two years ago went to Rolf M. Zinkernagel of
Switzerland and Peter C. Doherty, an Australian working in the
United States, for discovering how the immune system recognizes
infected cells _ a finding that could lead to new vaccines and
therapies for cancer, diabetes and multiple sclerosis.
	   Among other well-known names to receive the prize is David
Baltimore, although he shared the prize in 1975, long before
becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS researchers.
	   Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may
not be familiar names, but what they won the prize for in 1979 is a
term known by most patients: computer-assisted tomography _ or CAT
scan.
	   This year, the medicine prize is the second of the six Nobels to
be announced.
	   Last Thursday, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist
Jose Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the
economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and inventor of dynamite
whose will established the prizes.

Share prices surge on interest rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Shares prices in Hong Kong opened the week
sharply higher Monday, fueled by increasing hopes for both local
and U.S. interest rate cuts.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index was up 660.15 points, or 7.8
percent, to 9,166.94 at midday, its highest intraday level since
May 27. It pushed through the psychological resistance level of
9,000 during a frenetic morning session.
	   Turnover hit 7.46 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 954
million), compared with 4.09 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
524 million) in Friday's morning session.
	   Dealers say investors are piling into the market on expectation
that the territory's banks will cut interest rates as early as this
week. Such hopes have fueled a 12-percent rally in the index for
the past three sessions, including Friday's 7.15 percent gain.
	   Hopes of yet another rate cut in the United States at the next
meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in mid-November are
also bringing institutional investors back to the local market,
traders add.
	   ``There's more fear of being left out than buying high,'' said
Kent Rossiter, head of institutional sales at Nikko Securities Co.
(Asia) Ltd.
	   Property shares rose sharply on hopes of interest rate cuts,
with the sub-index tracking property shares rising 9.9 percent.
	   The gains in Japan's stock market early Monday and on Wall
Street Friday also buoyed sentiment, traders said.
	   Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average jumped 570.54 points, or
4.43 percent, to 13,450.51 at the end of the morning session. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.17 percent Friday.
	   George Chan, an analyst with Celestial Asia Securities Holdings
Ltd., said many institutions have been caught out by the sudden
change in sentiment locally and are short-covering their positions,
pushing the market higher.

Charter airplane crashes in Norway; eight killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) - A nine-passenger charter airplane crashed
short of a runway in western Norway Monday, killing all eight of
those believed to be aboard, police said.
	   The plane, a Cessna 402, was on its way from Aalborg, Denmark to
Stord, Norway when it crashed and caught fire at about 12:30 a.m.
(2230 GMT), some 200 meters (yards) short of the runway. The cause
of the crash was not known, even though it was seen from the
airport tower.
	   ``Everything seemed normal, and we had visual contact with the
plane,'' said Jan Morten Myklebust, head of the Stord local
airport. ``It was dark and raining, but there as a high cloud
ceiling and little wind. The plane just suddenly went down.''
	   According to Berit Johansen Sangholt, of the Hordaland district
police, seven passengers and a pilot were known to be aboard. The
Norwegian state radio network NRK said eight bodies had been
recovered from the wreckage, but that it was not clear whether one
more person could have been aboard.
	   The plane had been chartered to fly Danish workers to the Aker
Stord shipyard, about 500 kilometers (300 miles) west of Oslo,
after a weekend off. The identities and nationalities of the
victims were not immediately released.

Yeltsin feeling better: press secretary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin was
feeling better Monday, his spokesman said, after canceling public
events during a visit to Uzbekistan the previous day.
	   Yeltsin appeared stiff and stumbled Sunday on his arrival in
Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, and had to be supported by
Uzbek President Islam Karimov.
	   He canceled his other public events, saying he wasn't feeling
well. Yeltsin's chief spokesman, Dmitry Yakushin, said the
president was suffering from a cold and had had a bad flight from
Moscow.
	   Yakushin and Yeltsin's doctor, Sergei Mironov, said he was
feeling better Monday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``Yeltsin's cold will not affect the program of his state visits
to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan,'' Yakushin said.
	   The trip to Central Asia is Yeltsin's first outside of Russia
since May, when he traveled to Britain for a meeting of the Group
of Seven industrialized countries. Yeltsin is scheduled to fly to
Kazakstan later Monday.
	   In both Central Asian countries, Yeltsin is discussing economic
issues as well as concerns about the fighting in Afghanistan.
Former Soviet republics in the region fear an influx of refugees
and weapons from Afghanistan, and possibly a spill over of fighting
that has wracked the country.
	   Yeltsin, whose health has often sidelined him during his seven
years in power, has spent most of the last two months out of the
limelight and out of the Kremlin, holding meetings in his country
home outside Moscow.

Stronger ice platform allows early start to Antarctic seabed
</HEADLINE>
drilling &QL; 
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Solid sea ice more than 6-feet (2
meters) thick off the Antarctic coast is allowing an early restart
to a seabed drilling project at the ice continent's Cape Roberts,
where scientists are studying past climatic change.
	   ``The ice is thicker this year, Antarctica is letting us have
another go,'' chief scientist for the project Prof. Peter Barrett
told The Associated Press Monday.
	   This year's program could see the team drill a 2,300-ft (700
meter) hole into the Antarctic seabed.
	   ``We would like to get back 65 million years to the end of the
Cretaceous period, the end of the age of the dinosaurs,'' Barrett
said.
	   Last year the team extracted 500 feet (150 meters) of core
material from the first hole, before a severe Antarctic storm broke
a huge chunk from the ice-sheet and forced an urgent evacuation of
the 50-ton drill rig back to solid ice 15 miles (24 kilometers)
closer to the shoreline.
	   A thin ice sheet prevented any drilling in 1996.
	   The drilling project off Cape Roberts is 85 miles (140
kilometers) northwest of New Zealand's Scott Base and the U.S.
McMurdo Station on McMurdo Sound.
	   The six-nation project is drilling the Antarctic coastal seabed
to study past climatic change.
	   Scientists believe the rock cores from 1,500 feet (500 meters)
below the sea bed could unlock the history of the Antarctic's
climate and offer clues to global warming.
	   They also believe that studying earlier Antarctic warm spells
may help them predict what global warming may do to the world's ice
and sea levels.
	   The New Zealand dollars 10.2 million (U.S. dlrs 5 million)
drilling program is being jointly conducted by the United States,
Australia, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and Britain.
	   Barrett said the team expected to reach back at least 40 million
years in the second hole, with the drill team currently cementing
the casing to the seafloor, 560-ft (172 meters) below the ice,
ready to start drilling later this week.
	   Last year's hole yielded material going back 22 million years,
including 32 different shellfish fossils and 15 previously unknown
species of algae.
	   The discovery of the shells indicates the Ross Sea off
Antarctica was several degrees warmer some 1.2 to 1.8 million years
ago, said Marco Taviani of the Institute of Marine Geology in
Bologna, Italy.
	   Fifty scientists from 28 institutions around the world are
analyzing and describing the seabed core as it is recovered by the
drilling team.
	   Barrett, professor of geology at Victoria University of
Wellington, said the weather at Cape Roberts was reasonable, but
50-knot winds at McMurdo had prevented any flights to the ice from
Christchurch for nearly a week. Only the drilling and logistics
teams had reached the Antarctic so far.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's stock market plunged 67
points in early morning trading Monday as the Karachi Stock
Exchange reacted violently to the cancellation of a contract with
the country's largest private power company, dealers said.
	   The government also initiated criminal investigations against
senior officials of the Hub Power company.
	   The premier Karachi Stock Exchange 100-share index slumped 7.12
percent or 67 points, to 874 points in the first 30 minutes of
trade.
	   ``The Karachi index could hit an all time low owing to this
news,'' said Shakil Anwar, a dealer at Prudential Securities.
	   Hub Power shares fell 4.95 rupees to 9.10.
	   ``We should now forget about new fresh foreign investment in the
market for a long time to come. The individual investors and
institutions all have taken a severe beating,'' Anwar said.
	   Hub Power _ the second largest company listed on the exchange _
is considered a sentiment leader.
	   Meanwhile, the Karachi Stock Exchange board of directors was
holding an emergency meeting Monday to try to gauge the impact of
the government's decision to cancel Hub's contract. The government
also has warned that it is looking at rates being charged by other
power companies with an eye to cancellation or renegotiation.
	   ``The market was already under a bearish spell ... this news has
come as another blow,'' said Sajjad Mankani, a dealer at the BMA
Capital Management.
	   The cancellation of the contract follows months of wrangling
between the government and Hub in which Sharif accused the largely
British-owned company of charging inflated tariffs for electricity.
	   The contract was signed by former prime minister Benazir
Bhutto's government.
	   The government lodged two criminal cases of fraud and theft
against senior company officials. Several key officials from Ms.
Bhutto's former government also have been charged, he said.

China's trade surplus rises 15 percent in first nine months of year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's trade surplus for the first three
quarters of 1998 swelled 15 percent from a year earlier to dlrs
35.3 billion, as import growth slowed due to Asia's economic
troubles, state-run television reported Monday.
	   The General Administration of Customs said China's exports rose
3.9 percent on the year to dlrs 134.13 billion in the nine-month
period. Imports inched up just 0.4 percent to dlrs 98.82 billion,
according to the report.
	   China's January-September trade surplus was about dlrs 3.92
billion more than the surplus reported for the first eight months
of the year. The report blamed a deepening of the Asian financial
crisis for sluggish trade.
	   Facing slack demand from its Asian neighbors, China has been
hard-pressed to boost exports. This year's growth in exports is
well off the 21 percent pace the country recorded in 1997.
	   The region's widespread banking and corporate problems have also
meant fewer companies are willing to expand operations in China, so
they're spending less money to import equipment.
	   Some foreign officials have also complained that China is
erecting protectionist barriers to keep out some imports and
protect its own struggling companies from foreign competition.
	   The government has recently applied new anti-dumping laws more
vigorously and has established a cartel pricing system for both
autos and steel to prop up falling prices in these sectors.

Asian markets rally on growing optimism that worst is over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets opened the week sharply
higher Monday as the stronger yen and and Japan's action to address
its ailing banks generate hopes that the worst in Asia's protracted
financial chaos is finally over.
	   Asian bourses were also boosted by Wall Street's 2.17 percent
gain Friday, stabilizing regional currencies, and hopes of a fresh
round of global interest rate cuts.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average rose 675.04 points, or 5.24
percent, to close at 13,555.01. On Friday, the index had tumbled
146.09 points, or 1.12 percent, closing at 12,879.97 _ its lowest
finish since December 1985.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng index _ after gaining 12 percent in the
past three sessions _ rallied another 7.8 percent in the morning
session to 9,166.94 points, the highest intraday level since May
27.
	   Property shares led the Hang Seng's advance as local investors
expect a local interest rate cut as early as next week.
	   Singapore shares rallied on Wall Street's strong performance
Friday and continued expectations of further interest rate cuts.
	   The Straits Times Index surged about 6.3 percent, or 61.18
points, to 1037.83 in mid-afternoon trading. The last time the
index was around these levels was about two months ago.
	   In Japan, share prices rallied as the upper house of Parliament
voted into law Monday a plan to use public funds to clean up the
country's massive bad debt problem and deal with failed banks,
traders said.
	   The package, which was passed by the more powerful lower house
on Oct. 2, marks a major step in Japan's determination to bail the
nation out of its deepest recession since the end of World War II.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 115.90 yen in
early afternoon trading, down 1.30 yen from late Friday in Tokyo
and also below its late Friday level in New York of 116.95 yen.
	   Last week, the dollar dropped nearly 14 percent, falling as low
as 111.45 on Thursday.
	   Other Asian markets were buoyed by the Nikkei's jump and hints
that the United States and Europe are ready to coordinate efforts
to help Asia, said Richard Verin, director of Asia equity trading
at Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong.
	   Some investors believe ``Asia may have past the worst, with the
yen having traded very strongly. That would take a lot of pressure
off the currencies, and they would take interest rates down,'' he
said.
	   In other markets, the key index was up 2.1 percent in South
Korea; 2.8 percent in the Philippines; 2.9 percent in Thailand; 1.3
percent in Malaysia; and 1.9 percent in Indonesia.

Finance Minister: No long-term strategy yet for Russian economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's finance minister has acknowledged there
is no comprehensive, long-term strategy for rescuing the country's
economy and no plans to draft one this year.
	   ``I think that it would be rather difficult to draw up such an
integrated, comprehensive program now, since the situation,
firstly, changes very quickly, and secondly, it is too
sophisticated to be covered by any one single document,'' Mikhail
Zadornov said.
	   Zadornov spoke Sunday on the Russian television program
``Zerkalo.'' (Mirror).
	   The government has promised to make public its short-term plans
for dealing with the economic crisis by Oct. 20.
	   Zadornov said the government would not draw up any
comprehensive, long-term plans ``for at least the next three
months.'' Instead, it would set out specific tasks upon which it
would act vigorously, he said.
	   ``I think that, in essence, it it precisely such moves that will
lay the foundation for setting medium-term tasks in 1999,'' he
said.
	   Zadornov also said he expected more talks with international
lenders later this month. Russia is urging the International
Monetary Fund to release the next installment on a dlrs 22.6
billion loan negotiated before the crisis.
	   Russia has also asked the European Union for food and medicine
to help restock store shelves emptied by the latest economic
crisis, that struck in mid-August.
	   Russian officials are also reportedly holding informal talks
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture for as much as 3 million
metric tons (3.3 million short tons) of donated grains. Russia is
expecting one of the lowest harvest in 40 years because of
droughts.
	   Russia badly needs foreign money to help pay its debts, but the
IMF has said it must first come up with and implement measures to
end the crisis.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov maintains the government's plans
hinge on whether it gets the foreign aid.
	   Without that aid, Russia is widely expected to start printing
more money, which will stoke inflation.

Stocks finish sharply higher on passage of banking reform bills,
</HEADLINE>
dollar down
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks finished sharply higher Monday,
lifted by the passage in Parliament of bills designed to address
problems at the nation's ailing banks. The U.S. dollar fell against
the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average rose 675.04 points, or 5.24
percent, closing at 13,555.01. On Friday, the index had tumbled
146.09 points, or 1.12 percent, finishing at 12,879.97 _ its lowest
finish since December 1985.
	   The dollar bought 115.76 yen by mid-afternoon, down 1.44 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late Friday level in
New York of 116.95 yen.
	   Share prices rallied in the afternoon after Japan's upper house
of Parliament voted into law a plan to use public funds to clean up
the country's massive bad debt problem and deal with failed banks,
traders said.
	   The package, which was passed by the more powerful lower house
on Oct. 2, marks a major step in Japan's determination to bail the
nation out of its deepest recession in decades.
	   The market opened higher on expectations that the government
would soon expand a pool of public funds to assist ailing Japanese
banks, traders said.
	   Also supporting the market was Friday's rally in blue chips on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 167.61, or
2.17 percent, to 7,899.52 points, a gain of 114.83 for the week and
just shy of 7,908.25 where it began the year.
	   Japanese media reported over the weekend that the ruling and
opposition parties have agreed to expand to 67 trillion yen (dlrs
577 billion) the pool of public funds to boost the capitalization
of weak banks.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 40.84 points, or 4.16 percent, to 1,023.34. On
Friday, the TOPIX fell 19.00 points, or 1.93 percent.
	   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar moved lower on
selling from Japanese institutional investors and possibly by hedge
funds in a thin local market.
	   Anxiety over the economic health of hedge funds _ known for
betting large sums on global currency movements _ and their impact
on U.S. markets are among factors contributing to the uncertainty
over the dollar's direction.
	   The dollar's weakness also derived from the prospect of lower
German interest rates, which nudged the German mark down against
the yen, leading to the Japanese currency's relative strength
against the dollar, traders said.
	   Last week, the dollar plunged nearly 14 percent, falling as low
as 111.45 on Thursday.
	   That selling was fueled largely by hedge funds moving to dump
dollars in uncertain markets amid hopes for greater efforts by
Japan to mend its weak economy and the gloomier outlook for the
U.S. economy.
	   Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the Japanese Finance Ministry's
international bureau, said Monday that volatility like that which
took place last week was undesirable.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.895 percent from Friday's finish of 0.790
percent, driving its price down to 108.06 yen from 109.08.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Declaring a martyr of Auschwitz the first
Jewish-born saint of the modern era, Pope John Paul II said
Catholics should mark her saint's day as an annual commemoration of
all the Holocaust's murdered Jews.
	   The pope called Edith Stein an ``eminent daughter of Israel and
a faithful daughter of the church.''
	   ``In the martyr, Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, so many
differences meet and are resolved in peace,'' John Paul, using the
name Stein chose in the church, told the thousands filling St.
Peter's Square for Sunday's canonization.
	   It was a ceremony filled with remarkable gestures of
reconciliation: The Roman Catholic Church exerting all its
ceremony, pomp and grandeur in a tribute to a woman of Jewish
heritage. Relatives of Holocaust victims _ Stein's family _ sharing
a dais with the leader of Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Stein is believed to be the first Jewish-born saint since the
early days of the church, said the Rev. Simion Fernandez, who
oversaw the process toward canonization. Incomplete records and the
prevalence of conversions, voluntary and forced, make it impossible
to say for certain.
	   She was born into an Orthodox Jewish German family on Yom
Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, in 1891. An atheist, she
joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1922 and later became a
Carmelite nun.
	   In 1942, Adolf Hitler's regime ordered all the converts in the
Netherlands shipped to Auschwitz to punish the Dutch bishops for
speaking out against it.
	   Stein was offered a chance to escape deportation, the pope said,
but turned it down.
	   ``Why should I be excluded?'' he quoted her as saying.
	   ``If I cannot share the fate of my brothers and sisters, my life
is, in a certain way, destroyed.''
	   Stein was in a chapel praying with nuns of her order when the
Nazis came to arrest her.
	   Her sister, who had followed her into Catholicism, was among the
converts deported. They were killed at Auschwitz on Aug. 9.
	   ``We remember all of them today with profound respect,'' said
John Paul, whose voice stayed strong throughout the 2 1/2-hour
ceremony.
	   ``From now on, in celebrating the memory of our new saint, from
year to year we also cannot forget the Shoah, which slowly worked
at the elimination of a people, costing the lives of millions of
Jewish brothers and sisters,'' he declared, using the Hebrew word
for the Holocaust.
	   In Jerusalem, the Simon Wiesenthal Center protested Stein's
canonization.
	   ``She could in no way symbolize the Jewish martyrs of the
Holocaust because she chose to leave Judaism,'' said one center
official, Ephraim Zuroff.
	   In naming Stein a saint, the church credits her with at least
three miracles, one of which was her intercession almost a
half-century after her death to save a toddler's life.
	   More than a decade ago, 2 1/2-year-old Teresia Benedicta
McCarthy of Brockton, Massachusetts, swallowed an overdose of
Tylenol and suffered such severe liver damage that she was put on a
priority list for a transplant. Then, overnight, she recovered.
	   Benedicta's doctor called the recovery miraculous, and the
church agreed _ saying the only explanation was the prayers that
the McCarthys and their friends offered to Stein.
	   Both Stein's and Benedicta's families, independently, had urged
that the church mark Stein's sainthood with a fuller accounting of
its actions before and during the Holocaust.
	   The family of Stein's grandnephew, Michael Biberstein of
Kensington, California, wrote the pope in August, the San Diego
Union-Tribune reported.
	   They praised John Paul for his ``goodwill to the Jewish people''
but said the past is ``still waiting to be fully acknowledged.''
	   In March, the Vatican issued a long-awaited statement of regret
that Catholics did not say and do more to stop Nazi persecution of
Jews, but praised the conduct of wartime pope Pius XII, whom some
accuse of failing to do enough.
	   Improving relations with Jews has been a tenet of John Paul's
papacy, as has been the creation of saints. More people have been
canonized during his papacy, which reaches its 20th anniversary on
Friday, than in any other.

Cambodian government unruffled by U.S. condemnation of Hun Sen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian government said Monday
it was unconcerned by a U.S. congressional resolution calling for
an investigation into violations of international humanitarian law
allegedly committed by strongman Hun Sen.
	   The resolution, passed last week in the House of
Representatives, is non-binding and not supported by the U.S. State
Department, a Cambodian government spokesman said.
	   It is, therefore, not seen as a threat to Cambodia's leader, he
added.
	   ``We expected this resolution. It won't affect the relationship
between the American government and the Cambodian government at
all,'' spokesman Khieu Kanharith said.
	   The resolution calls on the United States to collect information
against Hun Sen and supply it to ``an appropriate international
judicial tribunal for use as evidence to support a possible
indictment and trial of Hun Sen for violations of international
humanitarian law after 1978.''
	   Events mentioned in the resolution include Hun Sen's coup d'etat
against his co-Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh last year,
and his violent crackdown in September against antigovernment
demonstrations.
	   The resolution was written by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.),
a staunch critic of Hun Sen who represents a district with
America's largest ethnic Cambodian population.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh released a statement last week
saying the State Department supported investigations into political
killings and other serious human rights violations in Cambodia, but
not the House resolution because it called for the establishment of
a tribunal focusing on a single individual.
	   ``This resolution, like the numerous other resolutions passed by
the House and Senate, does not have the force of law and is not
binding,'' the embassy stated.
	   Khieu Kanharith said that the only effect the resolution may
have is to embolden opposition party leaders, such as former
Finance Minister Sam Rainsy, to increase their verbal attacks
against the government.
	   Sam Rainsy, who lobbied U.S. lawmakers to support the
resolution, told a local newspaper Sunday that he was ``very
satisfied'' by its passing.
	   ``I think that it will send a message to Hun Sen to be very
careful not to use violence against his opponents,'' Sam Rainsy
told The Cambodia Daily by phone from Paris.
	   An earlier draft of the resolution included charges that Hun Sen
was involved in the genocide of more than 1 million Cambodians
during the communist Khmer Rouge's brutal 1975-79 reign.
	   However, historians say there is no evidence that Hun Sen, a
young Khmer Rouge field commander at the time, was responsible for
mass killings.

Thousands of East Timorese protest for second day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped letter in overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ About 15,000 East Timorese staged a
second consecutive day of protest on Monday, demanding the
provincial governor quit over a threat to fire government employees
who support an independence referendum for the troubled territory.
	   The protesters arrived in hundreds of cars and motorcycles from
several regencies in the morning and joined others already in the
East Timor capital, Dili.
	   Waving banners and chanting pro-independence slogans, the
protesters marched down several streets.
	   Stores, offices and schools were closed.
	   Hundreds of riot police blocked the crowd from entering the
compound of the governor's office. There were no reports of
violence or arrests.
	   The protesters were angered by a recent statement by Gov. Jose
Abilio Osorio Soares that civil servants in the province must
support a proposal by the Indonesian government to grant autonomy,
not independence, to the former Portuguese colony.
	   Soares also threatened to fire government employees who back
calls by separatists for a referendum on independence.
	   ``We will keep on protesting until the government responds to
our demands,'' said Leandro Isaac, a protest organizer.
	   He also threatened to hold a similar protest for the release of
jailed East Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao, who is now serving
a 30-year prison sentence in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
	   On the first day of protests on Sunday, police blocked a long
convoy of motorcycles and cars.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after invading it the
previous year during a civil war. The United Nations, however, does
not recognize Indonesia's sovereignty over the half-island
territory.
	   Indonesia has put forward an offer to grant autonomy as part of
ongoing U.N.-sponsored negotiations with Portugal.

World economic woes, budget wrangle dominate EU finance talks
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG _ The turmoil on world markets, a battle over the
European Union's budget and the economic impact of Italy's
government crisis dominate Monday's meeting of EU finance
ministers.
	   The meeting comes as slower growth rates and fears of more gloom
spreading from Asia, Russia and South America take some of the
shine off preparations for the launch of the euro as the common
currency of 11 EU nations on Jan. 1.
	   So far, the EU has avoided the worst of the global crisis.
Supporters say that's partly down to confidence in the euro as a
strong currency and the strict budget policies nations must follow
to join the single currency.
	   However, ministers face mounting pressure for action to halt any
further decline in growth and help prevent future outbreaks of
global turbulence.
	   ``We've got to contribute to maintaining the conditions for
growth and stability round the world,'' Britain's Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown told BBC television Sunday. ``My European
colleagues ... must share responsibility for creating these
conditions.''
	   With that in mind, ministers were expected to discuss plans for
strengthening international financial institutions and growing
calls for interest-rate cuts. They also expected to look at the
impact for Europe of the dollar recent tumble.
	   The one-day EU meeting should be the last for German Finance
Minister Theo Waigel. Defeat in last month's elections means the
Bavarian conservative is stepping down after almost 10 years at the
helm of the EU's biggest economy.
	   As a parting shot, Waigel is likely to knock home Germany's
tough line over plans to overhaul the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget
from 2000 so the Union can pay for it's planned expansion into
eastern Europe.
	   Germany, along with Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, says it
pays too much into EU coffers and gets too little back in return.
They insist any reform correct the imbalance.
	   Since the incoming center-left government of chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder is expected to continue to defend Germany's
stance, the budget wrangling is expected to drag on for months.
	   Italy's Carlo Azeglio Ciampi may also be making his last
appearance at a gathering of EU finance ministers, following the
fall of the center-left government in Rome Friday.
	   Other ministers will be looking for assurances that whoever
leads the next government _ perhaps Ciampi himself as caretaker
prime minister _ will continue Italy's efforts to cut debt and
budget deficit.

Foreign Minister reelected to parliament after close contest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Foreign Minister Alexander Downer on
Monday won one of the tightest contests of Australia's election,
after being targeted by the right-wing populist One Nation party
for attacking its leader Pauline Hanson's criticism of Asians.
	   Nine days after the polls closed, candidate for the centrist
Australian Democrats party John Schumann conceded Downer was going
to win the electorate of Mayo with just a handful of votes
remaining to be counted and a very tight margin.
	   Downer went into the Oct. 3 election with what on paper was one
of the safest parliamentary seats held by the ruling conservative
coalition of Prime Minister John Howard.
	   But as counting began it became clear that the result was going
to be a cliffhanger, after One Nation sought to take its revenge on
Downer through Australia's convoluted system of preference-vote
distribution.
	   Downer has been one of Hanson's most unrelenting and fiercest
critics, reassuring Asian leaders during trips through the region
that her views are not representative of the government or most
Australians.
	   Hanson, who claims Australia is in danger of being ``swamped by
Asians,'' lost her Parliamentary seat at the election. Only one
party member was elected, despite One Nation gaining about 8
percent of the national vote.
	   One Nation was always unlikely to be able to mount a serious
threat to Downer in Mayo in its own right.
	   Lying in the hills outside Adelaide, the district incorporates
many ethnic communities, including the wine-growing town of Handorf
where many citizens have their own experiences of being the targets
of prejudice _ it was settled by German migrants, many of whom were
interred in detention camps during both World Wars.
	   But folk singer Schumann, as a member of the respectable
centrist Democrats, received ``preference'' votes from One Nation
supporters.
	   Under the system, the votes of minor candidates who are
eliminated early can be passed on to one of the remaining
contenders.
	   In Mayo, One Nation urged its supporters to direct their
preference votes against Downer and towards Schumann.
	   Conceding defeat, Schumann Monday said: ``It is clear ... that,
on present trends, Mr. Downer will fall across the line ahead of
me.''
	   Downer Monday said he had no regrets about his criticism of
Hanson.
	   ``I wear it as a badge of honor that One Nation put the
Democrats ahead of me (in order of preference),'' Downer said.
	   ``They wanted to get rid of me and they failed.''

Russia: NATO airstrikes could lead to international chaos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ NATO airstrikes against Serbia could encourage
countries elsewhere to use force to solve disputes, Russia's
foreign minister said in pressing his country's opposition to
military action by the Western alliance.
	   ``That is very dangerous because we can enter a phase of
international chaos when states solve differences on borders with
their methods, the use of force,'' Igor Ivanov said.
	   He spoke Sunday on the Russian television program ``Zerkalo''
(Mirror).
	   Russia opposes possible NATO airstrikes a Serbia, a traditional
ally with which it shares a Slavic heritage and Orthodox religion.
	   Ivanov said Russia was still considering how it would respond if
NATO went ahead with the airstrikes to force Serbia to end its
violent crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province.
	   Ivanov said Sunday in Uzbekistan, where he is accompanying
President Boris Yeltsin on an official visit, that a Russian
military response was ``out of the question.''
	   ``We continue to believe and not only to believe but also to do
everything to prevent the worst,'' he said on TV.

PLDT chairman confirms that company faces hostile takeover bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. chairman
Roberto Romulo said Monday a hostile takeover is being mounted
against the company, but he declined to say whether the bidder was
an investment group or a foreign telecommunications company.
	   ``As a statement of fact there is a hostile takeover attempt on
going in Manila,'' said Romulo, who is attending an economic
conference in Singapore.
	   Romulo said he hoped Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission
would decide ``sooner rather than later'' on a company plan to
deter a hostile takeover.
	   PLDT, the Philippines' largest telecommunications company, has
seen its share price swing wildly since it announced Sept. 3 that
it had adopted a shareholder rights plan to protect against any
hostile takeover.
	   The plan needs SEC approval. The commission has not said how
long it expects to take before delivering its ruling.
	   The plan gives existing shareholders greater access to PLDT
stock in the event of a hostile takeover, making it more expensive
for an unwanted bidder to take a controlling stake in the company.
Shareholders of a record date yet to be set would be given the
right to acquire preferred shares in the event of an unwanted buyer
seeking to acquire more than 10 percent of the company's voting
stock.
	   Romulo said he is concerned about the impact of PLDT's share
volatility on the overall Philippine stock market.
	   ``It doesn't make the stock exchange look any better,'' he said,
noting that trading in PLDT invariably accounts for a large portion
of the daily volume of the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index.
	   Newspapers have cited various parties who are reportedly eyeing
a substantial stake in PLDT. Among them are Hong Kong's First
Pacific Co., Spain's Telefonica SA, and American International
Group.
	   Romulo reiterated that it would be ``inappropriate and quite
frankly counter productive to speculate on which group or groups
are involved ... but we know there is a hostile takeover.''

Japanese upper house approves bank failure measures

 &UR; Eds: PMs; RECASTS; UPDATES with stocks boosted by passage of bills,
details &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Taking a major step toward tackling Japan's bad
debt crisis, the upper house of Parliament on Monday voted into law
a plan to use taxpayer money to clean up the country's deeply
troubled banks.
	   The package, which was passed by the more powerful lower house
on Oct. 2, also boosts Japan's efforts to overcome its deepest
recession since the end of World War II.
	   The markets took the vote as a healthy sign the country is
acting to address its financial problems. The benchmark Nikkei
Stock Average surged 675.04 points, or 5.24 percent, closing the
day's trading at 13,555.01.
	   The so-called financial stabilization plan creates a special
committee to oversee the cleanup of the nearly dlrs 1 trillion in
bad debts left over from the burst of the speculative ``bubble
economy'' in the early 1990s.
	   Also set up would be an organization similar to the U.S.
Resolution Trust Corp., created during the 1980s U.S. savings and
loan crisis to buy the bad debt from banks.
	   The Japanese economy could use the help. New loans are hard to
get and business has been suffering, especially small and
medium-size companies. Unemployment is at a record high,
bankruptcies are soaring and consumer spending is falling.
	   Growth shows no sign of coming back soon. The Economic Planning
Agency announced last week that the economy would shrink by 1.8
percent this year, and the head of the agency said on Sunday that
it could shrink next year as well.
	   The legislation passed Monday provides a framework for the
bailout, but does not specify the amount of money to be used.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party originally proposed using
about 10 trillion yen (dlrs 86 billion), but reportedly agreed with
opposition parties over the weekend to increase that to 50 trillion
yen (dlrs 435 billion).
	   The new committee has the authority to pursue three courses of
action when dealing with a failed bank: to nationalize the bank
temporarily through the government's purchase of its shares; to
order the liquidation of the institution; or to transfer the bank's
operations to a public bridge bank.
	   It was unclear, however, what standards would be used to decide
which banks would fall under each method.
	   With Japan under pressure to turn around its economy and help
Asian neighbors, the bills also are a major victory for Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi and end one phase of a fierce dispute between
his ruling party and the opposition.
	   But the complicated implementation of the plan was expected to
be the center of another protracted political struggle.
	   ``It is one thing to pass a package of measures ... and it is
quite another to make sure they are workable,'' LDP lower house
member Nobuteru Ishihara was quoted as saying in the Asahi
newspaper Monday.
	   The first test case of the new legislation will be the troubled
Long-Term Credit Bank, which has been rumored to be on the verge of
collapse since summer. LTCB, one of Japan's biggest lenders, is
struggling under the weight of failed real estate loans.
	   In June, LTCB announced it was in talks to merge with Sumitomo
Trust _ a move that was widely regarded as a government-directed
bailout. But under the new legislation, the bank will be
nationalized temporarily and its bad loans will be sold, Kyodo News
agency reported.
	   The bills also abolish a 13 trillion yen (dlrs 113 billion) fund
that previously provided public money to be pumped into the banking
system to recapitalize banks.
	   Attention will now focus on the parliamentary debate regarding a
bill that would set up a replacement for the abolished fund,
allowing the government to pump cash into the banking system as a
means of easing the nation's credit crunch.
	   The ruling and opposition political camps have moved closer
toward an agreement on this issue in recent days.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A search team on Russia's Sakhalin Island found a
helicopter Monday that had caught fire and gone down the day
before, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The Mi-2 helicopter was spotted from the air on Sakhalin,
located off Russia's Pacific coast, after a search team of more
than 130 soldiers, border guards, police and forest rangers began
hunting for it Monday morning.
	   The helicopter had been inspecting forest fires Sunday in a
northern part of the island when it caught fire and went down,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   When the search team arrived they found a note from the two crew
members saying they had headed to the nearest settlement.
	   The search for the helicopter, which belonged to the Vostok
airline, took longer than expected because of smoke from forest
fires still burning out of control in the region, ITAR-Tass said.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's economic decline is expected to
continue in the next six months, half of 150 leading firms in the
territory said in a poll released Monday.
	   Jointly conducted by brokerage Nomura International and the
South China Morning Post, the polls is the first in a series that
will be carried out quarterly to gauge business and economic
sentiment.
	   ``The results are negative. More than 50 percent of firms say
the economic outlook will deteriorate in the next six months,''
Nomura's Greater China economist Kevin Chan said.
	   Hong Kong's economy shrank by 5 percent in the second quarter of
this year, and expected to contract by at least 4 percent this
year. Unemployment is at a 15-year high of 5 percent.
	   But most respondents expected the growth in unemployment to
ease. More than two-thirds said they would not lay off workers in
the next six months, and only 19 percent expected more layoffs in
their companies.
	   About 33 percent said they did not expect economic conditions to
change in the period, while 11.9 percent said the economy would
pick up.
	   ``Overall, it's bearish, but responses from China-related
companies were least bearish, followed by property, banks, and
private listed companies,'' Chan said.
	   Hong Kong could be facing negative inflation next year, pushing
real interest rates higher, he said, noting that 70 percent of the
firms said property rental prices would fall.
	   Of the 50 listed companies polled, half said their net profit
margins would decline, indicating that earnings forecasts for 1999
are ``overly optimistic,'' Chan said.
	   Despite high interest rates, firms are still willing to invest
and are optimistic in the long term, he said.
	   ``A lot of firms would like to diversify away from properties,''
he said.
	   All six banks surveyed said interest rates would remain constant
over the next six months, the results showed.
	   About two-thirds of the 76 firms that responded to a question on
the government's highly criticized intervention in the stock and
futures markets said they supported the move. But many said that
the move should have been better planned and implemented.
	   During two weeks in late August, the government spent about U.S.
dlrs 15 billion buying up stocks and futures to stabilize the
markets in an effort to drive out what it called ``market
manipulators,'' or speculators.
	   Questionnaires were sent to 300 leading companies, and the 150
respondents included 50 listed companies, including a majority of
the 33 members of the blue-chip Hang Seng stock index.

Government urges Australians to leave Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia would support NATO
airstrikes if negotiations failed to persuade Yugoslavia to accept
international demands on Kosovo, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
said Monday.
	   Downer upgraded warnings to the about 2,000 Australians in the
region, urging them to immediately leave the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   ``Australians should get out of Yugoslavia as soon as
possible,'' Downer told reporters. ``The situation has obviously
reached a point of crisis in Kosovo.''
	   Downer urged President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his troops
from the Kosovo region.
	   ``The situation there is a humanitarian disaster,'' he said,
adding that 250,000 people had been displaced from their homes.
	   ``You have winter coming and it is very important that President
Milosevic listens to the international community,'' Downer said.
	   ``I hope very much that it won't come to the need for a NATO
strike, but that clearly is a possibility. ... We will support NATO
action if it comes to that.''

Cuts to rest time could increase danger on South Africa flight:
</HEADLINE>
Pilots &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Roster changes proposed by Qantas
Airways for its Australia to South Africa route cut into pilots'
rest time and could increase the safety risk, the Australian and
International Pilots Association said Monday.
	   Qantas is proposing in the Australian Industrial Relations
Commission a new roster on its Perth to South Africa route which
would cut pilots rest time between flights from 34 to 21 hours.
	   The association has opposed the new roster as profit-driven and
possibly dangerous.
	   A Qantas spokeswoman said the proposed 21 hour turnaround period
was in accordance with Civil Aviation Safety Authority regulations.
	   Association president Colin Adams said the 21-hour rest period
in South Africa was not enough before the return trip. In most
ports, pilots receive more than 48 hours to rest, Adams told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``It's the middle of the night and you leave again in the middle
of the night so your body isn't ready to sleep when you arrive
there and nor just before you leave,'' he said.
	   Negotiations between Qantas and the pilots broke down in the
commission late Monday.

High level inquiry announced into gas facility explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The government of Victoria state on
Monday ordered a high-level investigation into the gas refinery
explosion last month which killed two people and cut supply to
Australia's second most populous state for almost two weeks.
	   Announcing a royal commission into the crisis, Premier Jeff
Kennett said gas producer Esso-BHP had failed the state's more than
3 million residents, who deserved the highest level inquiry
possible.
	   The explosion on Sept. 25 killed two workers and cut gas
supplies to most of the state for almost two weeks, costing
industry millions of dollars and leaving householders without
gas-powered cooking facilities, hot water or heating.
	   Gas for factories, businesses and hot-water heaters was restored
last week, but full supply to all domestic users was not expected
to be reconnected until late Monday, distributor VENCorp said.
	   Kennett said the royal commission would investigate both the
explosion at Esso's Longford facility and an earlier incident there
in June, when an ice plug in the pipeline choked gas supplies.
	   ``The people of Victoria are owed nothing less than the most
serious investigation,'' Kennett said.
	   Former High Court judge Sir Daryl Dawson would head the
commission, which is expected to hand down its report in February.
	   A royal commission is a government-appointed fact finding
inquiry which has many of the same powers of the Supreme Court,
including being able to compel people to give evidence and produce
documents.
	   Meanwhile, Kennett said the government was seeking guarantees
from Esso-BHP that the state's gas supply would not be interrupted
next winter, beginning in July.
	   The company has said damage to the Longford facility may mean
gas will have to be rationed next winter.
	   Kennett said he would look to resource companies elsewhere if
Esso BHP could not guarantee security of supply.

Economists disagree on prescriptions for Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Leading economists and businessmen disagreed
Monday on solutions for Asia's financial turmoil but warned that a
mishandling of the situation could lead to the world's worst
economic crisis in more than 50 years.
	   ``The prognosis remains bleak,'' said Roberto Romulo, chairman
of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., the Philippines' largest
telecommunications company. ``Meanwhile, nobody is taking
leadership.''
	   The economists, speaking at an East Asia Economic Summit, agreed
that the rapid spread of economic turmoil to Russia, South America
and the U.S. stock market showed that global solutions will be
needed.
	   ``We have to see this as a global issue, as a global challenge,
and the solution should be at the global level,'' said Jusuf
Wanandi, chairman of Indonesia's Center for Strategic International
Studies.
	   But they differed on whether the solutions should focus on the
internal policies and plights of affected countries, or on the
growing, uncertain impact of globalization on the world economy.
	   Clyde Prestowitz, president of the U.S.-based Economic Strategy
Institute, said the worsening of the crisis over the past year
shows that Asian countries should reconsider their most basic
economic fundamentals _ even traditional values such as high
personal savings rates that have been credited with the region's
previous economic success.
	   Unless they increase domestic spending, there will not be enough
demand for the region's products because of weakening consumption
around the world, he said.
	   But several other participants in the summit _ sponsored by the
World Economic Forum, a private agency based in Switzerland that
brings political and business leaders together _ focused on
problems caused by the growing globalization of financial markets.
	   ``In the past, the financial sector served the business world,''
said Lee Tsao Yuan, director of Singapore's Institute of Policy
Studies.
	   But that is no longer true with dlrs 1 trillion a day
transferred on global financial markets and volatility illustrated
by last week's 15 percent drop in the U.S. dollar against the
Japanese yen in two days, she said.
	   ``This is a fundamental change in the way we do business ... and
we have yet to deal with this,'' she said.
	   Kenneth Courtis, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Group Asia
Pacific, said the drive toward globalization is going to increase,
and countries will not be able to sidestep it.
	   He said the Asian crisis has intensified in recent months
because of a credit crunch and lower demand caused by slowing
economic growth around the world.
	   ``We are today at a critical juncture,'' Courtis said. ``If we
don't reverse course we face the biggest crisis since the 1930s.''
	   He called a recent offer by Japan to provide dlrs 30 billion in
loans to help Asian nations out of the crisis ``very positive,''
but said that would only partly offset the credit squeeze caused by
cutbacks in loans by troubled Japanese banks in the region.
	   To escape the crisis, Japan will need to spend about dlrs 1
trillion to solve its banking problems and stimulate its economy,
he said.
	   ``Japan can be a locomotive pulling the region out of its
crisis. If not, it becomes a Titanic pulling the region under,''
Courtis said.

Hyundai chief likely to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Il
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; UPDATES with Hyundai's plan to send construction workers and
equipment in grafs 8-10

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary
chairman of the Hyundai business group, plans to visit North Korea
later this month and meet leader Kim Jong Il, an aide said Monday.
	   Kim Yun-kyu, a senior Hyundai executive, made the statement
after a weekend visit to North Korea, where he discussed Hyundai's
plans for sightseeing tours of a scenic northern mountain.
	   ``There is a high probability that honorary chairman Chung will
visit North Korea within this month and have a meeting with leader
Kim Jong Il,'' Kim told reporters.
	   The aide said all important pending issues concerning the tours
were settled during his visit to North Korea. He declined to
disclose what the pending problems were.
	   The aide said Hyundai can expect to start the tours later this
month. The tours have been delayed since September because of
financial, safety and other problems.
	   The Hyundai chief, Chung, visited his native North Korea in June
with a gift of 500 cattle and agreed to set up the tours as a joint
venture with the communist nation.
	   Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, hopes to send up to
2,000 tourists a week on two luxury cruise ships to Diamond
Mountain on the North's east coast.
	   Hyundai said it plans to send 88 workers and construction
equipment by ship and barge Tuesday to build berthing facilities at
Changjun, a North Korean port near the mountain.
	   Also to sent aboard the barges will be 65 tourist buses,
officials said.
	   Eight Hyundai executives will fly to North Korea by way of
Beijing Tuesday to discuss other business ventures, including
assembly of car audio sets and hiring of North Korean workers for
Hyundai's overseas construction projects, they said.
	   The tourism project would mark the first major joint venture
between the two hostile Korean states and give Pyongyang a new
source of badly needed foreign currency.
	   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the
early 1950s. Their border is sealed with 2 million troops deployed
on both sides.

Finance Minister: No long-term strategy yet for Russian economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with former deputy prime minister's comments on food
aid, IMF visit delayed. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's finance minister has acknowledged there
is no comprehensive, long-term strategy for rescuing the country's
economy and no plans to draft one this year.
	   ``I think that it would be rather difficult to draw up such an
integrated, comprehensive program now, since the situation,
firstly, changes very quickly, and secondly, it is too
sophisticated to be covered by any one single document,'' Mikhail
Zadornov said.
	   Zadornov spoke Sunday on the Russian television program
``Zerkalo.'' (Mirror).
	   The government has promised to make public its short-term plans
for dealing with the economic crisis by Oct. 20.
	   Zadornov said the government would not draw up any long-term
plans ``for at least the next three months.'' Instead, iin said that an International
Monetary Fund delegation that had been expected to arrive in Moscow
on Monday has been postponed until later this month because of the
Russian government's failure to submit all the information sought
by the IMF.
	   ``The IMF decided not to hurry because data for Oct. 1 will be
available only after the 20th of this month,'' Vyugin said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia is urging the IMF to release the next installment on a
dlrs 22.6 billion loan negotiated before the latest crisis struck
in mid-August. Russia badly needs the money to help pay its debts,
but the IMF says it must first come up with and implement measures
to end the crisis.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov maintains the government's plans
hinge on whether it gets the foreign aid. Without that aid, Russia
is widely expected to start printing more money, which will stoke
inflation.
	   Russia has also asked the European Union for food and medicine
to help restock store shelves emptied by the latest economic
crisis, that struck in mid-August.
	   Russian officials are also reportedly holding informal talks
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture for as much as 3 million
metric tons (3.3 million short tons) of donated grains. Russia is
expecting one of the lowest harvest in 40 years because of
droughts.
	   Former deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov said Monday the
Russian government is also seeking humanitarian aid from the United
States. He said U.S. administration officials told him of the
request during a recent trip to the United States.
	   Nemtsov had no further details, but said the situation was
extremely embarrassing for Russia.
	   ``We must tackle our problems on our own rather than beg,'' he
said, according to the Interfax news agency.

Russia: NATO airstrikes could lead to international chaos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to CORRECT slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ NATO airstrikes against Serbia could encourage
countries elsewhere to use force to solve disputes, Russia's
foreign minister said in pressing his country's opposition to
military action by the Western alliance.
	   ``That is very dangerous because we can enter a phase of
international chaos when states solve differences on borders with
their methods, the use of force,'' Igor Ivanov said.
	   He spoke Sunday on the Russian television program ``Zerkalo''
(Mirror).
	   Russia opposes possible NATO airstrikes a Serbia, a traditional
ally with which it shares a Slavic heritage and Orthodox religion.
	   Ivanov said Russia was still considering how it would respond if
NATO went ahead with the airstrikes to force Serbia to end its
violent crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province.
	   Ivanov said Sunday in Uzbekistan, where he is accompanying
President Boris Yeltsin on an official visit, that a Russian
military response was ``out of the question.''
	   ``We continue to believe and not only to believe but also to do
everything to prevent the worst,'' he said on TV.

Australian facing child sex charges pleads innocent

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ An Australian former millionaire
pleaded innocent Monday to 38 charges of child sexual assault at
the District Court in Sydney.
	   Phillip Harold Bell, 62, appearing in a dark suit before Judge
Thomas Davidson and a jury of eight men and four women, replied,
``Not guilty,'' as each count of the indictment was read to the
court.
	   Prosecutors say Bell committed indecent assaults and acts of
homosexual intercourse on five boys aged between 13 and 15 between
1983 and 1988.
	   The alleged offenses took place at a rural property on coast of
New South Wales state, at two other locations and on boats moored
in Sydney Harbor.
	   Prosecutor Mark Tedeschi said Bell is accused of taking part in
masturbation, oral sex and anal sex with the boys.
	   He said up to 64 witnesses would be called to give evidence
during the trial, expected to last between six and eight weeks.
	   After nearly a year's international search, Bell was arrested
last December in Jeffrey's Bay, where he was running a surfing
school on South Africa's southern coast.
	   Bell was extradited to Australia after spending nearly five
months in a jail cell in Humansdorp, about 75 kilometers (46 miles)
west of Port Elizabeth.

Philippine president urges deeper ties with Singapore

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada, on his
first overseas trip, met Monday with Singapore's leaders and called
for more cooperation between the two once-estranged countries.
	   ``My decision to visit Singapore first was right ... as our
relations are very important,'' Estrada said in a speech to the
Philippine and Singaporean businessmen.
	   Estrada said his ``pro-poor'' policies cannot be implemented
without the help of the foreign business community.
	   ``The government recognizes the crucial role of foreign direct
investment for rural projects,'' he said.
	   Estrada, who won the presidency by appealing to the poor and the
disenchanted, reiterated his promise to transform the country
economically without neglecting the poor.
	   ``We are pro-market, pro-investment, pro-competition,'' he said,
``but we will not forget safety nets for the marginalized sectors
of the society.''
	   Earlier Monday, Estrada met with Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong and President Ong Teng Cheong.
	   ``We share a strong commitment to strengthening the cooperation
between our countries,'' Estrada said after the meeting.
	   Estrada, on his first trip abroad since assuming the presidency
in June, is to deliver the keynote address on Tuesday at the East
Asia Economic Summit sponsored by the World Economic Forum.
	   Singapore is the Philippines' third-largest trading partner,
with total trade reaching dlrs 3.8 billion last year. Singapore
also is the fourth-largest importer of Philippine products and an
important investor.
	   Estrada said the two countries enjoy a balanced trade
relationship, adding that Philippine businessmen are now investing
in Singapore in larger numbers to take advantage of Singapore's
``dynamic competitiveness.''
	   He said he was confident the Philippines will be the first in
Asia to recover from the regional economic crisis.
	   The Philippines' projected economic growth for this year is 1
percent, higher than most of its Southeast Asian neighbors.
	   Estrada on Sunday met with some of about 100,000 Filipino women
who work as domestic helpers in Singapore and praised them as
saviors of the Philippine economy. Overseas Filipino workers are
expected to send home more than dlrs 6 billion this year through
official channels, and much more through other means.
	   Relations between the two countries were hurt in 1995, when
Singapore convicted Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino maid, of killing

Singapore shrugs off Malaysian currency controls and airspace

restrictions

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore on Monday shrugged off recent moves
by Malaysia seen as detrimental to the small city-state, including
the imposition of market controls and restrictions of military
airspace.
	   Malaysia's decision to ban overseas trading of its currency and
stocks in early September had been viewed as particularly damaging
to Singapore's vulnerable economy, which relies on regional
financial activity and counts Malaysia as its second-largest
trading partner.
	   ``Given the close interdependence of the Singapore and Malaysian
economies, it is inevitable that Singapore will be affected by
Malaysia's capital and exchange control measures,'' Minister of
Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan told Parliament on Monday.
	   But he said trading of ringgit, the Malaysian currency, in
Singapore's foreign exchange market had declined over the past
months and was ``only a small proportion of total turnover.''
	   Minister for National Development Lim Hng Kiang said the
government was confident about Singapore's strengths as the
region's financial hub.
	   He pointed to growing business for many products on the
Singapore International Monetary Exchange despite the volatility in
regional markets.
	   Lim added that the ``closure of trading of Malaysian shares on
(the local stock market) is a loss to Singapore's financial sector,
but the loss is not significant relative to the size of the
financial sector'' here.
	   As with ringgit transactions, he noted that trading of Malaysian
shares had declined to only 3 to 8 percent of the total turnover in
the stock market in the months before Malaysia imposed
restrictions.
	   Lee added that bilateral trade, although likely to be affected
by the Malaysian restrictions, would not affect all Singapore-based
companies.
	   In addition to frayed economic ties with Malaysia, a series of
acrimonious disagreements over a wide range of issues has soured
relations between the two countries.
	   In mid-September, Malaysia abruptly revoked a long standing
agreement allowing Singapore military planes to transit through
their airspace without prior approval.
	   Minister of State for Defense Matthais Yao told Parliament that
Malaysia's decision will not affect training and operations of
Singapore's air force, which has started alternative routes, but
acknowledged it will hurt search and rescue efforts.

NATO asks Hungary to use its airspace for any action against

Yugoslavia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ NATO has asked Hungary for permission
to use its airspace for possible military action against
Yugoslavia, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.
	   Orban, speaking on state television Sunday night, said the
condition of any Hungarian participation is that NATO give
guarantees to extend its protection to Hungary.
	   Hungary considers that especially important after Serbia's vice
premier, Vojislav Seselj, warned last week that any neighboring
countries that support the NATO action would have to face the
consequences.
	   Hungary's parliamentary parties all support such military action
by NATO. In a vote last November, Hungarians overwhelmingly
supported joining NATO. Formal admission is expected by April 1999.
	   Orban called a meeting of the state security cabinet for Monday
and an extraordinary plenary session of Parliament for Tuesday to
give final approval.

Kyrgyz officials seize weapons intended for Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Customs officials in Kyrgyzstan found weapons and
explosives hidden among humanitarian aid on an Iranian train, and
believe they were going to be smuggled into Afghanistan, a news
agency said Monday.
	   Customs officials inspected the 16-car Iranian train in the
southern Kyrgyz city of Osh, ITAR-Tass said. A large number of
weapons and explosives was found hidden in the humanitarian aid, it
said.
	   Documents found on the train indicate the shipment was to be
loaded onto trucks and taken into Afghanistan, ITAR-Tass said,
quoting the deputy chairman of the State Customs Inspectorate,
Nadyrbek Turganbayev. He refused to give any more details.
	   Kyrgyzstan and other former Soviet republics in Central Asia
fear an influx of refugees and weapons from Afghanistan, and
possibly a spill over of fighting that has wracked the country.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's opposition parties
demanded Monday that talks between their leaders and strongman Hun
Sen aimed at forming a coalition government take place outside the
country.
	   A spokesman for Hun Sen's party called the demand an opposition
trick, but did not rule out meeting abroad if King Norodom Sihanouk
endorsed the idea.
	   The king said Monday in a letter to junior opposition party
leader Sam Rainsy that he would have to consult with Hun Sen and
ruling party president Chea Sim on a foreign venue.
	   Hun Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in the National
Assembly, or parliament, in a July 26 election, not the two-thirds
majority necessary to form a government on its own.
	   The opposition insists the victory was achieved through fraud
and intimidation. Talks between Hun Sen's party and the opposition
over forming a government have been deadlocked.
	   The opposition says it wants to negotiate outside the country
because it is being threatened by Hun Sen's party.
	   In a joint statement, opposition party leaders Prince Norodom
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy suggested Tokyo and several other foreign
capitals as neutral ground where talks could be held.
	   ``We cannot join a meeting in Cambodia as we will not negotiate
under threat, including the threat of further so-called `attacks'
on Hun Sen, which could bring consequences of the most serious
magnitude,'' the opposition leaders said.
	   Sam Rainsy and several others have been under investigation
since a grenade attack on Hun Sen's residence sparked a crackdown
on demonstrations against the results of the July 26 national
election.
	   Hun Sen was not in Phnom Penh at the time and no one was hurt in
the attack. The opposition claimed it was staged as an excuse to
break up the protests.
	   The Phnom Penh municipal court filed charges against Sam Rainsy
and summoned him to appear for questioning.
	   Both Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have stayed outside Cambodia since
parliament was ceremonially opened on Sept. 24.
	   A spokesman for Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party said Monday
that the statement was a ploy to portray the ruling party as
hostile toward the opposition.
	   ``This is one of the tricks of Sam Rainsy to show he is a victim
and that there is a threat inside the country,'' ruling party
spokesman Khieu Kanharith said.
	   A second alleged attempt on Hun Sen's life came in the
northwestern town of Siem Reap. A rocket-propelled grenade exploded
near Hun Sen's car, killing a 12-year-old bystander.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk's mediating efforts in a September summit
among Hun Sen, Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy led to the convening of the
legislature. The ruling party called on the 75-year-old monarch
last week to host more talks.
	   Sam Rainsy on Sunday sent his request to the king to chair the
summit and asked the monarch to hold the meeting outside Cambodia.
	   Sihanouk responded that he was still waiting for Ranariddh's
request for a summit, but if both opposition parties suggest a
foreign venue, he would have to consult with the ruling party
before making a decision.
	   The king had said in a weekend statement that he could not order
opposition leaders to attend the summit but would chair the meeting
if asked.
	   Khieu Kanharith said the opposition's demand for talks to be
held in another country would only be agreed to by Hun Sen's side
if the king also proposed it.

Charter airplane crashes in Norway; eight killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A nine-passenger charter airplane crashed
short of a runway in western Norway Monday, killing all eight of
those believed on aboard, police said.
	   The plane, a Cessna 402, was en route from Aalborg, Denmark, to
Stord, Norway, when it crashed 200 meters (yards) short of the
runway after midnight. The cause of the crash was not known.
	   ``Everything seemed normal, and we had visual contact with the
plane,'' said Jan Morten Myklebust, head of the Stord airport. ``It
was dark and raining, but there as a high cloud ceiling and little
wind. The plane just suddenly went down.''
	   The Norwegian state radio network NRK said eight bodies had been
recovered from the wreckage.
	   The plane had been chartered to fly Danish workers to the Aker
Stord shipyard 300 miles (480 kilometers) west of Oslo after a
weekend off. The identities and nationalities of the victims were
not immediately released.

	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The turmoil on world markets, a battle over
the European Union's budget and the economic impact of Italy's
government crisis dominate Monday's meeting of EU finance
ministers.
	   The meeting comes as slower growth rates and fears of more gloom
spreading from Asia, Russia and South America take some of the
shine off preparations for the launch of the euro as the common
currency of 11 EU nations on Jan. 1.
	   So far, the EU has avoided the worst of the global crisis.
Supporters say that's partly down to confidence in the euro as a
strong currency and the strict budget policies nations must follow
to join the single currency.
	   However, ministers face mounting pressure for action to halt any
further decline in growth and help prevent future outbreaks of
global turbulence.
	   ``We've got to contribute to maintaining the conditions for
growth and stability round the world,'' Britain's Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown told BBC television Sunday. ``My European
colleagues ... must share responsibility for creating these
conditions.''
	   With that in mind, ministers were expected to discuss plans for
strengthening international financial institutions and growing
calls for interest-rate cuts. They also expected to look at the
impact for Europe of the dollar recent tumble.
	   The one-day EU meeting should be the last for German Finance
Minister Theo Waigel. Defeat in last month's elections means the
Bavarian conservative is stepping down after almost 10 years at the
helm of the EU's biggest economy.
	   As a parting shot, Waigel is likely to knock home Germany's
tough line over plans to overhaul the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget
from 2000 so the Union can pay for it's planned expansion into
eastern Europe.
	   Germany, along with Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, says it
pays too much into EU coffers and gets too little back in return.
They insist any reform correct the imbalance.
	   Since the incoming center-left government of chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder is expected to continue to defend Germany's
stance, the budget wrangling is expected to drag on for months.
	   Italy's Carlo Azeglio Ciampi may also be making his last
appearance at a gathering of EU finance ministers, following the
fall of the center-left government in Rome Friday.
	   Other ministers will be looking for assurances that whoever
leads the next government _ perhaps Ciampi himself as caretaker
prime minister _ will continue Italy's efforts to cut debt and
budget deficit.

Malaysia's Islamic party gaining support from Anwar's arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The growing discontent with Prime
Minister Mahathir's 17-year-rule is swelling the ranks of an
Islamic party that is leading the anti-government campaign, a party
official said Monday.
	   ``More people are supporting us now than ever before,'' said
Salahuddin Ayub, an official of the Parti Islamic SeMalaysia or
PAS, a conservative group.
	   The party's president, Fadzil Mohamad Nor, was quoted as saying
in the Star newspaper on Monday that the party had received 500 new
applicants for membership in recent weeks.
	   A growing dissatisfaction with the ruling United Malays National
Organization has showered surprise support on PAS, Fadzil was
quoted as saying.
	   Mahathir's party depends on the majority Malay Muslims for its
support, a constituency that PAS is now encroaching on.
	   More than half the country's 22 million people are Malay Muslims
who have traditionally voted UMNO to power since Malaysia became
independent in 1957.
	   ``People don't believe UMNO will deliver justice,'' Salahuddin,
secretary of the powerful youth wing of PAS said in an interview.
	   PAS recently alarmed the government by winning a by-election in
the northern Perlis state in July. That victory gave the party a
total of 8 seats of 192 in parliament. UMNO has always controlled
more than two-third of the seats.
	   Mahathir has denied that UMNO's strength is being corroded by
the campaign set off by the firing and later arrest of his deputy
prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Malaysians were shocked when Anwar was arrested under the harsh
Internal Security Act and stunned weeks later when he appeared in
court with a black eye and body bruises, alleging police brutality.
	   Anwar, who faces trial on corruption and sexual misconduct
charges, has denied any wrongdoing. He says the charges are
politically motivated to silence him, at a time when he is emerging
as the biggest challenge against Mahathir.
	   Many Malaysians are angry. On city streets and rural roads
around the country, they have rallied by the thousands, shouting
``Mahathir resign!'' and demanding justice for Anwar.
	   Over and over, street protesters have voiced the same concern:
If this can happen to the country's No. 2 man, what about me?
	   Anwar's arrest has also been a catalyst for opposition unity.
PAS and other Muslim groups have for the first time allied with the
opposition Democratic Action Party, which is dominated by ethnic
Chinese.
	   ``Anwar held the promise of a new political tomorrow,'' said Lim
Kit Siang, the head of the DAP and Anwar's one time political foe.
``Now Anwar has become a symbol.''
	   The People's Justice Movement, with PAS and DAP as the major
components, has successfully organized rallies in defiance of
police bans.
	   Crowds of more than 10,000 have turned out to its rallies in
several parts of the country, where the group has demanded justice
for Anwar and an end to the Internal Security Act.
	   But it remains unclear whether it will survive as an electoral
bloc because mutual suspicions still exist.
	   Fadzil, the PAS president, said on Sunday that his party would
like to contest elections on its own without compromising its
Islamic stance. The next general election is not due until April
2000.
	   The PAS party, and many powerful Muslim groups in the pro-Anwar
campaign, want Malaysia to follow stricter Islamic laws.
	   The DAP and other liberal groups within the new coalition
however want a more liberal Malaysian society with greater
political freedom.

NATO asks Hungary to use its airspace for any action against
</HEADLINE>
Yugoslavia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ NATO has asked Hungary for permission
to use its airspace for possible military action against
Yugoslavia, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.
	   Orban, speaking on state television Sunday night, said the
condition of any Hungarian participation is that NATO give
guarantees to extend its protection to Hungary.
	   Hungary considers that especially important after Serbia's vice
premier, Vojislav Seselj, warned last week that any neighboring
countries that support the NATO action would have to face the
consequences.
	   Hungary's parliamentary parties all support such military action
by NATO. In a vote last November, Hungarians overwhelmingly
supported joining NATO. Formal admission is expected by April 1999.
	   Orban called a meeting of the state security cabinet for Monday
and an extraordinary plenary session of Parliament for Tuesday to
give final approval.

Yeltsin cuts short meetings for second day

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut
short his meetings in Uzbekistan on Monday, after canceling events
the previous day, but aides said he was recovering from a cold and
feeling better.
	   Yeltsin appeared stiff and stumbled Sunday on his arrival in
Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, and had to be supported by
Uzbek President Islam Karimov.
	   He canceled his other public events, saying he wasn't feeling
well, but held one-on-one talks with Karimov as scheduled.
Yeltsin's chief spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said the president was
suffering from a cold and had had a bad flight from Moscow.
	   Yakushkin and Yeltsin's doctor, Sergei Mironov, said he was
feeling better Monday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   However, Yeltsin showed up one hour late for talks Monday
between Russian and Uzbek officials, catching only the last 20
minutes. He also cut short his scheduled 20-minute news conference
to just a few minutes.
	   He and Karimov made brief statements and walked away without
taking any questions. Yeltsin walked unaided, but was closely
flanked by bodyguards.
	   ``We had to slightly change the program because of the tight
schedule,'' Yakushkin told reporters, refusing to give any further
details.
	   Following the talks, Yeltsin and Karimov signed a package of
agreements to boost economic and other ties.
	   ``We have agreed to establish closer cooperation in the
economic, political and military fields,'' Yeltsin said in his
statement.
	   Yeltsin then flew to neighboring Kazakstan for a two-day visit.
	   The trip to Central Asia is Yeltsin's first outside of Russia
since May, when he traveled to Britain for a meeting of the Group
of Seven industrialized countries.
	   In both Central Asian countries, Yeltsin is discussing economic
issues as well as concerns about the fighting in Afghanistan.
Former Soviet republics in the region fear an influx of refugees
and weapons from Afghanistan, and possibly a spill over of fighting
that has wracked the country.
	   Yeltsin and Karimov made a joint statement on Monday expressing
``serious concern'' over the developments in Afghanistan and
calling on the ruling fundamentalist Islamic movement Taliban to
end hostilities.
	   The two presidents also signed a declaration promising to help
one another in the event of an outside attack. The document was
signed earlier by President Emomali Rakhmonov of Tajikistan _
another former Soviet republic that borders both Uzbekistan and
Afghanistan.
	   Yeltsin, whose health has often sidelined him during his seven
years in power, has spent most of the last two months out of the
limelight and out of the Kremlin, holding meetings in his country
home outside Moscow.

Ministers chastized for purchase of dlrs 40 million painting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo AMS101 &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prime Minister Wim Kok, his
finance minister and the chief of the Dutch Central Bank were
rebuked Monday for buying a dlrs 40 million abstract painting with
taxpayers' money and donating it to a museum.
	   In a draft report, the national Court of Audit _ an independent
body that investigates government spending _ said the three
overstepped their bounds with the purchase of Piet Mondrian's
``Victory Boogie Woogie.''
	   Some art experts praise the painting as the pinnacle of the
Dutch master's career. But the Court of Audit wasn't impressed that
the government saw fit to acquire it with public funds.
	   It did not give details of the draft report, which was to be
released Tuesday and presented to parliament for debate later this
week.
	   The high-profile purchase jolted the usually tranquil Dutch art
world and drew the ire of ordinary citizens when it was revealed
early last month that the private National Art Collection Funds
purchased the work last week with part of a donation of dlrs 55
million from the 1998 profits of the Central Bank.
	   At 80 million guilders (dlrs 40 million), the most expensive art
purchase ever funded by the Dutch state quickly aroused the
curiosity of the Court of Audit, which launched a preliminary
investigation.
	   Auditors since have concluded that the Central Bank may only
turn over excess cash to the state, and not directly to private
institutions, Dutch media reported Monday.
	   Kok, Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm and Central Bank president
Nout Wellink were singled out as responsible for what the auditors
characterized as an unauthorized and inappropriate purchase.
	   Kok's office and the Finance Ministry had no immediate reaction
Monday.
	   In addition to their indignation over how it was bought, many
Dutchmen believe the 127-by-127-centimeter (51-by-51-inch)
unfinished painting simply wasn't worth the price tag.
	   The art fund that bought it calls it one of the most important
artworks of the 20th century, and some art experts consider it a
joyous expression to emerge from the gloom of World War II.
	   The diamond-shaped collage of small squares in bold blues, reds
and yellows, was done in oil and black crayon with pieces of paper
and plastic. The Dutch master created it in New York between 1942
and his death in 1944.
	   ``Victory Boogie Woogie,'' which belonged to American magazine
publishing magnate S.I. Newhouse Jr. and had hung in a New York
apartment, has been added to the permanent collection of The Hague
Municipal Museum, already home to the largest Mondrian collection
in the world. It goes on display there Oct. 29.

Needy families given rice aid in drought-affected province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Vietnamese Red Cross has provided an
additional 217 tons of rice for 10,850 of the neediest victims from
a recent drought in Quang Binh province.
	   The provincial Red Cross said Monday that each person was given
20 kilograms (44 pounds) of rice, with a maximum of 60 kilograms
(132 pounds) for one family. Another 93 tons had been donated
earlier.
	   The province, one of Vietnam's poorest, suffered from its worst
drought in half a century until rains finally came in mid-August.

Economic migrants on rise in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Economic migration is on the rise in
Vietnam as people move in search of better paying jobs in the
cities, a government official said Monday.
	   Hoang Dong, director of the Ministry of Agriculture's Department
of Settlement and Economic Zones, said such migration is increasing
because government-sponsored economic zones, which accommodate
100,000 people each year, cannot meet the demand.
	   Dong said a survey funded by the U.N. Development Program over
the past two years showed that 100,000 people are moving each year
to Ho Chi Minh City and 55,000 to Hanoi.
	   The survey also showed that these people earn an average of
471,000 dong (dlrs 34) per month, much higher than 100,000 dong
(dlrs 7) they could earn on the farm. By moving, migrants can send
some money back to their families each month, it said.
	   The massive migrations to major cities have complicated social
issues and put more pressure on the country's already overloaded
infrastructure.
	   Migration is also blamed for deforestation in four central
highland provinces as new residents, particularly from the northern
mountainous provinces, continue slash-and-burn cultivation
practices.

Deadlock as Air Algerie strike enters seventh day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ There was no end in sight Monday to a
seven-day strike by Air Algerie after unions voted to withdraw a
guarantee of minimal flights.
	   Since Friday, at least 30 percent of flights have been running
as normal from Algiers, especially on services to Paris and the
southern French city of Marseille.
	   But the strikers' position hardened after company officials said
Sunday they would not accept changes to a restructuring plan.
	   Air Algerie officials say a restructuring is essential to
maintain the company's competitiveness. But staff fear there will
be inevitable job losses.
	   The strike has left thousands of people stranded, and many have
had to take ferries to Europe.
	   ``I risk losing my job. I had to be back today,'' said Mouloud
Benlazreg, a businessman based in Paris who was trying to find an
alternative route.
	   Commuters whose domestic flights have been canceled have had to
resort to trains and buses to make their journeys.

Dozens struck with food poisoning after thank-you meal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A thank-you meal for villagers who helped
a man put a roof on his house left 76 of them sick with food
poisoning, a district hospital said Monday.
	   Six of the villagers had to be hospitalized overnight in Kien
Xuuong district in the northern province of Thai Binh.
	   Doctors said water used to cook the meal had been taken from the
nearby river, which was contaminated with the cholera virus.
	   The Health Ministry was quoted last week as saying 292 people
died among 6,103 food-poisoning cases in 1997.
	   The total of 3,517 cases and 156 fatalities in the first six
months this year is ahead of that pace. Excessive use of
insecticide is being blamed.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO warplanes shifted closer
for possible NATO airstrikes, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
described the Kosovo standoff as an ``emergency.'' on Monday and
demanded the Yugoslav leader end his crackdown.
	   Holbrooke returned to his hotel just before dawn Monday,
following an 11-hour session with President Slobodan Milosevic and
three hours on the telephone with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger.
	   Holbrooke described his meeting with Milosevic as ``intense,
indeed, and at times very heated.'' He said the standoff between
NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can only be called an
emergency.''
	   Holbrooked headed for Milosevic's offices shortly after 10 a.m.
(0800 GMT), and new talks were reported to have begun shortly
after.
	   NATO officials also scheduled a meeting, in Brussels, Belgium.
That meeting, delayed without reason from Monday morning to later
in the day, was expected to result in an ``activation order'' for
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia unless diplomacy produces a
breakthrough.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a Yugoslav republic.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's request that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   The Belgrade daily Nasa Borba reported Monday that Milosevic was
reluctantly considering the demand, but there was no confirmation.
	   The U.N. Security Council demands include an immediate
cease-fire, a withdrawal of special troops in the province,
allowing refugees to return home and beginning talks with
independence-minded ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Milosevic's crackdown on the KLA has killed hundreds, and forced
at least 270,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes. There was
sporadic gunfire and smoke Sunday in the ethnic Albanian village of
Makrmalj, about 35 kilometers (20 miles) west of Pristina, but Serb
police blocked journalists from the area.
	   Rebels claimed the activity was part of a police operation.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 anti-tank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   The Romanian government agreed to let NATO use its airspace in
an emergency, and Hungarian authorities were considering a similar
request from the organization. Australia today warned its citizens
to immediately leave Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, warned
neighboring countries Sunday that a NATO attack could turn the
Balkans into ``a powder keg.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov again expressed his
country's opposition to any NATO strike but said a military
response by Moscow to such an attack was ``out of the question.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.
	   Milosevic's office said Sunday that all U.N. conditions have
been met for a political settlement, but Washington disagrees.
	   Efforts to end the seven-month crisis intensified following
allegations that Serb police massacred scores of ethnic Albanian
refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will bring a humanitarian
disaster if thousands remain homeless by the first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. U.S. President Bill
Clinton believes, however, it does not need a new U.N. resolution
for the attacks.

U.S. first lady encourages businesswomen in Bulgaria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VESELIN ZHELEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
praised Bulgarians on Monday for their reform efforts and
encouraged women who are trying to help create a new business
culture in this former communist country.
	   On the second day of her four-day trip to promote women's rights
in Eastern Europe, Mrs. Clinton met with businesswomen at a Sofia
bakery and discussed the challenges of running a business in the
new Bulgaria.
	   ``We're very impressed by the reform effort and the difficult
decisions that your government is making on behalf of the future,''
she told the women.
	   Mrs. Clinton also accepted an offer to allow her book ``It Takes
a Village'' to be translated and published into Bulgarian.
Businesswoman Iren Komitova suggested the proceeds go to the
American University in Bulgaria's southwestern city of Blagoevgrad.
	   After talking with students at the American College of Sofia,
the first lady was headed later Monday to Prague to meet with Czech
leaders and speak at a conference organized by President Vaclav
Havel and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel.
	   On her first day in Bulgaria, far from the pressures of
Washington and talk of her husband's impeachment, Mrs. Clinton on
Sunday announced new American aid grants and posed for pictures
with former street children.
	   Although Sunday was the Clintons' 23rd wedding anniversary, the
couple marked the occasion apart, having celebrated on Friday with
a dinner on the eve of Mrs. Clinton's departure.
	   The first lady addressed the opening session of a conference
entitled ``Women in the 21st Century'' focusing on the role of
women in social issues confronting southeastern Europe, much of
which is still recovering from a half-century of Communist rule.
	   ``The American people, the American government and the president
of the United States will stand with you as you press ahead to meet
the challenges before you,'' she said.
	   ``Democratic progress depends on the progress of women,'' Mrs.
Clinton told delegates at the two-day conference. ``Economic
progress depends on progress of women. A vibrant civil society
depends upon the full contribution of women.''
	   She announced a dlrs 15 million grant to bolster civil society
in southeastern Europe, to be channeled through the U.S. Agency for
International Development, and said a new program would provide
dlrs 300,000 in training and internships for women business leaders
and entrepreneurs.
	   Later, at a meeting with activists at a Jewish center in
downtown Sofia, Mrs. Clinton praised Bulgarians for their tolerance
and their progress in establishing democratic principles since the
fall of Communism in 1989.
	   Bulgaria is one of the few former communist states to have
addressed issues involving its minorities, in particular, the
800,000 Turks and 300,000 Gypsies, or Roma, who live in the
country.
	   ``It is a great pleasure for me to be in a country well known
for its tolerance,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``In comparison to many
other transition countries, Bulgaria sets quite an example.''
	   Before having dinner with President Petar Stoyanov and his wife,
she shook hands with some 50 local people and was cheered by
foreign tourists.
	   ``She is a nice strong lady because she stands by her husband
and defends him,'' said Ivan Ivanov, 28, one of the bystanders who
turned out for a glimpse of the first lady.

Three police killed in Abkhazia

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Shooting in the breakaway Abkhazia region of
Georgia left three Abkhazian policemen dead, the Interfax news
agency reported Monday.
	   A police patrol came under fire Sunday morning in the Ghali
district that separates Abkhazia from the rest of Georgia, Interfax
said, quoting the Abkhazian Interior Ministry.
	   The Abkhazians blamed Georgians for the shooting. The Georgian
government had no comment.
	   Abkhazian separatists drove out Georgian soldiers and ethnic
Georgians in a 1992-93 civil war. Despite the presence of Russian
peacekeepers, skirmishes have been frequent since then.

Singapore banks' bad loans likely to grow as regional crisis
</HEADLINE>
continues

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Bad loans made by Singapore banks are likely to
increase as the regional crisis continues and the local economy
slows, a minister said Monday.
	   Minister for National Development Lim Hng Kiang told Parliament
that Singapore's six banks have set aside some capital as a
preparation.
	   He said non-performing loans amounted to 6.1 percent of total
loans at the end of August for Singapore banks.
	   About 2.7 percent of their total bad loans were made to
Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines _
nations at the center of the regional crisis.
	   But the level of bad debt ``does not threaten the financial
health of any of the local banks,'' adding that the sector remained
``resilient,'' Lim said.
	   The six banks are Development Bank of Singapore, Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp., United Overseas Bank, Overseas Union Bank, Keppel
Bank and Tat Lee Bank.
	   Lim said that the city-state's de facto central bank, the
Monetary Authority of Singapore, will soon begin releasing data on
non-performing loans on a quarterly basis.
	   The move is in line with recent measures to make the financial
sector here more transparent.
	   On Singapore's fiscal policy, Lim noted that the government is
pursuing more expansionary policies, but warned that Singapore will
not be able to reverse the downturn by merely stimulating domestic
spending.
	   He emphasized that the government's main response to the
slowdown was to reduce business costs ``decisively.'' Reduced
tariffs and taxes, lower rents and utilities, and wages freezes
have already been adopted.
	   The government has strongly hinted that further measures,
including a cut in the amount employers and workers contribute to a
mandatory pension fund, will be forthcoming.
	   ``We need to be realistic and recognize that ultimately the
external environment must improve before an enduring economic
recovery in Singapore can take place,'' said Lim.

Chinese Vice Governor to visit in breakthrough exchange
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Zhang Jiakun, vice governor of China's
Fujian province, will visit business leaders in Taiwan starting
Tuesday, the highest-ranking local-level Chinese official ever to
visit the island.
	   Zhang will lead a small delegation on a four-day visit at the
invitation of Taiwan's Chinese National Federation of Industries,
the federation said Monday.
	   He will visit leading Taiwanese investors in China including the
Formosa Plastics group, which is participating in a multi-billion
U.S. dlrs power plant project in Fujian, the United Evening News
said.
	   The vice governor's visit comes at a moment when Taipei is
hoping for a breakthrough in exchanges between the sides, divided
politically since 1949 when the Nationalists fled here ahead of the
communist takeover of the China.
	   Taiwan's top negotiator with China travels to the mainland on
Wednesday for contacts that Taipei hopes will help end a three-year
break in negotiations.
	   Fearing over-dependency, Taiwan's government has sought to rein
in Taiwanese investment in China, where the island's businesses
have sunk about U.S. dlrs 30 billion.
	   The government bans Taiwanese from investing in infrastructure
projects including railroads, highways, power plants and banks in
China, and mandates fines of up to dlrs 540,000 for unauthorized
investments.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO warplanes being moved
closer for possible airstrikes, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
described the Kosovo standoff as an ``emergency.'' on Monday and
demanded the Yugoslav leader end his crackdown.
	   Holbrooke returned to his hotel just before dawn Monday,
following an 11-hour session with President Slobodan Milosevic and
three hours on the telephone with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger.
	   Holbrooke described his meeting with Milosevic as ``intense,
indeed, and at times very heated.'' He said the standoff between
NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can only be called an
emergency.''
	   Holbrooke headed back to Milosevic's offices shortly after 10
a.m. (0800 GMT).
	   NATO officials were also scheduled to meet in Brussels, Belgium.
That meeting, delayed without reason from Monday morning to later
in the day, was expected to result in an ``activation order'' for
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia unless diplomacy produces a
breakthrough.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a part of the Yugoslav republic.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's request that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   The Belgrade daily Nasa Borba reported Monday that Milosevic was
reluctantly considering the demand, but there was no confirmation.
	   The Security Council demands include an immediate cease-fire, a
withdrawal of special troops in the province, allowing refugees to
return home and beginning talks with independence-minded ethnic
Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Milosevic's crackdown on the KLA has killed hundreds, and forced
at least 270,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes. There was
sporadic gunfire and smoke Sunday in the ethnic Albanian village of
Makrmalj, about 35 kilometers (20 miles) west of Pristina, but Serb
police blocked journalists from the area.
	   Rebels claimed the activity was part of a police operation.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations in case
Holbrooke's mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain
on Sunday and a contingent of A-10 anti-tank planes flew from
Germany to Italy.
	   The Romanian government agreed to let NATO use its airspace in
an emergency, and Hungarian authorities were considering a similar
request from the organization. Australia warned its citizens Monday
to immediately leave Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, warned
neighboring countries Sunday that a NATO attack could turn the
Balkans into ``a powder keg.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov expressed his country's
continuing opposition to any NATO strike, but said a military
response by Moscow to such an attack was ``out of the question.''
	   Moving U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia and preparing them
for attack is clearly designed to convince Milosevic of
Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands.
	   Milosevic's office said Sunday that all U.N. conditions have
been met for a political settlement, but Washington disagrees.
	   Efforts to end the seven-month crisis intensified following
allegations that Serb police massacred scores of ethnic Albanian
refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will bring a humanitarian
disaster if thousands remain homeless by the first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. U.S. President Bill
Clinton believes, however, it does not need a new U.N. resolution
for the attacks.

Nizhny Novgorod, Lipetsk get new mayors, runoffs expected in
</HEADLINE>
Kaliningrad &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Residents of Russia's third-largest city elected
the chairman of a local religious organization to be their mayor,
after the winner of the last election was convicted of stealing
government funds, news agencies reported Monday.
	   The incumbent mayor was re-elected Sunday in the industrial town
of Lipetsk, south of Moscow, while mayoral votes in two cities in
the western enclave of Kaliningrad will go to runoffs.
	   Voters in Nizhny Novgorod gave 44 percent of the vote to Yuri
Lebedev, the 47-year-old chairman of a local religious charity and
the former vice governor of the region, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   The runoff vote was required after the first round last month
produced no winner.
	   Lebedev defeated former mayor Dmitry Bednyakov, who won 41
percent of the vote. More than 12 percent of voters cast ballots
against both candidates in the city, about 400 kilometers (250
miles) east of Moscow.
	   Nizhny Novgorod's previous mayor, entrepreneur Andrei
Klimentyev, was elected in March but election officials invalidated
his victory after President Boris Yeltsin expressed concern about
the results.
	   Klimentyev was convicted in May of forging documents, embezzling
part of a government loan to a shipbuilding plant and appropriating
a large share of the plant's stock. He was sentenced to six years
in prison.
	   Meanwhile, in the industrial city of Lipetsk, 300 kilometers
(180 miles) south of Moscow, preliminary results showed incumbent
Alexander Korobeinikov winning the mayoral election with 40.9
percent of the vote, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Korobeinikov's nearest rival garnered 23.9 percent.
	   Mayoral elections in two cities in Kaliningrad, 1,000 kilometers
(620 miles) west of Moscow, will both go to runoffs after no
candidate won 50 percent of the vote plus one ballot _ the level
required in the region.
	   In the city of Kaliningrad, acting mayor Yuri Savenko led with
42 percent. Anatoly Khlopetsky, director of the Transrailwest
company, took 14 percent.
	   And in Sovetsk, the director of a film-making school, Vyacheslan
Svetlov, captured 22.3 percent of the vote. His main opponent,
Nikolai Nikolayev, the director of the Sandorgaz company, took 18
percent.
	   Runoffs in both places are likely to be scheduled for Oct. 25,
ITAR-Tass said. Kaliningrad is separated from the rest of Russia by
Belarus and Lithuania.

	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ With opposition groups boycotting the
vote, Azerbaijan's authoritarian leader looked certain to be
re-elected president by voters seeking stability and long-elusive
prosperity for their oil-rich Caspian Sea country.
	   Voters on Sunday chose between President Geidar Aliev, 75, and
five candidates close to the government, who are widely believed to
be running only to make the election seem competitive.
	   Opposition groups criticized an announcement by the Central
Election Commission that results would not be known for four days,
saying Aliev's government was delaying results so it could tamper
with the outcome.
	   An unidentified spokesman for Aliev's campaign headquarters said
that while ballots were still being counted ``it's already clear
that President Geidar Aliev has won,'' the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Turnout was high, with 78 percent of eligible voters casting
ballots, easily surpassing the 25 percent minimum turnout required
to validate the election, the election commission reported.
	   Voting was peaceful in this former Soviet republic of 7.5
million once plagued by war and political chaos. International
observers said they had noticed only a few minor technical
problems, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. More than 200
observers were monitoring the vote.
	   The stability that has taken hold in recent years appeared to be
working in favor of Aliev, who was Azerbaijan's KGB chief and then
Communist Party boss during the Soviet era and retook power in a
bloodless 1993 coup.
	   ``I voted for Aliev,'' said shop owner Shakhi Mamedov. ``Before
he became the president we had instability. It was impossible to do
business and a lot of people carried guns. But now we are moving
towards a market economy.''
	   The main opposition leaders accused Aliev of stacking the ballot
in his favor and were already crying foul Sunday over the expected
outcome.
	   ``Whoever wins, whether it be Aliev or someone else, will be
illegitimate,'' said Isa Gambar, leader of the opposition group
Musavat and a former parliament speaker.
	   If no candidate wins at least two-thirds of the vote, a second
round must be held. In the last elections that followed the 1993
coup, Aliev won with 98 percent support.
	   Aliev has overseen the development of Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea
oil fields, but chronic corruption and sagging world oil prices
have meant that the country has yet to enjoy the economic windfall
Aliev has been predicting for years.
	   Unemployment remains high and monthly salaries rarely exceed
170,000 manat (dlrs 43). The country's bitter dispute with Armenia
over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh remains unresolved.
	   Still, Aliev has cast himself as the only candidate capable of
continuing the country's development and market reforms.
	   He has tried to rework his authoritarian image by introducing
Western-style election laws, abolishing media censorship and
agreeing to permit limited anti-government rallies.
	   ``I believe in my victory and I will be a worthy president,''
Aliev said after voting Sunday. ``My main task has been the
settlement of the (Nagorno)-Karabakh problem, and the strengthening
of independence and the economy.''
	   Not everyone agreed. Aliev ``has not done anything to return our
territory,'' said Isaak Gamidov, a refugee from Nagorno-Karabakh.
``I don't care that we are very poor because the main thing now is
to return our land, which is occupied by the enemy.''

U.S. first lady encourages businesswomen in Bulgaria

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
praised Bulgarians on Monday for their reform efforts and
encouraged women who are trying to help create a new business
culture in this former communist country.
	   On the second day of her four-day trip to promote women's rights
in Eastern Europe, Mrs. Clinton met with businesswomen at a Sofia
bakery and discussed the challenges of running a business in the
new Bulgaria.
	   ``We're very impressed by the reform effort and the difficult
decisions that your government is making on behalf of the future,''
she told the women.
	   Mrs. Clinton also accepted an offer to allow her book ``It Takes
a Village'' to be translated and published into Bulgarian.
Businesswoman Iren Komitova suggested the proceeds go to the
American University in Bulgaria's southwestern city of Blagoevgrad.
	   After talking with students at the American College of Sofia,
the first lady was headed later Monday to Prague to meet with Czech
leaders and speak at a conference organized by President Vaclav
Havel and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel.
	   On her first day in Bulgaria, far from the pressures of
Washington and talk of her husband's impeachment, Mrs. Clinton on
Sunday announced new American aid grants and posed for pictures
with former street children.
	   Although Sunday was the Clintons' 23rd wedding anniversary, the
couple marked the occasion apart, having celebrated on Friday with
a dinner on the eve of Mrs. Clinton's departure.
	   The first lady addressed the opening session of a conference
entitled ``Women in the 21st Century'' focusing on the role of
women in social issues confronting southeastern Europe, much of
which is still recovering from a half-century of Communist rule.
	   ``The American people, the American government and the president
of the United States will stand with you as you press ahead to meet
the challenges before you,'' she said.
	   ``Democratic progress depends on the progress of women,'' Mrs.
Clinton told delegates at the two-day conference. ``Economic
progress depends on progress of women. A vibrant civil society
depends upon the full contribution of women.''

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Bad loans made by Singapore banks are likely to
increase as the regional crisis continues and the local economy
slows, a minister said Monday.
	   Minister for National Development Lim Hng Kiang told Parliament

Ministers chastized for purchase of dlrs 40 million painting
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prime Minister Wim Kok, his
finance minister and the chief of the Dutch Central Bank were
rebuked Monday for buying a dlrs 40 million abstract painting with
taxpayers' money and donating it to a museum.
	   In a draft report, the national Court of Audit _ an independent
body that investigates government spending _ said the three
overstepped their bounds with the purchase of Piet Mondrian's
``Victory Boogie Woogie.''
	   Some art experts praise the painting as the pinnacle of the
Dutch master's career. But in a brief statement Monday, the Court
of Audit said it wasn't impressed that the government acquired it
with public funds.
	   The statement did not contain any details of the draft report,
which was scheduled to be released Tuesday and presented to
parliament for debate later this week.
	   The high-profile purchase jolted the usually tranquil Dutch art
world and drew the ire of ordinary citizens when it was revealed
early last month that the private National Art Collection Fund
purchased the work last week with part of a donation of dlrs 55
million from the 1998 profits of the Central Bank.
	   At 80 million guilders (dlrs 40 million), the most expensive art
purchase ever funded by the Dutch state quickly aroused the
curiosity of the Court of Audit, which launched a preliminary
investigation.
	   Auditors since have concluded that the Central Bank may only
turn over excess cash to the state, and not directly to private
institutions, Dutch media reported Monday.
	   Kok, Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm and Central Bank president
Nout Wellink were singled out as responsible for what the auditors
characterized as an unauthorized and inappropriate purchase.
	   Kok's office and the Finance Ministry had no immediate reaction
Monday.
	   In addition to their indignation over how it was bought, many
Dutchmen believe the 127-by-127-centimeter (51-by-51-inch)
unfinished painting simply wasn't worth the price tag.
	   The art fund that bought it calls it one of the most important
artworks of the 20th century.
	   The diamond-shaped collage of small squares in bold blues, reds
and yellows, was done in oil and black crayon with pieces of paper
and plastic. Mondrian created it in New York between 1942 and his
death in 1944.
	   ``Victory Boogie Woogie,'' which belonged to American magazine
publishing magnate S.I. Newhouse Jr. and had hung in a New York

Police arrest a woman trying to sell fake million-dollar bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A woman peddling a fake million-dollar
bill has landed in jail in Sri Lanka, police said Monday.
	   A police detective posing as a wealthy businessman arrested the
woman in a suburb of the Sri Lankan capital on Friday. The United
States government doesn't print a million-dollar bill.
	   ``It certainly looks like a real one, but we haven't heard of
million-dollar bills before,'' said police Inspector Rohan
Rupasinghe.
	   Jabbar offered the counterfeit bill for 45 million rupees (dlrs
690,000). A magistrate sent her to jail for two weeks, giving
police time to complete investigation against her.
	   The fake bill carried a picture of the Statue of Liberty. There
also was a certificate of authenticity signed by officials of the
``American Banknote Company'' and the ``International Association
of Millionaires.''
	   Similar fake dollar bills were recently seized by police in
neighboring India, some with the image of President Clinton, while
others carried pictures of Fort Knox, where the U.S. government
keeps its gold reserves, and the American eagle seal.

APEC: Women hurt by Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Many already unemployed and poor by
decades-oil social biases, women are among the worst hit by Asia's
financial storm, officials said Monday.
	   Delegates to a conference on women at a meeting of Pacific Rim
leaders have urged steps to demolish such discrimination and to
provide women with better opportunities to overcome the crisis.
	   ``Where poverty reigns, women are poorer than most men. Gender,
to be sure, is a function of nature. Poverty, however, is not,''
Philippine congresswoman Bellaflor Castillo told the delegates at
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum.
	   ``Sex-based discrimination has thrived because those who are in
a position to make a difference have chosen to ignore it,'' she
said.
	   The conference of senior officials from APEC member countries
aims to find ways of giving women equal opportunities in workplaces
and trade. The recommendations will be offered to APEC ministers,
who will hold a two-day meeting in Manila starting Thursday.
	   The ministers would then bring the proposals to APEC heads of
state, who will hold a summit in the Malaysian capital of Kuala
Lumpur next month.
	   Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Rosario Manalo said women were
the first to be laid off when companies shut down because women
tend to be assigned to dispensable work.
	   A conference paper also found that women workers have been
primarily assigned to certain low-paying and dangerous jobs, such
as the garment industry and home-based industries.
	   ``Because of gender stereotypes, women are expected to engage in
paid work on a temporary basis, such as during the time between
finishing school and marriage and pregnancy,'' it said.
	   Although women have been found to be owners or managers of at
least half the number of small- and medium-scale firms among APEC
countries, they still find it more difficult to obtain credit or
loans than their male counterparts, Manalo said.
	   This has made it difficult for women entrepreneurs to adjust to
economic difficulties, she said.
	   Manalo called on APEC countries to jointly study the effect of
Asia's financial crisis on women to know how they could be
effectively helped.
	   She also urged countries to start compiling data on women's
contribution to production and trade to find out their impact on
APEC economies.
	   APEC, which accounts for half of global trade, consists of
Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,
Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.

French minister: NATO strikes on Yugoslavia could be lengthy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's Defense Minister, announcing a plan to
provide planes for possible NATO strikes against Yugoslavia, said
Monday a military attack could last ``several days.''
	   Alain Richard, speaking in an interview with television channel
France-2, said France would provide around 40 planes for possible
air strikes.
	   ``France has agreed to contribute to the air force which perhaps
will act,'' Richard said.
	   He added that most of the aircraft would be based on the French
aircraft carrier Foch, currently heading towards the region. Other
planes, he said, would be stationed at Italian air bases.
	   France, active in seeking a solution to the Kosovo crisis, is
not a member of NATO's military wing, but is consulted over action.
	   Kosovo was the subject of talks last Sunday between French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and British counterpart Robin Cook.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on Monday described the Kosovo
standoff as an ``emergency'' and demanded that Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic end his crackdown.

Japan needs couple of years to clean up bank problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Asia-Economic Conference
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Japan will need another year or two to
restructure its banking system and once again become the lending
engine of Asian economic recovery, a special adviser to Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Monday.
	   ``It will take at least a year or two before we can declare the
main part of our cleanup operations is completed,'' said Toyoo
Gyohten, president of the Institute for International Monetary
Affairs and Obuchi's adviser.
	   He said Japan's private banks ``will also take that span of time
to recover.''
	   Economists and businessmen hammered away at the opening day of
an East Asia Economic Summit that Japan, the world's second largest
economy, must quickly resolve the problem of sick banks and
encourage spending and investing in order to push the rest of Asia
out of financial crisis.
	   ``Japan can be a locomotive pulling the region out of its
crisis. If not, it becomes a Titanic pulling the region under,''
Kenneth Courtis, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Group Asia
Pacific, said at the first session.
	   Courtis said Japan will need to spend about dlrs 1 trillion to
solve its banking problems and stimulate its economy.
	   Gyohten, speaking later at the conference, outlined the more
modest proposal he said the government is committed to completing
by the end of this year, at a cost of dlrs 45 billion or dlrs 55
billion (dlrs 50-60 trillion yen).
	   ``The process, leading us to a new stability, will be rough and
tough,'' Gyohten said. ``The economy will not recover unless we
succeed in the financial clean up because business confidence and
consumer confidence will not come back.''

Chechen leader again criticizes generals calling for his ouster
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of Russia's breakaway Chechnya
region criticized political opponents who claim he is not capable
of stopping violence in the area and should step down, a news
agency said Monday.
	   In a televised address Sunday night, President Aslan Maskhadov
said his opponents, led by former rebel leaders Salman Raduyev and
Shamil Basayev, ``are being manipulated by groups intent on
increasing tension in Chechnya and plunging the republic into
chaos,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Raduyev and Basayev, two field generals who played prominent
roles in Chechnya's 1994-96 independence battle from Russia, have
said Maskhadov should be prosecuted for crimes against the people
and should step down from his post.
	   But a commission convened to investigate their charges ruled
that Maskhadov has not violated Chechnya's constitution, ITAR-Tass
reported Monday.
	   Maskhadov also cited a recent endorsement of his foreign and
domestic policies by the Congress of the Chechen People, a
government-sponsored meeting, Interfax said.
	   ``The Chechen people did not support the generals, and they are
doomed to shame and rejection by the entire nation,'' Maskhadov
said in his TV address.
	   Maskhadov won a landslide election victory in January 1997, but
during his time in office, Chechnya has seen a steep rise in
kidnappings and other crimes.
	   No country has recognized Chechnya's claims of independence, and
Russia still considers it a semi-autonomous Russian republic.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO warplanes shifted closer
for possible NATO airstrikes, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
described the Kosovo standoff as an ``emergency'' on Monday and
demanded the Yugoslav leader end his crackdown.
	   Holbrooke returned to his hotel just before dawn Monday,
following an 11-hour session with President Slobodan Milosevic and
three hours on the telephone with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger.
	   Holbrooke described his meeting with Milosevic as ``intense,
indeed, and at times very heated.'' He said the standoff between
NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can only be called an
emergency.''
	   Holbrooke headed for Milosevic's offices shortly after 10 a.m.
(0800 GMT), and new talks were reported to have begun shortly
after.
	   NATO officials also met in Brussels, Belgium, first on an
informal level in the morning. An official conference was scheduled
for later in the day, which was expected to result in an
``activation order'' for NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia unless
diplomacy produces a breakthrough.
	   Foreign presence was being reduced in anticipation of NATO
action.
	   The international team of U.S., Russian and other diplomats
observing events in Kosovo over the past months was to drive out to
neighboring Macedonia later Monday. Sources at the American embassy
said all but 12 people would be evacuated from Belgrade to
Budapest.
	   The Germans were expected to do the same, while British embassy
staff was waiting for the outcome of the present
Holbrooke-Milosevic talks.

Palestinians say success of summit depends on Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A senior Palestinian negotiator says the
success of a peace summit this week near Washington depends on a
clear-cut ``yes'' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
an American initiative.
	   ``It is time to deliver,'' Saeb Erekat told reporters Sunday
night after a meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   Palestinians also were expressing growing unease over the naming
of hawkish former Israeli general Ariel Sharon as Netanyahu's
foreign minister.
	   Sharon, whose appointment last week was widely seen as a bid to
keep far-right allies from toppling Netanyahu's government, has
been quoted as saying he would refuse to shake the hand of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   ``It's worrisome,'' Erekat said. Previously, the Palestinian
leadership had said the appointment was an internal Israeli affair.
	   Monday was a Jewish holiday and there was no immediate Israeli
comment on summit prospects. However, the Israeli newspaper Yediot
Aharonot said over the weekend that Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet,
due meet Tuesday, was balking at agreeing to an American-authored
plan for an Israeli pullback in the West Bank.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians hope the four-day summit, set to
begin Thursday outside the U.S. capital, would mark the end of a
long round of meetings and the start of implementation of accords.
	   ``It depends on Mr. Netanyahu. If he says `yes' to the American
initiative and stops attempts to change the references of the
interim agreement, we will reach an agreement in no time,'' Erekat
said.
	   At the table is a U.S plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal from
13 percent from the West Bank. The Palestinians accepted the plan,
which includes security conditions they must fulfill.
	   The Israeli government has said it will only authorize
implementing any deal after the Palestinians take a series of
security-related steps including disarming militants and annulling
sections of the PLO charter.
	   In a statement issued after its meeting, the Palestinian Cabinet
said it stood by an Israel-Palestinian security memorandum reached
under American auspices in December 1997, calling on both sides to
deal with security in reciprocity.
	   ``Security cannot be separated from the peace process. Real
security comes through the implementation of the agreement,'' the
statement read.
	   Also on the summit agenda are sticky points such as a third
troop redeployment and outstanding issues such as the opening of a
Palestinian airport and port, and the status of Palestinian
prisoners.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO warplanes being moved
closer to Yugoslavia for possible airstrikes, U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke described the Kosovo standoff as an ``emergency'' on
Monday and demanded the Yugoslav leader end his crackdown.
	   Holbrooke returned to his hotel just before dawn Monday,
following an 11-hour session with President Slobodan Milosevic and
three hours on the telephone with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger.
	   Holbrooke described his meeting with Milosevic as ``intense,
indeed, and at times very heated.'' He said the standoff between
NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can only be called an
emergency.''
	   Holbrooke headed for Milosevic's offices shortly after 10 a.m.
(0800 GMT), and new talks were reported to have begun shortly
after.
	   NATO officials also met in Brussels, Belgium, first on an
informal level in the morning. An official conference was scheduled
for later in the day, which was expected to result in an
``activation order'' for NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia unless
diplomacy produces a breakthrough.
	   Foreign presence was being reduced in anticipation of NATO
action.
	   The international team of U.S., Russian and other diplomats
observing events in Kosovo over the past months was to drive out to
neighboring Macedonia later Monday. Sources at the American embassy
said all but 12 people would be evacuated from Belgrade to
Budapest.
	   The Germans were expected to do the same, while British embassy
staff was waiting for the outcome of the present
Holbrooke-Milosevic talks.

Four carmakers submit bids to buy bankrupt Kia Motors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. rejoined the bidding
for Kia Motors Corp. on Monday, submitting an offer for the
bankrupt firm in a third attempt by creditors to auction it off.
	   The U.S. auto giant joined three South Korean carmakers in the
bidding after sitting out the second failed auction because of
Kia's huge debts.
	   Also submitting bids were Samsung Motors, Inc., Daewoo Motor Co.
and Hyundai Motor Co.
	   All four participated in the first failed auction, but only the
South Korean firms submitted offers in the second round of bidding.
	   Both the first and second auctions were canceled after bidders
demanded bigger writeoffs of Kia's dlrs 8.4 billion debt than
creditor banks were willing to make.
	   The creditors bowed to those demands in the third auction,
saying they would award Kia to the bidder seeking the smallest
reduction of its debt if the difference between the first and
second-place bids is greater than dlrs 500 million.
	   If the difference is less than that, the creditors will take
other factors into consideration, including suggested terms of debt
repayments.
	   The move to sell Kia is part of the government's effort to
restructure its battered economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout
from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Kia's collapse last year helped erode investor confidence in
South Korea's industries, leading to a flight of capital.

France announces 12th case of mad cow disease this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities on Monday announced the
discovery of another cow infected with mad cow disease _ the 12th
case in France this year.
	   The Agriculture Ministry said the infected animal was a milk cow
born in 1994 at a farm in the Orne region, west of Paris.
Conforming to French regulation, the farm's 137 other cows were
slaughtered as well.
	   Since 1990, 43 cases of mad cow disease have been reported in
France, the ministry said.
	   The disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, was first
detected in 1985. The ailment eats holes in the brain, causing
cattle to stagger and drool. There is no cure.
	   Scientists believe the mad cow disease may be linked to an
equally fatal human brain ailment, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

	   The prize amount of 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) is divided
equally among the three.
	   Last year, the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the
University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of
prions, the rogue proteins identified as causing Mad Cow Disease.
	   Winners generally aren't known outside the medical community,
although the list of laureates contains a few familiar names
including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA
researchers Francis Crick and James Watson.
	   Generally, they are researchers who have made discoveries that
sound small on paper but carry large consequences.
	   Among other well-known names to receive the prize is David
Baltimore, although he shared the prize in 1975, long before
becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS researchers.
	   Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may
not be familiar names, but what they won the prize for in 1979 is a
term known by most patients: computer-assisted tomography _ or CAT
scan.
	   The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be
announced this year.
	   Last Thursday, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist
Jose Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the
economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and inventor of dynamite
whose will established the prizes.

Two more dead from Lesotho rally violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Two people died at a hospital here to
raise the death toll to three from violence at a ruling-party
rally, officials said Monday.
	   The victims had been beaten Sunday by supporters of the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy after a shot was fired by an
unidentified person.
	   The crowd believed the victims were opposition party supporters
who had infiltrated the rally and allegedly were trying to plant a
bomb, the South African Press Association reported.
	   Dr. Thabo McPherson, superintendent at Queen Elizabeth II
Hospital, said the two people died on Sunday night from severe head
injuries, SAPA reported.
	   A fourth person was in critical condition, also with serious
head injuries. Another person died at the scene.
	   The violence has raised tensions in the mountain kingdom of 2
million people within South Africa's borders.
	   After an army revolt and crippling strikes, South Africa and
nearby Botswana last month sent about 1,000 troops into the country
to restore calm, but scores were killed and the downtown destroyed
by looters.

Share prices surge on interest rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Shares prices in Hong Kong surged for the
second consecutive session Monday on expectations of cuts in both
local and U.S. interest rates.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 483.48 points, or 5.6
percent, to close at 8,990.27, its highest close since July 2. On
Friday, the index had soared 567.28 points.
	   Turnover also rose to 12.807 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 1.64 billion), up from Friday's 9.126 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.17 billion).
	   Dealers say investors are piling into the market on expectation
that the territory's banks will cut interest rates as early as this
week. Such hopes have set off a 12-percent rally in the index for
the past three sessions.
	   Hopes of yet another rate cut in the United States at the next
meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in mid-November are
also bringing institutional investors back, traders add.
	   ``There's more fear of being left out than buying high,'' said
Kent Rossiter, head of institutional sales at Nikko Securities Co.
Asia.
	   Monday's gains on the Tokyo stock market and on Wall Street
Friday also buoyed sentiments, traders said.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong rose 4.60 Hong Kong dollars to
45.90, and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 2.20 dollars to 37.50. In
the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 9.00 dollars to 155.50, and
Hang Seng Bank rose 2.25 dollars to 59.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 4.00 dollars 49.80, and Swire
Pacific ``A'' rose 45 cents to 27.80.

German Cabinet meets to back Kosovo strikes

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ With Germany's newly elected government not
yet in charge, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's outgoing Cabinet was
expected Monday to back possible NATO airstrikes in Kosovo.
	   Germany's role in any attack has been in question since the
left's election victory last month.
	   To avoid leaving a political vacuum, Outgoing Defense Minister
Volker Ruehe said last week that the Cabinet session will approve a
NATO order authorizing alliance military commanders to launch
airstrikes.
	   Kohl's government has also offered NATO 14 Tornado warplanes,
but their deployment _ a divisive issue for the incoming government
_ remains uncertain.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder met Kohl at the chancellery
Monday before the Cabinet session to coordinate policy. Kohl
formally remains in power until Schroeder takes office Oct. 27.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton held talks with Schroeder in
Washington on Friday and said afterwards that the chancellor-elect
had signaled Germany's support for the so-called activation order.
	   But sending German warplanes into combat requires a vote of
parliament, and the newly elected lower house won't convene until
Oct. 26. The old parliament could be called into session, but that
is seen as politically awkward.
	   The Greens party, Schroeder's future coalition partner, approves
NATO airstrikes but has rejected German participation in airstrikes
without a clear United Nations mandate.
	   Angelika Beer, the party's defense expert, warned the old
government in a newspaper interview published Monday against
pre-empting a decision on German participation in airstrikes.
	   Leaders of the Social Democrats and Greens were meeting later
Monday to hash out common foreign policy goals, one of the toughest
topics in forming a new center-left government.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro
and Ferid Murad of the United States on Monday won the Nobel
Medicine Prize.
	   They were given the prize for their discoveries concerning
nitric oxide as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system,
according to the citiation from the Karolinska lnstitute.
	   Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the State University of New
York in Brooklyn, Ignarro is at University of California-Los
Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas Medical School in
Houston.
	   The citation said ``it was a senation that the simple, common
air pollutant (nitric oxide), which is formed when nitrogen burns
... could exert important functions in the organism. ''
	   Because of the research, ``we know today that nitric oxide acts
as a signal molecule in the nervous system, as a weapon against
infections and as a regulator of blood pressure.''
	   The prize amount of 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) is divided
equally among the three.
	   Last year, the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the
University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of
prions, the rogue proteins identified as causing Mad Cow Disease.
	   Winners generally aren't known outside the medical community,
although the list of laureates contains a few familiar names
including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA
researchers Francis Crick and James Watson.
	   Generally, they are researchers who have made discoveries that

	   Among other well-known names to receive the prize is David
Baltimore, although he shared the prize in 1975, long before
becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS researchers.
	   Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may
not be familiar names, but what they won the prize for in 1979 is a

announced this year.
	   Last Thursday, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist
Jose Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the

death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and inventor of dynamite
whose will established the prizes.

Palestinians say success of summit depends on Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A senior Palestinian negotiator says the
success of a peace summit this week near Washington depends on a
clear-cut ``yes'' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
an American initiative.
	   ``It is time to deliver,'' Saeb Erekat told reporters Sunday
night after a meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met Jordan's Crown Prince
Hassan in Amman Monday to brief him on talks with U.S. officials on
breaking the deadlock in the negotiations with Israel.
	   Palestinians also were expressing growing unease over the naming
of hawkish former Israeli general Ariel Sharon as Netanyahu's
foreign minister.
	   Sharon, whose appointment last week was widely seen as a bid to
keep far-right allies from toppling Netanyahu's government, has
been quoted as saying he would refuse to shake the hand of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   ``It's worrisome,'' Erekat said. Previously, the Palestinian
leadership had said the appointment was an internal Israeli affair.
	   Monday was a Jewish holiday and there was no immediate Israeli
comment on summit prospects. However, the Israeli newspaper Yediot
Aharonot said over the weekend that Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet,
due to meet Tuesday, was balking at agreeing to an
American-authored plan for an Israeli pullback in the West Bank.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians hope the four-day summit, set to
begin Thursday outside the U.S. capital, would mark the end of a
long round of meetings and the start of implementation of accords.
	   ``It depends on Mr. Netanyahu. If he says `yes' to the American
initiative and stops attempts to change the references of the
interim agreement, we will reach an agreement in no time,'' Erekat
said.
	   At the table is a U.S plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal from
13 percent from the West Bank. The Palestinians accepted the plan,
which includes security conditions they must fulfill.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A search team on Russia's Sakhalin Island found a
helicopter Monday that had caught fire and gone down the day
before, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The Mi-2 helicopter was spotted from the air on Sakhalin,
located off Russia's Pacific coast, after a search team of more
than 130 soldiers, border guards, police and forest rangers began
hunting for it Monday morning.
	   The helicopter had been inspecting forest fires Sunday in a
northern part of the island when it caught fire and went down,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   When the search team arrived they found a note from the two crew
members saying they had headed to the nearest settlement. The crew
members were later found, uninjured, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The search for the helicopter, which belonged to the Vostok
airline, took longer than expected because of smoke from forest
fires still burning out of control in the region, ITAR-Tass said.

	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ With leading opposition groups
boycotting the vote, Azerbaijan's authoritarian leader looked
certain to be re-elected president by voters seeking stability and
long-elusive prosperity for their oil-rich Caspian Sea country.
	   Voters on Sunday chose between President Geidar Aliev, 75, and
five candidates close to the government, who are widely believed to
be running only to make the election seem competitive.
	   Opposition groups criticized an announcement by the Central
Election Commission that results would not be known for four days,
saying Aliev's government was delaying results so it could tamper
with the outcome.
	   An unidentified spokesman for Aliev's campaign headquarters said
that while ballots were still being counted ``it's already clear
that President Geidar Aliev has won,'' the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Turnout was high, with 78 percent of eligible voters casting
ballots, easily surpassing the 25 percent minimum turnout required
to validate the election, the central election commission reported.
	   Commission member Fuad Agayev said there were reports of
violations from several regions. In some cases, ballots were kept
outside polling stations and in Aliev's home Nakhichevan region,
the turnout was 100 percent _ an almost impossibility, Agayev said.
	   Other commission members disagreed with Agayev, who represents
one of Aliev's rivals, saying there were no serious violations.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO warplanes shifted closer
for possible NATO airstrikes, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
described the Kosovo standoff as an ``emergency'' on Monday and
demanded the Yugoslav leader end his crackdown.
	   After a rest of just a few hours, Holbrooke resumed talks with
President Slobodan Milosevic on defusing the Kosovo crisis and
avoiding threatened NATO airstrikes on Yugoslav military targets.
	   Holbrooke described his earlier overnight meeting with Milosevic
as ``intense, indeed, and at times very heated.'' He said the
standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can only be
called an emergency.''
	   NATO officials also met in Brussels, Belgium, first on an
informal level in the morning. An official conference was scheduled
for later in the day, which was expected to result in an
``activation order'' for NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia unless
diplomacy produces a breakthrough.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, which
could last ``several days.''
	   Foreign presence was being reduced in anticipation of NATO
action.
	   The last two vehicles of international team of U.S., Russian and
other diplomats observing events in Kosovo over the past months
left for neighboring Macedonia before midday, carrying Americans
and Europeans. Sources at the American embassy said all but 12
people would be evacuated from Belgrade to Budapest.
	   The German embassy was closed down Monday morning, said local
employees, speaking on condition of anonymity, while British
embassy staff were waiting for the outcome of the latest
Holbrooke-Milosevic talks.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A town in southern Russia has been sealed off
after 70 residents were diagnosed with dysentery over the weekend,
a news agency reported Monday.
	   Health care workers in Verkhny Balyklei, about 900 kilometers

Three Americans win Nobel Medicine Prize

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three American researchers on Monday
won the Nobel Medicine Prize for discovering how nitric oxide acts
as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system, a breakthrough
with applications ranging from hardening of the arteries to
impotence.
	   The prestigious prize went to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J.
Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the State
University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro is at University of
California-Los Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas
Medical School in Houston.
	   The citation by the Karolinska Institute said ``it was a
senation that the simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide),
which is formed when nitrogen burns ... could exert important
functions in the organism. ''
	   Because of the research, ``we know today that nitric oxide acts
as a signal molecule in the nervous system, as a weapon against
infections and as a regulator of blood pressure.''
	   ``Signal transmission by a gas that is produced by one cell,
penetrates through membranes and regulates the function of another
cell represents an entirely new principle,'' the citation said.
	   Understanding how nitric oxide transmits the signals has sparked
research on a wide range of new drugs, including those that can be
used in the treatment of heart problems, artherosclerosis, shock
and impotence.
	   The prize amount of 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) is divided
equally among the three.
	   Last year, the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the
University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of
prions, the rogue proteins identified as causing Mad Cow Disease.
	   Winners generally aren't known outside the medical community,
although the list of laureates contains a few familiar names
including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA
researchers Francis Crick and James Watson.
	   Generally, they are researchers who have made discoveries that
sound small on paper but carry large consequences.
	   Among other well-known names to receive the prize is David
Baltimore, although he shared the prize in 1975, long before
becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS researchers.
	   Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may
not be familiar names, but what they won the prize for in 1979 is a
term known by most patients: computer-assisted tomography _ or CAT
scan.
	   The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be
announced this year.
	   Last Thursday, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist
Jose Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the
economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and inventor of dynamite
whose will established the prizes.

Malaysia's Islamic party gaining support from Anwar's arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede. UPDATES with ruling party official confirming
defections. Picks up 5th graf pvs ``Mahathir's party ...''
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Discontent with Prime Minister
Mahathir's 17-year-rule is swelling the ranks of an Islamic group
that is leading the anti-government campaign and triggering
defections from the ruling party, a party official said Monday.
	   In the last month, the Parti Islamic SeMalaysia or PAS, a
conservative group, had enrolled 5,000 new members, said Subky
Latif, a spokesman. He said PAS was running out of application
forms.
	   The party's president, Fadzil Mohamad Nor said Sunday he had
received 500 applications from members of the ruling United Malays
National Organization.
	   An UMNO official Monday confirmed the defections. ``It is good
riddance, the party will become stronger after their departure,''
said Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar, who is in UMNO's managing
committee.
	   ``More people are supporting us now than ever before,'' said
Salahuddin Ayub, a PAS youth wing official.
	   Mahathir's party depends on the majority Malay Muslims for its
support, a constituency that PAS is now encroaching on.
	   More than half the country's 22 million people are Malay Muslims
who have traditionally voted UMNO to power since Malaysia became
independent in 1957.
	   PAS recently alarmed the government by winning a by-election in
the northern Perlis state in July. That victory gave the party a
total of 8 seats of 192 in parliament. UMNO has always controlled
more than two-thirds of the seats.
	   Mahathir has denied that UMNO's strength is being corroded by
the campaign set off by the firing and later arrest of his deputy
prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Malaysians were shocked when Anwar was arrested under the harsh
Internal Security Act and stunned weeks later when he appeared in
court with a black eye and body bruises, alleging police brutality.
	   Anwar, who faces trial on corruption and sexual misconduct
charges, has denied any wrongdoing. He says the charges are
politically motivated to silence him, at a time when he is emerging
as the biggest challenge against Mahathir.
	   Many Malaysians are angry. On city streets and rural roads
around the country, they have rallied by the thousands, shouting
``Mahathir resign!'' and demanding justice for Anwar.
	   Anwar's arrest has also been a catalyst for opposition unity.
PAS and other Muslim groups have for the first time allied with the
opposition Democratic Action Party, which is dominated by ethnic
Chinese.
	   ``Anwar held the promise of a new political tomorrow,'' said Lim
Kit Siang, the head of the DAP and Anwar's one time political foe.
``Now Anwar has become a symbol.''
	   The People's Justice Movement, with PAS and DAP as the major
components, has successfully organized rallies in defiance of
police bans.
	   Crowds of more than 10,000 have turned out to its rallies in
several parts of the country, where the group has demanded justice
for Anwar and an end to the Internal Security Act.

Russia: NATO airstrikes could lead to international chaos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Foreign Ministry saying recall of diplomats
open-ended, Russia continuing to lobby against airstrikes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ NATO airstrikes against Serbia could encourage
countries elsewhere to use force to solve disputes, Russia's
foreign minister said in pressing his country's opposition to
military action by the Western alliance.
	   ``That is very dangerous because we can enter a phase of
international chaos when states solve differences on borders with
their methods, the use of force,'' Igor Ivanov said.
	   He spoke Sunday on the Russian television program ``Zerkalo''
(Mirror).
	   Russia opposes possible NATO airstrikes a Serbia, a traditional
ally with which it shares a Slavic heritage and Orthodox religion.
	   It has recalled its representative to NATO and its ambassador to
Belgium, where NATO has its headquarters, for consultations.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Chizov said their return will
depend on developments, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
	   Chizov, director of the Foreign Ministry's Third European
Department, said Russia is staying in touch with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and members of the Contact Group on Yugoslavia.
	   The fact that U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke is still holding
talks in Belgrade suggests that an agreement is still possible,
Chizov said.
	   ``If Holbrooke reaches a political settlement acceptable to
Belgrade, we will most probably support it,'' he said.
	   Ivanov said Russia was still considering how it would respond if
NATO went ahead with the airstrikes to force Serbia to end its
violent crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province.
	   Ivanov said Sunday in Uzbekistan, where he is accompanying
President Boris Yeltsin on an official visit, that a Russian
military response was ``out of the question.''
	   ``We continue to believe and not only to believe but also to do
everything to prevent the worst,'' he said on TV.

Iran accuses United States of trying to increase Gulf tension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The United States is trying to increase
tension between Iran and its Arab neighbors in the Gulf, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying Monday.
	   The spokesman, Mahmoud Mohammadi, was reacting to U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen's comments that it was imperative for
American allies in the Gulf to acquire missile defense systems to
counter weapons in the hands of Iran and Iraq.
	   ``Washington, following its backward policies, is trying to
foment tension in the region now that suitable grounds have been
established for cooperation among the Islamic nations of the
region,'' Iran News quoted Mohammadi as saying.
	   An Iraqi newspaper also criticized Cohen's comments.
	   ``We find the American defense minister in a new tour in the
region coming out with silly, unexplained and strange threats,''
said Al-Thawra, the newspaper of Iraq's ruling party.
	   Cohen told reporters Saturday in Bahrain that the United States
would share its missile technology with Gulf allies because of the
proliferation of missile technology in the Gulf.
	   The United States sees Iraq and Iran, which recently tested a
long-range missile, as major threats to the Gulf region.
	   Cohen said Iraq, which has been under U.N. sanctions since 1990,
continues efforts to acquire missile technology that would give
weapons a longer range than they are permitted to have.
	   Cohen was in Bahrain as part of a six-nation Gulf tour, which
includes the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

World economic woes, budget wrangle dominate EU finance talks

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting underway; quotes from Irish minister, EU
Commissioner; loans for Russia unlikely; EDITS to conform &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The turmoil on world markets, a battle over
the European Union's budget and the economic impact of Italy's
government crisis dominated Monday's meeting of EU finance
ministers.
	   The meeting came as slower growth rates and fears of more gloom
spreading from Asia, Russia and South America take some of the
shine off preparations for the launch of the euro as the common
currency of 11 EU nations on Jan. 1.
	   So far, the Europe has avoided the worst of the global crisis,
and EU's Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy predicted at
the start of the meeting ``in 1999 Europe will have the best growth
among the industrial powers.''
	   However, ministers face mounting pressure for action to halt any
further decline in growth, including calls for interest rate cuts
to help business.
	   Last week, the Spanish, Irish, Portuguese and British central
banks eased rates, but EU central bankers and a number of ministers
believe rates are low enough in core European economies such as
Germany and France.
	   ``The problem of bringing down rates is not one for Europe,''
said Irish Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy.
	   Apart from interest rates, ministers were expected to discuss
the impact for Europe of the dollar's recent tumble and proposals
for strengthening international financial institutions to prevent
future outbreaks of global turbulence.
	   ``We've got to contribute to maintaining the conditions for
growth and stability round the world,'' Britain's Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown told BBC television Sunday. ``My European
colleagues ... must share responsibility for creating these
conditions.''
	   The ministers were likely to reject a proposal for the EU to
back loans to Russia by the Union's lending arm, the European
Investment Bank.
	   ``In the present situation in Russia ... it would not be serious
to give the EU budget guarantee to an EIB intervention in Russia,''
De Silguy told reporters.
	   The one-day EU meeting should be the last for German Finance
Minister Theo Waigel. Defeat in last month's elections means the
Bavarian conservative is stepping down after almost 10 years at the
helm of the EU's biggest economy.
	   As a parting shot, Waigel is likely to knock home Germany's
tough line over plans to overhaul the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget
from 2000 so the Union can pay for it's planned expansion into
eastern Europe.
	   Germany, along with Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, says it
pays too much into EU coffers and gets too little back in return.
They insist any reform correct the imbalance.
	   Since the incoming center-left government of chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder is expected to continue to defend Germany's
stance, the budget wrangling is expected to drag on for months.
	   Italy's Carlo Azeglio Ciampi may also be making his last
appearance at a gathering of EU finance ministers, following the
fall of the center-left government in Rome Friday.
	   Other ministers looked for assurances that whoever leads the
next government _ perhaps Ciampi himself as caretaker prime
minister _ will continue Italy's efforts to cut debt and budget
deficit.
	   ``I have no reason to believe that Italy won't continue to honor
its pledges,'' De Silguy said.

 &UR; Philippine president urges deeper ties with Singapore in first trip
abroad
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Singapore prime minister Goh urging Estrada to
attend APEC meeting despite Anwar's arrest in first 7 grafs; trims

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada, on his
first overseas trip, met Monday with Singapore's leaders and called
for more cooperation between the once-estranged countries.
	   ``My decision to visit Singapore first was right ... as our
relations are very important,'' Estrada said.
	   He said he and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong shared ``a
strong commitment'' to strengthening cooperation between the two
countries.
	   Goh also urged Estrada to attend a meeting of Asia-Pacific
leaders in Malaysia despite the arrest of former Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, a Philippine official said.
	   Estrada, who considers Anwar a friend, said in a radio interview
Saturday that we was still deciding whether to attend the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting in November because
of the treatment Anwar has received.
	   Goh ``said he understood the president's feeling, but urged him
to attend, saying it was important for the region,'' said the
Philippine official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Estrada is to meet Tuesday afternoon with Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie, who has also expressed concern over Anwar's arrest.
	   Estrada, on his first trip abroad since assuming the presidency
in June, was also scheduled to deliver a keynote address Tuesday at
the East Asia Economic Summit sponsored by the World Economic
Forum.
	   Singapore is the Philippines' third-largest trading partner,
with total trade reaching dlrs 3.8 billion last year. Singapore
also is the fourth-largest importer of Philippine products and an
important investor.
	   Estrada said the two countries enjoy a balanced trade
relationship, adding that Philippine businessmen are now investing
in Singapore in larger numbers to take advantage of Singapore's
``dynamic competitiveness.''
	   In a meeting Monday with Singaporean and Philippine businessmen,
Estrada, who won the presidency by appealing to the poor and the
disenchanted, reiterated his promise to transform the country
economically without neglecting the poor.
	   ``We are pro-market, pro-investment, pro-competition,'' he said,
``but we will not forget safety nets for the marginalized sectors
of the society.''
	   Estrada on Sunday met with some of about 100,000 Filipino women
who work as domestic helpers in Singapore and praised them as
saviors of the Philippine economy. Overseas Filipino workers are
expected to send home more than dlrs 6 billion this year through
official channels, and much more through other means.
	   Relations between the two countries were hurt in 1995, when
Singapore convicted Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino maid, of killing
another Filipino maid and a young Singaporean boy she cared for.
	   Singapore insists Contemplacion confessed, but many Filipinos
believe she was a victim of injustice. Mass protests forced the
Philippine government to withdraw its ambassador, and Singapore
responded by doing the same.
	   Relations were normalized in 1996 with the exchange of new
ambassadors.

Italian president begins consultations to form new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Three days after the collapse of Premier Romano
Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president began calling in
political leaders Monday to try to reach a consensus on a new
government.
	   Following the talks, which are expected to last several days,
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi to try again with a
new majority. He could also name a new premier, or appoint a
government of technocrats.
	   If Scalfaro feels no candidate is capable of mustering a
majority, he could call early elections. Because the president
cannot dissolve Parliament during the last six weeks of his term,
elections would have to be scheduled by December.
	   Scalfaro has named Prodi as caretaker premier for the interim.
	   Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoked the
crisis when it withdrew support for the government over the 1999
deficit-cutting budget, which it said did not do enough to
stimulate job creation. Despite help from a breakaway faction of
the Communists, who on Sunday formed a new party, Prodi lost
Friday's vote of confidence by a single vote.
	   Prodi has said he won't take the job back unless his new
government could stick to the policies of its old one, an unlikely
scenario given the divided Parliament.
	   An alternative to Prodi could be Massimo D'Alema, leader of the
Democrats of the Left, the largest party in Prodi's coalition.
	   In the case of a so-called ``technical'' government, the names
of Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini have been circulated. A government of technicians
would get Italy through the volatile period of approving the 1999
budget and the launch of the common European currency, the euro, in
January 1999.
	   Prodi presided over cost cuts that got Italy into the debut of
the European Monetary Union, outlasting all but one other
post-World War II Italian government in the process.

Ukrainian miner killed in rock collapse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Pieces of coal fell in a deep mine shaft in
eastern Ukraine on Monday, killing a miner, officials said.
	   The accident occurred at the depth of 540 meters (1,782 feet) at
the Olkhovatska mine in the coal-rich Donetsk region, the Emergency
Situations Ministry reported.
	   At least 302 people have died in coal mine accidents in Ukraine
so far this year, about 100 more than the same period last year,
according to government statistics.
	   Ukraine's cash-strapped mines lack the funds needed to improve
safety conditions and modernize equipment, which has led to a
steady increase in work-related fatalities in recent years.
	   The worst single accident this year was in April, when a methane
gas blast killed 63 workers at a mine in Donetsk.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ When fighting started eight months
ago, she stopped going to the cafes. Stayed home every night with
her parents. Too sad, too depressed. Now, with NATO threatening
airstrikes against the Serbs, Jehona is out every night. Drinking
with her friends. Nervous but excited, too. At last: It might be
the end.
	   Cafes form the social heart of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo
province. Like everything else, they are segregated: Serbs have
their cafes, Albanians have theirs. And these days, the Albanian
cafes are packed with young people like Jehona, not celebrating
exactly but more blowing off steam, soothing their nerves and
waiting for something to happen.
	   ``Everyone is going out,'' says Jehona, 25, her brown eyes
shining as she lights a cigarette and waits for her beer. ``It's
crazy! Maybe they're drinking to forget, or going out to see
friends. Everyone is waiting for D-Day. Maybe tonight is the last
night.''
	   ``If I die, so what? I had a beautiful 22 years living in this
repression,'' says her friend Ilir, laughing.
	   They hope NATO will pressure President Slobodan Milosevic into
giving independence to Kosovo, a southern province in the Serbian
republic that dominates Yugoslavia. They also hope that if NATO
drops bombs, Serbs won't attack them in the streets as they say
they will.
	    &UR; ___
	   Serb cafe owner Predrag Ilic unfolds a large black leather
wallet, takes out a pistol and lays it on the glossy, chrome-rimmed
bar. Next, he reaches behind the bar and pulls out a grenade, lays
it next to the gun.
	   Sure, he has Albanian neighbors. Plenty of Serbs in Pristina do.
They can't help it. More Serbs live here than anywhere else in
Kosovo, 60,000 out of the population of 200,000. The two groups
exist on top of each other in the congested, hilly streets. But the
mingling stops there.
	   Separate bars. Separate stores. Separate schools. Albanians and
Serbs even have separate taxi services.
	   What would happen if an Albanian, even one of his neighbors,
stepped into Ilic's cafe?
	   He draws a finger across his neck.
	   ``Albanians like me,'' he says. ``But I want to kill them all.''
	   While ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, many of
the Serbs are armed to the teeth, in keeping with Balkans
tradition. And they are not shy about using those guns. Weddings,
elections, even basketball and soccer victories are celebrated with
volleys of gunfire out of apartment and car windows.
	   And those are happy occasions. If the Serbs are bombed, they
make no secret they will go into the streets to seek revenge the
instant NATO acts.
	   Serb accountant Miso Perovic, wearing jeans, was relaxing at a
Serb cafe Sunday when a question about NATO arose. His answer was
matter-of-fact.
	   ``I have four rifles,'' he said. ``Whatever happens, I'll go
straight to kill the first Albanian I find.''
	   The 30-year-old Serb cop sitting next to him was no less sure
what he'll do when the first bombs fall.
	   ``My grandfather rescued American pilots in 1944,'' said the
policeman, who gave his name as Stevo. ``I'm going to kill the
first American pilot I can lay my hands on.''
	    &UR; ___
	   Albanians aren't the only ones worried. Foreigners are also a
target, their situation worsening by the day.
	   Diplomats and humanitarian organizations have been packed and
ready to go for days, and many are already leaving. On Monday,
American, Russian and European observers monitoring Kosovo over the
last few months pulled out for neighboring Macedonia.
	   One coming flashpoint of Serb anger is the Grand Hotel, where
journalists from several NATO countries are staying: Italians,
Britons, Americans and others.
	   Every night, a crowd of drunks gathers outside. They scream
obscentities at the journalists inside, threatening to kill them
and smash their cars. Eventually they are chased away by official
and secret Serb police, stationed at the hotel to keep an eye on
the foreigners.
	   One blond Dutch journalist even went so far as to buy a bottle
of black hair dye so he could attract less attention on the street.
	    &UR; ___
	   There was a sense of hostility in Kosovo even before 1989, when
Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy and ethnic Albanians started
talking about independence.
	   The separate Serb and Albanian societies moved apart, and the
anger between the two sides grew hotter and hotter until it
exploded into war this year.
	   Now NATO threats, designed to force Milosevic to give the
Albanians back their autonomy, have strained this divided society
to the breaking point.
	   ``We were mixed before,'' says a 46-year-old Serb schoolteacher
who asks to remain anonymous, shaking her head. ``But after all
this, I don't know if we could be together again.''

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro
and Ferid Murad of the United States won the Nobel Medicine Prize
Monday for discoveries that shed light on the cardiovascular
system.
	   They discovered how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule for
the body's blood vessels, a breakthrough with applications ranging
from hardening of the arteries to impotence.
	   Understanding how nitric oxide transmits the signals has sparked
research on a wide range of new drugs, including those that can be
used in the treatment of heart problems, atherosclerosis, shock and
impotence.
	   Because of their work, ``we know today that nitric oxide acts as
a signal molecule in the nervous system, as a weapon against
infections and as a regulator of blood pressure,'' said the
citation from the Karolinska lnstitute.
	   Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the State University of New
York in Brooklyn, Ignarro is at University of California-Los
Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas Medical School in
Houston.
	   The citation said ``it was a sensation that the simple, common
air pollutant (nitric oxide), which is formed when nitrogen burns
... could exert important functions in the organism.''
	   ``It's great news,'' said Dr. Gerald Levey, dean of the UCLA
School of Medicine. ``We were hoping he (Ignarro) would win it. We
thought he had a strong chance to win. It's well deserved.''
	   The 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) prize is divided equally
among the three.
	   Last year, the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the
University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of
prions, the rogue proteins identified as causing Mad Cow Disease.
	   Winners generally aren't known outside the medical community,
although the list of laureates contains a few familiar names
including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA
researchers Francis Crick and James Watson.
	   Generally, they are researchers who have made discoveries that
sound small on paper but carry large consequences.
	   Among other well-known names to receive the prize is David
Baltimore, although he shared the prize in 1975, long before
becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS researchers.
	   Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may
not be familiar names, but what they won the prize for in 1979 is a
term known by most patients: computer-assisted tomography _ or CAT
scan.
	   The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be
announced this year.
	   Last week, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist Jose
Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the
economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and inventor of dynamite
whose will established the prizes.

Four carmakers submit bids to buy bankrupt Kia Motors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: RESTORES dropped word ``dlrs'' in 4th graf

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. rejoined the bidding
for Kia Motors Corp. on Monday, submitting an offer for the
bankrupt firm in a third attempt by creditors to auction it off.
	   The U.S. auto giant joined three South Korean car makers in the
third round of bidding for Kia after sitting out the second failed
auction because of Kia's huge debts.
	   Also submitting bids were Samsung Motors, Inc., Daewoo Motor Co.
and Hyundai Motor Co. They and Ford participated in the first
failed auction, but only the South Korean firms submitted offers in
the second round of bidding.
	   Both the first and second auctions were canceled after all
bidders demanded bigger writeoffs of Kia's dlrs 8.4 billion debt
than creditor banks were willing to make.
	   The creditors bowed to those demands in the third auction,
saying they would award Kia to the bidder seeking the smallest
reduction of its debt if the difference between the first and
second-place bids is greater than dlrs 500 million.
	   If the difference is less than that, the creditors will take
other factors into consideration, including suggested terms of debt
repayments.
	   The move to sell Kia is part of the government's effort to
restructure its battered economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout
from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Kia's collapse last year helped erode investor confidence in
South Korea's industries, leading to a flight of capital.

Iran accuses United States of trying to increase Gulf tension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The United States is trying to increase
tension between Iran and its Arab neighbors in the Gulf, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying Monday.
	   The spokesman, Mahmoud Mohammadi, was reacting to U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen's comments that it was imperative for
American allies in the Gulf to acquire missile defense systems to
counter weapons in the hands of Iran and Iraq.
	   ``Washington, following its backward policies, is trying to
foment tension in the region now that suitable grounds have been
established for cooperation among the Islamic nations of the
region,'' Iran News quoted Mohammadi as saying.
	   An Iraqi newspaper also criticized Cohen's comments.
	   ``We find the American defense minister in a new tour in the
region coming out with silly, unexplained and strange threats,''
said Al-Thawra, the newspaper of Iraq's ruling party.
	   Cohen told reporters Saturday in Bahrain that the United States
would share its missile technology with Gulf allies because of the
proliferation of missile technology in the Gulf.
	   The United States sees Iraq and Iran, which recently tested a
long-range missile, as major threats to the Gulf region.
	   Cohen said Iraq, which has been under U.N. sanctions since 1990,
continues efforts to acquire missile technology that would give
weapons a longer range than they are permitted to have.
	   Cohen was in Bahrain as part of a six-nation Gulf tour, which
includes the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

World economic woes, budget wrangle dominate EU finance talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting underway; quotes from Irish minister, EU
Commissioner; loans for Russia unlikely; EDITS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The turmoil on world markets, a battle over
the European Union's budget and the economic impact of Italy's
political crisis dominated Monday's meeting of EU finance
ministers.
	   The meeting came as slower growth rates and fears of more gloom
spreading from Asia, Russia and South America take some of the
shine off preparations for the launch of the euro as the common
currency of 11 EU nations on Jan. 1.
	   So far, Europe has avoided the worst of the global crisis. EU's
Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy predicted at the start
of the meeting ``in 1999 Europe will have the best growth among the
industrial powers.''
	   However, ministers face mounting pressure to halt any further
decline in growth, including calls for interest rate cuts to help
business.
	   Last week, the Spanish, Irish, Portuguese and British central
banks eased rates, but EU central bankers and a number of ministers
believe rates are low enough in core European economies such as
Germany and France.
	   ``The problem of bringing down rates is not one for Europe,''
said Irish Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy.
	   Apart from interest rates, ministers were expected to discuss
the impact for Europe of the dollar's recent tumble and proposals
for strengthening international financial institutions to prevent
future outbreaks of global turbulence.
	   ``We've got to contribute to maintaining the conditions for
growth and stability around the world,'' Britain's Chancellor of
the Exchequer Gordon Brown told BBC television Sunday. ``My
European colleagues ... must share responsibility for creating
these conditions.''
	   The ministers were likely to reject a proposal for the EU to
back loans to Russia by the Union's lending arm, the European
Investment Bank.
	   ``In the present situation in Russia ... it would not be serious
to give the EU budget guarantee to an EIB intervention in Russia,''
De Silguy told reporters.
	   The one-day EU meeting should be the last for German Finance
Minister Theo Waigel. Defeat in last month's elections means the
Bavarian conservative is stepping down after almost 10 years at the
helm of the EU's biggest economy.
	   As a parting shot, Waigel is likely to knock home Germany's
tough line over plans to overhaul the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget
from 2000 so the Union can pay for it's planned expansion into
eastern Europe.
	   Germany, along with Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, says it
pays too much into EU coffers and gets too little back in return.
They insist any reform correct the imbalance.
	   Since the incoming center-left government of chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder is expected to continue to defend Germany's
stance, the budget wrangling is expected to drag on for months.
	   Italy's Carlo Azeglio Ciampi may also be making his last
appearance at a gathering of EU finance ministers, following the
fall of the center-left government in Rome Friday.
	   Other ministers looked for assurances that whoever leads the
next government _ perhaps Ciampi himself as caretaker prime
minister _ will continue Italy's efforts to cut debt and budget
deficit.
	   ``I have no reason to believe that Italy won't continue to honor
its pledges,'' De Silguy said.

Three Americans win Nobel Medicine Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to ADD details, background, CORRECT typo in
'sensation' in 3rd graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three American researchers on Monday
won the Nobel Medicine Prize for discovering how nitric oxide acts
as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system, a breakthrough
with applications ranging from treating hardening of the arteries
to impotence.
	   The prestigious prize went to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J.
Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the State
University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro is at University of
California-Los Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas
Medical School in Houston.
	   The citation by the Karolinska Institute said ``it was a
sensation that the simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide),
which is formed when nitrogen burns ... could exert important
functions in the organism. ''
	   ''Signal transmission by a gas that is produced by one cell,
penetrates through membranes and regulates the function of another
cell represents an entirely new principle,'' the citation said.
	   Understanding how nitric oxide transmits the signals has sparked
research on a wide range of new drugs, including those that can be
used in the treatment of heart problems, artherosclerosis, shock
and impotence.
	   Studies of the gas have also shown that white blood cells use it
to kill infectious agents such as bacteria and parasites, and that
it also can defend against tumors. This has led to tests to see
whether nitric oxide could be used to halt tumor growth.
	   The prize amount of 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) is divided
equally among the three.
	   The three laureates' discovery touches on the personal life of
Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite
who estanlished the prizes in his will.
	   In later life, Nobel's physician told him to take nitroglycerin
_ one of the ingredients in dynamite _ to combat heart trouble.
``However, it would take 100 years until it was clarified that
nitroglycerin acts by releasing nitrci oxide gas,'' the citation
noted.
	   Last year, the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the
University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of
prions, the rogue proteins identified as causing Mad Cow Disease.
	   Winners generally aren't known outside the medical community,
although the list of laureates contains a few familiar names
including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA
researchers Francis Crick and James Watson.
	   The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be
announced this year.
	   Last Thursday, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist
Jose Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the
economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Nobel.

	   On Saturday, a hard-line Iranian student group offered 1 billion
rials (dlrs 333,333) to anyone who kills Rushdie.
	   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa, or religious
edict, on Rushdie in 1989. The issue has long strained ties between
Iran and the West, in particular Britain.
	   Powerful government hard-liners, dismayed over Khatami's efforts
to improve ties with the West since he took office last year, were
not happy with the new government position on Rushdie.
	   Earlier this month, more than half of Iran's hard-line
parliament signed a letter saying the death sentence stands.
	   Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini
issued the edict. He recently voiced relief the ordeal was over.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An explosive device in the southern Russian town
of Petrov Val killed an 8-year-old boy and seriously injured
another, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Monday.
	   The device exploded when the two boys were playing with a green
object they had found in a ravine, said a third boy who left before
the blast took place.
	   Police in the nearby city of Volgograd, 900 kilometers (550
miles) southeast of Moscow, were called in to investigate.

	   On Saturday, a hard-line Iranian student group offered 1 billion
rials (dlrs 333,000) to anyone who kills Rushdie.
	   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa, or religious
edict, on Rushdie in 1989. The issue has long strained ties between
Iran and the West, in particular Britain.
	   Powerful government hard-liners, dismayed over Khatami's efforts
to improve ties with the West since he took office last year, were
not happy with the new government position on Rushdie.
	   Earlier this month, more than half of Iran's hard-line
parliament signed a letter saying the death sentence stands.
	   Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini
issued the edict. He recently voiced relief the ordeal was over.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ When fighting started eight months
ago, she stopped going to the cafes. Stayed home every night with
her parents. Too sad, too depressed.
	   Now, with NATO threatening airstrikes against the Serbs, Jehona
is out every night. Drinking with her friends. Nervous but excited,
too. At last, it might be the end.
	   Cafes form the social heart of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo
province. Like everything else, they are segregated: Serbs have
their cafes, Albanians have theirs. And these days, the Albanian
cafes are packed with young people like Jehona, not celebrating
exactly but more blowing off steam, soothing their nerves and
waiting for something to happen.
	   ``Everyone is going out,'' says Jehona, 25, her brown eyes
shining as she lights a cigarette and waits for her beer. ``It's
crazy! Maybe they're drinking to forget, or going out to see
friends. Everyone is waiting for D-Day. Maybe tonight is the last
night.''
	   ``If I die, so what? I had a beautiful 22 years living in this
repression,'' says her friend Ilir, laughing.
	   They hope NATO will pressure President Slobodan Milosevic into
giving independence to Kosovo, a southern province in the Serbian
republic that dominates Yugoslavia. They also hope that if NATO
drops bombs, Serbs won't attack them in the streets as they say
they will.
	    &UR; ___
	   Serb cafe owner Predrag Ilic unfolds a large black leather
wallet, takes out a pistol and lays it on the glossy, chrome-rimmed
bar. Next, he reaches behind the bar and pulls out a grenade, lays
it next to the gun.
	   Sure, he has Albanian neighbors. Plenty of Serbs in Pristina do.
They can't help it. More Serbs live here than anywhere else in
Kosovo, 60,000 out of the population of 200,000. The two groups
exist on top of each other in the congested, hilly streets. But the
mingling stops there.
	   Separate bars. Separate stores. Separate schools. Albanians and
Serbs even have separate taxi services.
	   What would happen if an Albanian, even one of his neighbors,
stepped into Ilic's cafe?
	   He draws a finger across his neck.
	   ``Albanians like me,'' he says. ``But I want to kill them all.''
	   While ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, many of
the Serbs are armed to the teeth, in keeping with Balkans
tradition. And they are not shy about using those guns. Weddings,
elections, even basketball and soccer victories are celebrated with
volleys of gunfire out of apartment and car windows.
	   And those are happy occasions. If the Serbs are bombed, they
make no secret they will go into the streets to seek revenge the
instant NATO acts.
	   Serb accountant Miso Perovic, wearing jeans, was relaxing at a
Serb cafe Sunday when a question about NATO arose. His answer was
matter-of-fact.
	   ``I have four rifles,'' he said. ``Whatever happens, I'll go
straight to kill the first Albanian I find.''
	   The 30-year-old Serb cop sitting next to him was no less sure
what he'll do when the first bombs fall.
	   ``My grandfather rescued American pilots in 1944,'' said the
policeman, who gave his name as Stevo. ``I'm going to kill the
first American pilot I can lay my hands on.''
	    &UR; ___
	   Albanians aren't the only ones worried. Foreigners are also a
target, their situation worsening by the day.
	   Diplomats and humanitarian organizations have been packed and
ready to go for days, and many are already leaving. On Monday,
American, Russian and European observers monitoring Kosovo over the
last few months pulled out for neighboring Macedonia.
	   One coming flashpoint of Serb anger is the Grand Hotel, where
journalists from several NATO countries are staying: Italians,
Britons, Americans and others.
	   Every night, a crowd of drunks gathers outside. They scream
obscentities at the journalists inside, threatening to kill them
and smash their cars. Eventually they are chased away by official
and secret Serb police, stationed at the hotel to keep an eye on
the foreigners.
	   One blond Dutch journalist even went so far as to buy a bottle
of black hair dye so he could attract less attention on the street.
	    &UR; ___
	   There was a sense of hostility in Kosovo even before 1989, when
Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy and ethnic Albanians started
talking about independence.
	   The separate Serb and Albanian societies moved apart, and the
anger between the two sides grew hotter and hotter until it
exploded into war this year.
	   Now NATO threats, designed to force Milosevic to give the
Albanians back their autonomy, have strained this divided society
to the breaking point.
	   ``We were mixed before,'' says a 46-year-old Serb schoolteacher
who asks to remain anonymous, shaking her head. ``But after all
this, I don't know if we could be together again.''

Activists from Japan, two Koreas agree on sex slave issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Activists from Japan and both North
and South Korea have banded together to jointly urge Japan to
compensate women forced into sexual slavery in World War II.
	   Twenty-one leaders of women's groups from the three countries
met in Beijing over the weekend and issued a joint statement
condemning Japan for an ``unbearable debasement'' of women.
	   The statement was made available in Seoul Monday by Yang
Mi-kang, secretary general of the Korean Council for the Women
Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan.
	   ``The meeting created a basis for the three parties to further
cooperate and jointly deal with the issue,'' said Yang, who
attended the conference.
	   ``It is an unbearable debasement of women's human rights... that
the Japanese government neither recognizes its legal responsibility
nor apologizes to the women,'' their joint statement said.
	   The statement, among other things, urged Japan to stop trying to
compensate the former sex slaves through private donations and
address the issue by mentioning it in Japan's history textbooks.
	   Yang said it was the first time that activist groups from the
three countries had met to discuss the issue. Japanese and South
Korean women's groups had discussed the issue several times, but
never with their North Korean counterparts.
	   The three parties, Yang said, agreed to send a petition to the
U.N. Human Rights Commission later this month, asking it to
intervene to resolve the issue.
	   Historians estimate that as many as 200,000 women from Korea and
other Asian nations were taken to Japanese army brothels during
World War II.
	   Most of those sex slaves were from Korea, which was a colony of
Japan from 1910 to 1945. Some 150 South Koreans are registered as
former sex slaves.
	   Japan set up the private Asia Women's Fund in 1995 to dole out
financial assistance to the women, which it euphemistically refers
to as comfort women.
	   But the fund's offer of dlrs 17,000 to each surviving victim was
rejected by most South Koreans, who demand that any compensation
come directly from the Japanese government.

Iranian foundation raises reward for killing Rushdie

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian foundation has added dlrs 300,000
to the reward for Salman Rushdie's death, just weeks after the
Iranian government tried to distance itself from the bounty.
	   The move was a striking show of the infighting within Iran's
fractured government between hard-liners and moderates gathered
around President Mohammad Khatami, who has sought to improve ties
with the West since he assumed office last year.
	   ``I, as the head of the Khordad Foundation, add dlrs 300,000 to
the reward for implementing the edict,'' Ayatollah Hassan Saneii
was quoted as saying by Jomhuri Islami newspaper Monday.
	   The semiofficial foundation had initially offered dlrs 2.5
million to anyone who killed the British author, whose book ``The
Satanic Verses'' was claimed by Iran to be blasphemous to Islam.
	   The comments by Saneii were the first by the foundation since
Iran's government distanced itself last month from the death edict,
helping improve relations with Britain. Saneii is the
representative of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in
the foundation.
	   ``To set a reward for killing Salman Rushdie has been a great
honor for this foundation and we will keep this honor. We should
not let this issue be forgotten,'' Saneii said.
	   On Saturday, a hard-line Iranian student group offered 1 billion
rials (dlrs 333,333) to anyone who kills Rushdie.
	   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa, or religious
edict, on Rushdie in 1989. The issue has long strained ties between
Iran and the West, in particular Britain.
	   Powerful government hard-liners, dismayed over Khatami's efforts
to improve ties with the West since he took office last year, were
not happy with the new government position on Rushdie.
	   Earlier this month, more than half of Iran's hard-line
parliament signed a letter saying the death sentence stands.
	   Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini
issued the edict. He recently voiced relief the ordeal was over.

four-day trip to promote women's rights in Eastern Europe, Mrs.
Clinton met with businesswomen at a Sofia bakery and discussed the
challenges of running a business in the new Bulgaria.
	   ``We're very impressed by the reform effort and the difficult
decisions that your government is making on behalf of the future,''
she told the women.
	   Mrs. Clinton also accepted an offer to allow her book ``It Takes
a Village'' to be translated and published into Bulgarian.
Businesswoman Iren Komitova suggested the proceeds go to the
American University in Bulgaria's southwestern city of Blagoevgrad.
	   After talking with students at the American College of Sofia,
the first lady flew later Monday to Prague to meet with Czech
leaders and speak at a conference organized by President Vaclav
Havel and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel.
	   Mrs. Clinton met with some 500 students at the American College
of Sofia, where she also toured the school, talked to teachers and
alumni and looked at their computer laboratory.
	   ``I saw the future of Bulgaria in the eyes of the brilliant and
dynamic students I met at the American College of Sofia,'' she
said. ``That school is but one example of the ties of trade,
investment, culture and friendship between our two countries.''
	   The college, established in 1860 while Bulgaria was still under
Turkish rule, was closed down by the communists in 1948 shortly
after they came to power. College alumni were persecuted, but the
school's book collection was preserved at the local monastery and
the college was resurrected in 1992.
	   Mrs. Clinton presented the college with 100 volumes of the
Library of America, containing the best works of famous American
writers, historians, philosophers and statesmen.
	   The students presented her with a book entitled ``Heroines of
History'' that contains a chapter about her.
	   On her first day in Bulgaria, far from the pressures of
Washington and talk of her husband's impeachment, Mrs. Clinton on
Sunday announced new American aid grants and posed for pictures
with former street children.
	   ``It is a great pleasure for me to be in a country well known
for its tolerance,'' she told one audience. ``In comparison to many
other transition countries, Bulgaria sets quite an example.''
	   A popular figure abroad, she shook hands with some 50 local
people and was cheered by foreign tourists.
	   ``She is a nice strong lady because she stands by her husband
and defends him,'' said Ivan Ivanov, 28, one of the bystanders who
turned out for a glimpse of the first lady.

Asian markets rally on growing optimism that worst is over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures for all markets
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply higher
Monday, boosted by the passage of legislation in the Japanese
parliament to help the country's ailing banks.
	   Asian bourses were also boosted by Wall Street's 2.17 percent
gain Friday, and hopes of a fresh round of global interest rate
cuts.
	   Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average rose 675.04 points, or
5.24 percent, closing at 13,555.01. On Friday, the index had
tumbled 146.09 points, or 1.12 percent, finishing at 12,879.97 _
its lowest finish since December 1985.
	   Share prices surged in the afternoon after Japan's upper house
of Parliament passed a package of bills to create a framework to
deal with banks that have failed.
	   The package already passed the more powerful lower house on Oct.
2. The law marks a major step in cleaning up the bad debt problem
and in turning around the economy out of its deepest recession in
decades.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar bought 116.72 yen in late afternoon,
down 0.48 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late
Friday level in New York of 116.95 yen.
	   Hong Kong shares surged for the second consecutive session
Monday on expectations of cuts in both local and U.S. interest
rates.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 483.48 points, or 5.6
percent, to close at 8,990.27, its highest close since July 2. On
Friday, the index had soared 567.28 points.
	   Other Asian markets were also buoyed by the Nikkei's jump and
hints that the United States and Europe are ready to coordinate
efforts to help Asia, said Richard Verin, director of Asia equity
trading at Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong.
	   Malaysian shares surged 4.6 percent on local institutional
buying. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's benchmark Composite Index
rose 17.28 points to 389.50.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed sharply higher as Friday's rally on
Wall Street and expectations of more interest rate cuts propelled
the benchmark index to end above the 1,000 mark for the first time
in about two months. The benchmark Straits Times Index rose 4.1
percent, or 39.95 points, to 1,016.60.
	   SEOUL: Share prices also closed sharply higher, with the key
index surging 4.1 percent on expectations that the recent rise of
the Japanese yen will help local companies gain a price
competitiveness against their Japanese rivals. The Korea Composite
Stock Price Index rose 13.74 points to 352.17.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The market's
key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 23.72 points, or 0.3 percent,
to 6,920.45.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher in reaction
to Friday's gains on Wall Street. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose
19.18 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,723.65.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher for a fifth consecutive
session on the back of Wall Street's gains on Friday. The
Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected stocks rose 41.91
points, or 3.2 percent, to 1,343.27.
	   SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed moderately higher.
The All Ordinaries Index rose 10.3 points, or 0.4 percent, to
2,501.6.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed higher. The Composite Index rose
2.577 points, or 0.8 percent, to 307.417.
	   BANGKOK: Thai shares closed lower on profit-taking. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index fell 1.70 points, or 0.6 percent, to
290.80.

The FBI reports on Marxism _ the Groucho kind
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HILLEL ITALIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ He did more than smoke cigars and leer at women.
He defended free speech and U.S.-Soviet friendship. He had opinions
on everything from the New Deal to the United Nations.
	   So when Groucho Marx wiggled those eyebrows and cracked wise
about the Establishment, a few Establishment eyebrows went up as
well.
	   Documents recently made public show the FBI kept detailed files
on the comedian, ranging from his supportive quote about the
Scottsboro Boys in the 1930s to jokes made on television in the
'50s and '60s.
	   With the unintentional humor of a Marx brothers villain, the
bureau is still withholding several pages ``in the interest of
national defense or foreign policy.''
	   A fine way to treat the beloved leader of Fredonia _ the country
Groucho led in the film ``Duck Soup.''
	   ``In 1953, the FBI was told by one of their confidential
informants that Groucho was a member of the Communist Party and
they decided to do a full review,'' said Jon Wiener, a professor of
history at the University of California, Irvine, who acquired the
files through the Freedom of Information Act.
	   ``Getting the files on Marx was a kind of shot in the dark. I
had been a plaintiff in a lawsuit to the John Lennon FBI files,''
Wiener said. ``We recently settled most of the issues in that case
so I thought, `After Lennon, why not Marx?'''
	   The son of Jewish immigrants, Marx grew up in
turn-of-the-century Manhattan, in a world where socialism was about
as subversive as the Sabbath. He would become a dependable member
of Hollywood's liberal community, supporting Franklin D.
Roosevelt's New Deal program and other causes.
	   But what was standard left-wing thinking in the 1930s and '40s
became suspicious thinking in the Cold War era. In 1953, the House
Un-American Activities Committee pressured Groucho through Jerry
Fielding, bandleader for the comedian's TV game show ``You Bet Your
Life.''
	   Fielding, who had been tagged as a Communist sympathizer in
Walter Winchell's syndicated column, would later say the committee
wanted him to name Groucho as a fellow traveler. Fielding refused
and the show's sponsor, DeSoto-Plymouth Dealers of America,
persuaded Groucho to fire him.
	   ``That I bowed to sponsors' demands is one of the greatest
regrets of my life,'' Marx wrote years later.
	   According to the FBI files, Groucho's alleged offenses date back
to a 1934 article in the Communist Party newspaper the Daily
Worker. The article claims he called Communist support for the
Scottsboro Boys _ nine black youths who were unfairly convicted by
an Alabama court in the rape of two white girls _ an inspiration
for ``Soviet America.'' He was also quoted as defending Tom Mooney,
a labor leader then imprisoned, and later pardoned, for the bombing
deaths of 10 people.
	   In the '40s, Groucho attended a benefit concert for Soviet war
relief, helped sponsor a fundraiser for the liberal magazine The
Nation and opposed United Nations recognition for the fascist
government of Spain. He was also a member of the Committee for the
First Amendment, an anti-HUAC organization that included Frank
Sinatra, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.
	   ``You Bet Your Life'' was a popular program, but the Groucho
files are filled with letters from unhappy viewers in the '50s and
'60s. One letter complained that when a guest told Groucho he was a
former pugilist and bootlegger, the comedian responded, ``You mean
you were a bootlegger for the FBI?'' Another writer observed that
``Groucho Marks'' had referred to the United States as ``the United
Snakes'' and was friendly with another alleged Communist
sympathizer, Charlie Chaplin.
	   There's no indication that Groucho's career was affected, but
the FBI did take him seriously. One internal memo _ noting
Groucho's real name was Julius H. Marx _ was initialed by six
officials, and J. Edgar Hoover personally responded to at least one
letterwriter, enclosing the pamphlet ``What You Can Do to Fight
Communism and Preserve America.''
	   Entries to Groucho's file ended in the early 1960s. He died in
1977.
	   ``They concluded from their study he was not a member of the
Communist Party,'' Wiener said. ``The party was a very rigid
organization; it's hard to imagine a wisecracking spirit like
Groucho's in it.''

	   The announcement came shortly after Yeltsin arrived in Almaty,
the main city in Kazakstan. He came from neighboring Uzbekistan,
where he appeared stiff and stumbled on Sunday and canceled his
public appearances. On Monday he turned up more than an hour late
for talks with officials and abruptly cut short a scheduled news
conference.
	   Aides said Yeltsin, 67, was suffering from a cold and had had a
bad flight from Moscow. The Russian leader has a history of health
problems, including multiple heart bypass surgery two years ago.

Havel, Kissinger reflect on Kosovo crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Kosovo crisis bore heavily on
a gathering of more than 50 prominent thinkers and activists
meeting here Monday to discuss the process of globalization at the
end of the millennium.
	   Opening the prestigious event Monday, Czech President Vaclav
Havel asked for a minute of silence to honor the plight of Kosovo
refugees.
	   During his brief welcome speech he also commemorated Edith
Stein, an Auschwitz martyr and the first Jewish-born saint of the
modern era, canonized Sunday in the Vatican by Pope John Paul II.
	   Fears of another potential Balkan war and looming NATO
airstrikes in Kosovo were acknowledged by others as well.
	   ``I am uneasy about it,'' said former U.S. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger.
	   ``I would like to know exactly what the objective is ... and
what happens after the use of military force,'' he said. ``These
answers have to be given before a military strike.''
	   The conference includes a wide range of political and religious
activists, such as former Polish Premier Hana Suchocka and the
chief rabbi of Israel, Meir Lau.
	   U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, arriving later Monday en
route from the Bulgarian capital of Sofia, is to address the
gathering Tuesday.
	   The conference, sponsored by Japan's Nippon Foundation, is the
second of its kind held in Prague. The first was held in 1997.
Three more will be held here until 2001.
	   Havel, a former playwright and dissident, is known for his
efforts to make Prague the center of intellectual activity in the
post-Communist world.
	   After opening the event Monday, he dashed off to Vienna to
attend a summit of six Central European presidents held in the
Austrian capital.
	   He is due to return to Prague later Monday to meet with Mrs.
Clinton and hold a ceremonial dinner at Prague Castle for Forum
2000 participants.

Three Americans win Nobel Medicine Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to ADD details, including nitric oxide's
importance to Viagra. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three American researchers on Monday
won the Nobel Medicine Prize for discovering new properties of
nitric oxide, which is key to the anti-impotence drug Viagra and
has other wide applications ranging from treating heart trouble to
shock.
	   The prestigious prize went to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J.
Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the State
University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro is at University of
California-Los Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas
Medical School in Houston.
	   The citation by the Karolinska Institute said ``it was a
sensation that the simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide),
which is formed when nitrogen burns ... could exert important
functions in the organism. ''
	   ``Signal transmission by a gas that is produced by one cell,
penetrates through membranes and regulates the function of another
cell represents an entirely new principle,'' the citation said.
	   Nitric oxide can initiate erection of the penis by dilating
blood vessels. The wildly popular anti-impotence drug Viagra is
based on this effect.
	   Understanding how nitric oxide transmits the signals also has
sparked research on a wide range of new drugs, including those that
can be used in the treatment of heart problems and artherosclerosis
and shock.
	   Studies of the gas have also shown that white blood cells use it
to kill infectious agents such as bacteria and parasites, and that
it also can defend against tumors. This has led to tests to see
whether nitric oxide could be used to halt tumor growth.
	   The prize amount of 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) is divided
equally among the three.
	   The three laureates' discovery touches on the personal life of
Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite
who estanlished the prizes in his will.
	   In later life, Nobel's physician told him to take nitroglycerin
_ one of the ingredients in dynamite _ to combat heart trouble.
``However, it would take 100 years until it was clarified that
nitroglycerin acts by releasing nitrci oxide gas,'' the citation
noted.
	   Last year, the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the
University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of
prions, the rogue proteins identified as causing Mad Cow Disease.
	   Winners generally aren't known outside the medical community,
although the list of laureates contains a few familiar names
including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA
researchers Francis Crick and James Watson.
	   The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be
announced this year.
	   Last Thursday, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist
Jose Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the
economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Nobel.

Muslim leaders around world voice support for Algerian truce
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Thirty Muslim leaders from around the world have
appealed to Islamic insurgents in Algeria to join a truce called a
year ago, saying blind violence by fighters was helping to pervert
Islam.
	   ``We bless this noble, patriotic initiative,'' said a statement
obtained Monday.
	   A copy of the statement, dated Sunday, was obtained by The
Associated Press. The truce by the Islamic Salvation Army went into
effect on Oct. 1, 1997.
	   The statement called on Algerian authorities to use the truce to
``strengthen the bases for national global reconciliation.''
	   The statement was signed by Muslim leaders from Malaysia to
Morocco, and included diverse names on the list of 30 that included
activists like the head of Egypt's banned Muslim Brotherhood,
university professors and thinkers.
	   The signatories ``consider the truce ... a good work and a bold
patriotic position that has contributed in an appreciable manner to
diminishing the level of killings, destruction and attacks on
sacred laws,'' the statement said.
	   It added that the signatories agree that accusations of apostasy
by armed groups concerning fellow Muslims are an ``ignomy,''
leading to ``great evil.'' Blind killings, likewise, give ``the
enemies of Islam the occasion to deform (the religion) ....''
	   ``Islam always insists, even in cases of war ..., on preserving
the blood of non-combatants, particularly women, children and the
elderly,'' the statement said.
	   In Algeria, there was no immediate reaction from authorities or
from the Armed Islamic Group, the radical insurgency movement held
responsible for numerous massacres.
	   The Islamic Salvation Army, the military wing of the banned
Islamic Salvation Front, called the truce in part to ``unmask the
enemy hiding behind the abominable massacres.''
	   But the truce has been belittled by some as a unilateral
cease-fire by a poorly equipped force. It even divided the Islamic
Salvation Front, some of whose members consider the truce a virtual
surrender.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed since violence
erupted nearly seven years ago, after the army canceled January
1992 legislative elections to thwart a likely victory by the
Islamic Salvation Front.
	   The party was banned in a massive crackdown by authorities and
the Islamic Salvation Army was born to win back ``stolen votes.''
After the Armed Islamic Group was formed in 1994, sharp ideological
and territorial rivalries developed between the two groups.
	   The text was interspersed with quotes from the Koran and the
Sunna, the traditions of Prophet Mohammed, founder of the Islamic
faith.
	   Among the signatories were: Mustapha Mashhour, leader of Egypt's
Muslim Brotherhood; Tunisian Rachid Ghannouchi, living in exile in
London; Ghulam A'dham Amir of the Jamaat Islami group in
Bangladesh; Qadi Hussein of the Jemaat Islami in Pakistan; Fadel
Nour, president of the Islamic Party of Malaysia; Dr. Azzam Tamimi,
head of the British-based Liberty organization.

Foster has limited victory in battle against extradition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Convicted international conman Peter
Foster succeeded Monday in temporarily challenging his extradition
to Britain but was ordered to remain in jail until proper
extradition steps were taken.
	   Federal Court Judge Jeffrey Spender found that Justice Minister
Amanda Vanstone did not have the power to sign the extradition
warrant authorizing Foster's deportation to England to face
fraud-related charges.
	   Spender said only Australia's attorney general had the authority
to sign such a warrant and that it had been wrongly delegated to
Vanstone.
	   But Spender also ordered Foster remain in prison until Attorney
General Daryl Williams signs the warrant.
	   Foster, 35, of the Gold Coast, in Queensland state, faces five
charges _ two of conspiracy to defraud and three of using a false
instrument _ in the United Kingdom and has been fighting
extradition since last year.
	   He has been in jail since he was recaptured in Melbourne after
going on the run last November.
	   Foster has been jailed in three countries on convictions of
various crimes. He was captured in Australia and jailed for
breaching bail conditions and trying to escape lawful custody.

Iranian foundation raises reward for killing Rushdie

 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian foundation has raised its reward
for Salman Rushdie's execution to dlrs 2.8 million, just weeks
after the Iranian government tried to distance itself from the
bounty.
	   The move was a striking show of the infighting within Iran's
fractured government between hard-liners and moderates gathered
around President Mohammad Khatami, who has sought to improve ties
with the West since he assumed office last year.
	   ``I, as the head of the Khordad Foundation, add dlrs 300,000 to
the reward for implementing the edict,'' Ayatollah Hassan Saneii
was quoted as saying by Jomhuri Islami newspaper Monday.
	   The semiofficial foundation had initially offered dlrs 2.5
million to anyone who killed the British author, whose book ``The
Satanic Verses'' was claimed by Iran to be blasphemous to Islam.
	   The comments by Saneii were the first by the foundation since
Iran's government distanced itself last month from the death edict.
Saneii is the representative of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, in the foundation.
	   ``To set a reward for killing Salman Rushdie has been a great
honor for this foundation and we will keep this honor. We should
not let this issue be forgotten,'' Saneii said.
	   On Saturday, a hard-line Iranian student group offered 1 billion
rials (dlrs 333,000) to anyone who kills Rushdie.
	   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa, or religious
edict, on Rushdie in 1989. The issue has long strained ties between
Iran and the West, especially Britain. Britain restored diplomatic
relations last month in return for a promise that the death warrant
would not be pursued.
	   Powerful government hard-liners, dismayed over Khatami's efforts
to improve ties with the West since he took office last year, were
not happy with the new government position on Rushdie.
	   Earlier this month, more than half of Iran's hard-line
parliament signed a letter saying the death sentence stands.
	   Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini
issued the edict. He recently voiced relief the ordeal was over.

EU gives cautious approval to Greek economic plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; with EU-Finance &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers Monday
approved Greek government plans to get the economy in shape for
joining the EU single currency bloc, but they warned extra efforts
may be need to meet the ambitious targets.
	   High levels of inflation, public debt and budget deficit
excluded Greece from the first group of 11 nations set to adopt the
euro as their common currency on Jan. 1. Greece hopes it can be
ready to join in 2001.
	   Under EU rules, the four nations staying outside the euro-zone
present mid-term economic programs intended to promote policy
convergence within the EU.
	   While Denmark, Britain and Sweden voluntarily opted out of the
euro, Greece is hoping it's ``convergence program'' will keep in on
track for early membership.
	   Under the plan, Greece aims to have debt and deficits down to
the levels required for participation in by the end of this year
and inflation in line by the end of 1999.
	   However, the EU said an expected slow down in growth because of
the shaky world economic situation could call for extra effort to
meet the targets.
	   The program shows the budget deficit falling to 2.4 percent of
gross domestic product this year, from 4 percent in 1997. The
deficit is seen at 2.1 percent in 1999.
	   Inflation is seen at an average of 4.5 percent in 1998, compared
to 5.5 percent in 1997. Inflation is expected to drop to 2.5
percent in 1999.

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is
suffering from a cold, will cut short his trip to Central Asia and
return to Moscow on Monday, one day ahead of schedule, Russian news
agencies said.
	   No reason was given for the change in plans.
	   The announcement came shortly after Yeltsin arrived in Almaty,
Kazakstan's main city, from neighboring Uzbekistan.
	   Yeltsin appeared stiff and stumbled when he landed in Uzbekistan
on Sunday and canceled his public appearances. On Monday he turned
up more than an hour late for talks with officials and abruptly cut
short a scheduled news conference.
	   Aides said Yeltsin, 67, was suffering from a cold and had a bad
flight from Moscow. The Russian leader has a history of health
problems, including multiple heart bypass surgery two years ago,
although he insists he has no major health problems and will serve
out the remaining two years of his term.
	   Yeltsin has spent most of the last two months out of the
limelight and out of the Kremlin, holding meetings in his country
home outside Moscow. The trip to Central Asia was his first outside
of Russia since May when he went to Britain for the Group of Seven
summit of industrialized countries.
	   Yeltsin has been scheduled to hold talks in Kazakstan on Monday
and Tuesday. The Kazak presidential press service said he would
compress his entire agenda into one day and fly back to Moscow on
Monday night.
	   Yeltsin had to be supported by Uzbek President Islam Karimov
when he arrived in Tashkent on Sunday. He canceled his other public
events, saying he wasn't feeling well, but held one-on-one talks
with Karimov as scheduled.
	   Yeltsin's chief spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said the president
was suffering from a cold and had had a bad flight from Moscow.
	   Yakushkin and Yeltsin's doctor, Sergei Mironov, said he was
feeling better Monday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   However, Yeltsin showed up one hour late for talks Monday
between Russian and Uzbek officials, catching only the last 20

to just a few minutes.
	   He and Karimov made brief statements and walked away without

	   Following the talks, Yeltsin and Karimov signed a package of
agreements to boost economic and other ties.
	   ``We have agreed to establish closer cooperation in the
economic, political and military fields,'' Yeltsin said in his
statement.
	   Yeltsin's talks in Uzbekistan and Kazakstan were to have focused
on economic issues as well as concerns about fighting in
Afghanistan. The former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear an
influx of drugs, weapons and refugees as well as a possible
spillover of fighting from Afghanistan.

U.S. soldier in Germany shot at by unknown assailant

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A U.S. soldier was shot and wounded
slightly late Sunday while on guard duty outside a barracks at a
military airfield in Erlensee east of Frankfurt, the U.S. Army said
Monday.
	   The female soldier, who was not identified, was apparently shot
by an assailant in a nearby field. No arrests have been made.
German and American authorities were cooperating on an
investigation.
	   The soldier was taken to hospital for treatment after a bullet
apparently hit her bullet-proof vest then grazed her neck.
	   The Army's public affairs division could not immediately be
reached for further comment.

PAL indefinitely suspends resumption of international flights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines on Monday
indefinitely put on hold a plan to resume international flights,
initially set for this week, on request of potential investors.
	   Debt-laden PAL reopened Wednesday with domestic flights after a
13-day shutdown caused by disagreements with its largest labor
union over a management recovery plan.
	   The flag-carrier was scheduled to resume flights to Hong Kong,
Tokyo, Los Angeles and San Francisco on Thursday and gradually add
flights to seven other destinations in Asia and the Middle East.
	   A PAL statement said without elaborating that the resumption of
international flights was aborted on request of potential
investors, who have been studying the airline's records the past
week.
	   It said domestic flights would continue.
	   Jimmy Bautista, PAL's chief finance officer, said there were at
least three investors in talks with PAL officials, Hong Kong's
Cathay Pacific Airways, Northwest Airlines and Singapore Airlines.
	   Two of PAL's four 747-400 Boeing planes, used on international
flights, have been seized by authorities in Hong Kong and Los
Angeles recently on demand of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which
financed them.
	   It was not immediately clear if the airline put on hold the
resumption of international flights due to fears by PAL officials
that its other leased planes could be garnished by authorities in
foreign airports as well.
	   A PAL plane brought President Joseph Estrada to Singapore on
Sunday, where he will address an international economic summit and
make a state visit. He has wanted the flight to signal the
resumption of PAL's international flights this week.
	   PAL, which has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion
in debt, was devastated by a pilots' strike in June and by the
region's currency crisis, which reduced passenger numbers and
inflated costs.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, shut down operations on Sept. 23
after a union representing ground personnel turned down a
management-proposed recovery plan that would suspend labor strikes
and collective bargaining negotiations for 10 years.
	   Union members turned down the proposal in an initial
government-supervised referendum but accepted it in a second
referendum after Estrada brokered an agreement between PAL majority
owner and Chairman Lucio Tan and the union.
	   Under the accord, workers agreed to the suspension of their
collective bargaining agreement for 10 years in exchange for 20
percent ownership of the airline.

Seoul to launch campaign to account for MIAs from Korean War
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea will launch a new campaign
to account for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of its soldiers missing
from the Korean War, the Defense Ministry said Monday.
	   ``The efforts will be through direct South-North Korea channels
or the U.N. Human Rights Commission,'' the ministry said in a
statement.
	   The statement came after a South Korean soldier who escaped
after being held in North Korea for 45 years claimed he knew of
about 30 other prisoners of war still alive in the communist
country.
	   Staff Sgt. Chang Moon-hwan, 72, arrived in South Korea late last
month after fleeing into China from North Korea, where he had been
held captive and forced to work as a coal miner since 1953.
	   Chang, who was captured two weeks before the Korean War ended in
1953, reported seeing about 70 South Korean prisoners of war
working at the coal mines, of whom about 40 have died.
	   Chang was the third South Korean prisoner of war to escape North
Korea. Former POW Yang Soon-yong, who escaped to the South in
December, said at least 59 ailing South Korean prisoners of war
were still alive in a North Korean concentration camp.
	   Seoul says more than 40,000 South Korean prisoners were not
returned at the end of the Korean conflict, but the North says all
POWs went home in 1953.

Tornado destroys houses in two southern Philippine villages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA Philippines (AP) _ A tornado tore through two coastal
villages in the southern Philippines, injuring at least a dozen
people and destroying several grass huts, officials said Monday.
	   The tornado struck late Friday the villages in Lamitan town in
the island province of Basilan, which has been swamped by monsoon
rains for a week, Gov. Wahab Akbar said.
	   At least 20 huts were destroyed in the villages of Bato and
Banas, leaving about 100 people homeless, Akbar said.
	   Pounding rains also have hit the nearby province of Zamboanga
for days, destroying wide swaths of agricultural land and
fishponds, officials said.
	   At least three people have died in floods in Zamboanga, they
said.
	   Basilan and Zamboanga are located in the southern region of
Mindanao, about 850 kilometers (527 miles) south of Manila.

	   Yeltsin traveled to Kazakstan from neighboring Uzbekistan, where
he appeared stiff and stumbled when he landed on Sunday and
canceled his public appearances. On Monday he turned up more than
an hour late for talks with officials and abruptly cut short a
scheduled news conference.
	   Aides said Yeltsin, 67, was suffering from a cold and had a bad
flight from Moscow. The Russian leader has a history of health
problems, including multiple heart bypass surgery two years ago,
although he insists he has no major health problems and will serve
out the remaining two years of his term.
	   Yeltsin has spent most of the last two months out of the
limelight and out of the Kremlin, holding meetings in his country
home outside Moscow. The trip to Central Asia was his first outside
of Russia since May when he went to Britain for the Group of Seven
summit of industrialized countries.
	   Yeltsin has been scheduled to hold talks in Kazakstan on Monday
and Tuesday. The Kazak presidential press service said he would
compress his entire agenda into one day and fly back to Moscow on
Monday night.
	   Yeltsin had to be supported by Uzbek President Islam Karimov
when he arrived in Tashkent on Sunday. He canceled his other public
events, saying he wasn't feeling well, but held one-on-one talks
with Karimov as scheduled.
	   Yakushkin, Yeltsin's spokesman, said the president was suffering
from a cold and had had a bad flight from Moscow.
	   Yakushkin and Yeltsin's doctor, Sergei Mironov, said he was
feeling better Monday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   However, Yeltsin showed up one hour late for talks Monday
between Russian and Uzbek officials, catching only the last 20
minutes. He also cut short his scheduled 20-minute news conference
to just a few minutes.
	   He and Karimov made brief statements and walked away without
taking any questions. Yeltsin walked unaided, but was closely
flanked by bodyguards.
	   ``We had to slightly change the program because of the tight
schedule,'' Yakushkin told reporters, refusing to give any further
details.
	   Following the talks, Yeltsin and Karimov signed a package of
agreements to boost economic and other ties.
	   ``We have agreed to establish closer cooperation in the
economic, political and military fields,'' Yeltsin said in his
statement.
	   Yeltsin's talks in Uzbekistan and Kazakstan were to have focused
on economic issues as well as concerns about fighting in
Afghanistan. The former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear an
influx of drugs, weapons and refugees as well as a possible
spillover of fighting from Afghanistan.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO warplanes being moved
closer for possible airstrikes, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on
Monday described the Kosovo standoff as an ``emergency'' and
demanded the Yugoslav leader end his crackdown. After a rest of
just a few hours, Holbrooke resumed talks with President Slobodan
Milosevic on defusing the Kosovo crisis and avoiding threatened
NATO airstrikes on Yugoslav military targets. Holbrooke described
his earlier overnight meeting with Milosevic as ``intense, indeed,
and at times very heated.'' He said the standoff between NATO and
the Yugoslav president ``can only be called an emergency.'' NATO
officials also met in Brussels, Belgium, first on an informal level
in the morning. An official conference was scheduled for later
Monday, expected to result in an ``activation order'' for NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia unless diplomacy produces a
breakthrough. In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said
his country would provide around 40 aircraft for possible
airstrikes, which could last ``several days.'' (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ Balkan leaders in Antalya, a Turkish
seaside resort, tried Monday to persuade Yugoslavia to accept
international demands on Kosovo and avoid NATO airstrikes. Although
Yugoslav Premier Momir Bulatovic and Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic were said to be bearing ``new ideas,'' it seems unlikely
the heads of government attending Monday's two-day Balkan summit
will be able to persuade them to accept a key U.N. demand that
could avert a NATO decision to authorize military action. NATO
meets Monday to decide on the use of force, and Balkan leaders here
_ including alliance members Greece and Turkey _ want to attempt
their own 11th-hour effort to find a peaceful solution. Diplomats
say Yugoslavia has so far refused to even accept a mention of
Kosovo in a joint declaration to be issued at the end of the
meeting, forcing other countries to draft a separate resolution on
the crisis in the Albanian-dominated Serbian province. (BALKAN
SUMMIT)
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro
and Ferid Murad of the United States won the Nobel Medicine Prize
on Monday for discoveries that shed light on the cardiovascular
system. They discovered how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule
for the body's blood vessels, a breakthrough with applications
ranging from hardening of the arteries to impotence. Understanding
how nitric oxide transmits the signals has sparked research on a
wide range of new drugs, including those that can be used in the
treatment of heart problems, atherosclerosis, shock and impotence.
Because of their work, ``we know today that nitric oxide acts as a
signal molecule in the nervous system, as a weapon against
infections and as a regulator of blood pressure,'' said the
citation from the Karolinska lnstitute. The citation said ``it was
a sensation that the simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide),
which is formed when nitrogen burns ... could exert important
functions in the organism.'' (NOBEL-MEDICINE)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Discontent with Prime Minister
Mahathir's 17-year-rule is swelling the ranks of an Islamic group
that is leading the anti-government campaign and triggering
defections from the ruling party, a party official said Monday. In
the last month, the Parti Islamic SeMalaysia or PAS, a conservative
group, said it had enrolled 5,000 new members, and was running out
of application forms. Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar said the
defections of at least 500 members of his ruling United Malays
National Organization was ``good riddance,'' since their departure
will let the party will become stronger. More than half the
country's 22 million people are Malay Muslims who have
traditionally voted UMNO to power since Malaysia became independent
in 1957. Mahathir has denied that UMNO's strength is being corroded
by the campaign set off by the firing and later arrest of his
deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim. Anwar, who faces trial on
corruption and sexual misconduct charges, has denied any
wrongdoing. He says the charges are politically motivated to
silence him, at a time when he is emerging as the biggest challenge
to Mahathir. (MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who
is suffering from a cold, will cut short his trip to Central Asia
and return to Moscow on Monday, one day ahead of schedule, Russian
news agencies said. No reason was given for the change in plans.
The announcement came shortly after Yeltsin arrived in Almaty, the
main city in Kazakstan. He came from neighboring Uzbekistan, where
he appeared stiff and stumbled on Sunday and canceled his public
appearances. On Monday he turned up more than an hour late for
talks with officials and abruptly cut short a scheduled news
conference. Aides said Yeltsin, 67, was suffering from a cold and
had had a bad flight from Moscow. The Russian leader has a history
of health problems, including multiple heart bypass surgery two
years ago. He has spent most of the last two months out of the
limelight and out of the Kremlin, holding meetings in his country
home outside Moscow. The trip to Central Asia was his first outside
of Russia since May when he went to Britain for the Group of Seven
summit of industrialized countries. (RUSSIA-YELTSIN)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply higher
Monday, boosted by the passage of legislation in the Japanese
parliament to help the country's ailing banks. Asian bourses were
also boosted by Wall Street's 2.17 percent gain Friday, and hopes
of a fresh round of global interest rate cuts. Tokyo's benchmark
Nikkei Stock Average rose 675.04 points, or 5.24 percent, closing
at 13,555.01. Hong Kong shares surged for the second consecutive
session Monday on expectations of cuts in both local and U.S.
interest rates. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 483.48 points,
or 5.6 percent, to close at 8,990.27, its highest close since July
2. Malaysian and other markets were also buoyed by hints that the
United States and Europe are ready to coordinate efforts to help
Asia, said Richard Verin, director of Asia equity trading at Credit
Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar bought
116.72 yen in late afternoon, down 0.48 yen from late Friday in
Tokyo. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Taking a major step toward tackling Japan's bad
debt crisis, the upper house of Parliament on Monday passed a plan
to use taxpayer money to clean up the country's deeply troubled
banks. The package, which was passed by the more powerful lower
house on Oct. 2, also boosts Japan's efforts to overcome its
deepest recession since the end of World War II. The markets took
the vote as a healthy sign the country is acting to address its
financial problems. The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average surged
675.04 points, or 5.24 percent, closing the day's trading at
13,555.01. The so-called financial stabilization plan creates a
special committee to oversee the cleanup of the nearly dlrs 1
trillion in bad debts left over from the burst of the speculative
``bubble economy'' in the early 1990s. Also set up would be an
organization similar to the U.S. Resolution Trust Corp., created
during the 1980s U.S. savings and loan crisis to buy the bad debt
from banks. (JAPAN-BANK BILLS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's finance minister has acknowledged there
is no comprehensive, long-term strategy for rescuing the country's
economy and no plans to draft one this year. Mikhail Zadornov said
Sunday that the government would not draw up any long-term plans
``for at least the next three months.'' Instead, the government has
promised to make public its short-term plans for dealing with the
economic crisis by Oct. 20. ``I think that, in essence, it is
precisely such moves that will lay the foundation for setting
medium-term tasks in 1999,'' he said. Russia is urging the IMF to
release the next installment on a dlrs 22.6 billion loan negotiated
before the latest crisis struck in mid-August. Russia badly needs
the money to help pay its debts, but the IMF says it must first
come up with and implement measures to end the crisis. Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov maintains the government's plans hinge on
whether it gets the foreign aid. Without that aid, Russia is widely
expected to start printing more money, which will stoke inflation.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The turmoil on world markets, a battle over
the European Union's budget and the economic impact of Italy's
political crisis dominated Monday's meeting of EU finance
ministers. The meeting came as slower growth rates and fears of
more gloom spreading from Asia, Russia and South America take some
of the shine off preparations for the launch of the euro as the
common currency of 11 EU nations on Jan. 1. So far, Europe has
avoided the worst of the global crisis. However, ministers face
mounting pressure to halt any further decline in growth, including
calls for interest rate cuts to help business. Ministers were also
to discuss the impact of the dollar's recent tumble and proposals
for strengthening international financial institutions to prevent
future outbreaks of global turbulence. Britain's Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown said Sunday that his European colleagues
must share responsibility for creating ``conditions for growth and
stability around the world.'' (EU-FINANCE)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Deprived of protection from
unemployment because of decades-old social biases, women have been
especially hurt by Asia's financial storm, officials said Monday.
Delegates to a conference on women at a meeting of Pacific Rim
leaders have urged steps to demolish such discrimination and to
provide women with better opportunities to overcome the crisis.
``Where poverty reigns, women are poorer than most men. Gender, to
be sure, is a function of nature. Poverty, however, is not,''
Philippine congresswoman Bellaflor Castillo told the delegates at
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. The conference of
senior officials from APEC member countries aims to find ways of
giving women equal opportunities in workplaces and trade. The
recommendations will be offered to APEC ministers, who will hold a
two-day meeting in Manila starting Thursday. The ministers would
then bring the proposals to APEC heads of state, who will hold a
summit in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur next month.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Supporters of former President Suharto
attacked the office of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation on
Monday, lawyers at the human rights group said.
	   Police dispersed the self-proclaimed People's Voice Committee
after they broke windows and doors at the entrance of the
foundation's office in central Jakarta. No one was injured.
	   The group demanded that the foundation stop sheltering about 200
labor activists who have been living in its compound as part of an
anti-government protest.
	   The attackers also complained about rising criticism of Suharto,
who is now at the center of a government corruption investigation.
	   They accused the foundation of supporting causes that harmed
Indonesia's image abroad.
	   Senior lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution said Monday's attack was the
first since the foundation was founded in 1970.
	   Last week, there was a similar attack against pro-reform
businessman Arifin Panigoro in southern Jakarta.

Italian government approves use of bases for possible raids over
</HEADLINE>
Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military
bases for possible NATO air raids against Yugoslavia.
	   The government approved the use of the bases during an
extraordinary Cabinet meeting.
	   Italian forces, however, cannot take part in any NATO action
without the approval of Parliament.
	   Italian bases, including the air base in Aviano north of Venice,
played a key support role for the alliance during the recent war in
the Balkans.
	   The Cabinet is acting in a caretaker role following the
resignation of Premier Romano Prodi last week. During parliamentary
debate Thursday, Prodi raised questions about any role by Italy
when he said conditions were not yet ripe for a military strike.
	   Prodi needed the votes of far-left legislators, who are opposed
to any military action by NATO in the Balkans, particularly without
specific United Nations approval.

Gazza spends weekend in drying out clinic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English soccer's troubled genius Paul Gascoigne
spent the weekend in a specialist alcohol clinic at the request of
Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson.
	   His latest attempt to overcome his well publicized drink problem
was splashed across the front pages of every national tabloid
Monday.
	   The Sun headline read: ``Gazza in Booze Clinic. Sozzled star is
sent to dry out by soccer boss.''
	   The paper also offered a reward of a carton of beer to any
reader who spotted Gascoigne ``slipping back into his old habits.''
	   The 31-year-old former England midfielder was involved in a
spate of alcohol-related incidents last week.
	   He reportedly returned from a team trip to Ireland and was found
drunk and sobbing at a train station, he allegedly crashed the team
bus and reportedly ran naked through the club's training facility.
	   But Robson, a former England teammate of Gascoigne's, said the
media had contributed to Gazza's problems by relentlessly hounding
him.
	   Gascoigne has been followed by controversy since he was axed
from the England national team by Glenn Hoddle on the eve of the
France '98 World Cup for being unfit.
	   His axing followed reports of his drunken benders in nightclubs
in England and Spain in the leadup to tournament.
	   The England manager later slated Gascoigne in a World Cup book,
revealing how the Middlesbrough star went beserk and smashed up a
hotel room when he was given the news of his axing.
	   In the meantime, one of his closest friends died after spending
a night out with Gascoigne and his stormy two-year marriage ended
when his wife Sheryl was granted a ``quickie'' divorce on the
grounds of what was described as his unreasonable behavior.
	   Gascoigne had turned to 33-year-old Sheryl for support after he
was dropped from the England team. The couple went on a Florida
vacation together. But despite the player's hopes of a
reconciliation, Sheryl decided to go ahead with the divorce.
	   She said Monday that she had spoken to Gazza but he would not be
rejoining her at their former marital home.
	   Middlesbrough spokesman David Allan said Gascoigne would stay
away from the club until the clinic staff consider his symptoms.
	   ``The club will be guided by (the clinic's) advice over his
welfare,'' he said.
	   Robson confirmed that Gascoigne was suffering from alcohol and
stress related problems.
	   ``Gazza has got a problem,'' Robson said. ``It's been building
up for quite a few years.''
	   ``We're going to try and help the lad. We're not like some other
people saying they want to help him because they've done nothing
but try to destroy him for the last six weeks.''
	   ``As a club, we're going to get on with that and as a manager
and a friend, I'm going to try and help Gazza as much as I can.''
	   Gascoigne joined Middlesbrough late last season from Glasgow
Rangers. He previously played for Tottenham and Italian club Lazio.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Door-to-door checks for illegal
weapons are set to begin next month in the Cambodian capital in an
effort to combat a recent surge in crime, a senior municipal
official said Monday.
	   Citing an increase in kidnappings and robberies, Phnom Penh
Deputy Gov. Chea Sophara said a general search warrant has been
requested at the Municipal Court to carry out searches if a home is
suspected to contain illegal weapons.
	   ``Police will go house to house to question residents if they
have weapons or not. If they do have weapons, they must have a
license for them,'' Chea Sophara said.
	   The increase in crime has affected foreign investment as youth
gangs often target foreigners as relatively wealthy victims, the
deputy governor said.
	   Foreign embassies, non-governmental organizations and
international organizations will be exempted from the weapons
dragnet.
	   Cambodia is awash with weapons, a legacy of decades of civil war
and strife. Assault rifles and handguns are a common sight on the
streets of Phnom Penh. Firearms, ammunition and even hand grenades
can be bought cheaply at local markets.
	   Residents of the capital fire their guns at the sky during heavy
rainstorms to chase off perceived evil spirits.
	   Shooting into the air is also the accepted way to alert the fire
department of a fire, and the turning of the Cambodian new year in
April sounds like a war as thousands of gun-owners unload their
weapons into the air simultaneously.
	   Chea Sophara said the weapons searches are a part of efforts to
curb the gun culture in the city.
	   ``I cannot allow random shooting throughout Phnom Penh during
rainfall or during the Cambodian New Year. At least nine to 10
people are hit during these outbursts,'' he said.
	   As an example of the seriousness of the problem, Chea Sophara
cited a roadblock police recently set up on a major street in the
capital to search for weapons. In an hour, more than 100 weapons,
mostly registered, had been found.
	   But other announced crackdowns on unregistered weapons in the
past had little evident effect.

	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Doctors ordered Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to cut short his trip to Central Asia for health reasons
Monday, and he agreed to return home a day early, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Yeltsin's aides had said he was suffering from a cold. The
67-year-old leader has a long history of health problems, but there
was no word that he had any illness aside from the cold.
	   The announcement came shortly after Yeltsin arrived in Almaty,
Kazakstan's main city, from neighboring Uzbekistan.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said doctors insisted that
the president return to Moscow for health reasons, Interfax said.
It gave no other details.
	   Yeltsin, 67, appeared stiff and stumbled when he landed in the
Uzbek capital of Tashkent on Sunday and canceled his public
appearances. On Monday, he turned up more than an hour late for
talks with officials and abruptly cut short a scheduled news
conference.
	   The Russian leader has had a number of health problems in recent
years, including multiple heart bypass surgery two years ago,
although he insists he has no major health problems and will serve
out the remaining two years of his term.
	   Yeltsin has spent most of the last two months out of the
limelight and out of the Kremlin, holding meetings in his country
home outside Moscow. The trip to Central Asia was his first outside
of Russia since May when he went to Britain for the Group of Seven
summit of industrialized countries.
	   Yeltsin has been scheduled to hold talks in Kazakstan on Monday
and Tuesday. The Kazak presidential press service said he would
compress his entire agenda into one day and fly back to Moscow on
Monday night.
	   Yeltsin had to be supported by Uzbek President Islam Karimov
when he arrived in Tashkent on Sunday. He canceled his other public
events, saying he wasn't feeling well, but held one-on-one talks
with Karimov as scheduled.
	   Yakushkin and Yeltsin's doctor, Sergei Mironov, said the
president was feeling better Monday, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   However, Yeltsin showed up one hour late for talks Monday
between Russian and Uzbek officials, catching only the last 20
minutes. He also cut short his scheduled 20-minute news conference
to just a few minutes.
	   He and Karimov made brief statements and walked away without
taking any questions. Yeltsin walked unaided, but was closely
flanked by bodyguards.
	   ``We had to slightly change the program because of the tight
schedule,'' Yakushkin told reporters, refusing to give any further
details.
	   Following the talks, Yeltsin and Karimov signed a package of
agreements to boost economic and other ties.
	   ``We have agreed to establish closer cooperation in the
economic, political and military fields,'' Yeltsin said in his
statement.
	   Yeltsin's talks in Uzbekistan and Kazakstan were to have focused
on economic issues as well as concerns about fighting in
Afghanistan. The former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear an
influx of drugs, weapons and refugees as well as a possible
spillover of fighting from Afghanistan.

Government critic jailed without trial: Report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Politics

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The head of an Islamic group that
had joined two new anti-government coalitions was arrested Monday
under a law that allows imprisonment without trial, a Malaysian
media report said.
	   Shaari Sungip, the president of JIM, or the Malaysian Reform
Group, was arrested under the harsh Internal Security Act, the
Bernama news agency said.
	   His arrest brings to five the number of people detained recently
under the act, including former deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim. Police detained 12 other Anwar associates, who have since
been released.
	   Since Anwar's arrest on Sept. 20, two new opposition coalitions
had formed, calling for an end to the ISA and justice for the
dissident politician. JIM was a member of both coalitions, which
are comprised of political parties and non-governmental groups.
	   A spokesman from federal police headquarters, Ghazali Mohamad
Amin, said Shaari was suspected of acts considered a threat to
national security.
	   Ghazali added that police released from custody Mahinder Singh
Randhawa, an engineer who was arrested Saturday under the Internal
Security Act while attending a pro-Anwar rally.

Philippine government comfortable with current peso level
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Philippine Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno
said Monday he is comfortable with the peso's present exchange rate
and does not believe its recent gains pose a risk to the country's
export competitiveness.
	   ``Almost all Asian currencies have recovered because of the
stronger (Japanese) yen,'' Diokno said, adding that the Philippine
government is ``comfortable'' with the exchange rate.
	   The peso has posted strong gains against the dollar in recent
days, spurred by the yen.
	   Diokno is in Singapore to attend the East Asia Economic Summit,
sponsored by the World Economic Forum, a private agency based in
Switzerland that brings political and business leaders together.
	   Diokno said fears of a devaluation of the Chinese yuan that
might set off another round of currency devaluations in the region
are ``fading fast'' due to the recent strengthening of the yen.
	   The dollar would probably have to rebound to 160 yen to 170 yen
to rekindle fears of a yuan devaluation, he added.
	   Instead, the biggest threat of a setback to the Philippine
economy is the possibility of a recession in the United States,
Diokno said.
	   The United States is the Philippines' biggest trading partner
and accounted for 34 percent of total exports last year. By
comparison, only 13 percent of Philippine exports went to other
Southeast Asian markets.

Turkish president firm on Turkish route for Caspian oil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ President Suleyman Demirel insisted Monday
that Caspian Sea oil will be transported through Turkey, despite a
report claiming that companies favored a cheaper and shorter route.
	   ``Baku-Ceyhan will be definitely constructed,,'' Demirel told an
oil conference in reference to a pipeline project running from the
Azeri capital of Baku to Turkey's Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
``It is the safest route and has the backing of the United
States.''
	   Demirel's optimism conflicted with Sunday's report in The New
York Times that U.S. efforts for the Turkish project appeared to be
failing.
	   Azerbaijan's oil reserves in the Caspian Sea are considered to
be the world's richest after the Middle East.
	   According to the newspaper, companies from the United States and
seven other nations are expected to announce Oct. 29 that they will
rely on a much shorter and cheaper pipeline already being built
from Azerbaijan to the port of Supsa, on Georgia's Black Sea coast,
or an enlarged pipeline along the same route.
	   From Georgia, the oil would be loaded into tankers and shipped
through Turkey's narrow Bosporus Strait, a proposal strongly
opposed by Turkey for security concerns.
	   Energy Minister Cumhur Ersumer said the report was totally
baseless, private NTV television said. Ersumer said Turkey will
sign an agreement with Georgia and Azerbaijan this month, to allow
the Turkish pipeline to cut through their territories.
	   The Turkish proposal foresees the construction of a
1,730-kilometer (1,081-mile) pipeline, via Georgia, capable of
carrying 50 million metric tons (7.1 million barrels) of oil a
year. It is expected to cost dlrs 2.5 billion.
	   There have been nearly 50 oil tanker accidents in the last four
decades in the Bosporus, a narrow waterway that bisects Istanbul.
In several cases, leaking oil covered the waterway, causing it to
be shut down to traffic for days. Thousands of tons of oil have
spilled in the accidents.
	   ``You can pump the oil and flush it out directly in the
Mediterranean, which is a perfect market.'' Demirel said.
	   Washington has favored the Baku-Ceyhan route because it would
avoid crossing Iran, which has also proposed an alternative route.
	   Oil from Azerbaijan started flowing through a preliminary
Russian pipeline last fall to Russia's Black Sea port of
Novorossisk.

Taiwan expresses optimism, flexibility on eve of China visit

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Issuing calls for ``new thinking,'' Taiwan
said Monday that its top envoy was willing to discuss any issue
that would help get talks with China back on track during upcoming
meetings on the mainland.
	   Crucial meetings in Shanghai beginning Wednesday mark the start
of a ``new stage'' in relations, frozen for three years by China's
suspension of dialogue, a smiling Premier Vincent Siew told
negotiator Koo Chen-fu and his 12-member delegation.
	   Though careful not to promise results, Taiwan has expressed
cautious hopes that Koo's visit will point ties in the right
direction. At the least, contacts should ``nurture a pleasant
atmosphere,'' relations,'' Siew said.
	   ``We hope that the two sides will use new thinking and a new
approach to face the issues (and) rebuild a framework for relations
suited to the conditions of separation between the two sides,''
Siew said.
	   Siew's comments appeared to be a final appeal for China to seize
the opportunity afforded by Koo's visit to pave the way for
restoring formal talks.
	   China has made negotiations conditional on Taiwan agreeing to
discuss political issues relating to their reunification. But the
island has urged that agreements first be reached on practical
matters to create trust.
	   However, in a sign of flexibility, Siew reiterated earlier
comments that Taiwan is open to discussion on any issue helpful to
peaceful relations and eventual reunification.
	   But he added that Taiwan would not be dictated to by Beijing,
and said the sides should regard each other as equals.
	   Taiwan has tried hard to sweeten conditions for talks, canceling
a military display and visits abroad by its vice president that
could have riled Beijing. China responded by agreeing to allow 248
illegal aliens detained in Taiwan to return home, removing a major
headache for authorities here.
	   In a further sign of warming ties, Zhang Jiakun, vice governor
of China's Fujian province, will visit business leaders in Taiwan
starting Tuesday, the highest-ranking local-level official of the
Communist regime to visit the island.
	   Zhang will lead a small delegation on a four-day visit at the
invitation of Taiwan's Chinese National Federation of Industries,
the federation said Monday.
	   Koo's first stop will be in Shanghai, where he will meet Wang
Daohan, his Chinese counterpart.
	   Jan Jyh-horng, a deputy secretary general of Koo's semi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation, departed for China's commercial
capital Monday morning to make final preparations for the visit.
	   The Shanghai meeting will be the first between the elder
statesmen since the 1993 talks in Singapore that marked the first
formal contact between the sides since they split politically amid
civil war in 1949.
	   Based on an agreement they signed, the sides held talks on
practical issues such as recognition of legal documents, until
China backed out in June 1995 in anger over Taiwan's efforts to
raise its international profile.
	   China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to
foreign relations and refuses to recognize the government in
Taipei.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Nitric oxide, a colorless odorless gas,
is a common pollutant, formed by combustion of nitrogen such as in
automobile exhaust pipes.
	   The gas has a wide range of effects and potential applications,
according to the Karolinska Institute, which awarded the Nobel
Medicine Prize to three American researchers for their discoveries
about the gas.
	   Among its effects and applications, according to the prize
citation:
	   _ It acts as a weapon against infections, as a regulator of
blood pressure and as a gatekeeper of blood flow to different
organs. It controls blood pressure and its distribution, and also
prevents the formation of thrombi.
	   _ White blood cells use nitric oxide to not only to kill
infectious agents such as bacteria, fungi and parasites, but also
to defend the host against tumors. Scientists are currently testing
whether nitric oxide cane be used to stop the growth of tumors.
	   _ Nitric oxide can initiate erection of the penis by dilating
the blood vessels to the erectile bodies.
	   _ Nitric oxide is important for the olfactory sense and the
capacity to recognize different scents.

Thousands of East Timorese protest for second day

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Witnesses said police fired warning shots
at protesting prison inmates while thousands of East Timorese
demonstrated for a referendum on independence for the troubled
territory Monday.
	   Human rights activists said two prisoners at Dili's main
penitentiary were shot and wounded when they tried to escape as
protesters gathered outside.
	   Police and prison officials were not immediately available for
comment.
	   It was the second consecutive day of protest in the capital of
the former Portuguese colony.
	   As many as 15,000 demonstrators took part, demanding that a
referendum be held on East Timor's future.
	   They rejected an offer made by the Indonesian government, as
part of U.N.-sponsored talks with Portugal, to grant autonomy, not
independence, to the province.
	   The protesters were angered by a recent demand by East Timor
Gov. Jose Abilio Osorio Soares that civil servants in the province
support the autonomy proposal or be fired.
	   The protesters arrived in hundreds of cars and motorcycles from
several regencies in the morning and joined others already in the
East Timor capital, Dili.
	   Waving banners and chanting pro-independence slogans, the
protesters marched down several streets.
	   Stores, offices and schools were closed. Hundreds of riot police
blocked the crowd from entering the compound of the governor's
office. There were no reports of violence or arrests.
	   ``We will keep on protesting until the government responds to
our demands,'' said Leandro Isaac, a protest organizer.
	   He also threatened to hold a similar protest for the release of
jailed East Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao, who is now serving
a 30-year prison sentence in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
	   East Timor's Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo called for calm.
	   Belo was quoted by the official Antara news agency as saying
that people ``should respect the rights of the others ... and not
to be destructive.''
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after invading the previous
year during a civil war. The United Nations does not recognize
Indonesia's sovereignty over the half-island territory.

Third round of peace talks postponed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHE NKRUNZIZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The third round of talks aimed at
finding a peaceful solution to ethnic and political conflict in
Burundi has been postponed for a day or two, a spokesman for
mediator Julius Nyerere said Monday.
	   ``We are waiting for other members who will arrive this
afternoon from Bujumbura. We hope to begin the talks Tuesday,''
said Gen. Hashim Mbita.
	   But since Tuesday is the 37th anniversary of the assassination
in Bujumbura of Prince Louis Rwagasore, the prime
minister-designate following elections in September 1961 that paved
the way for independence from Belgium a year later, it is unlikely
that the talks will get underway before Wednesday.
	   They were to have begun Monday, but under a veiled threat of a
government pullout if sanctions imposed by neighboring countries on
Burundi two years ago when President Pierre Buyoya seized power
were not lifted.
	   Sources close to former Tanzanian President Nyerere say he was
not keen on lifting the sanctions until he sees how Buyoya's
government performs at the latest round of talks.
	   The first round opened in June, and was followed by another in
July when a cease-fire more or less took hold in most of the
country.
	   The sanctions were imposed to force Buyoya, a retired Tutsi
military officer who had previously served as president from 1987
to 1993, to return to a constitutional regime and begin talks with
Hutu rebels.
	   Buyoya claims those conditions have been met and that the
holding of the talks in which all major political parties and rebel
groups are represented is proof.
	   Mbita said heads of delegations were holding informal meetings
with Nyerere.
	   At least 200,000 people died since October 1993 when Tutsi
paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first democratically elected
president, Hutu Melchior Ndadaye.
	   There were initial widespread reprisals by majority Hutus
against minority Tutsis, but because the Tutsis control the army,
they seized the upper hand and drove many Hutus out of Bujumbura,
the capital and largest city in the tiny central African nation.
	   Buyoya said he intervened in July 1996 to staunch the bloodshed
after a coalition government was unable to control the situation.

Thousands of high school students protest poor conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of high school students were marching
through Paris Monday to demand that the government take measures to
increase the number of teachers and provide better equipment.
	   The students, chanting and holding banners, set off at midday
from squares in the east and south of the city, and headed for the
Education Ministry, where they planned to rally in the late
afternoon.
	   Students have been protesting in a number of French cities over
the last 10 days, barely weeks after starting the new school year.
Monday's demonstration was the first in the capital.
	   Education Minister Claude Allegre said he understood the
students' concerns, but suggested they be patient.
	   ``What can be done quickly will be done quickly,'' Allegre told
reporters Monday.
	   ``There will be improvements _ but Paris wasn't built in a
day.''

SAfrica stadium calls for better training after violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Officials at Ellis Park
stadium on Monday called for better training of security staff
after weekend violence injured six people and caused up to 250,000
rand (dlrs 43,000) in damage.
	   The violence occurred when fans charged into the central
Johannesburg stadium to see a Premier Soccer League clash Saturday
night between arch rivals Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs.
	   The rampaging fans set fire to ticket offices, ripped down gates
and stoned security officials, filling the 60,000-capacity stadium
to about 80,000.
	   ``We have requested the PSL send their staff on better training
courses so that they know how to handle these things,'' said Louis
Luyt Jr., stadium manager and son of former South African rugby
chief Louis Luyt.
	   Security is shared between stadium and league staff, but Luyt
said many of the league security officers fled their posts in the
face of the mob.
	   Police called in to quell the disturbance used stun grenades and
rubber bullets. During the fracas two civilians and four police
officers were injured.
	   Unlike in many parts of Europe, soccer hooliganism is rare in
South Africa. Luyt said this was the worst incident of its kind in
Ellis Park's history.
	   Trouble started after ticketless fans broke into the stadium and
filled all the empty seats. Fans with tickets were then barred from
the stadium, triggering the riot as the outraged supporters broke
inside.
	   The game ended in a goal-less draw.

Germany backs airstrikes in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's outgoing
government said Monday it intends to allow German warplanes to take
part in any airstrikes in Kosovo.
	   A Cabinet meeting later Monday will approve that decision and
also back a NATO order authorizing alliance military commanders to
launch an attack, Kohl's chief of staff Friedrich Bohl said.
	   Germany's role in any airstrikes has been in question since the
left's Sept. 27 election victory.
	   But Kohl and Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder met Monday and
agreed that the old government should take the initiative, Bohl
said.
	   Since parliament must approve Germany's participation in NATO
strikes, outgoing lawmakers will be called into session Friday to
vote on Germany's offer to NATO of 14 Tornado warplanes, Bohl said.
	   Approval seems assured because both major parties, the Social
Democrats and Kohl's Christian Democrats, largely support
committing German troops.
	   The timetable allows Germany's future governing partners _
Schroeder's Social Democrats and the Greens party _ to skirt a
potentially divisive issue.
	   Kohl formally remains in power until Schroeder takes office Oct.
27, a day after the new parliament convenes.
	   The Greens approve of NATO airstrikes, but they have rejected
German participation without a clear U.N. mandate.
	   Angelika Beer, the party's defense expert, warned the old
government in a newspaper interview published Monday against
pre-empting the new government from making a decision on German
participation in airstrikes.
	   Leaders of the Social Democrats and Greens were meeting later
Monday to hash out common foreign policy goals, one of the toughest
topics in forming a new center-left government.

Americans ordered out of Serb-held half of Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ All American officials were
ordered out of the Serb-held half of Bosnia on Monday, ahead of
possible NATO military intervention in neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   The precautions were prompted by the worsening crisis in
Yugoslavia, which faces possible NATO airstrikes following a
continuing military crackdown in the embattled province of Kosovo.
A decision on airstrikes is expected in the next few days.
	   ``All official Americans have been ordered to withdraw from the
Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia-Herzegovina and to remain outside
the Republika Srpska until further notice,'' said a travel warning
issued by the U.S. Embassy here.
	   ``The U.S. Embassy strongly advises non-official U.S. citizens
to leave the Republika Srpska now,'' the advisory added.
	   It said the U.S. State Department is expected to issue a revised
travel warning for Bosnia-Herzegovina later today. It would warn
U.S. citizens of ``increased danger'' in the Serb-held half of
Bosnia due to potential ``retaliation against U.S. citizens and
interests as members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) are considering military action against neighboring Serbia
and Montenegro.''
	   Due to the American holiday Columbus Day, no one was available
for comment at the U.S. Embassy or the biggest U.S. reconstruction
agency in Bosnia, the U.S. Agency for International Development.
	   Some American contractors started pulling their staffs out of
the Serb-held areas in Bosnia last week, sources said.
	   Yugoslav officials have vowed their military will retaliate in
case of any NATO actions. Serb hard-liners in Yugoslavia and Bosnia
are united by the goal of creating a greater Serbia, and Western
officials fear retaliation could spread into Bosnia.
	   There are hundreds, if not thousands, of American civilians
working in Bosnia for different agencies, humanitarian
organizations and reconstruction companies, and they would be easy
prey for retaliation.
	   A less likely target would be NATO-led peacekeepers, due to
their strength and higher security standards.
	   There are some 8,500 American soldiers in the 36,000-strong
multinational peace force in Bosnia.
	   Lt. Col. Stephen Kerrick, a spokesman for the American
peacekeeping contingent based in northern town of Tuzla, said he
was not aware of the new travel warning, but stressed U.S. troops
were ready to defend themselves and undertake necessary
counteractions if attacked.
	   ``We don't discuss our protection plans,'' he said. ``But we
continuously evaluate and assess the situation.''

Hoogovens workers, fearing layoffs, stage brief walkout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ About 500 Dutch steel workers
briefly walked out Monday at Koninklijke Hoogovens NV, where
hundreds of jobs depend on the company's pending decision to invest
in one unit.
	   Dutch union member Jos Duynhoven said the workers, from
Hoogovens' Lange Produkten (long products) unit, held a meeting
followed by a march from the factory to the company's headquarters
in the city of Beverwijk. They were back on the job by noon.
	   ``We demand that management makes a quick decision'' on whether
to go ahead with a new electric oven, an investment estimated to
cost 70-75 million guilders (dlrs 35-38 million), Duynhoven said.
	   The workers of Lange Produkten, which produces concrete and
malleable steel and employs around 700 people, gave Hoogovens
management a petition demanding that a final decision be made by
the end of the month.
	   The outcome and timing of that decision could trigger more work
actions, Duynhoven said.
	   Hoogovens spokesman Stefan de Krijger said the company was still
reviewing whether to buy the new equipment. Without it, union and
company officials say, hundreds of the units' employees may be out
of a job.

Three Americans win Nobel Medicine Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to ADD comment, TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three American researchers won the
Nobel Medicine Prize on Monday for discovering new properties of
nitric oxide, which is key to the anti-impotence drug Viagra and
has other applications ranging from treating heart disease to
shock.
	   The prestigious prize went to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J.
Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the State
University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro is at University of
California-Los Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas
Medical School in Houston.
	   The 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 978,000) prize is divided equally
among the three winners.
	   The researchers discovered that the colorless, odorless gas acts
as a messenger that tells blood vessels to relax and widen, which
lowers blood pressure.
	   Nitric oxide can trigger erection of the penis by dilating blood
vessels. The wildly popular Viagra is based on this effect.
	   The winners' research has sparked studies on a wide range of new
drugs, including those that can be used in the treatment of heart
problems and atherosclerosis and shock.
	   Studies of the gas have also shown that white blood cells use it
to kill infectious invaders, and that it also can defend against
tumors. This has led to tests to see whether nitric oxide could be
used to halt tumor growth.
	   ``It was a sensation that this simple common air pollutant ...
could exert important functions'' in animals and people, said the
Karolinska Institute, which awards the prize.
	   Their work touches on the personal life of Alfred Nobel, the
Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the
prizes in his will.
	   In later life, Nobel's physician told him to take nitroglycerin
_ one of the ingredients in dynamite _ to combat heart trouble.
``However, it would take 100 years until it was clarified that
nitroglycerin acts by releasing nitric oxide gas,'' the citation
noted.
	   The announcement is ``great news,'' said Dr. Gerald Levey, dean
of the UCLA School of Medicine. ``We were hoping he (Ignarro) would
win it. We thought he had a strong chance to win. It's well
deserved.''
	   Last year, the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the
University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of
prions, the rogue proteins identified as causing mad cow disease.
	   Winners usually aren't known outside the medical community,
although the list of laureates contains a few familiar names
including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA
researchers Francis Crick and James Watson.
	   Generally, they are researchers who have made discoveries that
sound small on paper but carry large consequences.
	   Among other well-known names to receive the prize is David
Baltimore, although he shared the prize in 1975, long before
becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS researchers.
	   Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may
not be familiar names, but what they won the prize for in 1979 is a
term known by most patients: computer-assisted tomography _ or CAT
scan.
	   The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be
announced this year.
	   Last week, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist Jose
Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the
economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.

Youths demand that foreign oil workers leave delta region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Youths who have been attacking oil
installations in Nigeria's southern delta region have ordered
foreign oil workers to leave the area by Monday, according to a
Lagos newspaper report.
	   A letter sent Sunday to foreign embassies urged them to ask
their nationals to leave by Monday, saying their safety could no
longer be guaranteed, the Vanguard newspaper reported.
	   The ethnic Ijaw youths also promised to step up activities
against oil companies in the region and to ``indefinitely'' sustain
their occupation of seized oil stations until their demands were
met.
	   The letter followed a week of angry protesters by the Ijaw
youths who have been attacking Shell sites in the oil-rich Niger
River delta region, trying to use Nigeria's dependence on petroleum
exports as leverage to force the government to pay attention to
their grievances.
	   On Thursday, the Anglo-Dutch giant Shell was forced to send a
notice to its crude buyers that it could not guarantee availability
of crude because of ``the shutdown of 378,000 barrels of crude
production from 15 flow stations.''
	   On Wednesday, armed protesters seized two helicopters belonging
to Shell Petroleum Development Company _ Shell's Nigerian joint
venture _ and took control of an oil rig.
	   Although rich in oil, the Niger River delta states are among the
poorest and most neglected in Nigeria. Ijaws make up a large
portion of the people of the delta region.
	   Basic infrastructure in towns and villages is often provided by
foreign oil companies operating in the area, because the government
has failed to provide paved roads, electricity and clean water.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _NATO positioned itself for airstrikes
on Yugoslavia Monday, preparing to give a pre-attack ``activation
order,'' should talks on Kosovo fail between the chief U.S.
troubleshooter and President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Ambassadors of the 16-member NATO were meeting informally in
Brussels pending the results of talks between U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke and Milosevic. If the Holbrooke talks failed, plans were
for the Brussels meeting to go formal, so it can issue an
``activation order'' _ the last military step before any strike can
be launched.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
other military hardware needed for an airstrike from member
countries to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize
its deployment over Yugoslavia.
	   Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering planes and
missiles launched.
	   As NATO met in Brussels, Holbrooke resumed talks with Milosevic
on defusing the Kosovo crisis and avoiding the threatened strikes.
	   Holbrooke described his earlier overnight meeting with Milosevic
as ``intense, indeed, and at times very heated.'' He said the
standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can only be
called an emergency.''
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the outgoing German government was to meet and
issue an expected approval of such a strike.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, which
could last ``several days.''
	   Foreign presence was being reduced in anticipation of NATO
action.
	   The last two vehicles of international team of U.S., Russian and
other diplomats observing events in Kosovo over the past months
left for neighboring Macedonia before midday, carrying Americans
and Europeans. Sources at the American embassy said all but 12
people would be evacuated from Belgrade to Budapest.
	   The German embassy was closed down Monday morning, while British
embassy staff were waiting for the outcome of the latest
Holbrooke-Milosevic talks.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a Yugoslav republic.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's request that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   The Belgrade daily Nasa Borba reported Monday that Milosevic was
reluctantly considering the demand, but there was no confirmation.
	   The U.N. Security Council demands include an immediate
cease-fire, a withdrawal of special troops in the province,
allowing refugees to return home and beginning talks with
independence-minded ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Milosevic's crackdown on the KLA has killed hundreds, and forced
at least 270,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   The Romanian government agreed to let NATO use its airspace in
an emergency, and Hungarian authorities were considering a similar
request from the organization.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, warned
neighboring countries Sunday that a NATO attack could turn the
Balkans into ``a powder keg.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov again expressed his
country's opposition to any NATO strike but said a military
response by Moscow to such an attack was ``out of the question.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.
	   Milosevic's office said Sunday that all U.N. conditions have
been met for a political settlement, but Washington disagrees.
	   Efforts to end the seven-month crisis intensified following
allegations that Serb police massacred scores of ethnic Albanian
refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will bring a humanitarian
disaster if thousands remain homeless by the first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. The U.S. administration
believes, however, that it does not need a new U.N. resolution for
the attacks.

into the Pacific Ocean have been confirmed dead, the Japanese
military said Monday.
	   The Air Self-Defense Forces said the pilots were identified
through DNA tests from pieces of their corpse found in waters where
the plane's debris was also floating.
	   Killed in the crash were 1st Lt. Tomohiro Suetake, 28, and 2nd
Lt. Masahiro Ogasawara, 26, said an official with the forces,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The McDonnell Douglas fighter crashed into the Pacific about 50
kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Misasa, northern Japan, Friday
night, he said.
	   The fighter was flying for Misawa from Chitose on Japan's
northern main island of Hokkaido after training exercises. Misawa
is 560 kilometers (350 miles) northwest of Tokyo.
	   The official said four fighters _ two F-4EJ fighters and two
Japan-developed F-1 fighters _ have crashed into the ocean since
April this year.
	   Four pilots have been killed, including Friday's crash, and two
ejected safely, he said. Defense officials are investigating the
cause of the crashes.

Georgian president says new pipeline to be finished soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A new route to transport Caspian Sea oil to the
West will be determined soon, pending clarification of ``technical
details,'' Georgia's president said Monday.
	   President Eduard Shevardnadze said in a television address that
discussions on the new route have entered the final stage, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Shevardnadze's comments came after the New York Times reported
Sunday that western oil companies are expected to announce Oct. 29
they will rely on Georgia's new Baku-Supsa pipeline, which runs
from the Caspian to the Black Sea through Azerbaijan and Georgia,
to move most of their oil.
	   ``Georgia will feel the significance of that oil,'' Shevardnadze
said, according to Interfax.
	   The Baku-Supsa pipeline will begin pumping oil by early 1999, he
said.
	   The United States government wants oil from the Caspian to flow
through a longer, as-yet unbuilt pipeline across Azerbaijan,
Georgia, and Turkey.
	   The U.S. thinks that pipeline would bind those countries closer
to the West, and make an oil route across Russia and Iran less
likely.
	   Caspian oil reserves are said to be the largest outside the
Middle East, but they remain relatively untapped because countries
with access to them have been struggling to get the expensive
projects off the ground.
	   Meanwhile, Turkish leaders said Monday that the pipeline through
Turkey would be built, insisting that the Bosporus Straits, through
which any oil from the Georgian route would have to pass, are too
crowded to manage the new flow of tankers.

Cargill aims to buy ailing Japanese food trader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Cargill Inc., the world's largest grain dealer,
plans to expand its operations in Japan by taking over a failed
food trader, the U.S. company said Monday.
	   Cargill will submit a plan to a Japanese court by March to buy
the remaining operations of Toshoku Ltd.
	   The deal would be the first in which a foreign company has come
to the aid of a Japanese firm undergoing bankruptcy procedures.
	   Toshoku filed for bankruptcy in December after investments at
its financial units went bad. Since March, managers appointed by
the Tokyo District Court have been trying to work out a way for the
company to pay off its debts.
	   Minnesota-based Cargill aims to make Toshoku a full subsidiary
but first needs permission from the court, Hideyo Suzuki, president
of Cargill Japan, told a news conference.
	   Cargill plans to expand its business in Japan through the
acquisition, Suzuki said. Toshoku specialized in trading grain,
feed and meat.
	   A funding plan for Toshuku is expected to be decided upon by the
spring of 2000, Suzuki said.

F.A. charges Hartson with misconduct for kicking teammate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ West Ham striker John Hartson was charged Monday
with misconduct by the Football Association for kicking teammate
Eyal Berkovic in the head in a training ground incident.
	   The Welsh international was fined 10,000 pounds (dlrs 17,000) by
West Ham last week, with Hammers manager Harry Redknapp saying he
hoped that was the end of the incident.
	   But after a review of the video which shows Hartson kicking a
prone Berkovic in the face, the F.A. decided to charge him with
misconduct.
	   Hartson has 14 days to respond to the charge.
	   The incident sparked outrage last week when a series of graphic
photographs published in the Mirror showed Hartson kicking Berkovic
the face during the leadup to West Ham's Sept. 28 match against
Southampton.
	   Berkovic, an Israel international, was quoted as saying he was
in agony and was unable to eat for two days after the incident.
	   He also said he was considering leaving West Ham because he
could not ``forgive and forget'' what Hartson had done.
	   ``If my head was a ball it would have been (kicked into) the top
corner of the net,'' Berkovic said.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Declaring a martyr of Auschwitz the first
Jewish-born saint of the modern era, Pope John Paul II said
Catholics should mark her saint's day as an annual commemoration of
all the Holocaust's murdered Jews.
	   The pope called Edith Stein an ``eminent daughter of Israel and
a faithful daughter of the church.''
	   ``In the martyr, Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, so many
differences meet and are resolved in peace,'' John Paul, using the
name Stein chose in the church, told the thousands filling St.
Peter's Square for Sunday's canonization.
	   It was a ceremony filled with remarkable gestures of
reconciliation: The Roman Catholic Church exerting all its
ceremony, pomp and grandeur in a tribute to a woman of Jewish
heritage. Relatives of Holocaust victims _ Stein's family _ sharing
a dais with the leader of Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Stein is believed to be the first Jewish-born saint since the
early days of the church, said the Rev. Simion Fernandez, who
oversaw the process toward canonization. Incomplete records and the
prevalence of conversions, voluntary and forced, make it impossible
to say for certain.
	   She was born into an Orthodox Jewish German family on Yom
Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, in 1891. An atheist, she
joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1922 and later became a
Carmelite nun.
	   In 1942, Adolf Hitler's regime ordered all the converts in the
Netherlands shipped to Auschwitz to punish the Dutch bishops for
speaking out against it.
	   Stein was offered a chance to escape deportation, the pope said,
but turned it down.
	   ``Why should I be excluded?'' he quoted her as saying.
	   ``If I cannot share the fate of my brothers and sisters, my life
is, in a certain way, destroyed.''
	   Stein was in a chapel praying with nuns of her order when the
Nazis came to arrest her.
	   Her sister, who had followed her into Catholicism, was among the
converts deported. They were killed at Auschwitz on Aug. 9.
	   ``We remember all of them today with profound respect,'' said
John Paul, whose voice stayed strong throughout the 2 1/2-hour
ceremony.
	   ``From now on, in celebrating the memory of our new saint, from
year to year we also cannot forget the Shoah, which slowly worked
at the elimination of a people, costing the lives of millions of
Jewish brothers and sisters,'' he declared, using the Hebrew word
for the Holocaust.
	   In Jerusalem, the Simon Wiesenthal Center protested Stein's
canonization.
	   ``She could in no way symbolize the Jewish martyrs of the
Holocaust because she chose to leave Judaism,'' said one center
official, Ephraim Zuroff.
	   In naming Stein a saint, the church credits her with having
performed a miracle: Interceding almost a half-century after her
death to save a toddler's life.
	   More than a decade ago, 2 1/2-year-old Teresia Benedicta
McCarthy of Brockton, Massachusetts, swallowed an overdose of
Tylenol and suffered such severe liver damage that she was put on a
priority list for a transplant. Then, overnight, she recovered.
	   Benedicta's doctor called the recovery miraculous, and the
church agreed _ saying the only explanation was the prayers that
the McCarthys and their friends offered to Stein.
	   Both Stein's and Benedicta's families, independently, had urged
that the church mark Stein's sainthood with a fuller accounting of
its actions before and during the Holocaust.
	   The family of Stein's grandnephew, Michael Biberstein of
Kensington, California, wrote the pope in August, the San Diego
Union-Tribune reported.
	   They praised John Paul for his ``goodwill to the Jewish people''
but said the past is ``still waiting to be fully acknowledged.''
	   In March, the Vatican issued a long-awaited statement of regret
that Catholics did not say and do more to stop Nazi persecution of
Jews, but praised the conduct of wartime pope Pius XII, whom some
accuse of failing to do enough.
	   Improving relations with Jews has been a tenet of John Paul's
papacy, as has been the creation of saints. More people have been
canonized during his papacy, which reaches its 20th anniversary on
Friday, than in any other.

U.S. bombers prepare for airstrikes amid marathon Kosovo talks

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _NATO positioned itself for airstrikes
on Yugoslavia Monday, preparing to give a pre-attack ``activation
order,'' should talks on Kosovo fail between the chief U.S.
troubleshooter and President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Ambassadors of the 16-member NATO were meeting informally in
Brussels pending the results of talks between U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke and Milosevic. If the Holbrooke talks failed, plans were
for the Brussels meeting to go formal, so it can issue an
``activation order'' _ an essential step, setting into motion the
airstrike machinery.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
other military hardware needed for an airstrike from member
countries to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize
its deployment over Yugoslavia.
	   Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering planes and
missiles launched.
	   As NATO met in Brussels, Holbrooke resumed talks with Milosevic
on defusing the Kosovo crisis and avoiding the threatened strikes.
	   Holbrooke described his earlier overnight meeting with Milosevic
as ``intense, indeed, and at times very heated.'' He said the
standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can only be
called an emergency.''
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the outgoing German government said it intends to
allow German warplanes to participate in any attack.

Troubled Korean Air unveils new safety programs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Its image and balance sheet damaged by
safety problems, Korean Air said Monday it will spend 150 billion
won (dlrs 111 million) to improve maintenance, pilot training and
navigation systems by the year 2000.
	   The announcement came three days after the government slapped
the South Korean flag carrier with a multimillion dollar penalty
for a series of recent accidents.
	   ``We'll thoroughly overhaul our safety systems,'' Lee Jong-wook,
a KAL spokesman, said. ``We accept the government's punitive action
and will do our best to dispel uneasiness among passengers.''
	   Korean Air, the world's 13th largest carrier, has come under
intense fire from the government after it has been involved in
seven accidents in just over two months.
	   As penalties, the government ordered the airliner to cut 15
percent of its domestic flights for six months beginning on Oct. 25
and suspended some of its Seoul-Tokyo flights.
	   The heaviest penalty in South Korean aviation history will cost
Korean Air dlrs 30 million to dlrs 37 million in lost revenue and
hurt the already money-losing airline's efforts to improve its
battered image and finances, analysts said.
	   Korean Air's net loss amounted to dlrs 753 million last year,
according to Barre International Ltd.
	   Korean Air said it plans to ground its airplanes beginning on
Thursday for a safety check and maintenance. About half of its 112
planes will have been grounded by year's end, it said.
	   The airline will introduce advanced management and safety
programs under a dlrs 14 million, three-year contract with Delta
Airlines of the United States beginning this year.
	   New high-tech equipment, including flight simulation and safety
alert systems, will be introduced to strengthen pilot training and
prevent more accidents, airline officials said.
	   Korean Air has had seven minor accidents since Aug. 5, when a
Boeing 747-400 passenger plane from Tokyo skidded off a rain-slick
runway in Seoul, injuring 22 people.
	   Most of the recent accidents were blamed on poor maintenance and
pilot training.
	   Disasters have plagued the airline since 1983, when one of its
747s _ Flight 007 _ was shot down after straying into Soviet air
space, killing all 269 people on board.
	   Korean Air Flight 801 slammed into a Guam hillside on Aug. 6,
1997, killing 229 people. Only 26 people aboard the Boeing 747
survived.
	   Industry analysts blame Korean Air's accident-prone records for
its lax safety programs. They also note that the carrier flies 14
different types of aircraft, more than most major carriers.
	   The latest government penalty is especially bad news for Korean
Air at a time when competition is heating up at home with an
industry newcomer, Asiana.
	   The airliner has struggled with rising fuel costs and the
decline of the value of Korean currency, the won, against the
dollar, which raises the cost of servicing the company's dlrs 4.5
billion in foreign debt.
	   Last year, Korean Air carried 46 percent of all passengers
traveling in and out of South Korea. Korean Air adopted its present
name in 1984. Until then, it was Korean Airlines, or KAL.

Eight soldiers, two Muslim militants killed in Kashmir violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ An Indian army patrol jeep was blown up by a
land mine Monday in the restive Kashmir region, killing five
soldiers, near the site of a gunbattle that left dead three
soldiers and two militants, police said.
	   Police said alleged militants placed the land mine on a mountain
road in the Mughal Maidan area 225 kilometers (140 miles) northeast
of the state's winter capital of Jammu. Five wounded soldiers were
admitted to hospital, three with serious injuries.
	   Four more soldiers were injured in the gunbattle in a dense
forest near the village of Pasarkot in the Doda district, officials
said.
	   In the state's summer capital of Srinagar, suspected Muslim
militants exploded a hand grenade in a shopping center injuring at
least three people, police said. The grenade was aimed at a bunker
of paramilitary forces, but it missed the target and wounded
shoppers, police said.
	   Nearly a dozen Muslim rebel groups are fighting a secessionist
war in Jammu-Kashmir, India's northern frontier province, since
1989. They demand an independent Kashmir or choice to join
neighboring Pakistan, an Islamic state. Kashmir is the only Muslim
majority state in predominantly Hindu India.

Turkey and Greece join forces on Kosovo, but unable to talk about

own disputes &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ Traditional enemies Greece and Turkey
united Monday to pressure Yugoslavia into making concessions on
Kosovo, but the two neighbors have so far been unable to make any
headway on their own disputes such as Cyprus.
	   ``Considering the recent history of our region, a gathering of
all heads of state and government and of their ministers ... is an
achievement by itself,'' said Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
	   Although Greek Premier Costas Simitis agreed that ``it is highly
enouraging to meet and agree on further action,'' he added that
summits between Balkan leaders can ``only prove succesful in the
long run if we also tackle difficult problems which affect all of
us.''
	   Solving their own disputes is important if the two countries
hope to set an example for other leaders gathered in this
Mediterranean resort and help the turbulent region realize their
dream of European Union and NATO membership. Prime ministers from
Bulgaria, Macedonia and Romania are at the two-day summit as are
the foreign minister of Albania and observers from Bosnia and
Croatia.
	   All have joined to convince Yugoslavia to accept a reference to
Kosovo in their joint statement and avert its political ouster from
the Balkan initiative, but Greece and Turkey have been unable to
see eye-to-eye on their own disputes in the Aegean and war-divided
Cyprus. They have nearly gone to war three times in the past 24
years over those disputes.
	   War may be likely if Greek Cypriots go ahead with plans to
deploy Russian-made S-300 missiles next month. Turkey has said it
will use military force to prevent their installation. Athens has
said such an action would mean war between the two NATO allies.
	   Yilmaz and Simitis plan to meet on the sidelines and hold their
first meeting in nearly one year, and hopefully find a way to ease
tensions. A conflict between the region's two most powerful
countries would make the Kosovo crisis pale by comparison.
	   Cyprus is an issue on which Turkey does not fool around. It
invaded and occupied its northern third in 1974 in the wake of an
abortive Athens-backed coup by Greek-Cypriot supporters of union
with Greece. It retains more than 30,000 combat troops in the
Turkish Cypriot breakaway state, recognized only by Ankara.
	   Turkey's apparent determination to start a war with military
powerhouse Syria over its harboring of Turkish Kurdish insurgents
is indicative of the no-nonsense approach taken by its military,
which essentially pulls Ankara's foreign policy strings.
	   During the first Balkan summit on the Greek island of Crete last
year, Greece and Turkey agreed to revive a long-dormant
American-backed non-aggression pact. But in the 11 months that
followed, relations between European Union-member Greece and Turkey
hit rock bottom after the EU refused to consider Turkey for
membership.
	   ``None of us has the intention to insist on a bilateral dispute
or difference as a matter to dominate our consultations. On the
other hand, I believe we all agree that any problem affecting peace
and stability in our region or any issue which deeply affects any
one of us has to be discussed,'' said Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz.

Philippines approves anti-impotence drug Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines approved the use of
the anti-impotence drug Viagra Monday, possibly helping some 2.8
million Filipinos, officials said.
	   The Bureau of Food and Drug approved the drug after its
manufacturer completed a six-month study of its effects on 500 men
from six Asian countries, including the Philippines.
	   Pfizer, the manufacturer, will be able to sell Viagra in the
Philippines for three years, said bureau Director Quintin Kintanar.
	   Carlos Gasparian, Philippine representative of Pfizer said
Viagra will be available at local drugstores nationwide in the
first week of November for 450 pesos (dlrs 10.50) for each 50
milligram (0.002 ounce) pill.
	   A doctor's prescription will be required.
	   ``Viagra is a not a sexual stimulant,'' Gasparian told reporters

	   Dr. Sandra Torres, a Pfizer consultant, said the drug showed
tolerable side-effects under controlled conditions but warned the
drug should not be taken by people using nitrates drugs for heart
problems.
	   She said that the drug was found to be effective in about 70
percent or 46 out of 66 Filipino men who took it under the study.
	   Filipino have generally relied on traditional balms, herbs,
home-made concoctions and Chinese traditional medicine to deal with
impotence.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO positioned itself for
airstrikes on Yugoslavia, preparing Monday to give a pre-attack
``activation order,'' should talks on Kosovo fail between the chief
U.S. troubleshooter and President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Ambassadors of the 16-member NATO were meeting informally in
Brussels pending the results of talks between U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke and Milosevic. If the Holbrooke talks failed, plans were
for the Brussels meeting to go formal, so it can issue an
``activation order'' _ an essential step, setting into motion the
airstrike machinery.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
other military hardware needed for an airstrike from member
countries to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize
its deployment over Yugoslavia.
	   Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering planes and
missiles launched.
	   As NATO met in Brussels, Holbrooke resumed talks with Milosevic
on defusing the Kosovo crisis and avoiding the threatened strikes.
	   Holbrooke described his earlier overnight meeting with Milosevic
as ``intense, indeed, and at times very heated.'' He said the
standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can only be
called an emergency.''
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the outgoing German government said it intends to
allow German warplanes to participate in any attack.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide about 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, which
could last ``several days.''
	   Foreign presence was being reduced in anticipation of NATO
action.
	   The last two vehicles of international team of U.S., Russian and
other diplomats observing events in Kosovo over the past months
left for neighboring Macedonia before midday, carrying Americans
and Europeans. Sources at the American embassy said all but 12
people would be evacuated from Belgrade to Budapest.
	   The German embassy was closed down Monday morning, while British
embassy staff were waiting for the outcome of the latest
Holbrooke-Milosevic talks.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a Yugoslav republic.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's request that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   The Belgrade daily Nasa Borba reported Monday that Milosevic was
reluctantly considering the demand, but there was no confirmation.
	   The U.N. Security Council demands include an immediate
cease-fire, a withdrawal of special troops in the province, letting
refugees return home and beginning talks with independence-minded
ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Milosevic's crackdown on the KLA has killed hundreds, and forced
at least 270,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived Sunday in Britain and
a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to Italy.
	   The Romanian government agreed to let NATO use its airspace in
an emergency, and Hungarian authorities were considering a similar
request from the organization.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, warned
neighboring countries Sunday that a NATO attack could turn the
Balkans into ``a powder keg.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov again expressed his
country's opposition to any NATO strike but said a military
response by Moscow to such an attack was ``out of the question.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.
	   Milosevic's office said Sunday that all U.N. conditions have
been met for a political settlement, but Washington disagrees.
	   Efforts to end the seven-month crisis intensified following
allegations that Serb police massacred scores of ethnic Albanian
refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will bring a humanitarian
disaster if thousands remain homeless by the first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. The U.S. administration
believes, however, that it does not need a new U.N. resolution for
the attacks.

Italian president begins consultations to form new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: SUBS third graf ``If Scalfaro...'' to correct to six months
sted of weeks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Three days after the collapse of Premier Romano
Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president began calling in
political leaders Monday to try to reach a consensus on a new
government.
	   Following the talks, which are expected to last several days,
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi to try again with a
new majority. He could also name a new premier, or appoint a
government of technocrats.
	   If Scalfaro feels no candidate is capable of mustering a
majority, he could call early elections. Because the president
cannot dissolve Parliament during the last six months of his term,
elections would have to be scheduled by December.
	   Scalfaro has named Prodi as caretaker premier for the interim.
	   Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoked the
crisis when it withdrew support for the government over the 1999
deficit-cutting budget, which it said did not do enough to
stimulate job creation. Despite help from a breakaway faction of
the Communists, who on Sunday formed a new party, Prodi lost
Friday's vote of confidence by a single vote.
	   Prodi has said he won't take the job back unless his new
government could stick to the policies of its old one, an unlikely
scenario given the divided Parliament.
	   An alternative to Prodi could be Massimo D'Alema, leader of the
Democrats of the Left, the largest party in Prodi's coalition.
	   In the case of a so-called ``technical'' government, the names
of Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini have been circulated. A government of technicians
would get Italy through the volatile period of approving the 1999
budget and the launch of the common European currency, the euro, in
January 1999.
	   Prodi presided over cost cuts that got Italy into the debut of
the European Monetary Union, outlasting all but one other
post-World War II Italian government in the process.

Cargo jet burst tires and damage runway lights

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A cargo jet chartered by Emirates Airline that
burst two tires Monday when taking off from Hong Kong's new airport
damaged two runway lights after it was forced to return, officials
said.
	   The airport had to be shut down three times, they said. The
runway was first closed for 30 minutes after the Boeing 747 burst
its tires to check for any debris, and then again for a similar
period after the plane returned and hit two runway lights.
	   The airport was closed briefly for a third time later to inspect
the repairs.
	   The closures caused delays to 30 incoming and outgoing flights,
airport officials said.
	   An Emirates Airline employee said the cargo jet was bound for
Dubai, but it was not known what cargo it was carrying.
	   The U.S. dlrs 20.1 Chek Lap Kok airport opened in July on an
outlying island. Its opening was marred by computer and mechanical
glitches.

Italian Olympic Committee antidoping prosecutor resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The chief antidoping prosecutor of Italy's
Olympic Committee resigned Monday, the latest victim of a doping
scandal that has shaken Italian soccer.
	   Ugo Longo said ``difficult work conditions'' motivated his
decision.
	   Since the summer, Longo had been conducting one of four
inquiries into the use of banned substances by Italy's first
division soccer players. Investigators have reportedly discovered
that some tests were not complete and results of others might have
been hidden.
	   The doping debacle has already seen CONI president Mario
Pescante resign and the chief of CONI's Acqua Acetosa laboratory,
Emilio Gasbarrone, fired.
	   The Acqua Acetosa lab was shut down after an International
Olympic Committee (IOC) official deemed the facility
unsatisfactory.
	   Later Monday, Italy's players' union was scheduled to discuss a
possible six-month walkout to protest the handling of the
inquiries, which it sustains violate players' privacy.
	   AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman sparked the investigations in July
when he raised questions about the sudden muscular development of
certain players.

Thai police deport 270,000 foreigners to create jobs for Thais
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than 270,000 illegal foreign
workers have been deported since January as part of an effort to
free up jobs for unemployed Thai workers, police said.
	   In addition to the deportations, 34 people have been arrested on
charges of smuggling foreigners into the country while 111 others
were arrested on suspicion of housing them, said an immigration
department news release received Monday.
	   Despite the high number of deportees, only one employer was
arrested on charges of hiring illegal workers.
	   Thailand has been an economic magnet for much of Southeast Asia,
drawing poor workers from impoverished neighbors Myanmar, Cambodia
and Laos.
	   At the end of last year, Thailand had about 1 million illegal
immigrant workers, about 90 percent of them from neighboring
Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Some 200,000 won temporary legal status after registering with
the government last year.
	   Thai governments had long turned a blind eye to illegal foreign
workers. Some employers favor them because they are willing to work
for low wages and are less likely to complain about abuses.
	   But in the past year, the unemployment rate has risen
dramatically as more factories have closed amid a sharp economic
downturn.
	   More than a million Thais have become unemployed since the
region's currency crisis began in July 1997.
	   Employers in some industries have sought exemptions from the
foreign worker ban because they say Thais won't do hard manual
labor. Limited exemptions have been granted for some border areas
and in the rice-milling and fishing sectors.

Three Americans win Nobel Medicine Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to ADD comment from Karolinska Institute

jointly, ADD that Murad's prize-winning work was done while at
University of Virginia, ADD laureates' ages. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three American researchers won the
Nobel Medicine Prize on Monday for discovering new properties of
nitric oxide, which is key to the anti-impotence drug Viagra and
has other applications ranging from treating heart disease to
shock.
	   The prestigious prize went to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J.
Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott, 82, is a pharmacologist at the
State University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro, 57, is at
University of California-Los Angeles and Murad, 62, is at the
University of Texas Medical School in Houston.
	   The 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 978,000) prize is divided equally
among the three winners, who worked both independently of each
other and sometimes together.
	   The researchers' work led to the discovery that the colorless
gas acts as a messenger that tells blood vessels to relax and
widen, which lowers blood pressure.
	   Nitric oxide can trigger erection of the penis by dilating blood
vessels. The wildly popular Viagra is based on this effect.
	   The winners' research has sparked studies on a wide range of new
drugs, including those that can be used in the treatment of heart
problems and atherosclerosis and shock.
	   ``This is a new general principle ... which will help us to
develop lots of new medicines, for example ones that directly relax
or retain tension in muscles, as in the new impotence drug,
Viagra,'' said Hans Joernvall, professor of medical chemistry at
the Karolinska Institute.
	   Studies of the gas have also shown that white blood cells use it
to kill infectious invaders, and that it also can defend against
tumors. This has led to tests to see whether nitric oxide could be
used to halt tumor growth.
	   ``It was a sensation that this simple common air pollutant ...
could exert important functions'' in animals and people, said the
Karolinska Institute, which awards the prize.
	   Their work touches on the personal life of Alfred Nobel, the
Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the
prizes in his will.
	   In later life, Nobel's physician told him to take nitroglycerin
_ one of the ingredients in dynamite _ to combat heart trouble.
``However, it would take 100 years until it was clarified that
nitroglycerin acts by releasing nitric oxide gas,'' the citation
noted.
	   The announcement is ``great news,'' said Dr. Gerald Levey, dean
of the UCLA School of Medicine. ``We were hoping he (Ignarro) would
win it. We thought he had a strong chance to win. It's well
deserved.''
	   The prize citation said Murad, while at the University of
Virginia in 1977, made the discovery that nitroglycerin releases
nitric oxide and speculated that hormones might also act through
the gas.
	   In 1980, Furchgott concluded that blood vessels dilate because
the cells that line produce a signal molecule. Ignarro, working on
his own and with Furchgott, proved this molecule was nitric oxide.
	   Last year, the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the
University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of
prions, the rogue proteins identified as causing mad cow disease.
	   Winners usually aren't known outside the medical community,
although the list of laureates contains a few familiar names
including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA
researchers Francis Crick and James Watson.
	   The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be
announced this year.
	   Last week, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist Jose
Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the
economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.

	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Doctors ordered Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to cut short his trip to Central Asia for health reasons
Monday, and he agreed to return home a day early, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Yeltsin's aides said he was suffering from a respiratory
infection, had a fever and was being treated with antibiotics.
Yeltsin went ahead with talks with Kazak President Nursultan
Nazerbayev and would move up all his scheduled meetings before
returning home Monday evening, they said.
	   The 67-year-old Russian leader has a long history of health
problems, but the Kremlin said there were no plans to hospitalize
him.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said doctors insisted that
the president return to Moscow on Monday instead of Tuesday as
scheduled. The president agreed in part so that he could focus on
efforts to end fighting in the Serb province of Kosovo, Yakushkin
said.
	   ``Boris Yeltsin was against cutting short his visit to
Kazakstan, but he headed doctors' demands,'' Yakushkin said. ``The
president has a cold and a cough. You're supposed to stay in bed
when you have a cold.''
	   The announcement came shortly after Yeltsin arrived in Almaty,
Kazakstan's main city, from neighboring Uzbekistan.
	   Yeltsin appeared stiff and stumbled when he arrived in the Uzbek
capital of Tashkent on Sunday and later canceled his public
appearances. On Monday, he turned up more than an hour late for
talks with officials and abruptly cut short a scheduled news
conference.
	   The Russian leader has had a number of health problems in recent
years, including multiple heart bypass surgery two years ago,
although he insists he has no major health problems and will serve
out the remaining two years of his term.
	   Yeltsin has spent most of the last two months out of the Kremlin
despite the country's economic crisis, holding meetings in his
country home outside Moscow. The trip to Central Asia was his first
outside of Russia since May when he went to Britain for the Group
of Seven summit of industrialized countries.
	   Yeltsin was scheduled to hold talks in Kazakstan on Monday and
Tuesday. Yakushkin insisted that Yeltsin would eliminate his rest
time in Kazakstan so that he could still conduct all the meetings
on his schedule.
	   As he spoke, Yeltsin began his meeting with the Kazak president.
	   Yeltsin had to be supported by Uzbek President Islam Karimov
when he arrived in Tashkent on Sunday. He canceled his other public
events, saying he wasn't feeling well, but held one-on-one talks
with Karimov as scheduled.
	   Yakushkin and Yeltsin's doctor, Sergei Mironov, had said the
president was feeling better Monday, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   However, Yeltsin showed up one hour late for talks Monday
between Russian and Uzbek officials, catching only the last 20
minutes. He also cut short his scheduled 20-minute news conference
to just a few minutes.
	   Yeltsin read his brief statement in a strong voice, rarely
raising his eyes from the text. He walked away unaided, but was
closely flanked by bodyguards.
	   Following the talks, Yeltsin and Karimov signed a package of
agreements to boost economic and other ties.
	   ``We have agreed to establish closer cooperation in the
economic, political and military fields,'' Yeltsin said in his
statement.
	   Yeltsin's talks in Uzbekistan and Kazakstan were to have focused
on economic issues as well as concerns about fighting in
Afghanistan. The former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear an
influx of drugs, weapons and refugees as well as a possible
spillover of fighting from Afghanistan.
	   Yeltsin's opponents, including the Communists, have long charged
that Yeltsin's condition makes him unable to work and pushed for
his resignation. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov renewed this
call on Monday.
	   ``Yeltsin is unable to work more than two or three hours a
day,'' he said at a news conference in Moscow. ``He is even unable
to review guards of honour.''

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Nitric oxide, a colorless gas, is a
common pollutant, formed by combustion of nitrogen such as in
automobile exhaust pipes.
	   The gas has a wide range of effects and potential applications,
according to the Karolinska Institute, which awarded the Nobel
Medicine Prize to three American researchers for their discoveries
about the gas.
	   Among its effects and applications, according to the prize
citation:
	   _ It acts as a weapon against infections, as a regulator of
blood pressure and as a gatekeeper of blood flow to different
organs. It controls blood pressure and its distribution, and also
prevents the formation of thrombi.
	   _ White blood cells use nitric oxide to not only to kill
infectious agents such as bacteria, fungi and parasites, but also
to defend the host against tumors. Scientists are currently testing
whether nitric oxide cane be used to stop the growth of tumors.
	   _ Nitric oxide can initiate erection of the penis by dilating
the blood vessels to the erectile bodies.
	   _ Nitric oxide is important for the olfactory sense and the
capacity to recognize different scents.

EU warns Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain over social laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission on Monday gave
Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain two months to extend a system of
reduced railway fares to include migrant workers from other EU
countries, or face court action.
	   The Commission, the European Union's executive body, said
national law in these countries reserved reduced tariffs for large
families for people residing within their borders and denied them
to cross-border EU workers.
	   The Commission claimed such legislation violates EU law which
states that migrant workers and members of their families are
entitled to the same benefits as nationals of the country in which
they work.
	   The Commission issued a separate warning against Spain over
access to jobs in the public service.
	   Despite certain improvements in Spain's legislation, in practice
a majority of administrative jobs are reserved for Spanish
nationals, the Commission said.
	   Spain has two months to comply with EU law or the Commission
could take it to court.

NATO ready to approve order to bring air strikes closer

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO nations awaited word Monday from
Kosovo talks in Belgrade before deciding whether to take the last
military step before launching airstrikes against the Serbs.
	   Ambassadors from the 16 NATO members were meeting Monday at
headquarters in Belgium, while U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke
continued talks with Yugoslav Slobodan Milosevic in an urgent
attempt to persuade the Serb leader to abide by U.N. Security
Council demands in Kosovo.
	   If the Holbrooke talks fail, NATO is expected to approve an
activation order on Monday, the last military step before
airstrikes can be launched.
	   A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an
activation order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in
Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated
275,000 uprooted since February's crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over
Yugoslavia.
	   From then on Gen. Clark would no longer need any approval from
the 16 member nations and proceed only in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana, NATO officials said on condition
of anonymity.
	   ``We are heading toward decision time now,'' said the NATO
official. Solana and Holbrooke have been in close touch over the
past week.
	   The few days between any activation order and actual airstrikes
allow Milosevic more time to consider the consequences.
	   Almost all NATO members have cleared barriers to participating
in airstrikes. On Monday, the outgoing German government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was also expected to back potential NATO
airstrikes.
	   Prior to the activation order, NATO officials agreed on rules of
engagement, targeting, liaison with humanitarian organizations in
Kosovo and the safety of NATO troops in Bosnia.
	   The NATO alliance also reached common ground on a legal basis
for airstrikes over the weekend, removing uncertainty whether an
additional U.N. resolution was necessary.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a part of the Yugoslav republic.
	   On Monday, the alliance ambassadors were still hoping for a
change of mind on the part of Milosevic, but ``the latest
impression is that all is the same,'' said the NATO official.

Yeltsin cautiously optimistic about Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS TO UPDATE with Yeltsin reaxn, general saying Russia
may reconsider arms embargo; ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin is ``cautiously
optimistic'' that a peaceful solution can be found to the crisis in
the Serbian province of Kosovo, his spokesman said Monday.
	   But a Russian general warned that Moscow may reconsider its
support for the international arms embargo if Serb-led Yugoslavia
is targeted by NATO airstrikes, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Russia vehemently opposes airstrikes against Yugoslavia, a
traditional ally with which it shares a Slavic heritage and
Orthodox religion, and has been lobbying for a negotiated solution.
	   Yeltsin was buoyed by the fact that U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
was still in Belgrade talking with Serb officials, said his
spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin. Yeltsin was ``cautiously optimistic''
that chances for a peaceful solution have ``slightly increased,''
Yakushkin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Yakushkin said the Kosovo crisis was one of the reasons Yeltsin
agreed to cut short his trip to Central Asia. Doctors ordered him
to return to Moscow for health reasons.
	   The ``huge responsibility in connection with the situation
regarding Kosovo weighs on the president,'' Yakushkin said.
	   The head of the international military cooperation department of
the Russian Defense Ministry said Moscow may reconsider its support
for the international arms embargo if NATO takes action without
specific approval from the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``If the North Atlantic alliance uses force against Yugoslavia
without the sanction of the U.N. Security Council, Russia will have
the right to revise its attitude to the embargo on military
cooperation with Yugoslavia,'' Col.-Gen. Leonid Ivashov said,
according to Interfax.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said the Russian government
was still considering how it would respond if NATO went ahead with
airstrikes to force Serbia, the leading republic in Yugoslavia, to
end its violent crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province.
	   Ivanov said Sunday in Central Asia, where he is accompanying
Yeltsin on an official visit, that a Russian military response was
``out of the question.''
	   ``We continue to believe and not only to believe but also to do
everything to prevent the worst,'' he said on TV.
	   Russia has recalled its representative to NATO and its
ambassador to Belgium, where NATO has its headquarters, for
consultations. Foreign Ministry official Vladimir Chizov said their
return to Brussels will depend on developments, the Interfax news
agency reported Monday.
	   Chizov, director of the Foreign Ministry's Third European
Department, said Russia is staying in touch with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and members of the Contact Group on Yugoslavia.

Impeachment campaign against Yeltsin stalls again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The impeachment campaign against Boris Yeltsin
faltered again Monday, when a parliamentary commission failed to
reach agreement on the accusation of launching the unsuccessful war
in Chechnya.
	   ``All members of the commission agreed that the president had
exceeded his powers, but as to the accusation of the killings of
people in Chechnya, that question was not supported,'' commission
chairman Vadim Filimonov said.
	   The impeachment campaign by the Communist-led opposition began
long before the current economic crisis in Russia. It appears
likely to fail, as have several previous efforts, in part because
the constitution gives Yeltsin the upper hand in dealing with
parliament.
	   The commission was to complete its work Monday, but the lack of
agreement means a further delay in putting any impeachment motion
on parliament's agenda.
	   The commission has reached a verdict against Yeltsin on the
accusations of instigating the Soviet Union's collapse and sending
troops and tanks against hard-liners in the former Russian
parliament in October 1993.
	   ``Yeltsin has committed actions that have features of a grave
crime ... that is, high treason,'' read a commission report
obtained by The Associated Press.
	   Meanwhile, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov resumed his call
for Yeltsin to resign.
	   ``The greatest problem is that (Yeltsin) has had great
difficulty in finding his bearings for a very long time, and does
not realize what is actually happening in the country,'' Zyuganov
was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin was forced to cut short a trip to Central Asia on Monday
on his doctors' orders. Presidential aides said he was suffering
from a respiratory infection, had a fever and was being treated
with antibiotics.
	   An impeachment motion requires a two-thirds majority vote in
parliament's lower house, the State Duma. If it passed there, the
motion would then need to be approved by a two-thirds majority in
three other bodies: the upper house or Federation Council, and both
the Constitutional and Supreme Courts.
	   The development would be extremely unlikely, as both bodies are
largely made up of Yeltsin supporters.

Bowman to decide by end of month whether to return to Red Wings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Scotty Bowman said he will decide by the end of
October whether he will return as coach of the two-time defending
Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings.
	   ``I don't think it will linger past that,'' the 65-year-old Hall
of Fame coach told Booth Newspapers on Sunday from Buffalo, New
York.
	   ``While (Red Wings officials) have been patient, I know it's
important for them to have someone in place. Once the season
starts, it goes up and down in a hurry.''
	   Since leading the Red Wings to the Stanley Cup title in June,
Bowman has had doctors clear a partly blocked artery and replace
his left knee.
	   With one year left on his contract, Bowman has said his health
would dictate whether he returns to pursue an National Hockey
League-record ninth Stanley Cup.
	   On Sunday, Bowman said much of his decision about his coaching
career could rest in results of a physical he will undergo Friday
at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, a Detroit Hospital. A
stress test will reveal Bowman's progress since he underwent the
heart procedure in July.
	   Bowman is to attend Friday night's championship banner-raising
at Joe Louis Arena, then decide whether to retire soon thereafter.
	   ``I'll either be back right away or be gone right away,'' he
said.
	   In July, Bowman said, he offered to step aside and told Red
Wings general manager Ken Holland to consider hiring a replacement.
The response: ``He said, `No, take all the time you need to make
the decision,''' Bowman said.

Strawberry remains hospitalized
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Darryl Strawberry, once projected to released
from New York's Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center as early as
Sunday, is expected to remain hospitalized for at least two more
days.
	   ``He probably will be discharged in the next couple of days,''
said Jaime Gill, the administrator on duty Sunday at
Columbia-Presbyterian. She said the cancer-stricken New York
Yankees slugger remained in stable condition.
	   A 16-inch (40-centimeter) portion of 36-year-old outfielder's
large intestine was removed during a three-hour operation Oct. 3 to
get rid of a 2 1/2-inch (6.5-centimeter) cancerous tumor that
nearly obstructed his intestine.
	   Dr. Stuart Hershon, the Yankees' team physician, told The New
York Times that Strawberry was ``still weak'' and ``needs to get
his strength.''
	   ``He'll go home when he's ready,'' Hershon said.

Three Americans win Nobel Medicine Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 13 grafs to ADD quote from Murad and his
clarification that he never worked directly with the other
laureates. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three American researchers won the
Nobel Medicine Prize on Monday for discovering new properties of
nitric oxide, which is key to the anti-impotence drug Viagra and
has other applications ranging from treating heart disease to
shock.
	   The prestigious prize went to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J.
Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott, 82, is a pharmacologist at the
State University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro, 57, is at
University of California-Los Angeles and Murad, 62, is at the
University of Texas Medical School in Houston.
	   The 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 978,000) prize is divided equally
among the three winners, who worked both independently of each
other and sometimes together.
	   The researchers' work led to the discovery that the colorless
gas acts as a messenger that tells blood vessels to relax and
widen, which lowers blood pressure.
	   Nitric oxide can trigger erection of the penis by dilating blood
vessels. The wildly popular Viagra is based on this effect.
	   The winners' research has sparked studies on a wide range of new
drugs, including those that can be used in the treatment of heart
problems and atherosclerosis and shock.
	   ``This is a new general principle ... which will help us to
develop lots of new medicines, for example ones that directly relax
or retain tension in muscles, as in the new impotence drug,
Viagra,'' said Hans Joernvall, professor of medical chemistry at
the Karolinska Institute.
	   Studies of the gas have also shown that white blood cells use it
to kill infectious invaders, and that it also can defend against
tumors. This has led to tests to see whether nitric oxide could be
used to halt tumor growth.
	   ``It was a sensation that this simple common air pollutant ...
could exert important functions'' in animals and people, said the
Karolinska Institute, which awards the prize.
	   Their work touches on the personal life of Alfred Nobel, the
Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the
prizes in his will.
	   In later life, Nobel's physician told him to take nitroglycerin
_ one of the ingredients in dynamite _ to combat heart trouble.
``However, it would take 100 years until it was clarified that
nitroglycerin acts by releasing nitric oxide gas,'' the citation
noted.
	   Murad, contacted by the Swedish news agency TT, said the
announcement was a surprise. ``I can't say I expected this,'' he
said.
	   Murad said he had been aware of the other two laureates' work,
but had never done research with them.
	   The prize citation said Murad, while at the University of
Virginia in 1977, made the discovery that nitroglycerin releases
nitric oxide and speculated that hormones might also act through
the gas.
	   In 1980, Furchgott concluded that blood vessels dilate because
the cells that line produce a signal molecule. Ignarro, working on
his own and with Furchgott, proved this molecule was nitric oxide.
	   Last year, the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the
University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of
prions, the rogue proteins identified as causing mad cow disease.
	   Winners usually aren't known outside the medical community,
although the list of laureates contains a few familiar names
including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA
researchers Francis Crick and James Watson.
	   The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be
announced this year.
	   Last week, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist Jose
Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the
economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.

Pakistan stocks plunge as government scraps contract with Hub

raided &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's stock market tumbled 9.45
percent Monday as the Karachi Stock Exchange reacted violently to
the cancellation of a contract with the country's largest private
power company, dealers said.
	   The government also initiated criminal investigations against
senior officials of the Hub Power Company, which has denied the
corruption charges and said it will respond through its lawyers
once it receives formal notices from the authorities.
	   Late Monday the Hubco office in southern Karachi's posh Clifton
district was raided by federal officials who confiscated company
files, said company officials, who didn't want to be identified.
	   So far no one has been arrested, despite charges filed by the
government.
	   It's not clear whether the office was sealed or whether business
would continue to operate.
	   The premier Karachi Stock Exchange 100-share index slumped 89.07
points, or 9.45 percent, to 852.75 points by Monday's close. The
KSE index shed 159 points during the past week, the biggest fall
this year.
	   ``The Karachi index could hit an all time low owing to this
news,'' said Shakil Anwar, a dealer at Prudential Securities.
	   Hub Power 10-rupee shares fell 4.55 rupees to 9.50.
	   ``We should now forget about new fresh foreign investment in the
market for a long time to come. The individual investors and
institutions all have taken a severe beating,'' Anwar said.
	   Hub Power _ the second largest company listed on the exchange _
is considered a bellwether.
	   Pakistan's government also has warned that it is looking to
cancel or renegotiate contracts with other power companies.
	   The cancellation of the contract follows months of wrangling
between the government and Hub Power, in which Sharif accused the
largely British-owned company of charging inflated tariffs for
electricity it sell to the cash-strapped state utility. The
contract was signed by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's
government.
	   The government lodged two criminal cases of fraud, commissions
and electricity theft against senior company officials. Several key
officials of Ms. Bhutto former government also have been charged,
he said.
	   Sentiment is weak due to the country's crumbling economy,
political instability and government's dispute with the private
power companies, the said.
	   Cash-strapped Pakistan is scrambling for loans from
internationpromised
foreign loan and aid are not restored.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO positioned itself Monday for
airstrikes on Yugoslavia, preparing to authorize an attack should
talks on Kosovo fail between the chief U.S. troubleshooter and
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Ambassadors of the 16-member alliance were meeting informally
pending the results of talks between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
and Milosevic. If the talks produce no agreement, the officials in
Brussels were expected to vote on an ``activation order'' _ an
essential step setting into motion the airstrike machinery.
	   NATO still may not use force immediately, but a flurry of
diplomatic evacuations by Western nations from Yugoslavia added to
a sense that intervention is imminent barring a breakthrough in
negotiations.
	   Milosevic summoned a crew from state television to the White
Palace where talks with Holbrooke were being held, indicating he
was preparing a public statement. But it was not clear whether he
was ready to compromise in order to evade airstrikes.
	   The NATO order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
other military hardware needed for an airstrike from member
countries to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize
its deployment over Yugoslavia.
	   Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering
planes and missiles launched.
	   As NATO met in Brussels, Holbrooke resumed talks with Milosevic
on defusing the Kosovo crisis and avoiding the threatened strikes.
That meeting recessed by early afternoon and was to resume before
evening.
	   Holbrooke described his earlier overnight meeting with Milosevic
as ``intense, indeed, and at times very heated.'' He said the
standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can only be
called an emergency.''
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the outgoing German government said it intends to
allow German warplanes to participate in any attack.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, which
could last ``several days.''
	   Foreign presence was being reduced in anticipation of NATO
action.
	   Most of an international diplomats' mission observing events in
Kosovo left for neighboring Macedonia before midday. Sources at the
American Embassy in Belgrade said all but 12 foreign staff were
being evacuated to Budapest, and an embassy statement said personal
in ``non-emergency situations'' had left.
	   A State Department advisory urged all U.S. citizens to leave
Yugoslavia, and Americans in the Serb part of neighboring Bosnia
also were advised to leave.
	   The German and British embassy were closed down on Monday.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A power outage blacked out wide areas
of the main Luzon island for several hours Monday, disrupting
operations at Manila's international airport and at the
presidential palace.
	   A breakdown in two power plants and a major power transmission
line south of Manila caused the outage, the state-run National
Power Corporation said.
	   A Napocor official said they were investigating the cause of the
breakdown in the plants but said they did not suspect any sabotage.
	   It took at least five hours to restore power in Manila and most
other areas, officials said.
	   At the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, emergency
power generators failed to activate for at least 15 minutes,
halting cargo conveyor belts and preventing movable passageways to
be connected to planes at the passenger terminal.
	   Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said generators provided
power at the Malacanang presidential palace but many offices were
without power for hours.
	   President Joseph Estrada is on a four-day state visit in
Singapore.
	   A power crisis in 1992 during the term of President Corazon
Aquino caused up to 12 hours of outages in most of Luzon daily,
seriously hurting Manila's economy.

Prince Charles donates lithograph to aid Northern Ireland hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Prince Charles has donated one of his own
artworks to benefit the hospital that treated most of the victims
of Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist attack.
	   A signed and dated lithograph of one of the heir to the British
throne's watercolors of Windsor Castle will be auctioned Wednesday
in support of County Tyrone Hospital in Omagh, where an Aug. 15 car
bomb planted by IRA dissidents killed 29 people and wounded 370.
	   ``This is the first time a piece of art by Prince Charles has
been auctioned anywhere in the world, so we have not placed a
reserve price on it,'' said John de Vere White, Dublin's premier
auctioneer of fine art.
	   He said Christie's London office had previously valued the
lithograph at between 2,000 and 3,000 British pounds (dlrs 3,400 to
dlrs 5,100), though he said its rarity combined with the special
occasion was likely to attract a higher price.
	   Charles visited the hospital and the bomb-ravaged town of Omagh
three days after the attack. At the time, he noted that he
understood what its residents were going through, since his own
great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, was assassinated by Irish Republican
Army bombers in 1979.
	   Charles' artwork will be sold alongside some 200 other donated
works.
	   Organizers expect the auction to raise at least 50,000 pounds
(dlrs 85,000) for the hospital, which is facing likely cutbacks by
the British government.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ When fighting started in Kosovo
eight months ago, Jehona stopped going out to the cafes at night.
She was too sad, too depressed.
	   Now, with NATO threatening airstrikes against the Serbs for
their crackdown in Kosovo, the 25-year-old Jehona goes out drinking
with her friends every night. She is nervous but excited: At last,
it might be the end.
	   Cafes form the social heart of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo
province. Like everything else, they are segregated: Serbs have
their cafes, ethnic Albanians have theirs. And these days, the
ethnic Albanian cafes are packed with young people like Jehona who
are blowing off steam, soothing their nerves and waiting for
something to happen.
	   ``Everyone is going out,'' says Jehona, her brown eyes shining
as she lights her cigarette. ``It's crazy! Maybe they're drinking
to forget, or going out to see friends. Everyone is waiting for
D-Day. Maybe tonight is the last night.''
	   ``If I die, so what? I had a beautiful 22 years living in this
repression,'' says her friend Ilir, laughing.
	   Neither would give their full name.
	   They hope NATO will pressure President Slobodan Milosevic into
giving independence to Kosovo, a southern province in Serbia, the
republic that dominates Yugoslavia. They also hope that if NATO
drops bombs, Serbs won't attack them in the streets.
	   The talk around town is that Serbs will seek revenge on ethnic
Albanians the instant NATO acts.
	    &UR; ___
	   Serb cafe owner Predrag Ilic takes out a pistol and lays it on
the glossy, chrome-rimmed bar. Next, he reaches behind the bar,
pulls out a grenade and lays it next to the gun.
	   Sure, he has ethnic Albanian neighbors. Plenty of Serbs in
Pristina do. More Serbs live here than anywhere else in Kosovo,
60,000 out of the city population of 200,000. The two groups exist
on top of each other in the congested, hilly streets. But the
mingling stops there.
	   Separate bars. Separate stores. Separate schools. Ethnic
Albanians and Serbs even have separate taxi services.
	   What would happen if an ethnic Albanian, even one of his
neighbors, stepped into Ilic's cafe?
	   He draws a finger across his neck.
	   ``Albanians like me,'' he says. ``But I want to kill them all.''
	    &UR; ___
	   Ethnic Albanians aren't the only ones worried. Foreigners are
also a target, their situation worsening by the day.
	   Diplomats and humanitarian organizations have been packed and
ready to go for days, and many are leaving. On Monday, American,
Russian and European observers who have been monitoring Kosovo over
the last few months pulled out for neighboring Macedonia.
	   A flashpoint for Serb anger is the Grand Hotel, where
journalists from several NATO countries are staying: Italians,
Britons, Americans and others.
	   Every night, a crowd of drunks gathers outside. They scream
obscenities at the journalists inside, threatening to kill them and
smash their cars. Eventually they are chased away by official and
secret Serb police, who are stationed at the hotel to watch the
foreigners.
	   One blond Dutch journalist even went so far as to buy a bottle
of black hair dye so he could attract less attention on the street.
	    &UR; ____
	   There was a sense of hostility in Kosovo even before 1989, when
Milosevic revoked the province's autonomy and ethnic Albanians
started talking about independence.
	   The separate Serb and ethnic Albanian societies moved apart, and
the anger between the two sides grew hotter and hotter until it
exploded into war this year.
	   Now NATO threats, designed to force Milosevic to give the ethnic
Albanians back their autonomy, have strained this divided society
to the breaking point.
	   ``We were mixed before,'' says a 46-year-old Serb teacher who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But I don't know if we could be
together again.''

Distributor recalls batches of Heinz baby food
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Two batches of Heinz baby food have been
recalled in Hong Kong following a similar action in the United
States over worries they may contain high levels of lead, the
Health Department said Monday.
	   A statement said 14,000 jars of 4-ounce (110 gram) Vegetable
Chicken Dinner and 2.5-ounce (70 gram) Beginner Strained Carrots
were being recalled by the distributor in the territory.
	   It said the department has also taken some samples of Heinz
products for further testing.
	   Last week, Heinz officials in the United States said the traces
of lead pose little health risks.
	   The problem was discovered in a routine Food and Drug
Administration review of supermarket shelves. No illnesses have
been reported.

Muslim leaders around world call on armed groups to join truce
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Algerian government reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Thirty Muslim leaders from around the world have
appealed to Islamic insurgents in Algeria to join a truce called a
year ago, saying blind violence by fighters was helping to pervert
Islam.
	   ``We bless this noble, patriotic initiative,'' said a statement
obtained Monday.
	   A copy of the statement, dated Sunday, was obtained by The
Associated Press. The truce by the Islamic Salvation Army went into
effect on Oct. 1, 1997.
	   The statement called on Algerian authorities to use the truce to
``strengthen the bases for national global reconciliation.''
	   The statement was signed by Muslim leaders from Malaysia to
Morocco, and included diverse names on the list of 30 that included
activists like the head of Egypt's banned Muslim Brotherhood,
university professors and thinkers.
	   The signatories ``consider the truce ... a good work and a bold
patriotic position that has contributed in an appreciable manner to
diminishing the level of killings, destruction and attacks on
sacred laws,'' the statement said.
	   It added that the signatories agree that accusations of apostasy
by armed groups concerning fellow Muslims are an ``ignomy,''
leading to ``great evil.'' Blind killings, likewise, give ``the
enemies of Islam the occasion to deform (the religion) ....''
	   ``Islam always insists, even in cases of war ..., on preserving
the blood of non-combatants, particularly women, children and the
elderly,'' the statement said.
	   In Algeria, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdelaziz Sbaa said
Monday that authorities ``have long waited for a denunciation from
these personalities of terrorist acts committed in the name of
Islam.'' There was no indication the government was prepared to
take up the suggestion of transforming a military truce into a
political tool to resolve the crisis.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Armed Islamic Group,
the radical insurgency movement held responsible for numerous
massacres.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Hungary's foreign minister said Monday that
the weakness of Ukrainian companies was the main obstacle to
strengthening economic ties between the two countries.
	   On the second day of his two-day visit to Ukraine, Foreign
Minister Janos Martonyi said Hungary was nonetheless interested in
expanding economic ties.
	   ``Therefore, we have to resolve the issue of government
guarantees for our investments,'' Martonyi said.
	   Trade turnover between the two neighbors stands at a low dlrs
500 million to dlrs 530 million a year, Martonyi noted at a meeting
with Ukraine's deputy parliament speaker Adam Martyniuk, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   Martyniuk said parliament supported an expansion of ties with
Hungary and pledged speedy ratification of bilateral agreements
that Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma plans to sign during his
Oct. 27-28 visit to Budapest.
	   The Hungarian minister also met Monday with Kuchma, Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and Foreign Minister Borys Tarasiuk.
	   Tarasiuk said the two sides had discussed travel and trade
regulations that might be toughened if Hungary is accepted into the
European Union.
	   Kiev is concerned about the possible consequences of its East
European neighbors' membership in the EU and has been holding talks
with Poland, Hungary and EU member nations in an attempt to
minimize the impact.

earnings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand loses about 20 billion baht
(dlrs 500 million) annually in potential export earnings from
livestock because of diseases brought in by smuggled animals, a
Bangkok newspaper said Monday.
	   As many as 1 million heads of cattle have been smuggled from
Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia _ Thailand's neighboring countries _
into 26 provinces, and some have brought in such diseases as hoof
and mouth disease and anthrax, a bacterial infection, the Bangkok
Post reported.
	   The spread of such diseases among livestock in Thailand has
caused importing countries to look elsewhere for their supplies,
the report quoted Deputy Agriculture Minister Somchai Sunthornwat
as saying.
	   The agriculture ministry's livestock development department
hopes to be able to stop the import of all diseased animals and
eliminate hoof and mouth diseases by 2005, the newspaper said.
	   More than 1 billion baht (dlrs 25 million) have been spent
already over 10 years to combat the problem.
	   The Japan International Cooperation Agency and the United
Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization are now considering
making Thailand the center for animal disease control for the
region, the Post said.
	   Japanese officials will be visiting Thailand next month for
assessment before offering financial aid, it reported.

New terrorism czar has been on front lines for 25 years

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Richard Clarke is not a household name. And the
United States' new anti-terrorism czar hopes it stays that way.
	   Clarke assumed his new job earlier this year after spending the
last quarter-century battling terrorism on the international stage.
If he becomes recognizable, it probably means something went very
wrong.
	   Clarke, 47, welcomes the challenge.
	   ``I don't think I could get out of bed in the morning if I was
not motivated by something more than money,'' says the Boston-bred,
University of Pennsylvania and M.I.T.-educated statesman who's made
anti-terrorism his career.
	   Clarke's official title is national coordinator for security,
infrastructure protection and counter-terrorism, a newly created
federal position. He already is working on a proposed dlrs 2
billion domestic defense plan, prepping 120 cities to fight
terrorism.
	   ``I have a tough challenge,'' he acknowledged in an interview
with The Associated Press during a recent visit to New York. It was
a rare step into the public spotlight for a man who prefers the
shadows that often provide grist for fiction writers.
	   Clarke had been a Pentagon analyst and a key intelligence player
at the State Department and the White House. Watching the rise and
fall of Libyan and Palestinian groups convinced him, he says, that
terrorists never achieve their ultimate goals.
	   ``I think the groups after us now would be very wise to take the
path other terrorist groups have taken: Get out of the business,
get out of town,'' he says. ``Stop coming after us, because you
cannot win. We are a big country. We can take a lot of hits. We can
give back a hell of a lot more than they can send our way.''
	   After the 1996 midair explosion of TWA Flight 800 _ investigated
as a possible terrorist act _ the White House, law enforcement and
the military realized the need for a federal coordinator to respond
to a domestic terrorist attack.
	   Clarke, then special assistant to the president on terrorism,
was selected. His job: to coordinate the federal agencies
responsible for defending against chemical or biological attack,
mounting counter-terrorist maneuvers, and warding off possible
computer assaults.
	   The need for such planning appears to have grown.
	   The FBI opened 68 investigations into the threatened or actual
use of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear materials last
year, said a senior FBI official, Robert Blitzer, at a conference
in Washington last week. This year, more than 86 such FBI probes
had been opened as of last month.
	   Clarke told the conference that Attorney General Janet Reno
would unveil the new terrorism response plan this week and that it
includes state and local officials.
	   Clarke is known among colleagues for his powers of persuasion.
He ``has a talent for overcoming interagency problems and making
sure everyone is on board,'' said the deputy assistant director for
counter-terrorism for the FBI in Washington, Dale Watson.
	   Says Clarke: ``The front lines of defense are the FBI on the
streets, the CIA meeting sources in godforsaken countries, and the
Delta Force guys training for raids. I am back from the front line,
trying to make it possible for them to do what they do.''
	   When he entered government out of college, he worked to control
the proliferation of nuclear weapons. That ended when the Soviet
Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, touching off fears in Washington
that the Soviets might want to march through to the Middle East.
	   Clarke soon found himself an expert on the region, with his
expertise spreading quickly to include the Persian Gulf.
	   In the 1980s, he and colleagues crafted a campaign designed to
stop Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's suspected sponsorship of
terrorism. The campaign included flying airplanes over Libya to
create sonic booms and floating rafts onto its beaches to fake
landings by commandos.
	   ``It seemed to me at the time that booms were better than
bombs,'' Clarke said when asked about the campaign during a Senate
Foreign Relations Committee hearing.
	   At the start of the Gulf War, in 1991, Clarke headed the State
Department's political military bureau. He accompanied Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney and Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf to meet the
king of Saudi Arabia and ask for permission to station troops
there.
	   After the war, a bomb that killed six people and injured more
than 1,000 at New York's World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993,
brought a new urgency to U.S. efforts to combat terrorism.
	   President Bill Clinton now wants Clarke to try new tactics, such
as developing germ-warfare vaccines and battling terrorists in
cyberspace.
	   Clarke has already begun identifying where the United States is
vulnerable. He helped devise a plan earlier this year to have a
small team of hackers infiltrate the Pentagon's computers, just to
prove it could be done. It worked _ too well. In three days, the
team had gained control of the national military command center
computers.
	   ``If that can happen in the Pentagon, it can happen in power
grids and communications, markets and banks,'' he said. ``We are in
a new era. Warfare techniques have changed. The nation that invests
the money will win the next war.''
	   Protecting cities against terrorism, Clarke said, is attracting
some of the brightest minds in government _ much the way that
efforts to control nuclear weapons once did.
	   ``Some people say you can't fight City Hall. That is nonsense.
You can change things. You can make a difference,'' he says. ``In
my own little way I try to make that difference. And if you do the
right thing, an embassy won't blow up. People won't get killed. The
good guys will win occasionally.''

	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Doctors ordered Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to cut short his Central Asian trip because of a
respiratory infection and he agreed to return home Monday, a day
earlier than planned, officials said.
	   Yeltsin was suffering from tracheobronchitis, had a fever of
37.4 Celsius (99.3 Fahrenheit) and was being treated with
antibiotics, the president's doctors told the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin was to fly back to Moscow late Monday, rather than on
Tuesday as scheduled, but was going ahead with talks, including a
meeting with Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev. He planned to
move up all his scheduled meetings before returning home, aides
said.

U.S. economist says China should devalue the yuan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S. economist Jeffrey Sachs said Monday that
China should devalue its currency next year and criticized other
Asia exchange rates as unrealistic.
	   Beijing's rate was ``fraught with future trouble,'' Sachs,
director of the Harvard Institute of Development, told reporters at
the World Economic Forum's seventh annual East Asia Economic
Summit.
	   China's huge economy has become less competitive than many of
its Asian neighbors, where currencies have depreciated
significantly since the start of the regional crisis in the summer
of 1997.
	   Sachs said the Hong Kong dollar, pegged at 7.80 Hong Kong
dollars per U.S. dollar, has also reduced the territory's
competitiveness against its Southeast Asian counterparts.
	   Keeping the Chinese and Hong Kong currencies at their rates has
been considered crucial to preventing a repeated outbreak of Asian
currency devaluations, like those that set off the regional crisis.
	   Western and regional leaders have urged Beijing to keep its
exchange rate, despite falling growth in its giant economy. The
Chinese currency has been kept at 8.27 yuan to the dollar.
	   Other Asian currencies have received some respite from falling
values recently, with the greenback weakening significantly against
most regional denominations.
	   Sachs said the current dollar-yen exchange rate was unjustified
since economic fundamentals in both the United States and Japan had
deteriorated in the last few months.
	   ``The dollar shouldn't be weakening against the yen,'' he said,
arguing that a depreciation against European currencies was more
appropriate.
	   He said the yen's rapid appreciation against the U.S. currency
could have been caused by hedge funds _ squeezed by their creditors
_ unwinding their positions.
	   ``That suggests that the yen will depreciate again,'' he said,
adding that a U.S dollar valued at 115 yen ``is too strong.''
	   The dollar, which fell to as low as 111.45 last week, cost
116.72 yen late Monday in Tokyo.
	   Sachs argued that a strong yen, although seen boosting regional
currencies, would be counterproductive to Asia's recovery if
Japan's economy remained weak.
	   ``The bigger problem is a Japanese economy in recession,'' he
said.

	   --
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Retired Nigerian generals have asked the
military junta to ban current and former generals from running for
president in next year's elections, a newspaper said Monday.
	   A group of retired generals met with junta leader Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar last week in the capital, Abuja, ThisDay
newspaper said. The group told Abubakar that allowing generals to
run would taint Nigeria's democratization process.
	   The move would stave off the possible candidacy of Gen. Olusegun
Obasanjo, a former Nigerian military leader who is mulling a run
for the presidency. Obasanjo, who came to power in 1976 after a
failed coup attempt took the life of military leader Gen. Murtala
Muhammed, relinquished power and retired in 1979.
	   While he has yet to say whether he will run for office, Obasanjo
has met with leaders of one of Nigeria's leading party's, the
People's Democratic Party.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The government of the autonomous
region of Zanzibar has no plans to allow producers of alcoholic
beverages to sponsor sports clubs and competitions, the East
African said Monday.
	   The weekly newspaper said Minister of Information, Culture and
Youth Issa Mohammed said a ban on such sponsorships was in the best
interest of the majority of Zanzibaris, who are Muslim.
	   Some soccer clubs in Zanzibar and neighboring Pemba island had
petitioned
	   President Salmin Amour to lift the ban, which would allow them
to receive funds from breweries as do teams in mainland Tanzania.
	   The ban on advertising alcohol in Zanzibar forced the regional
government
	   to spend 50 million shillings (dlrs 66,000) to pay for the East
and Central African soccer championships last December after a
brewery was ruled out as a
	   sponsor.
	   Tanzania Breweries Ltd., which sponsors the national Union Super
League, has provided more than dlrs 200,000 worth of equipment and
cash grants to mainland clubs, the newspaper said.
	   It said negotiations were still ongoing with TBL over the
sponsorship of the third annual Zanzibar National Marathon.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyan teachers ignored President Daniel
arap Moi's call for them to work Monday as their strike for a raise
promised but not delivered entered its second week.
	   ``Strikers do not go back to work in response to public
political pronouncements, which are distinct from return-to-work
formulas,'' the Daily Nation on Monday quoted Kenya National Union
of Teachers official Mureu Kamau as saying.
	   KNUT officials were to meet Monday and Tuesday to discuss Moi's
request.
	   ``The strikers will remain out of class until they receive
official communication from the union's head office,'' KNUT
officials told the East African Standard newspaper.
	   The government has locked the union out of its headquarters.
	   It had promised raises of up to 200 percent last year when
teachers went on strike before general elections.
	   On Saturday at a ceremony marking Moi's 20 years in office, the
president
	   called on teachers to return to work Monday without conditions.
	   Education Minister Kalonzo Musyoka has said if the raises agreed
on last year were put into effect, 80 percent of his ministry's
1998-99 budget of 44 billion shillings (dlrs 733 million) would go
to pay salaries.
	   The strike by about 260,000 teachers has idled 7 million
students in primary and secondary school students.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ A pipeline carrying petrol burst
outside Durban on Monday, spilling at least 250,000 liters of fuel.
	   Repairs were underway and the line _ between Durban and
Johannesburg _ was expected to be running again by Tuesday, said
Petronet spokeswoman Sanet Knoetze. The cause of the break was not
yet known.
	   Environmentalists were called to help assess the damage.

Americans ordered out of Serb-held half of Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ All U.S. officials were
ordered out of the Serb-held half of Bosnia on Monday, ahead of
possible NATO military intervention in neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   The precautions were prompted by the worsening crisis in
Yugoslavia, which faces NATO airstrikes if it continues its
military crackdown in the embattled province of Kosovo. A decision
on airstrikes is expected in the next few days.
	   ``All official Americans have been ordered to withdraw from the
Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia-Herzegovina and to remain outside
the Republika Srpska until further notice,'' said a travel warning
issued by the U.S. Embassy here.
	   ``The U.S. Embassy strongly advises non-official U.S. citizens
to leave the Republika Srpska now,'' the advisory added.
	   It said the U.S. State Department is expected to issue a revised
travel warning for Bosnia-Herzegovina later Monday. It would warn
U.S. citizens of ``increased danger'' in the Serb-held half of
Bosnia due to potential ``retaliation against U.S. citizens and
interests as members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) are considering military action against neighboring Serbia
and Montenegro.''
	   Due to the American holiday Columbus Day, no one was available
for comment at the U.S. Embassy or the biggest U.S. reconstruction
agency in Bosnia, the U.S. Agency for International Development.
	   Yugoslav officials have vowed their military will retaliate in
case of any NATO actions. Serb hard-liners in Yugoslavia and Bosnia
are united by the goal of creating a greater Serbia, and Western
officials fear retaliation could spread into Bosnia.
	   There are hundreds, if not thousands, of American civilians
working in Bosnia for different agencies, humanitarian
organizations and reconstruction companies, and they would be easy
prey for retaliation.

Egypt relays message from Syria to Turkish president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Egypt pursued its efforts Monday to cool
off a crisis between Syria and Turkey over Kurdish rebels, as
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa held talks with Turkish
officials.
	   Moussa will relay a message from Syrian President Hafez Assad to
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Turkish officials said.
	   The daily Sabah claimed Monday that Syria had given in to
Turkish demands and agreed in the message to end its alleged
support of Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast.
	   But Foreign Minister Ismail Cem insisted that Turkey was
awaiting concrete steps from the Syrians rather than promises,
independent NTV television reported.
	   Iran is also trying to mediate in the crisis.
	   Ankara stepped up its rhetoric against Syria two weeks ago,
accusing Damascus of harboring Kurdish rebels and providing them
with financial and logistics support. It has demanded that Damascus
end its support and extradite their leaders. Syria has denied the
accusations.
	   Some 37,000 people have died in the Kurdish rebel war against
Ankara since 1984.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz raised the stakes in Ankara's
face-off with its southern neighbor on Sunday, saying: ``If Syria
does not come to its senses, it is our incumbent duty to bring the
world down on them ... It is our incumbent duty to poke out the
eyes of those who have eyes on our territory.''
	   Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said Sunday that Turkish forces
would conduct maneuvers along the Turkish-Syrian border in
November. There have been unconfirmed reports of a Turkish troop
buildup along the Syrian border.
	   Meanwhile, Tunisian Foreign Minister Said Bin Mustafa is
expected to hold talks with Assad in Damascus Monday.

U.S. mountaineer dies on Himalayan slopes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ An American alpinist died on the slopes
of Mt. Baruntse, the Nepalese tourism ministry said Monday.
	   Raoul Willie, a 45-year-old businessman from Aspen, Colorado,
died on Sunday after suffering from acute high altitude pulmonary
and cerebral edema near the base camp at 4,300 meters (14,200
feet).
	   Willie was part of a 12-member group led by Richard Jackson, 48,
of Basalt, Colorado, that was attempting to climb the 7,129 meters
high (23,525 feet) Mt. Baruntse.
	   Last week, a Greek mountaineer was reported missing on Mt.
Dhaulagiri.
	   The autumn mountaineering season on the Himalayas began Sept. 1.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Defense Minister Andrija Hebrang resigned
unexpectedly Monday, signifying a rift within President Franjo
Tudjman's ruling party.
	   Hebrang, who has been a devoted Tudjman supporter, also said he
would no longer head the medical team taking care of the
76-year-old Tudjman. In addition, he resigned the position of the
vice president of Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union.
	   In his letter to Tudjman, released by the state-run news agency
HINA, Hebrang made it clear that Tudjman's failure to uphold his
attempts to replace two of his associates prompted him to resign.
	   Hebrang did not name the two, although it has long been known
that Hebrang wanted to get rid of Markica Rebic, head of military
counter-intelligence, and Vlado Zagorac, who leads the ministry's
firm for arms purchases.

Three Americans win Nobel Prize for cardiovascular discovery

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three Americans won a Nobel prize on
Monday for discovering that nitric oxide acts as a signal for the
cardiovascular system, a role that's key to the anti-impotence drug
Viagra.
	   The finding also has other applications ranging from treating
heart disease to shock.
	   The Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine went to Robert F.
Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott, 82, is a
pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn,
Ignarro, 57, is at University of California-Los Angeles and Murad,
62, is at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston.
	   The dlrs 978,000 prize is divided equally among the three
winners.
	   The researchers discovered that nitric oxide tells blood vessels
to relax and widen, an effect that helps control blood pressure.
	   Nitric oxide, a colorless gas, makes blood vessels dilate by
relaxing the vessels' smooth muscles. It can trigger erection of
the penis the same way, because the relaxation lets blood flow in.
The wildly popular Viagra is designed to increase nitric oxide's
effect.
	   The winners' research has sparked studies on a wide range of new
drugs, including those that can be used in the treatment of
atherosclerosis and shock.
	   Studies also show that white blood cells use the gas to kill
infectious invaders, and to defend against tumors. This has led to
tests to see whether nitric oxide could be used to halt tumor
growth.
	   ``It was a sensation that this simple common air pollutant ...
could exert important functions'' in animals and people, said the
Karolinska Institute, which awards the prize.
	   Nitric oxide is different from nitrous oxide, better known as
laughing gas.
	   The honored work touches on the personal life of Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established
the prizes in his will.
	   In later life, Nobel's physician told him to take nitroglycerin
_ one of the ingredients in dynamite _ to combat heart trouble.
``However, it would take 100 years until it was clarified that
nitroglycerin acts by releasing nitric oxide gas,'' the citation
noted.
	   Monday's announcement is ``great news,'' said Dr. Gerald Levey,
dean of the UCLA School of Medicine. ``We were hoping he (Ignarro)
would win it. We thought he had a strong chance to win. It's well
deserved.''
	   Murad, who worked independently of the other two winners, called
the announcement ``a delightful surprise.''
	   At first, scientists didn't think nitric oxide had so many
effects, he said, but ``a lot of researchers have now discovered
that nitric oxide does so many things and is so important.''
	   Furchgott, reached at his Long Island home, said ``I'm very
pleased. I truly wasn't sure I'd ever get an award like this. I
wasn't sure that I deserved it.''
	   He said he had planned to go to the dentist and possibly play
golf Monday, but ``I guess that's all changed now. I'll be
answering calls all day.''
	   He said he hasn't had enough time to think about what he would
do with his share of the dlrs 978,000,
	   ``I just want to get through breakfast. I've been trying to eat
it for the last 30 minutes.''
	   The prize citation said Murad, while at the University of
Virginia in 1977, discovered that nitroglycerin and other
vessel-dilating compounds release nitric oxide.
	   In 1980, Furchgott concluded that blood vessels dilate because
cells in their inner lining produce a signal molecule. Ignarro,
working on his own and with Furchgott, proved this molecule was
nitric oxide.
	   Last year, the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the
University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of
prions, the rogue proteins identified as causing mad cow disease
and other ailments.
	   Winners usually aren't known outside the medical community,
although the list of laureates contains a few familiar names
including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA
researchers Francis Crick and James Watson.
	   Generally, they are researchers who have made discoveries that
sound small on paper but carry large consequences.
	   Among other well-known names to receive the prize is David
Baltimore, although he shared the prize in 1975, long before
becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS researchers.
	   The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be
announced this year.
	   Last week, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist Jose
Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the
economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Tens and thousands of high school students marched
noisily through Paris and several French cities Monday to demand
that the government take measures to increase the number of
teachers and provide better equipment.
	   The students _ chanting ``Solidarity!'' _ set off at midday from
squares in the east and south of Paris, and headed for the
Education Ministry, where they planned to rally in the late
afternoon.
	   ``Through strikes you can dream,'' said stickers the students
slapped on lampposts and telephone boxes along the way. ``We're
angry students ... and fed up of the chaos,'' others sang.
	   Students have been protesting in a number of French cities over
the last 10 days, barely weeks after starting the new school year.
Monday's demonstration was the first in the capital. Protests were
held in more than a dozen cities.
	   Police patrolled the Paris demonstrations, which are often
marred by violence, but did not cut off traffic, leaving the
students to maneuver in and out of passing cars.
	   Police intervened to disperse hundreds of students who were
rampaging through a shopping center in Montparnasse, in southern
Paris. Dozens of others, their faces masked, stole from music shops
and bakeries, police said.
	   Nearby, a scooter was set on fire on a downtown avenue.
	   It was not immediately clear whether arrests had been made.
	   ``We hope there will be some improvements, but we probably won't
get everything we want,'' said 18-year-old student Mathieu Agneau.
	   Yaelle Dorison, 17, said her school was well equipped, but that
she was there to show solidarity with friends from a school outside
Paris that did not have computers.
	   Education Minister Claude Allegre said he understood the
students' concerns, but suggested they be patient.
	   ``What can be done quickly will be done quickly,'' Allegre told
reporters Monday.
	   ``There will be improvements _ but Paris wasn't built in a
day.''

	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ With leading opposition groups
boycotting the vote, Azerbaijan's authoritarian president looked
certain to be re-elected by voters seeking stability and
long-elusive prosperity for their oil-rich Caspian Sea nation.
	   Voters on Sunday chose between President Geidar Aliev, 75, and
five other candidates, most of whom were widely believed to be
running only to make the election appear competitive.
	   A spokesman for Aliev's campaign headquarters said that while
ballots were still being counted, ``it's already clear that
President Geidar Aliev has won,'' the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Turnout was high, with 78 percent of eligible voters casting
ballots, easily surpassing the 25 percent minimum turnout required
to validate the election, the Central Electoral Commission
reported.
	   Aliev's leading rival, Etibar Mamedov, accused the government
Monday of rigging the ballot and said he would go to court to
protest the results of the vote.
	   ``According to my information, Aliev got no more than 60
percent, but they are going to announce that he got 75,'' Mamedov
said at a news conference.
	   Other opposition leaders also cried foul. They said that the
electoral commission's announcement that results would not be known
for four days suggested Aliev's government would tamper with the
outcome.
	   Commission member Fuad Agayev said there were reports of
violations in several regions. In some cases, ballots were kept
outside polling stations and in Aliev's home Nakhichevan region,
the turnout was 100 percent, an impossibly high showing, Agayev
said.
	   Other commission members disagreed with Agayev, who represents
Mamedov, saying there were no serious violations. International
observers said they had noticed only a few minor technical
problems, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. More than 200
observers monitored the vote.
	   Voting was peaceful in the former Soviet republic of 7.5
million, which was once plagued by war and political chaos.
	   The stability that has taken hold in recent years appeared to be
working in favor of Aliev, who was Azerbaijan's KGB chief and then
Communist Party boss during the Soviet era and retook power in a
bloodless 1993 coup.
	   Aliev has overseen the development of Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea
oil fields, but chronic corruption and sagging world oil prices
have meant that the country has yet to enjoy the economic windfall
Aliev has been predicting for years.
	   The main opposition leaders decided to boycott the election,
saying that Aliev would stack the ballot in his favor.
	   If no candidate wins at least two-thirds of the vote, a second
round must be held. In the last elections that followed the 1993
coup, Aliev won with 98 percent support.

British Aerospace and Daimler Benz Aerospace talking merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Aerospace PLC is in merger talks with
Daimler-Benz Aerospace of Germany, the companies confirmed Monday
after the Financial Times reported the two planned to join forces
early next year.
	   The merger would be the beginning of the creation of a giant
pan-European defense contractor, the paper said.
	   In Munich, Daimler-Benz Aerospace said a merger deal needed to
be completed quickly to compete with U.S. companies.
	   The Financial Times said that after a year of negotiations
involving the big airplane makers and governments in Britain,
France, Germany, Sweden and Spain, a ``big bang'' merger of the
British and German companies with the French firm
Aerospatiale/Matra now seemed unlikely.
	   The main stumbling block, the newspaper said, was that
Aerospatiale/Matra is still partly government-owned and progress
toward full privatization has been slow.
	   The British and German companies oppose having a government as a
stakeholder in the new giant company, the paper said.
	   Daimler-Benz Aerospace spokesman Rainer Uhler said that while no
deadline has been set, the merger talks are now ``under great
pressure.''
	   ``It is possible we would merge with one partner,'' Uhler added,
in an apparent reference to the problem with the French company.
	   In a more cautiously worded statement, British Aerosapce said it
``has for some years been engaged in discussions about the possible
restructuring of the European aerospace and defense industry.''
	   ``These discussions naturally include talks with Dasa
(Daimler-Benz Aerospace), but it is too early to say whether any of
these discussions will result in definitive proposals,'' the
statement added.
	   The big European aircraft makers agreed in principle in March to
seek a merger to compete with the U.S. aerospace giants Boeing Co.
and Lockheed Martin Co.
	   The Financial Times said British Aerospace and Daimler-Benz
Aerospace would merge initially, setting up a holding company
probably registered as a Dutch company for tax reasons.
	   ``However, there would be an invitation to Aerospatiale to be
represented on its board, as a signal of its intent to be part of
the group eventually,'' the newspaper said.
	   Other European defense firms, including Saab AB in Sweden and
Finmeccanica in Italy, could also join the merger when they are
ready, the newspaper quoted an unidentified businessman involved in
the negotiations as saying.
	   The proposed merger between Lockheed Martin and Northrop Gumman
and last year's merger between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
has spurred the Europeans.
	   ``The aim is to create one of the world's biggest
aerospace/defense companies, so that in a few years' time we could
buy one of the U.S. giants,'' the Financial Times quoted an
unidentified negotiator as saying.
	   However, because of U.S. complaints about protectionist
overtones, the words ``Europe'' or ``Euro'' were unlikely to be in
the title of the new company, the newspaper said.
	   In December, the French, German and British governments directed
their respective Airbus operations to present a ``detailed plan''
for the development of a so-called ``Airbus-Plus.''

Turkey and Greece join forces on Kosovo, but unable to talk about

own disputes &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ Traditional enemies Greece and Turkey
united Monday to pressure Yugoslavia into making concessions on
Kosovo, but the two neighbors have so far been unable to make any
headway on their own disputes such as Cyprus.
	   Solving their own disputes is important if the two countries
hope to set an example for other leaders gathered in this
Mediterranean resort and help the turbulent region realize their
dream of European Union and NATO membership. Prime ministers from
Bulgaria, Macedonia and Romania are at the two-day summit as are
the foreign minister of Albania and observers from Bosnia and
Croatia.
	   ``Considering the recent history of our region, a gathering of
all heads of state and government and of their ministers ... is an
achievement by itself,'' said Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
	   Although Greek Premier Costas Simitis agreed that ``it is highly
encouraging to meet and agree on further action,'' he added that
summits between Balkan leaders can ``only prove successful in the
long run if we also tackle difficult problems which affect all of
us.''
	   All have joined to persuade Yugoslavia to accept a reference to
Kosovo in their joint statement and avert its political ouster from
the Balkan initiative, but Greece and Turkey have been unable to
see eye-to-eye on their own disputes in the Aegean and war-divided
Cyprus. They have nearly gone to war three times in the past 24
years over those disputes.
	   War may be likely if Greek Cypriots go ahead with plans to
deploy Russian-made S-300 missiles next month. Turkey has said it
will use military force to prevent their installation. Athens has
said such an action would mean war between the two NATO allies.
	   Yilmaz and Simitis plan to meet on the sidelines and hold their
first meeting in nearly one year, and hopefully find a way to ease
tensions. A conflict between the region's two most powerful
countries would make the Kosovo crisis pale by comparison.
	   Cyprus is an issue on which Turkey does not fool around. It
invaded and occupied its northern third in 1974 in the wake of an
abortive Athens-backed coup by Greek-Cypriot supporters of union
with Greece. It retains more than 30,000 combat troops in the
Turkish Cypriot breakaway state, recognized only by Ankara.
	   Turkey's apparent determination to start a war with military
powerhouse Syria over its harboring of Turkish Kurdish insurgents
is indicative of the no-nonsense approach taken by its military,
which essentially pulls Ankara's foreign policy strings.
	   During the first Balkan summit on the Greek island of Crete last
year, Greece and Turkey agreed to revive a long-dormant
American-backed nonaggression pact. But in the 11 months that
followed, relations between European Union-member Greece and Turkey
hit rock bottom after the EU refused to consider Turkey for
membership.
	   ``None of us has the intention to insist on a bilateral dispute
or difference as a matter to dominate our consultations. On the
other hand, I believe we all agree that any problem affecting peace
and stability in our region or any issue which deeply affects any
one of us has to be discussed,'' said Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz.

Bakayoko signs 4.5 million pound deal with Everton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Ibrahim Bakayoko became Everton
manager Walter Smith's latest acquisition Monday when the Ivory
Coast international signed a 4.5 million pound (dlrs 7.65 million)
transfer deal.
	   The 21-year-old striker signed a five-year contract to move from
Montpellier, where he earned a reputation as one of the leading
strikers in the French league over the last three years.
	   Everton is 14th in the Premier League standings with two wins
from eight matches but has not scored a goal in four home matches.
	   The signing of Bakayoko is Smith's latest bid to increase his
strike power and he could make his Premier League debut within
days.
	   Bakayoko is expected to be rushed into the Everton team for the
Merseyside derby clash against Liverpool at Goodison Park on
Saturday.
	   ``The Liverpool match could be my first game, and I can hardly
wait for it. I just want to get going and am looking forward for
the challenge,'' he said Monday.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Some 25 foreign firms are vying in Baghdad
for deals to sell agricultural machinery and implements to Iraq
under its oil deal with the United Nations.
	   The firms, exhibiting combine harvesters, tractors, sprayers,
seeders, planters, diggers and fertilizers, are hoping to win some
of the $250 million Iraq has earmarked to rehabilitate its
agriculture under the current phase of the oil program.
	   Waleed Abdulhadi of Iraq's Trade Fairs Directorate told The
Associated Press that ``ambitious deals'' were being struck during
the week-long exhibition, which started Thursday.
	   Finland's Valtra Valmet won a contract to sell 150 of its
combine harvesters to Iraq. Germany's Claas will sell 40 others.
	   Organizers said the current deals were exploratory and the firms
taking part will be given preferential treatment.
	   Four Italian firms were present. Their offer was a deal for the
export of 30,000 seeders and 100 tractors to Iraq.
	   Iraq sells the machines at a subsidised price to its farmers.
	   ___
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The Saudi French Bank, partly owned
by the Paris-based Banque Indosuez, made a profit of 364.2 million
riyals (dlrs 97 million) for the first nine months of this year,
the bank said in a statement Monday.
	   The profit was a 12 percent increase over profits of 324.9
million (dlrs 86.6 million) over the same period last year.
	   The statement said the increased profits were due to growth in
deposits and loans and the good performance of investments in Saudi
Arabia, the United States and Europe.
	   The Saudi French Bank, in which Banque Indosuez owns a 30
percent stake, is a leading commercial bank in Saudi Arabia. It is
listed on the local stock market.
	   ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Egypt will discuss the
feasibility of supplying the kingdom and the Palestinian
territories with natural gas through a pipeline, a senior Jordanian
Energy Ministry official said Monday.
	   Talks on the estimated dlrs 500 million pipeline and the gas
supply is expected to be discussed by Energy Minister Hani Mulqi
and his Egyptian counterpart during annual Jordanian-Egyptian
cooperation talks scheduled for next week in Amman.
	   The official said a foreign feasibility study presented to both
governments this year has said the plan is workable.
	   Details of the project have yet to be finalized.
	   Jordan produces natural gas from a al-Risheh field on the
eastern border with Iraq. But the gas generated covers only 30
percent of the country's needs.
	   ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The United States agreed Monday to give
Lebanon dlrs 130,000 to help finance a feasibility study for a
national center for a geographic information system.
	   The agreement was signed by Nabil al-Jisr, chairman of Lebanon's
state-run Council for Development and Reconstruction, and J. Joseph
Grandmaison, director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, a
council statement said.
	   The council is a government agency that coordinates
reconstruction projects in Lebanon, which is rebuilding from the
devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   To be completed within 10 months, the study will cost about dlrs
260,000, the statement said.
	   Half of the cost will be covered by the USTDA's gift and the
other half by a U.S. consulting agency, Geographic Planning
Collaborative, and the CDR, it added.
	   ___
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The Emirates telecom giant
Etisalat will increase its GSM capacity to 1 million subscribers by
mid-1999 and to 1.6 million by 2000, the company's chief executive
said in remarks published Monday.
	   Etisalat has 437,000 GSM subscribers and a capacity for a total
of 800,000, Ali al-Owais told the monthly Update magazine.
	   The GSM, or Global System for Mobile Communications, is the most
widely used mobile phone system around the world. It was introduced
in the Emirates in September 1994.
	   Al-Owais also said that the number of internet subscribers in
the country stands at 48,000, up from 218 in August 1995.
	   The present capacity is for 100,000 dial-up users and expansion
is under way for a capacity of 200,000 by 1999, he said.
	   Etisalat is the sole provider of mobile phone and internet
services in the Emirates.
	   The company is 60 percent owned by the government and 40 percent
by private investors.
	   ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon exported 255.7 billion Lebanese
pounds (dlrs 170.4 million) in industrial goods in the first nine
months of the year, a 9.2 percent drop from the same period last
year, published reports said Monday.
	   No reason was mentioned for the drop that came despite a 100
percent jump in capital investment in the same sector, statistics
published by the Beirut daily newspaper An-Nahar showed.
	   The main exports were chemical products, ready-made garments and
paper products.
	   Saudi Arabia was the major importer of Lebanese industrial
goods. It bought dlrs 36.8 million _ or 21.6 percent of the
exports, followed by France at dlrs 24.1 million, or 14.1 percent,
and Syria at dlrs 17.4 million, or 12 percent.
	   ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ India is to supply Iraq with agricultural
machinery and improve the country's power plants, the Nabdh
al-Shabab weekly reported Monday.
	   The agreement was signed in Baghdad during a visit by
Agriculture Minister Som Pal, the weekly said. It did not specify a
date nor did it say when India will begin exporting the equipment
to Iraq which is under an eight-year U.N. sanctions.
	   The weekly said the two countries also agreed to exchange
scientific experts in the fields of research and studies.
	   ``Indian engineering groups will conduct agricultural studies in
order to be involved in further cooperation in the fields of
advanced technology for the agricultural sector,'' the weekly
quoted Pal as saying. It gave no further details.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Some 216.5 billion pounds (dlrs 63.7
billion) were deposited in Egyptian banks in the 1997-98 fiscal
year, an increase of 7.9 percent, the Central Bank said in its
annual report released Monday.
	   Last year's deposits totaled 200.6 billion pounds (dlrs 59
billion).
	   Egypt's fiscal year starts July 1.
	   Some two-thirds of the deposits were at the four
government-owned banks, an increase of 5.4 billion pounds (dlrs 1.6
billion) or 4.3 percent from the previous year.
	   In the previous year, deposits at the four state-owned banks
rose 12.3 percent.
	   Foreign currency deposits in the same banks have risen by 1
percent to dlrs 7.8 billion compared to a drop of 7 percent last
year, the report said.
	   Loans extended by all banks in Egypt totaled 172.4 billion
pounds (dlrs 50.7 billion). The share of the four banks from these
loans was 81 billion pounds (dlrs 23.8 billion) with a growth rate
of 6.4 percent, compared to last year's growth rate of 11.4
percent, the report said.

League champion Seibu Lions 5-4 Monday in the league's last regular
season game.
	   Makoto Kosaka of the Marines drove in the winning run at Seibu
Dome in the top of the ninth with a sacrifice fly.
	   Warren, formerly with the Texas Rangers, was 2-1 with 0.93 ERA

at Yokohama.
	   Nomura had 14 homers this season and his team ended fifth in the
six-team league.
	   At Koshien Stadium, Yutaka Wada drew a bases-loaded walk in the

EU finance ministers look to contain financial turmoil

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers struggled
Monday to produce a strategy for containing the global market
crisis and prevent further outbreaks of such highly-contagious
financial turmoil.
	   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said he was
seeking EU support for strengthening international financial
institutions.
	   ``I am determined that Europe plays its full part in addressing
the weaknesses of the international financial system and
contributing to growth and stability around the world,'' Brown told
reporters as he arrived for the one-day meeting.
	   Outlining what he called a ``three-point action plan,'' Brown
called for a ``crisis prevention mechanism'' to ensure greater
openness in financial market so potential dangers could be detected
early. He also urged reinforcing the International Monetary Fund so
it can quickly to tackle emerging crises and suggested enhanced
supervisory regulation of the global finance system.
	   The EU meeting came as slower growth rates and fears of more
gloom spreading from Asia, Russia and South America take some of
the shine off preparations for the launch of the euro as the common
currency of 11 EU nations on Jan. 1.
	   So far, Europe has avoided the worst of the global crisis,
something German Finance Minister Theo Waigel put down to
confidence in a strong and stable euro and the strict budget
discipline nations must follow to join the euro-bloc.
	   ``In spite of all the problems in the world, the euro-zone is an
island of stability,'' Waigel told reporters. ``This is clear proof
that this process has been the right one.''
	   The EU's Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy predicted
at the start of the meeting ``in 1999 Europe will have the best
growth among the industrial powers.''
	   However, ministers face mounting pressure for action to halt any
further decline in growth, including calls for interest rate cuts
to help business.
	   Last week, the Spanish, Irish, Portuguese and British central
banks eased rates, but EU central bankers and a number of ministers
believe rates are low enough in core European economies such as
Germany and France.
	   ``The problem of bringing down rates is not one for Europe,''
said Irish Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy.
	   The ministers were likely to reject a proposal for the EU to
back loans to Russia by the Union's lending arm, the European
Investment Bank.
	   ``In the present situation in Russia ... it would not be serious
to give the EU budget guarantee to an EIB intervention in Russia,''
De Silguy told reporters.
	   The one-day EU meeting was the last for Waigel. Defeat in last
month's elections means the Bavarian conservative is stepping down
after almost 10 years at the helm of the EU's biggest economy.
	   As a parting shot, Waigel knocked home Germany's tough line over
plans to overhaul the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget from 2000 so the
Union can pay for it's planned expansion into eastern Europe.
	   Germany, along with Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, says it
pays too much into EU coffers and gets too little back in return.
Waigel insist any reform correct the imbalance.
	   ``There is a lack of burden sharing in the budget,'' he told a
news conference. ``This is something that cannot continue.''
	   Italian Tresury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi assured other
ministers the Friday's government collapse in Rome would not weaken
Italy's determination to cut debt and budget deficit. ``I have no
reason to believe that Italy won't continue to honor its pledges,''
De Silguy said.

security reasons, another diplomat said.

Portuguese authorities step up probe into public works corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Prime Minister Antonio Guterres met with
top legal officials Monday and agreed to set up a powerful new
anti-corruption unit in an effort to defuse pressure on his
government over a high-level kickback scandal.
	   The new bureau will immediately launch a sweeping probe into
recent allegations that political parties for years received
kickbacks in the awarding of public roadbuilding contracts, Lisbon
radio station TSF reported.
	   Officials said that later this week Guterres would unveil
details of a broad package of measures to combat corruption agreed
during his two-hour meeting with the Justice Minister and the
Attorney-General.
	   The illegal party financing scandal erupted when Garcia dos
Santos, the former head of the state-run national roadbuilder JAE,
alleged that officials and parties had received payoffs to grant
public works contracts to some construction companies.
	   Attorney-General Jose Cunha Rodrigues launched an investigation
into graft at the JAE after similar allegations from businessmen
four years ago.
	   However, he dropped the case a year later because of a lack of
evidence and complained of a lack of manpower to deepen the probe.
	   Garcia dos Santos, who quit as JAE President in June, was quoted
in weekly Expresso as alleging that members of the current
Socialist government knew about the corruption.
	   The allegations rocked Guterres's minority Socialist government
after Garcia dos Santos receved a personal letter from Finance
Minister Antonio Sousa Franco saying he knew of government members
who allegedly connived in the scam.
	   Sousa Franco said he had also informed the Attorney-General of
his suspicions.
	   Meanwhile, Infrastructure and Transport Minister Joao Cravinho
insisted that internal inquiries had found no evidence of
corruption in his ministry.
	   Sousa Franco and Cravinho had previously clashed over funding
for local authorities. Relations between the two ministers
reportedly are tense.
	   The current Socialist government, in office in 1995, and the
previous Social Democrat government have spent hundreds of millions
of dollars on roadbuilding programs since Portugual joined the
European Union in 1986.

Ukraine offering mediation services in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine is offering to mediate in the
Kosovo conflict and has already started discussing its offer with
Yugoslavia and the United States, Foreign Minister Borys Tarasiuk
said Monday.
	   Ukraine is prepared to participate in a mission to Kosovo by the
54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
Tarasiuk said. Ukrainian leaders have suggested former Foreign
Minister Hennady Udovenko as a possible mediator.
	   Ukraine says it would support NATO airstrikes against Serb
forces, provided that other possibilities to resolve the conflict
prove fruitless and the U.N. Security Council approves the use of
force.
	   ``Not all the possibilities for a peaceful solution have been
exhausted'' in Kosovo, a predominantly ethnic Albanian province in
Yugoslavia, Tarasiuk said. NATO is considering airstrikes there to
end the violent Serb crackdown.
	   The foreign minister also said Ukraine was consulting with
neighboring Russia over Kosovo and was ``well aware of all the
arguments and the Russian stance'' on the issue.
	   Russia opposes possible NATO attacks on Serbia, a traditional
ally with which it shares a Slavic heritage and Orthodox Christian
religion.

Chechen official: No trace found of British, New Zealand hostages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's security service is conducting a
round-the-clock search for three Britons and a New Zealander
kidnapped in the breakaway republic, but no trace of the hostages
has been found, the service's chief said Monday.
	   No ransom demands have been made for the four hostages,
Chechnya's acting Security Minister Aslambek Arsayev said.
	   Arsayev said that investigators believe the four may be held by
the same gang that kidnapped another high-profile hostage, Russian
presidential envoy Valentin Vlasov, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Vlasov, kidnapped on May 1, remains missing.
	   Chechnya's security forces launched a 10-day crackdown last
week, seeking to capture rebel armed groups and possibly find leads
to the hostages. A particularly thorough search is being conducted
in Chechnya's mountainous regions, where hostages are usually held,
Arsayev said.
	   Several suspects in other cases have been detained during the
operation, and dozens of firearms and more than 18 kilograms (about
40 pounds) of marijuana have been seized, he said. However, no
leads to the hostages have been found, Arsayev said.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped on Oct. 3.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Arsayev said previously that investigators believe the Britons
and the New Zealander are being moved from place to place by their
captors.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of its two-year war for independence from
Russia in 1996.

Ministers chastized for purchase of dlrs 40 million painting

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prime Minister Wim Kok, his
finance minister and the Dutch central bank chief were rebuked
Monday for buying a dlrs 40 million abstract painting with
taxpayers' money and donating it to a museum.
	   In a draft report, the national Court of Audit _ an independent
body that investigates government spending _ said the three
overstepped their bounds with the purchase of Piet Mondrian's
``Victory Boogie Woogie.''
	   Some art experts praise the painting as the pinnacle of the
Dutch master's career. But in a brief statement Monday, the Court
of Audit said it wasn't impressed that the government saw fit to
acquire it with public funds.
	   It did not give details of the draft report, which was to be
released Tuesday and presented to parliament for debate later this
week.
	   The high-profile purchase jolted the usually tranquil Dutch art
world and drew the ire of ordinary citizens when it was revealed
early last month that the private National Art Collection Funds
purchased the work with part of a donation of 110 million guilders
(dlrs 55 million) from the 1998 profits of the Central Bank.
	   At 80 million guilders (dlrs 40 million), the most expensive art
purchase ever funded by the Dutch state quickly aroused the
curiosity of the Court of Audit, which launched a preliminary
investigation.
	   Auditors since have concluded that the Central Bank may only
turn over excess cash to the state, and not directly to private
institutions, Dutch media reported Monday.
	   Kok, Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm and Dutch Central Bank
president Nout Wellink were singled out as responsible for what the
auditors characterized as an unauthorized and inappropriate
purchase.
	   Kok's office and the Finance Ministry were preparing official
responses to the report Monday and had no immediate reaction. The
Netherlands' political opposition, meanwhile, responded with anger.
	   ``As far as I'm concerned, parliament has to say that this must
never happen again,'' Kees Vendrik, a noted economist and member of
the environmentalist Green Left party, told the daily Het Parool.
	   Vendrik said the affair was ``extra spicey'' because the
purchase was authorized in August, while Kok was still forming a
new Cabinet, by a government that was technically in limbo after
spring elections.
	   In addition to their indignation over how it was bought, many
Dutchmen believe the 127-by-127-centimeter (51-by-51-inch)
unfinished painting simply wasn't worth the price tag.
	   The art fund that bought it calls it one of the most important
artworks of the 20th century, a rare expression of carefree joy to
emerge from the gloom of World War II.
	   The diamond-shaped collage of small squares in bold blues, reds
and yellows, was done in oil and black crayon with pieces of paper
and plastic. The Dutch master created it in New York between 1942
and his death in 1944.
	   ``Victory Boogie Woogie,'' which belonged to American magazine
publishing magnate S.I. Newhouse Jr. and had hung in a New York
apartment, has been added to the permanent collection of The Hague
Municipal Museum, already home to the largest Mondrian collection
in the world. It goes on display there Oct. 29.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO positioned itself Monday for
airstrikes on Yugoslavia, preparing to give a pre-attack
``activation order,'' should talks on Kosovo fail between the U.S.
envoy and President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Ambassadors of the 16-member NATO were meeting in Brussels
pending the results of talks between Richard Holbrooke and
Milosevic. If the talks failed, the officials in Brussels were
expected to vote on an ``activation order'' _ the last military
step before any military strike can be launched.
	   The NATO order would transfer command over the airplanes and
other military hardware needed for an airstrike from member
countries to Supreme Allied Cmdr. Wesley K. Clark and authorize the
deployment over Yugoslavia.
	   Clark could then, in consultation with NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana, order planes and missiles launched.
	   As NATO met in Brussels, Holbrooke resumed talks with Milosevic
on defusing the Kosovo crisis and avoiding the threatened strikes.
That meeting recessed early Monday afternoon and was to resume
before evening.
	   Holbrooke described his earlier overnight meeting with Milosevic
as ``intense, indeed, and at times very heated.'' He said the
standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can only be
called an emergency.''
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the German government said it intends to let
German warplanes participate in any attack.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide about 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes.
	   The foreign presence in Kosovo was being reduced in anticipation
of NATO action.
	   Most of an international diplomats' mission observing events in
Kosovo left for neighboring Macedonia before midday. Sources at the
U.S. Embassy in Belgrade said all but 12 foreign staff were being
evacuated to Budapest.
	   A U.S. State Department advisory urged all Americans to leave
Yugoslavia, and the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo asked Americans in the
Serb part of neighboring Bosnia to evacuate.
	   The German and British embassies also were closed Monday.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo, where 90 percent of the population is
ethnic Albanian, is a Serbian province in southern Yugoslavia.
	   The major obstacle appeared to be Holbrooke's request that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission in
Kosovo to verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security
Council.
	   The Belgrade daily Nasa Borba reported Monday that Milosevic was
reluctantly considering the demand, but there was no confirmation.
	   Other Security Council demands include an immediate cease-fire,
a withdrawal of special troops from Kosovo, allowing refugees to
return home and beginning talks with independence-minded ethnic
Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Milosevic's crackdown on the KLA has killed hundreds and forced
at least 270,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived Sunday in Britain and
a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to Italy.
	   The Romanian government agreed to let NATO use its airspace in
an emergency, and Hungarian authorities were considering a similar
request from the organization.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov again expressed his
country's opposition to any NATO strike but said a military
response by Moscow to such an attack was ``out of the question.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.
	   Milosevic's office said Sunday that all U.N. conditions have
been met for a political settlement, but Washington disagrees.
	   Efforts to end the crisis intensified following allegations that
Serb police massacred scores of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern
is mounting that winter will bring a humanitarian disaster if
thousands remain homeless by the first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. The U.S. administration
believes, however, that it does not need a new U.N. resolution for
the attacks.

German actor Bernhard Minetti dies at 93
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Bernhard Minetti, a German actor whose
career began in the Prussian State Theater in 1930 and spanned most
of this century, died on Monday. He was 93.
	   Minetti, who had appeared increasingly frail in recent years,
died in a Berlin hospital where he was admitted two weeks ago, a
spokeswoman for the Berlin Ensemble theater said. She said the
exact cause of death was not known.
	   Minetti was one of the last great German actors of the century.
He worked with such legendary German actors as Gustaf Gruendgens
and appear in most of Germany's best-known theaters.
	   Minetti was born in 1905 in Kehl, a small German town on the
Rhine river close to the French city of Strasbourg.
	   He appeared most recently with the Berlin Ensemble, playing the
role of an actor in ``The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui,'' a play by
Bertolt Brecht.
	   Minetti's most important roles included ``Krapp'' in Samuel
Beckett's ``Krapp's Last Tape,'' ``Faust'' in Goethe's version of
the classic, and ``Lear'' in Shakespeare's ``King Lear.''
	   Funeral plans were not immediately announced.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO nations awaited word Monday from
Kosovo talks in Belgrade before deciding whether to approve the
last military step needed to launch airstrikes against the Serbs.
	   Ambassadors from the 16 NATO members were meeting Monday at
headquarters in Belgium, while U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke
continued talks with Yugoslav Slobodan Milosevic in an urgent
attempt to persuade the Serb leader to abide by U.N. Security
Council demands in Kosovo.
	   If the Holbrooke talks fail, NATO is expected to approve an
activation order on Monday, the last military step before
airstrikes can be launched.
	   A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an
activation order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in
Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated
275,000 uprooted since February's crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over
Yugoslavia.
	   From then on, Gen. Clark would no longer need any approval from
the 16 member nations and proceed only in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana, NATO officials said on condition
of anonymity.
	   ``We are heading toward decision time now,'' said the NATO
official. Solana and Holbrooke have been in close touch over the
past week. The few days between any activation order and actual
airstrikes allow Milosevic more time to consider the consequences.
	   NATO authorities also met with Russian representatives at NATO
headquarters Monday in an ongoing attempt to keep Moscow informed
on the military preparations. Russia opposes airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, which is a traditional ally. Moscow has long been
lobbying for a negotiated solution and has threatened to veto any
U.N. resolution calling for airstrikes.
	   Almost all NATO members have cleared barriers to participating
in airstrikes. On Monday, the outgoing German government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was also expected to back potential NATO
airstrikes.
	   Prior to the activation order, NATO officials agreed on rules of
engagement, targeting, liaison with humanitarian organizations in
Kosovo and the safety of NATO troops in Bosnia.
	   The NATO alliance also reached common ground on a legal basis
for airstrikes over the weekend, removing uncertainty whether an
additional U.N. resolution was necessary.
	   The Americans, and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a part of the Yugoslav republic.
	   On Monday, the alliance ambassadors were still hoping for a
change of mind on the part of Milosevic, but ``the latest
impression is that all is the same,'' said the NATO official.

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Veteran Scotland goalkeeper Jim
Leighton retired from international soccer Monday, two days after
Scotland's come-from-behind 3-2 Euro 2000 win over Estonia.
	   Leighton, who turned 40 days after Scotland's France '98 World
Cup campaign ended with a 3-0 loss to Morocco, is the most capped
Scotland goalkeeper with 91 international matches to his credit.
	   Scotland manager Craig Brown announced Leighton's retirement at
a press conference Monday.
	   Leighton was involved in a series of mix-ups with veteran
defender Colin Hendry which led to Estonia's shock first goal at
Tyneside on Saturday.
	   The Aberdeen veteran, who reportedly wears glasses and false
teeth off the field, gave no reason for his decision to retire.
	   Leighton became the first Scot to appear in four World Cup
finals campaigns when he was selected for France '98. He played in
all Scotland's first-round World Cup matches, including a 2-1 loss
to 1994 champions Brazil, a loss to Morocco and a 1-1 tie with
Norway.
	   Leighton made his Scottish league debut with Aberdeen in 1978.
He moved into the Premier League with Manchester United from 1988
to 1991 and had stints with Arsenal, Dundee and Sheffield United
before returning to Scotland to play with Hibernian. He is now back
playing for Aberdeen.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton praised Bulgarians
on Monday for their reform efforts and encouraged women who are
trying to help create a new business culture in this former
communist country.
	   Mrs. Clinton met with businesswomen at a Sofia bakery and
discussed the challenges of running a business in Bulgaria before
leaving for the Czech Republic on the second day of a four-day trip
to promote women's rights in Eastern Europe.
	   ``We're very impressed by the reform effort and the difficult
decisions that your government is making on behalf of the future,''
the U.S. first lady told the women.
	   Mrs. Clinton also accepted an offer to let her book ``It Takes a
Village'' be translated and published into Bulgarian.
	   After talking Monday with students at the American College of
Sofia, the first lady flew later to Prague to meet with Czech
leaders and speak at a conference organized by President Vaclav
Havel and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel.
	   Mrs. Clinton met with some 500 students at the American College
of Sofia, where she also toured the school, talked to teachers and
alumni and looked at their computer laboratory.
	   ``I saw the future of Bulgaria in the eyes of the brilliant and
dynamic students I met at the American College of Sofia,'' she
said.
	   The college, established in 1860 while Bulgaria was still under
Turkish rule, was closed down in 1942 and turned into a police
training academy after the communists came to power. College alumni
were persecuted, but the school's book collection was preserved at
the local monastery and the college was resurrected in 1992.
	   Mrs. Clinton presented the college with 100 volumes of the
Library of America, containing the best works of famous American
writers, historians, philosophers and statesmen.
	   The students presented her with a book entitled ``Heroines of
History'' that contains a chapter about her.
	   In Prague, she met separately with Prime Minister Milos Zeman
and President Havel's wife, Dagmar, then was scheduled to meet the
Havels together, go to church and attend a gala dinner.
	   On Tuesday, she was scheduled to deliver a keynote speech at the
Forum 2000 conference before returning to Washington the same day.
	   The prestigious gathering of over 50 thinkers and political and
religious activists includes former U.S. Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, former Polish Premier Hana Suchocka and the chief rabbi
of Israel, Meir Lau.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three workers were injured Monday in a gas
explosion at a Russian shipyard and officials believe there could
be more victims buried under the debris.
	   The blast at the Admiralty Shipyard in St. Petersburg also
sparked a blaze that took more than two hours to extinguish. Rescue
teams are still searching for victims, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported, quoting local emergency officials.
	   Meanwhile, city prosecutors on Monday were carrying out a probe
into another explosion that occurred in St.Petersburg over the
weekend.
	   Dmitry Filippov, the head of the financial company Rosko, was
badly wounded by a bomb explosion at the entrance of his apartment
building on Saturday. He is in critical condition in a city
hospital.
	   His predecessor in the job was shot and killed two years ago.
	   Contract shootings and bombings have become customary in Russia
as mobsters wage turf battles and fight for control over profitable
businesses.

Sierra Leonean officers given death sentence for 1997 coup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A military court condemned 34
officers Monday to death by firing squad for crimes linked to the
bloody coup that toppled Sierra Leone's President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah in May last year.
	   The 34 were found guilty of treason, murder and other crimes
committed by the junta, which held sway for 10 months until Kabbah
was restored to power by a Nigerian-led West African intervention
force in March.
	   Three other officers were acquitted while another died in
custody during the court martial, which lasted more than two
months.
	   Military court president Col. Tom Carew ruled that the convicts
were among the chief architects of the May 25, 1997 coup.
	   Among the convicts is Col. F.Y. Koroma, the brother of former
junta leader Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, who has gone into hiding
in the eastern interior with the remnants of his ousted forces.
	   Last month 16 civilians were convicted of treason for
collaborating with the junta.
	   Another 38 civilians are on trial in separate cases for treason
connected with junta rule, while former rebel leader Foday Sankoh
is standing trial on various charges, including crimes against
humanity.
	   Although Kabbah's return was hailed as a victory for democracy
in West Africa, fighting between Kabbah's loyalist forces and
ousted junta fighters and their rebel allies has continued in the
country's east.
	   Hundreds of alleged opponents of Kabbah have been rounded up and
detained without charge on suspicion of aiding the rebellion.

Poland expecting record foreign investment level in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Direct foreign investment in Poland since
the end of communist rule is expected to reach the dlrs 30 billion
mark by the end of the year, a government official said Monday.
	   According to Wojciech Dziemanowicz of the Polish Foreign
Investment Agency, corporate investors brought about dlrs 6 billion
in the first nine months of 1998. An additional dlrs 3.4 billion
was expected by the end of the year, he said, which would make 1998
a record year for foreign investment.
	   While Dziemanowicz noted the pace of direct investment slowed in
recent months compared to earlier in the year, he said the pace was
unrelated to the Russian economic crisis that caused market
volatility in the region.
	   ``Interest among investors remains strong,'' he said.
	   Corporate investors distinguish Poland from Russia, unlike
portfolio investors who fled Polish holdings when the Russian
crisis began, said agency vice president Barbara Jarzembowska. She
said corporate investors view Poland as stable in political and
economic terms.
	   Last year, Poland received dlrs 6.6 billion in direct foreign
investment, which was the most for a single year among former
Soviet satellite countries in central and eastern Europe.
	   In a survey of 110 foreign investors conducted in June, foreign
companies gave Poland high marks for rapid economic growth, a
skilled and relatively inexpensive labor force, and good relations
between investors and local authorities, agency officials said.
	   They gave poor marks for the high level of payroll tax, the
state of roads and railways, and the customs service, according to
the survey.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Bernhard Minetti, a German actor whose
career began in the Prussian State Theater in 1930 and spanned most
of this century, died on Monday. He was 93.
	   Minetti, who had appeared increasingly frail in recent years,
died in a Berlin hospital where he was admitted two weeks ago, a
spokeswoman for the Berlin Ensemble theater said. She said the
exact cause of death was not known.
	   Minetti was one of the last great German actors of the century.
He worked with such legendary German actors as Gustaf Gruendgens
and appeared in most of Germany's best-known theaters.
	   Minetti was born Jan. 26, 1905 in Kiel in the northern German
state of Schleswig-Holstein.
	   He appeared most recently with the Berlin Ensemble, playing the
role of an actor in ``The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui,'' a play by
Bertolt Brecht.
	   Minetti's most important roles included ``Krapp'' in Samuel
Beckett's ``Krapp's Last Tape,'' ``Faust'' in Goethe's version of
the classic, and ``Lear'' in Shakespeare's ``King Lear.''
	   Funeral plans were not immediately announced.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three Americans won a Nobel prize on
Monday for discovering that the body uses nitric oxide to regulate
blood vessels, a finding that helped in developing the
anti-impotence drug Viagra.
	   The finding also has other applications ranging from treating
heart disease to shock.
	   The Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine went to Robert F.
Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott, 82, is a
pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn,
Ignarro, 57, is at University of California-Los Angeles and Murad,
62, is at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston.
	   The dlrs 978,000 prize is divided equally among the three
winners.
	   The researchers discovered that nitric oxide tells blood vessels
to relax and widen, an effect that helps control blood pressure.
	   Nitric oxide, a colorless gas, makes blood vessels dilate by
relaxing the vessels' smooth muscles. It can help trigger erection
of the penis the same way, because the relaxation lets blood flow
in. The wildly popular Viagra is designed to increase nitric
oxide's effect.
	   The prizewinning work, while important for science and medicine,
was ``a small piece of information'' that researchers used in
creating Viagra, said Mariann Caprino, spokeswoman for Viagra maker
Pfizer Inc.
	   The winners' research has sparked studies on a wide range of new
drugs, including those that can be used in the treatment of
atherosclerosis and shock.
	   Studies also show that white blood cells use the gas to kill
infectious invaders, and to defend against tumors. This has led to
tests to see whether nitric oxide could be used to halt tumor
growth.
	   ``It was a sensation that this simple common air pollutant ...
could exert important functions'' in animals and people, said the
Karolinska Institute, which awards the prize.
	   Nitric oxide is different from nitrous oxide, better known as
laughing gas.
	   The honored work touches on the personal life of Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established
the prizes in his will.
	   In later life, Nobel's physician told him to take nitroglycerin
_ one of the ingredients in dynamite _ to combat heart trouble.
``However, it would take 100 years until it was clarified that
nitroglycerin acts by releasing nitric oxide gas,'' the citation
noted.
	   Murad, who worked independently of the other two winners, called
the announcement ``a delightful surprise.''
	   At first, scientists didn't think nitric oxide had so many
effects, he said, but ``a lot of researchers have now discovered
that nitric oxide does so many things and is so important.''
	   Furchgott, reached at his Long Island home, said ``I'm very
pleased. I truly wasn't sure I'd ever get an award like this. I
wasn't sure that I deserved it.''
	   He said he had planned to go to the dentist and possibly play
golf today, but ``I guess that's all changed now. I'll be answering
calls all day.''
	   He said he hasn't had enough time to think about what he would
do with his $326,000 share of the prize.
	   ``I just want to get through breakfast. I've been trying to eat
it for the last 30 minutes.''
	   The prize citation said Murad, while at the University of
Virginia in 1977, discovered that nitroglycerin and other
vessel-dilating compounds release nitric oxide.
	   In 1980, Furchgott concluded that blood vessels dilate because
cells in their inner lining produce a signal molecule. Ignarro,
working on his own and with Furchgott, proved this molecule was
nitric oxide.
	   Last year, the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the
University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of
prions, the rogue proteins identified as causing mad cow disease
and other ailments.
	   Winners usually aren't known outside the medical community,
although the list of laureates contains a few familiar names
including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA
researchers Francis Crick and James Watson.
	   Generally, they are researchers who have made discoveries that
sound small on paper but carry large consequences.
	   Among other well-known names to receive the prize is David
Baltimore, although he shared the prize in 1975, long before
becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS researchers.
	   The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be
announced this year.
	   Last week, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist Jose
Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the
economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission said Monday it
will take Finland to court for failing to apply 1995 European
legislation on habitats for endangered animals and plants in its
province of Aland.
	   The Commission, the European Union's executive body, said
Finland is over three years late in implementing the EU law on
habitats in Aland, an island in the Baltic Sea between Finland and
Sweden.
	   Finland should have adopted the proper legislation when it
joined the EU on January 1, 1995, the Commission said.
	   ``With the exception of some hunting legislation, Finland has
not formally communicated any implementing legislation for (Aland),
which has legislative autonomy,'' the Commission noted.
	   The Swedish-speaking island of Aland belongs to an archipelago
of about 7,000 islands in the Baltic Sea. The group of islands is
part of Finland.

Lawyer: Former prison guard should be spared long sentence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A former Bosnian Muslim prison
guard charged with war crimes against Serb captives should get a
milder sentence because he suffers from mental problems worsened by
the war, his lawyer told a U.N. tribunal Monday.
	   The appeal came during the final phase of the months-long trial
of three Muslims and a Croat accused of atrocities at the Bosnian
government-run Celebici prison camp in 1992.
	   On trial are Hazim Delic, Celebici's deputy commander; Zdravko
Mucic, the camp's former commander; Esad Landzo, a former Celebici
guard; and Zejnil Delalic, who prosecutors claim had overall
responsibility for the camp.
	   All four defendants have pleaded innocent. If convicted, they
face maximum life sentences.
	   Although the three-judge panel at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal has not yet reached a verdict in the case, Monday's
hearing allowed lawyers to introduce evidence that could help
judges determine prison terms if the defendants are found guilty.
	   Landzo's lawyer, Cynthia McMurrey, was the first to present her
case, using arguments ranging from Landzo's supposed rehabilitation
to his fragile mental state during the war.
	   An expert witness testified that Landzo has a personality
disorder which was compounded by the trauma of war and eventually
led to diminished mental capacity, meaning he allegedly was unable
to exercise his own free will to disobey orders during the war or
to make decisions on his own.
	   In written arguments, Landzo's lawyers said his sentence _ if he
is convicted _ should not be longer than five years. They also
based their arguments on his age, 25; the fact that he had no
record before Celebici; and his voluntary surrender to the
tribunal.
	   Like all guards at Celebici, Landzo acted under the orders of
superiors in the camp, his lawyers said.
	   Prosecutors have said that Serbs held at the central Bosnia camp
were ``murdered, tortured, raped and beaten.'' A 49-page indictment
alleges that inmates were beaten with steel cables and wooden and
metal bars, burned with heated scissors, wrapped with fuses that
were then lit, and kept in vats of water. At least 14 died.
	   The Celebici trial, which began in March 1997, was expected to
last only several months but has dragged on for 19 months, in part
because the U.N. court has five other trials in progress.
	   Taking up sentencing arguments before a trial has ended is part
of the tribunal's new efforts to streamline and speed up its work.
Lawyers for the other defendants, as well as prosecutors, were also
scheduled to make sentencing arguments this week.

	   ROME (AP) _ After nearly 200 years in Poland, Leonardo da
Vinci's portrait ``Lady with Ermine,'' painted around 1490, will
return to Italy next week and go on display in various cities.
	   Rome will be the first city to host the art work starting
Thursday at the Quirinal Palace, the building that houses the
president's office.
	   Polish prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski bought the portrait as a
gift for his mother Isabella around 1800 while he was traveling in
Italy. Its temporary return from Poland is part of a cultural
exchange between the two countries.
	   The person portrayed in the painting is thought to be Cecilia
Gallerani, a striking figure at the Milan court, a friend of poets
and a poet herself. She is shown holding an ermine in her arms.

NATO ready to approve order to bring air strikes closer

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO nations awaited word Monday from
Kosovo talks in Belgrade before deciding whether to approve the
last military step needed to launch airstrikes against the Serbs.
	   Ambassadors from the 16 NATO members were meeting Monday at
headquarters in Belgium, while U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke
continued talks with Yugoslav Slobodan Milosevic in an urgent
attempt to persuade the Serb leader to abide by U.N. Security
Council demands in Kosovo.
	   If the Holbrooke talks fail, NATO is expected to approve an
activation order on Monday, the last military step before
airstrikes can be launched.
	   A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an
activation order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in
Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated
275,000 uprooted since February's crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over
Yugoslavia.
	   From then on, Gen. Clark would no longer need any approval from
the 16 member nations and proceed only in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana, NATO officials said on condition
of anonymity.
	   ``We are heading toward decision time now,'' said the NATO
official. Solana and Holbrooke have been in close touch over the
past week. The few days between any activation order and actual
airstrikes allow Milosevic more time to consider the consequences.
	   NATO authorities also met with Russian representatives at NATO
headquarters Monday in an ongoing attempt to keep Moscow informed
on the military preparations. Russia opposes airstrikes against
Yugoslavia and has long been lobbying for a negotiated solution.
Moscow has threatened to veto any U.N. resolution calling for
airstrikes.
	   Almost all NATO members have cleared barriers to participating
in airstrikes. On Monday, the outgoing German government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was also expected to back potential NATO
airstrikes.
	   Prior to the activation order, NATO officials agreed on rules of
engagement, targeting, liaison with humanitarian organizations in
Kosovo and the safety of NATO troops in Bosnia.
	   The NATO alliance also reached common ground on a legal basis
for airstrikes over the weekend, removing uncertainty whether an
additional U.N. resolution was necessary.
	   The Americans, and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a part of the Yugoslav republic.
	   On Monday, the alliance ambassadors were still hoping for a
change of mind on the part of Milosevic, but ``the latest
impression is that all is the same,'' said the NATO official.

Three Americans win Nobel Medicine Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with laureates' reaction, CLARIFY
importance to Viagra development. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three Americans won the Nobel Medicine
Prize Monday for discovering that the body uses nitric oxide to
regulate blood vessels, a finding that helped in developing the
anti-impotence drug Viagra.
	   The finding also has other applications ranging from treating
heart disease to shock.
	   The prestigious prize went to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J.
Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott, 82, is a pharmacologist at the
State University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro, 57, is at
University of California-Los Angeles and Murad, 62, is at the
University of Texas Medical School in Houston.
	   The 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 978,000) prize is divided equally
among the three winners, who worked both independently of each
other and sometimes together.
	   The researchers' work led to the discovery that the colorless
gas acts as a messenger that tells blood vessels to relax and
widen, which lowers blood pressure.
	   Nitric oxide can trigger erection of the penis by dilating blood
vessels. The wildly popular Viagra is designed to increase nitric
oxide's effect.
	   The prizewinning work, while important for science and medicine,
was ``a small piece of information'' that researchers used in
creating Viagra, said Mariann Caprino, spokeswoman for Viagra maker
Pfizer Inc.
	   The winners' research has sparked studies on a wide range of new
drugs, including those that can be used in the treatment of heart
problems and atherosclerosis and shock.
	   ``This is a new general principle ... which will help us to
develop lots of new medicines, for example ones that directly relax
or retain tension in muscles, as in the new impotence drug,
Viagra,'' said Hans Joernvall, professor of medical chemistry at
the Karolinska Institute.
	   Studies of the gas have also shown that white blood cells use it
to kill infectious invaders, and that it also can defend against
tumors. This has led to tests to see whether nitric oxide could be
used to halt tumor growth.
	   ``It was a sensation that this simple common air pollutant ...
could exert important functions'' in animals and people, said the
Karolinska Institute, which awards the prize.
	   Their work touches on the personal life of Alfred Nobel, the
Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the
prizes in his will.
	   In later life, Nobel's physician told him to take nitroglycerin
_ one of the ingredients in dynamite _ to combat heart trouble.
``However, it would take 100 years until it was clarified that
nitroglycerin acts by releasing nitric oxide gas,'' the citation
noted.
	   Murad, who worked independently of the other two winners, called
the announcement ``a delightful surprise.''
	   At first, scientists didn't think nitric oxide had so many
effects, he said, but ``a lot of researchers have now discovered
that nitric oxide does so many things and is so important.''
	   Furchgott, reached at his Long Island home, said ``I'm very
pleased. I truly wasn't sure I'd ever get an award like this. I
wasn't sure that I deserved it.''
	   He said he had planned to go to the dentist and possibly play
golf today, but ``I guess that's all changed now. I'll be answering
calls all day.''
	   He said he hasn't had enough time to think about what he would
do with his share of the prize.
	   ``I just want to get through breakfast. I've been trying to eat
it for the last 30 minutes.''
	   The prize citation said Murad, while at the University of
Virginia in 1977, discovered that nitroglycerin and other
vessel-dilating compounds release nitric oxide.
	   In 1980, Furchgott concluded that blood vessels dilate because
cells in their inner lining produce a signal molecule. Ignarro,
working on his own and with Furchgott, proved this molecule was
nitric oxide.
	   Last year, the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the
University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of
prions, the rogue proteins identified as causing mad cow disease
and other ailments.
	   The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be
announced this year.
	   Last week, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist Jose
Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the
economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Some 25 foreign firms are vying in Baghdad
for deals to sell agricultural machinery and implements to Iraq
under its oil deal with the United Nations.
	   The firms, exhibiting combine harvesters, tractors, sprayers,
seeders, planters, diggers and fertilizers, are hoping to win some
of the dlrs 250 million Iraq has earmarked to rehabilitate its
agriculture under the current phase of the oil program.
	   Waleed Abdulhadi of Iraq's Trade Fairs Directorate told The
Associated Press that ``ambitious deals'' were being struck during
the week-long exhibition, which started Thursday.
	   Finland's Valtra Valmet won a contract to sell 150 of its
combine harvesters to Iraq. Germany's Claas will sell 40 others.
	   Organizers said the current deals were exploratory and the firms
taking part will be given preferential treatment.
	   Four Italian firms were present. Their offer was a deal for the
export of 30,000 seeders and 100 tractors to Iraq.
	   Iraq sells the machines at a subsidized price to its farmers.
	   ___
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The Saudi French Bank, partly owned
by the Paris-based Banque Indosuez, made a profit of 364.2 million
riyals (dlrs 97 million) for the first nine months of this year,
the bank said in a statement Monday.
	   The profit was a 12 percent increase over profits of 324.9
million (dlrs 86.6 million) over the same period last year.
	   The statement said the increased profits were due to growth in
deposits and loans and the good performance of investments in Saudi
Arabia, the United States and Europe.
	   The Saudi French Bank, in which Banque Indosuez owns a 30
percent stake, is a leading commercial bank in Saudi Arabia. It is
listed on the local stock market.
	   ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Egypt will discuss the
feasibility of supplying the kingdom and the Palestinian
territories with natural gas through a pipeline, a senior Jordanian
Energy Ministry official said Monday.
	   Talks on the estimated dlrs 500 million pipeline and the gas
supply is expected to be discussed by Energy Minister Hani Mulqi
and his Egyptian counterpart during annual Jordanian-Egyptian
cooperation talks scheduled for next week in Amman.
	   The official said a foreign feasibility study presented to both
governments this year has said the plan is workable.
	   Details of the project have yet to be finalized.
	   Jordan produces natural gas from a al-Risheh field on the
eastern border with Iraq. But the gas generated covers only 30
percent of the country's needs.
	   ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The United States agreed Monday to give
Lebanon dlrs 130,000 to help finance a feasibility study for a
national center for a geographic information system.
	   The agreement was signed by Nabil al-Jisr, chairman of Lebanon's
state-run Council for Development and Reconstruction, and J. Joseph
Grandmaison, director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, a
council statement said.
	   The council is a government agency that coordinates
reconstruction projects in Lebanon, which is rebuilding from the
devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   To be completed within 10 months, the study will cost about dlrs
260,000, the statement said.
	   Half of the cost will be covered by the USTDA's gift and the
other half by a U.S. consulting agency, Geographic Planning
Collaborative, and the CDR, it added.
	   ___
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The Emirates telecom giant
Etisalat will increase its GSM capacity to 1 million subscribers by
mid-1999 and to 1.6 million by 2000, the company's chief executive
said in remarks published Monday.
	   Etisalat has 437,000 GSM subscribers and a capacity for a total
of 800,000, Ali al-Owais told the monthly Update magazine.
	   The GSM, or Global System for Mobile Communications, is the most
widely used mobile phone system around the world. It was introduced
in the Emirates in September 1994.
	   Al-Owais also said that the number of internet subscribers in
the country stands at 48,000, up from 218 in August 1995.
	   The present capacity is for 100,000 dial-up users and expansion
is under way for a capacity of 200,000 by 1999, he said.
	   Etisalat is the sole provider of mobile phone and internet
services in the Emirates.
	   The company is 60 percent owned by the government and 40 percent
by private investors.
	   ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon exported 255.7 billion Lebanese
pounds (dlrs 170.4 million) in industrial goods in the first nine
months of the year, a 9.2 percent drop from the same period last
year, published reports said Monday.
	   No reason was mentioned for the drop that came despite a 100
percent jump in capital investment in the same sector, statistics
published by the Beirut daily newspaper An-Nahar showed.
	   The main exports were chemical products, ready-made garments and
paper products.
	   Saudi Arabia was the major importer of Lebanese industrial
goods. It bought dlrs 36.8 million _ or 21.6 percent of the
exports, followed by France at dlrs 24.1 million, or 14.1 percent,
and Syria at dlrs 17.4 million, or 12 percent.
	   ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ India is to supply Iraq with agricultural
machinery and improve the country's power plants, the Nabdh
al-Shabab weekly reported Monday.
	   The agreement was signed in Baghdad during a visit by
Agriculture Minister Som Pal, the weekly said. It did not specify a
date nor did it say when India will begin exporting the equipment
to Iraq which is under an eight-year U.N. sanctions.
	   The weekly said the two countries also agreed to exchange
scientific experts in the fields of research and studies.
	   ``Indian engineering groups will conduct agricultural studies in
order to be involved in further cooperation in the fields of
advanced technology for the agricultural sector,'' the weekly
quoted Pal as saying. It gave no further details.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Some 216.5 billion pounds (dlrs 63.7
billion) were deposited in Egyptian banks in the 1997-98 fiscal
year, an increase of 7.9 percent, the Central Bank said in its
annual report released Monday.
	   Last year's deposits totaled 200.6 billion pounds (dlrs 59
billion).
	   Egypt's fiscal year starts July 1.
	   Some two-thirds of the deposits were at the four
government-owned banks, an increase of 5.4 billion pounds (dlrs 1.6
billion) or 4.3 percent from the previous year.
	   In the previous year, deposits at the four state-owned banks
rose 12.3 percent.
	   Foreign currency deposits in the same banks have risen by 1
percent to dlrs 7.8 billion compared to a drop of 7 percent last
year, the report said.
	   Loans extended by all banks in Egypt totaled 172.4 billion
pounds (dlrs 50.7 billion). The share of the four banks from these
loans was 81 billion pounds (dlrs 23.8 billion) with a growth rate
of 6.4 percent, compared to last year's growth rate of 11.4
percent, the report said.

Rights group calls for protection for Indonesian rape counselors

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with suspect saying motive was theft, victim's sister
denying threats in 5th-6th grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A New York-based human rights group
Monday called on the Indonesian government to protect those trying
to help rape victims following the murder of a counselor.
	   The body of Martadinata Haryono, 17, a counselor with the
Volunteers for Humanity group, was found in her home Friday night,
with stab wounds and a slashed neck.
	   Haryono, a member of the ethnic Chinese minority in Indonesia,
had been helping other ethnic Chinese women who had been raped
during the riots in May.
	   Police have arrested a 20-year-old male neighbor on suspicion of
murder during a bungled burglary.
	   With police permission, the suspect appeared with his lawyers at
a news conference where he denied any political motive behind the
killing. He said that he intended to steal money or jewelry but
that she had caught him red-handed.
	   Haryono's older sister, Evy Suryadinata, told reporters that her
family had not received any threats.
	   Women activists, however, believe the killing is part of a
campaign of intimidation by those responsible for the May rapes.
	   Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group, said the Indonesian
government should provide ``better protection'' for members of
Volunteers for Humanity.
	   It also said the government ``has an obligation to conduct fully
transparent investigations'' into the murder as well as a series of
threats made against other rape counselors and activists.
	   Indonesian media reports have said that activists including
Haryono's mother received threats demanding them to stop counseling
rape victims or investigating their cases.
	   Many ethnic Chinese homes and businesses were targeted by mobs
that killed about 1,200 people during the widespread unrest, which
led to the resignation of authoritarian President Suharto.
	   Human rights groups say at least 168 women, mostly ethnic
Chinese, were raped during the riots.
	   The government has confirmed that rapes occurred, but doesn't
know how many. The military and police have repeatedly said they
have no hard evidence that sexual assault was widespread.

	   LONDON (AP) _ British Aerospace PLC is in merger talks with
Daimler-Benz Aerospace of Germany, the companies confirmed Monday
after the Financial Times reported the two planned to join forces
early next year.
	   The merger would be the beginning of the creation of a giant
pan-European defense contractor, the paper said.
	   In Munich, Daimler-Benz Aerospace said a merger deal needed to
be completed quickly to compete with U.S. companies.
	   The Financial Times said that after a year of negotiations
involving the big airplane makers and governments in Britain,
France, Germany, Sweden and Spain, a ``big bang'' merger of the
British and German companies with the French firm
Aerospatiale/Matra now seemed unlikely.
	   The main stumbling block, the newspaper said, was that
Aerospatiale/Matra is still partly government-owned and progress
toward full privatization has been slow.
	   The British and German companies oppose having a government as a
stakeholder in the new giant company, the paper said.
	   Daimler-Benz Aerospace spokesman Rainer Ohler said that while no
deadline has been set, the merger talks, which also involve the
French, are now ``under great pressure.''

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Cabinet
agreed Monday to allow German warplanes to take part in any
airstrikes in Kosovo and backed a NATO order authorizing alliance
military commanders to launch an attack.
	   However, actual deployment must be approved by the sitting
parliament, which won't meet until Friday to approve Germany's role
in NATO action in the Yugoslav province.
	   Germany's role in any airstrikes has been in question since the
left's Sept. 27 election victory. But Kohl and Chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder met Monday and agreed that the old government
should take the initiative, Kohl's chief of staff Friedrich Bohl
said.
	   Parliamentary approval seems assured because both major parties,
the Social Democrats and Kohl's Christian Democrats, largely
support committing German troops.

EU gives cautious approval to Greek economic plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers Monday
approved Greek government plans to get the economy in shape for
joining the EU single currency bloc, but they warned extra efforts
may be need to meet the ambitious targets.
	   High levels of inflation, public debt and budget deficit
excluded Greece from the first group of 11 nations set to adopt the
euro as their common currency on Jan. 1. Greece hopes it can be
ready to join in 2001.
	   Under EU rules, the four nations staying outside the euro-zone
present mid-term economic programs intended to promote policy
convergence within the EU.
	   While Denmark, Britain and Sweden voluntarily opted out of the
euro, Greece is hoping it's ``convergence program'' will keep in on
track for early membership.
	   Under the plan, Greece aims to have debt and deficits down to
the levels required for participation in by the end of this year
and inflation in line by the end of 1999.
	   However, the EU said an expected slow down in growth because of
the shaky world economic situation could call for extra effort to
meet the targets.
	   The program shows the budget deficit falling to 2.4 percent of
gross domestic product this year, from 4 percent in 1997. The
deficit is seen at 2.1 percent in 1999.
	   Inflation is seen at an average of 4.5 percent in 1998, compared
to 5.5 percent in 1997. Inflation is expected to drop to 2.5
percent in 1999.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Swaziland and Malaysia have agreed
to increase economic cooperation between the two nations, the
national Bernama news agency reported Monday.
	   The agreement came after King Mswati from the southern African
nation, who arrived here Sunday for a six-day visit, met with
Malaysian Prime Minister Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the report
said.
	   Mahathir and Mswati attended a signing ceremony on agreements on
trade and scientific, technical and cultural cooperation, it said.
	   At a palace banquet in his honor, Mswati said in a speech that
although Malaysia was not spared in the Asian economic downturn, he
was confident it will manage a turnaround.
	   ``We feel that in a matter of time, Malaysia will return to the
pattern of its strong economic growth. These are examples of
confidence, not despair and they point clearly to a future full of
optimism,'' he said.
	   The Malaysian king, Tuanku Ja'afar, said the two nations should
work together to overcome challenges and increase exchanges in
culture and sports.

UN envoy agrees to travel to Afghanistan to meet Taliban leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ After receiving a promise from the
Taliban religious army that it will investigate the killing of a
U.N. worker, the U.N. special envoy agreed Monday to travel to the
Taliban headquarters in southern Afghanistan.
	   Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi is in the region to ease tensions between
the Taliban army and neighboring Iran, which has deployed more than
200,000 soldiers, hundreds of tanks and scores of jet fighters on
its border with Afghanistan.
	   The promise to visit the religious militia's Kandahar
headquarters came after a two-hour meeting in Pakistan, said
Saeed-ur Rehman Haqqani, the Taliban ambassador to the neighboring
nation.
	   Haqqani said the Taliban promised Brahimi ``they would carry out
an investigation ... and further details would be given during his
visit to Kandahar.''
	   Iran's troop deployment followed the killings of its diplomats
in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif in August by invading
Taliban soldiers.
	   Tehran is demanding an apology from the Taliban and forces who
killed the diplomats. So far the Taliban has refused both requests.
	   The Taliban has accused Iran of arming and financing the Afghan
opposition, while Pakistan is believed to be supporting the
Taliban.
	   Brahimi's promise to visit Afghanistan on Wednesday is seen as a
major breakthrough for the Taliban who have been pressing the U.N.
envoy to meet them on their home ground.
	   Brahimi initially refused because U.N. headquarters in New York
has forbidden its international staff from traveling to Afghanistan
for security reasons.
	   An Italian U.N. worker was shot to death in Kabul on Aug. 21, in
apparent retaliation for U.S. missiles attacks on suspected
training camps in eastern Afghanistan the day before. The United
Nations has been demanding the assassins be arrested and punished.
	   Brahimi is expected to hold face-to-face talks with the
Taliban's reclusive leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, who in the past
has refused to meet U.N. envoys.
	   The United Nations also is pressing the Taliban for security
guarantees that would let its international staff return to
Afghanistan and restart stalled humanitarian programs. The United
Nations is also demanding the Taliban ensure access to programs for
women and girls and freedom to carry out programs in line with U.N.
policies.
	   In areas it controls, the Taliban has imposed a strict version
of Islamic law, barring women from work outside the home, banning
most art and music and forcing men to grow beards.
	   Haqqani said the Taliban promised Brahimi they would send a
delegation to Pakistan to discuss the resumption of U.N. programs.
	   There was no immediate comment from the United Nations.

Arsonists burn psychiatric hospital car
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Arsonists burned a car belonging to a
state psychiatric hospital Monday, causing extensive damage to
other vehicles parked nearby but no injuries, police said.
	   A total of six cars were destroyed when fire spread after a
makeshift gas canister bomb exploded under the Dafni hospital car,
parked in the southeastern Athens suburb of Ilioupolis.
	   The attack caused an estimated 10 million drachmas (dlrs 35,000)
worth of damage, police said.
	   A previously unknown organization calling itself Anarchist
Groups of Crisis claimed responsibility for the attack in a
telephone call to a small private radio station.
	   During the past year, arsonists have targeted numerous cars with
diplomatic, government and foreign license plates. On average,
about 300 cars are firebombed in Greece every year.

Refugees burden Africa, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ More than 27 million Africans have
been driven from their homes by violence, worsening the continent's
economic problems, an African leader said Monday.
	   ``Today, there is not a country in Africa that has not played
host to refugees,'' said Ahmed Haggag, acting secretary-general of
the Organization of African Unity.
	   ``Many of the host countries have themselves been faced with
major economic problems and are not able to absorb the extra burden
of refugees,'' he said. The development of those countries is
impeded.
	   Haggag spoke at the opening session of a four-day OAU seminar
aimed at alleviating the plight of African refugees, especially
women and children, and to reintegrate them into their societies.
	   ``In any refugee or internally displaced community, women are
the life-sustaining force, they play a central economic and social
role, they have the power to nurture future generations and
reestablish the family and culture in exile or in displacement,''
Haggag said.
	   The number of Africans living in neighboring countries has
soared to 7 million, and is rising, Haggag said.
	   Another 20 million Africans are displaced within the borders of
their own countries, ``deprived of their livelihoods, dignity and
home,'' he said.
	   The seminar was attended by representatives of African
governments, U.N. agencies, donors and aid groups.

Russian delegation travels to The Hague for chemical weapons talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian delegation traveled to The Hague,
Netherlands on Monday for talks on inspections of Russian
facilities producing or storing substances that could be used for
chemical weapons, a news agency said.
	   The Russian delegation was to meet with international
specialists from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons, and will pave the way for a later delegation to sign
agreements on inspecting the Russian chemical sites, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   Representatives from the Russian ministries of health, defense,
economics and foreign affairs were to attend the meetings, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The talks are pursuant to the 1993 Paris Convention on Chemical
Weapons, which calls for Moscow to destroy its huge Soviet-era
arsenal by 2005. Russia's parliament ratified it last year.
	   Russian officials say they are fully complying with the treaty,
but work has been slow and plagued by funding shortages. Many
western lawmakers say Russia cannot afford the huge costs of
dismantling its chemical arsenal.
	   Russian officials say they expect foreign money to cover about
dlrs 1 billion of the estimated dlrs 6 billion cost of destroying
some 40,000 metric tons (44,000 tons) of chemical weapons.

EU finance ministers look to contain financial turmoil

finance; fresh quotes from British, German ministers; EDITS to

 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers struggled
Monday to produce a strategy for containing the global market
crisis and prevent further outbreaks of such highly contagious
financial turmoil.
	   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said he was
seeking EU support for strengthening international financial
institutions.
	   ``I am determined that Europe plays its full part in addressing
the weaknesses of the international financial system and
contributing to growth and stability around the world,'' Brown told
reporters as he arrived for the one-day meeting.
	   Outlining what he called a ``three-point action plan,'' Brown
called for a ``crisis prevention mechanism'' to ensure greater
openness in financial market so potential dangers could be detected
early. He also urged reinforcing the International Monetary Fund so
it can quickly to tackle emerging crises and suggested enhanced
supervisory regulation of the global finance system.
	   The EU meeting came as slower growth rates and fears of more
gloom spreading from Asia, Russia and South America take some of
the shine off preparations for the launch of the euro as the common
currency of 11 EU nations on Jan. 1.
	   So far, Europe has avoided the worst of the global crisis,
something German Finance Minister Theo Waigel put down to
confidence in a strong and stable euro and the strict budget
discipline nations must follow to join the euro-bloc.
	   ``In spite of all the problems in the world, the euro-zone is an
island of stability,'' Waigel told reporters. ``This is clear proof
that this process has been the right one.''
	   The EU's Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy predicted
at the start of the meeting ``in 1999 Europe will have the best
growth among the industrial powers.''
	   However, ministers face mounting pressure for action to halt any
further decline in growth, including calls for interest rate cuts
to help business.
	   Last week, the Spanish, Irish, Portuguese and British central
banks eased rates, but EU central bankers and a number of ministers
believe rates are low enough in core European economies such as
Germany and France.
	   ``The problem of bringing down rates is not one for Europe,''
said Irish Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy.
	   The ministers were likely to reject a proposal for the EU to
back loans to Russia by the Union's lending arm, the European
Investment Bank.
	   ``In the present situation in Russia ... it would not be serious
to give the EU budget guarantee to an EIB intervention in Russia,''
De Silguy told reporters.
	   The one-day EU meeting was the last for Waigel. Defeat in last
month's elections means the Bavarian conservative is stepping down
after almost 10 years at the helm of the EU's biggest economy.
	   As a parting shot, Waigel knocked home Germany's tough line over
plans to overhaul the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget from 2000 so the
Union can pay for its planned expansion into eastern Europe.
	   Germany, along with Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, says it
pays too much into EU coffers and gets too little back in return.
Waigel insist any reform correct the imbalance.
	   ``There is a lack of burden sharing in the budget,'' he told a
news conference. ``This is something that cannot continue.''
	   Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi assured other
ministers the Friday's government collapse in Rome would not weaken
Italy's determination to cut debt and budget deficit. ``I have no
reason to believe that Italy won't continue to honor its pledges,''
De Silguy said.

Lawyer: Former Bosnian Muslim prison guard should be spared long
</HEADLINE>
sentence &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A former Bosnian Muslim prison
guard charged with war crimes against Serb captives should get a
milder sentence because he suffers from mental problems worsened by
the war, his lawyer told a U.N. tribunal Monday.
	   The appeal came during the final phase of the months-long trial
of three Muslims and a Croat accused of atrocities at the Bosnian
government-run Celebici prison camp in 1992.
	   On trial are Hazim Delic, Celebici's deputy commander; Zdravko
Mucic, the camp's former commander; Esad Landzo, a former Celebici
guard; and Zejnil Delalic, who prosecutors claim had overall
responsibility for the camp.
	   All four defendants have pleaded innocent. If convicted, they
face maximum life sentences.
	   Although the three-judge panel at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal has not yet reached a verdict in the case, Monday's
hearing let lawyers introduce evidence that could help judges
determine prison terms if the defendants are found guilty.
	   Landzo's lawyer, Cynthia McMurrey, was the first to present her
case, using arguments ranging from Landzo's supposed rehabilitation
to his fragile mental state during the war.
	   An expert witness testified that Landzo has a personality
disorder which was compounded by the trauma of war and eventually
led to diminished mental capacity, meaning he allegedly was unable
to exercise his own free will to disobey orders during the war or
to make decisions on his own.
	   In written arguments, Landzo's lawyers said his sentence _ if he
is convicted _ should not be longer than five years. They also
based their arguments on his age, 25; the fact that he had no
record before Celebici; and his voluntary surrender to the
tribunal.
	   Like all guards at Celebici, Landzo acted under the orders of
superiors in the camp, his lawyers said.
	   Prosecutors have said that Serbs held at the central Bosnia camp
were ``murdered, tortured, raped and beaten.'' A 49-page indictment
alleges that inmates were beaten with steel cables and wooden and
metal bars, burned with heated scissors, wrapped with fuses that
were then lit, and kept in vats of water. At least 14 died.
	   The Celebici trial, which began in March 1997, was expected to
last only several months but has dragged on for 19 months, in part
because the U.N. court has five other trials in progress.
	   Taking up sentencing arguments before a trial has ended is part
of the tribunal's new efforts to streamline and speed up its work.
Lawyers for the other defendants, as well as prosecutors, were also
scheduled to make sentencing arguments this week.

Yeltsin cuts short Central Asia trip with respiratory infection

past health problems.

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut
short a trip to Central Asia on Monday after coming down with a
respiratory infection that again raised questions about his overall
health.
	   Yeltsin's aides said the president was taking antibiotics to
ward off a bout of bronchitis and a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius
(99.3 Fahrenheit). There were no plans to hospitalize Yeltsin, who
was expected back in Moscow late Monday night from Almaty,
Kazakstan, a day earlier than planned.
	   ``The president has a cold and a cough. You're supposed to stay
in bed when you have a cold,'' said Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   There was no indication that Yeltsin's illness would sideline
him for any length of time, and aides said the president would
maintain his schedule for the rest of the week.
	   But after a series of health problems in recent years, including
heart bypass surgery in 1996, every new ailment unleashes a flurry
of speculation about the president's ability to function. The
president insists he has no major health problems and will serve
out the remaining two years of his term.
	   His last illness was in March, when he had acute laryngitis
which resulted in a bad cough, a hoarse voice and a reduced
workload.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has never immersed himself in the day-to-day work
of government, but has been even more distant than usual during the
country's recent economic crisis, the most serious since the Soviet
Union collapsed.
	   He has offered only a few, brief remarks on the turmoil and has
not announced any plan for dealing with the crisis, leaving the job
to the new government headed by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   In a typical week, the president spends most of his time at his
country home outside Moscow, venturing into the Kremlin on perhaps
two or three days, and usually for only several hours.
	   His public appearances consist mostly of televised footage that
show Yeltsin greeting government officials in his office. The
footage rarely lasts as long as a minute, and regularly shows
Yeltsin and his guest engaging in small talk for the benefit of the
cameras.
	   Yeltsin's opponents have long charged that his overall condition
has deteriorated to the point that he can no longer work full-time.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov renewed the call for the
president's resignation on Monday.
	   ``Yeltsin is unable to work more than two or three hours a
day,'' he said at a Moscow news conference. ``He is even unable to
review honor guards.''
	   The president's foreign trips have been prone to misadventure,
either because of health issues or unpredictable remarks from
Yeltsin.
	   The trip to Central Asia, Yeltsin's first outside Russia since a
visit to Britain in May, got off to a bad start immediately.
	   The president appeared stiff and stumbled when he arrived Sunday
in Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent. He had to be supported by
Uzbek President Islam Karimov and canceled his other public events,
saying he wasn't feeling well.
	   On Monday, Yeltsin turned up more than an hour late for talks
with Uzbek officials and abruptly cut short a scheduled news
conference.
	   Yeltsin read his brief statement in a strong voice, rarely
raising his eyes from the text. He walked away unaided, but was
closely flanked by bodyguards.
	   Shortly after Yeltsin arrived in neighboring Kazakstan, his
aides announced he would be heading home Monday night instead of
Tuesday, as originally scheduled.
	   Yeltsin went ahead with a meeting with Kazakstan President
Nursultan Nazarbayev and sought to fit all of his planned meetings
into Monday's schedule.
	   Yakushkin, Yeltsin's spokesman, said that based on his own
observations the president had begun to fall ill at the end of last
week. Yeltsin was against curtailing the trip, but ``the doctors
insisted it was necessary to return to Moscow,'' Yakushkin said.

Swiss to give more information in Salinas case in late October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss authorities will give more
information later this month on their investigation into the
brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, an
official said Monday.
	   Swiss Federal Attorney General Carla Del Ponte is currently
deciding whether the evidence collected by the 2 1/2-year Swiss
inquiry is sufficient to prosecute Raul Salinas.
	   More details will be given ``in the second half of October,''
Dominique Reymond, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office,
said. He didn't elaborate.
	   Reymond declined to comment on a report in The New York Times
Monday that the Swiss report on the case suggests prominent
businessman Carlos Peralta Quintero helped hide protection money
paid to Raul Salinas by drug traffickers.
	   In July, Switzerland's anti-narcotics police chief said he had
wrapped up his investigation into bribery allegations against
Salinas.
	   ``We have a case against Raul Salinas that he got the money from
drug traffickers,'' Valentin Roschacher said then.
	   Folco Galli, spokesman for the Swiss Office of Police Affairs,
also declined to comment on Monday's report. Roschacher, who is
abroad, couldn't be contacted.
	   The Swiss have been investigating whether Raul Salinas helped
launder drug money while his younger brother was president from
1988 to 1994.
	   Authorities seized Swiss bank accounts belonging to Raul Salinas
in 1995.
	   Swiss court documents have said U.S. officials alleged he
deposited dlrs 132 million in drug-trafficking bribes in Swiss
banks.
	   If Del Ponte decides to prosecute, the defense attorneys will
have the right to appeal, which would immediately send the case to
the highest Swiss court, the Federal Tribunal.
	   Raul Salinas is in prison in Mexico pending completion of his
trials in a political assassination and on a charge of illegal
enrichment.
	   He has denied any links to drug traffickers and said the money
in the Swiss accounts was an investment fund pooled by several
wealthy friends.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's moderate defense minister
resigned unexpectedly Monday, signifying that hardliners have
prevailed in a rift in President Franjo Tudjman's ruling party and
within his government.
	   The move by Andrija Hebrang is the second high-level resignation
in four days by a political moderate in the government. Another
close aide to Tudjman, Hrvoje Sarinic, quit Friday as his Cabinet
chief.
	   Both cited Tudjman's failure to support them in their conflicts
with hardliners.
	   Hebrang, considered a devoted Tudjman supporter, also said he
would no longer head the medical team caring for the 76-year-old
president. In addition, he resigned as vice president of Tudjman's
Croatian Democratic Union.
	   A split has existed for years in Tudjman's ruling party between
pro-Western moderates and hard-line nationalists who oppose broader
democratic reforms.
	   Tudjman evidently has now chosen to back the hardliners, who
control the army and much of the police force. Such a choice could
lead to even more rigid rule in a country criticized by the West
for failing to promote democracy.
	   Last month, Sarinic charged in an interview that military
counter-intelligence was behind a media campaign against the more
liberal members of the ruling party. He said their actions were
likely commanded by another Tudjman aide, hardliner Ivic Pasalic.
	   Sarinic's claims highlighted Tudjman's opponents' claims that
his party, or some of its members, use state institutions for
political or personal gains.
	   Hebrang replaced the late Gojko Susak as defense minister in May
and vowed to reorganize the army according to NATO standards.
	   It has long been known that in the process, Hebrang wanted to
dump military counter-intelligence chief Markica Rebic and Vlado
Zagorac, who leads the ministry's firm for arms purchases. Both men
were protegees of Susak, a hard-liner, and they reportedly opposed
Hebrang's planned reforms.
	   In his letter to Tudjman, released by the state-run news agency
HINA, Hebrang said Tudjman's failure to uphold his attempts to
replace the two prompted him to resign.
	   ``Without your support, all my attempts to carry on the complex
programs which are also crucial for our country become futile,''
Hebrang wrote, adding: ``May God help you in recognizing good from
evil.''
	   Meanwhile, Rebic appeared before the parliamentary commission
which is to examine Sarinic's claims that counter-intelligence was
implicated in the media attacks.
	   Sarinic and Pasalic also were summoned for the closed-door
hearings.

Three Americans win Nobel Medicine Prize

 &UR; By MATTI HUUHTANEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Nitric oxide doesn't just pollute the
air: it also saves lives and enhances men's sexual performance.
Unlocking its secrets won three American researchers the Nobel
Medicine Prize on Monday.
	   The 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 978,000) award is divided equally
between Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad, who
discovered new properties of the gas, which helped in developing
the anti-impotence drug Viagra.
	   In 1977, while at the University of Virginia, Murad was
researching how nitroglycerin _ often given to heart patients to
dilate blood vessels _ releases nitric oxide. In 1980, Furchgott
concluded that blood vessels dilate because cells in their inner
lining produce a signal molecule. Ignarro, working on his own and
with Furchgott, proved this molecule was nitric oxide.
	   The conclusions of Furchgott and Ingarro, published in 1986,
opened up a new field of medical research based on the properties
of nitric oxide, and led to studies on a wide range of new drugs.
	   ``It was a sensation that this simple common air pollutant ...
could exert important functions'' in animals and people, said the
Karolinska Institute, which awards the prize.
	   Furchgott, 82, is a pharmacologist at the State University of
New York in Brooklyn. Ignarro, 57, is at University of
California-Los Angeles and Murad, 62, now is at the University of
Texas Medical School in Houston.
	   Furchgott, reached at his Long Island home, said ``I'm very
pleased. I truly wasn't sure I'd ever get an award like this. I
wasn't sure that I deserved it.''
	   Nitric oxide, which can ease chest pains, has been used to find
stronger and more selective drugs to treat cardiovascular
conditions.
	   Scientists are now testing to see whether the colorless gas can
be used to stop the advance of cancer because of its ability to
defend against tumors and kill infectious bacteria, fungi and
parasites.
	   Patients in intensive care often are made to inhale the gas,
which has provided ``good results and even saved lives,'' the
Karolinska Institute said.
	   It is also being used to fight bacterial infections, as well as
diagnoze lung conditions, including asthma.
	   Nitric oxide can trigger erection of the penis by dilating blood
vessels. The wildly popular Viagra is based on this effect.
	   ``This is a new general principle ... which will help us to
develop lots of new medicines, for example ones that directly relax
or retain tension in muscles, as in the new impotence drug,
Viagra,'' said Hans Joernvall, professor of medical chemistry at
the Karolinska Institute.
	   The studies on nitric oxide touch on the personal life of Alfred
Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who
established the prizes in his will.
	   In later life, Nobel's physician told him to take nitroglycerin
_ one of the ingredients in dynamite _ to combat heart trouble. But
it took 100 years before science clarified that nitroglycerin acts
by releasing nitric oxide gas, the Karolinska Institute said.
	   ``This year's Nobel prize goes to the body's own
nitroglycerin,'' said Goeran Hansson, professor of experimental
cardiovascular research at Karolinska Institute.
	   The announcement is ``great news,'' said Dr. Gerald Levey, dean
of the UCLA School of Medicine. ``We were hoping he (Ignarro) would
win it. We thought he had a strong chance to win. It's well
deserved.''
	   The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be
announced this year. Last week, the literature prize went to
Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the
economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.

Bulgaria bans investment in Serbia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria on Monday joined a European
Union ban on investment in Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia.
	   The European Union has endorsed the punitive measure because of
Belgrade's crackdown on independence seeking Albanians in
Yugoslavia's southern province of Kosovo.
	   The ban doesn't affect Bulgarian-Serbian commercial contracts
that have been concluded before it, Bulgarian trade minister
Valentin Vasilev said.
	   He added so far Bulgarian investment in Serbia was
insignificant.
	   On Saturday, Bulgaria said it was ready to allow NATO aircraft
use its airspace for possible attacks on Yugoslavia. However, the
permit has to be finally approved by parliament if the alliance
resorts to airstrikes.

Magazine had the right to report on corruption by army leader,
</HEADLINE>
court rules.
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The nation's highest court threw out a
damage claim by the former guerrilla leader and retired army
commander against a magazine that accused him of corruption.
	   The monthly Horizon magazine made fair comment that was in the
public interest when it reported on the business activities of Gen.
Solomon Mujuru in late 1991, Judge Nick McNally ruled.
	   Mujuru, who at an earlier hearing threatened to shoot dead the
magazine's editor, had sued for a record 250,000 Zimbabwe dollars
(then worth dlrs 30,000) in damages.
	   The Supreme Court, after an appeal by Horizon, said Monday there
was no merit in Mujuru being awarded 40,000 Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs
5,000) in damages by the high court in 1996 and granted the appeal,
with Mujuru paying all costs.
	   President Robert Mugabe has been accused of failing to curb
corruption in his government, though such allegations are rarely
reported in the dominant state-controlled media.
	   McNally said Mujuru acquired business interests in ways that
``could reasonably be regarded as morally questionable or
improper'' after independence in 1980.
	   The magazine argued Mujuru bought farms, a store chain and a
hotel despite rules prohibiting public officials and political
leaders from becoming rich.
	   The magazine had also questioned how Mujuru financed the
purchase of properties and businesses worth millions of dollars
while he was head of the Zimbabwe army.
	   McNally said Mujuru admitted he breached the rules limiting
public officials to owning two modest homes and prohibiting them
from running businesses when in office.
	   Horizon editor Andrew Moyse described the ruling as a victory
for press freedom in a nation where the state controls all
broadcasting and five main newspapers and frequently harasses
independent journalists.
	   ``We believed in what we had to say. We have been totally
vindicated. I hope this will keep the door open for freedom of
expression in the scary and threatening environment we work in,''
Moyse said.
	   Mujuru led the Marxist guerrilla army that helped end white rule
in the former British colony of Rhodesia. He retired as army
commander in 1992 after leading the force of mainly ex-guerrillas
for 12 years.
	   Mujuru remains a ruling party legislator and a member of its
politburo, the party's top policy-making body.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 95-year-old woman has winged her way into the
Guinness Book of Records after looping-the-loop in a glider.
	   ``I've always wanted to fly like birds do,'' Adeline Ablitt,
whose flight in May was organized by the retirement home where she
lives near Coventry, in central England.
	   ``The first thing I knew about being upside down was when I lost
sight of the horizon,'' Mrs. Ablitt added. ``I started to reach to
release my parachute, but the pilot told me to sit back and enjoy
it. ''
	   The Guinness Book of Records has opened a new category: ``Oldest
person to loop-the-loop in an unpowered glider.''
	   ``Mrs. Ablitt has been accepted as the new record holder in the
new category,'' said Vanessa Law, spokeswoman for the Guinness Book
of Records.

Exiled Indonesian activist calls for pro-democracy support

 &UR; By KATHRYN MASTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ An exiled student activist who
says he was kidnapped and tortured by the Indonesian military
appealed to the international community Monday to support the
democratic movement in his troubled homeland.
	   Mugiyanto, the international officer for the People's Democratic
Party (PRD), called on other countries to pressure the new
Indonesian government to sever its military ties and to release
protesters held illegally.
	   ``The struggle for democracy in Indonesia needs support from
people abroad,'' Mugiyanto said. ``It is not only a struggle for
Indonesian people.''
	   Mugiyanto is traveling throughout Europe asking for financial
and political support for the pro-democracy movement. His stay in
the Netherlands, which has a large Indonesian community and
longtime ties to its former colony, was coordinated by the Dutch
group Supporting Movement for Democratization in Indonesia.
	   Mugiyanto is the second prominent Indonesian dissident to take
his case to Europe. Earlier this year, well-known student activist
Pius Lustrilanang _ also based in the Netherlands _ launched a
similar awareness campaign.
	   Mugiyanto's appeal for aid comes as new elections approach in
Indonesia. Parliamentary elections have been promised for next
year, and a presidential election is scheduled for December 1999.
	   Widespread rioting triggered by the economic crisis and
oppression under military rule prompted former President Suharto to
resign in May.
	   Without international intervention, Mugiyanto sees the upcoming
elections as having the dangerous potential for another massive
uprising.
	   ``If this force is not led, there will be anarchy,'' he said.
``This will not bring a solution to Indonesia.''
	   An Indonesian court lifted a ban against the PRD in August, but
many of the party's leaders have been imprisoned for subversion.
	   The PRD believes its challenge is to cobble together the various
and unorganized protest groups into a unified movement for
democracy, Mugiyanto said.
	   Mugiyanto said he was abducted from his home March 13 by the
military and tortured for two days. He was blindfolded and tied to
a bed wearing only his underpants, he said. While he was
interrogated, he was beaten and electrically shocked.
	   He was held in prison until June 5, when B.J. Habibie replaced
Suharto as president.
	   His captors warned him not to speak of his abduction, he said.
Though he may be in danger when he returns, he is speaking out
about the human rights violations he says are still occurring under

	   Fourteen activists still remain missing, he said.
	   ``It is not because I am brave but because this is the only
choice I have,'' he said of his campaign. ``I have friends who are
missing. We must make sure this does not happen again.''

Tudjman's party loses majority in Dubrovnik local elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) _ A united opposition beat out President
Franjo Tudjman's ruling party in local voting, unofficial results
showed Monday. The result signaled trouble ahead for the government
for next year's scheduled parliamentary elections.
	   Although Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union won 13 seats in
Dubrovnik County elections, for the best showing of any individual
party, the opposition alliance together took the remaining 27
seats.
	   The town of Dubrovnik, a famed tourist attraction, is already
run by the opposition.
	   Final unofficial results showed the Social Democrats and the
Peasants' party with 10 seats each and their junior coalition
partners, the Social Liberals and Liberal Party, with a total of
five seats. The Independent List won two seats.
	   Despite his most recent loss, Tudjman's party still holds a
majority in 18 of 21 counties.
	   But the party's once unchallenged popularity is steadily fading,
amid growing suspicions of financial and political corruption. The
loss of the potentially highly prosperous tourist and agricultural
region of Dubrovnik was particularly galling.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan took a big step toward ending its banking
crisis Monday with the passage of laws that will allow the
government to take over foundering banks to fix them or shut them
down.
	   The legislation establishes rules for how the government will
deal with banks doomed to fail and establishes a public institution
similar to the U.S. Resolution Trust Corp., created during the
1980s U.S. savings and loan crisis to buy the bad debt from banks.
	   The new laws were the first half of a broader plan to strengthen
the debt-ridden financial system.
	   A bill that allows the government to pour public funds into
banks to induce them to lend more was expected to clear Parliament
by the end of the week.
	   The package is crucial for cleaning up nearly dlrs 1 trillion in
bad loans left by the collapse in the early 1990s of runaway real
estate and stock prices.
	   It is also a key first step in Japan's efforts to overcome its
deepest recession since the end of World War II.
	   The laws passed Monday established a framework for bank bailouts
but didn't specify how much public money could be used.
	   Still, lawmakers seemed close to an agreement on those details.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party originally proposed using
about 10 trillion yen (dlrs 86 billion), but reportedly agreed with
opposition parties over the weekend to increase that to 50 trillion
yen (dlrs 435 billion).
	   Toyoo Gyohten, a special adviser to the prime minister for
financial affairs, said in Singapore Monday that the bailout could
reach 60 trillion yen (dlrs 522 billion).
	   ``Adequate public funds will be made available,'' he said.
	   The markets took the news as a sign the country is getting
serious about fixing its financial problems.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average surged 675.04 points, or 5.24
percent, closing the day's trading at 13,555.01.
	   Japan could use a boost.
	   Bank problems have made new loans hard to get and business has
been suffering, especially small and medium-size companies.
Unemployment is at a record high, bankruptcies are soaring and
consumer spending is falling.
	   Growth shows no sign of coming back soon. The Economic Planning
Agency announced last week that the economy would shrink by 1.8
percent this year, and the head of the agency said on Sunday that
it could shrink next year as well.
	   Under the new laws, a committee will be set up to handle bank
failures. The committee will take one of three steps: nationalize
the bank temporarily through the government's purchase of its
shares; order the liquidation of the institution; or transfer the
bank's operations to a public bridge bank.
	   The laws cleared the upper house of Parliament Monday after
passing the more powerful lower house on Oct. 2.
	   Shortly after the bills passed, politicians from the ruling and
opposition camps announced an agreement on a proposal to inject
public funds into the banking system to ease the nation's credit
crunch.
	   With Japan under pressure to turn around its economy and help
Asian neighbors, the bills are a major victory for Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi and end one phase of a fierce dispute between his
ruling party and the opposition.
	   The first test case of the new legislation will be the troubled
Long-Term Credit Bank, which has been rumored to be on the verge of
collapse since summer.
	   LTCB, one of Japan's biggest lenders, is struggling under the
weight of failed real estate loans.
	   In June, LTCB announced it was in talks to merge with Sumitomo
Trust _ a move that was widely regarded as a government-directed
bailout. But under the new legislation, the bank will be
nationalized temporarily and its bad loans will be sold, Kyodo News
agency reported.
	   The bills also abolish a 13 trillion yen (dlrs 113 billion) fund
that previously provided public money to be pumped into the banking
system to recapitalize banks.

Orthodox leader visits Poland

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Archbishop of Constantinople and
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I awarded Poland's prime minister
a medal Monday for good cooperation with the Orthodox church.
	   Jerzy Buzek, who became prime minister after last year's
parliament elections, is a member of the Solidarity party in the
ruling coalition. He also is Protestant, which is considered
unusual in the predominantly Catholic country.
	   In 1991, the Solidarity government passed a law giving the
Orthodox church in Poland the same rights as the Catholic church,
according to Interior Ministry official Krzysztof Wiktor.
	   Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of nearly 300 million
Orthodox Christians, also met Monday with Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the
leader of Poland's Roman Catholic Church.
	   At a religious ceremony Sunday after his arrival on a week long
trip to Poland, Bartholomew I appealed for more dialogue and
cooperation between churches. He also met with President Aleksander
Kwasniewski and awarded him a medal for helping ensure equal status
of churches in Poland.
	   Bartholomew I also will visit Krakow, the Auschwitz Nazi death
camp and Bialystok, the center of Poland's 550,000-strong Orthodox
community.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Tens and thousands of high school students marched
noisily through Paris and several French cities Monday to demand
that the government take measures to increase the number of
teachers and provide better equipment.
	   The students _ chanting ``Solidarity!'' _ set off at midday from
squares in the east and south of Paris, and headed for the
Education Ministry, where they planned to rally in the late
afternoon.
	   ``Through strikes you can dream,'' said stickers the students
slapped on lampposts and telephone boxes along the way. ``We're
angry students ... and fed up of the chaos,'' others sang.
	   Students have been protesting in a number of French cities over
the last 10 days, barely weeks after starting the new school year.
Monday's demonstration was the first in the capital. Protests were
held in more than a dozen cities.
	   Police patrolled the Paris demonstrations, which are often
marred by violence, but did not cut off traffic, leaving the
students to maneuver in and out of passing cars.
	   Police intervened to disperse hundreds of students who were
rampaging through a shopping center in Montparnasse, in southern
Paris. Dozens of others, their faces masked, stole from music shops
and bakeries, police said.
	   Nearby, a scooter was set on fire on a downtown avenue.
	   It was not immediately clear whether arrests had been made.
	   But several people were detained in Thionville, a town in
eastern France, after dozens of students wielding baseball bats and
throwing stones smashed shop windows and turned cars over. About
1,000 students had protested during the day.

Official: Ukraine's military draft hampered by massive evasion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The vast majority of young men are evading
the military draft this year, hampering Ukraine's efforts to
recruit soldiers, a senior military official said Monday.
	   The military can count on actually drafting only 6.7 percent, or
54,500, of those eligible for army service _ just 5,000 more than
are to be called into service this fall, said Mykola Matiukh,
Ukraine's deputy chief of staff.
	   ``There's practically no one to choose from,'' Matiukh
complained.
	   He said most potential conscripts are either evading military
service illegally or cannot be drafted because they study at
universities or have health problems.
	   Ukraine's army, like those in other former Soviet republics, has
been badly hurt by the 1991 Soviet collapse and ensuing economic
problems. The force has been reduced by nearly one-third from its
pre-independence level of 900,000 servicemen.
	   Many young Ukrainians are unwilling to spend the required 18
months in the army, fearing hazing by veteran soldiers and poor
conditions that stem from chronic under-financing of the military's
needs.
	   Matiukh told reporters that massive evasion from military
service forces the army to draft conscripts with a low educational
level and imperfect health, which badly affects the military's
fighting potential.
	   Only 0.5 percent of young people eligible for this year's draft
have higher education, while about a third of them have not
completed secondary education, he added.
	   Ukraine's army is to be reduced to 320,000 servicemen by the end
of 1998, and by 10,000 more in 1999, according to the Defense
Ministry.

Charter airplane crashes in Norway; nine Danes killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with nine confirmed dead and all victims being Danes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) - A small charter airplane crashed short of a
runway in western Norway Monday, killing all nine of the Danish
citizens on board, police said.
	   The aircraft, a twin-engine Cessna 402 propeller plane, was on
its way from Aalborg, Denmark to Stord, Norway, when it crashed and
caught fire at about 12:30 a.m. (2230 GMT Sunday), some 200 meters
(yards) short of the runway. The cause of the crash was not known.
	   ``Everything seemed normal, and we had visual contact with the
plane,'' said Jan Morten Myklebust, head of the Stord local
airport. ``It was dark and raining, but there as a high cloud
ceiling and little wind. The plane just suddenly went down.''
	   Rescuers immediately found the bodies of eight victims, but it
took until mid-afternoon to find the ninth victim in the charred
wreckage.
	   Stord Sheriff Reidar Faerestrand said it took several hours to
determine how many people had been aboard.
	   ``Now we can confirm that we have found nine dead,'' he said.
	   The plane had been chartered to fly Danish employees of the
Alteck Isolering company to the Aker Stord shipyard, about 500
kilometers (300 miles) west of Oslo, after a weekend off. The
identities of the victims were not immediately released.
	   Danish police claimed the pilot had been facing charges for
flying paying passengers without commercial certification, Danish
and Norwegian news reports said. However, Palle Jensen of Altek
Isolering told the Norwegian news agency NTB that the pilot's
papers were in order at the time of the crash.

	   In launching an air attack on Yugoslavia, NATO could face an
armed force that is still the largest in the region despite the
crippling effects of years of embargo.
	   NATO planners are aware that their technological superiority
does not mean a risk-free operation to force President Slobodan
Milosevic to curb attacks by Serb security forces against ethnic
Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province.
	   ``The Yugoslavs have formidable air defenses and are not going
to be a pushover,'' said Dana Alenn of the International Institute
for Strategic Studies in London.
	   Serb forces have a history of fierce resistance to outside
attack. In response to NATO strikes in 1995, Bosnian Serbs shot
down one French Mirage 2000 with a single SA-7 missile and an
American F-16 with a direct hit by SA-6.
	   The first target for NATO, the analysts said, likely would be
Yugoslav surface-to-air systems, which could challenge NATO
warplanes, but would pose less of an obstacle to Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
	   Years after the disintegration of former socialist Yugoslavia,
Serbia and Montenegro still have a sizable air force, consisting of
260 aircraft, divided into five fixed-wing brigades and three
helicopter regiments.
	   The fixed wing element include 16 MiG-29 fighters, of which two
are MiG-29 UTI training two-seaters unsuitable for combat. These
planes, purchased from the former Soviet Union in the early 1980s,
are based at Batajnica Airfield near Belgrade.
	   The Yugoslav versions of the MiG-29 carries aging electronics
and radar, but their superb maneuverability and APHID and ACRID
air-to-air missiles could threaten incoming aircraft.
	   In addition, there are about 60 aging MiG-21 FT and BIS
interceptors that also can be thrown into the fray. This model
dates from the Vietnam and the Mideastern conflicts, and likely
would not mount serious opposition to NATO warplanes.
	   The Yugoslav air force also has about 65 close-support ORAO and
80 GALEB G4 and G2 aircraft, and other utility planes of various
kinds.
	   Perhaps the most serious threat to NATO warplanes would comes
from 60 self-propelled surface-to-air SA-12b missile systems, along
with SA-6 missiles upgraded with new warheads, seeking devices and
proximity fuses.
	   At airfields and other strategic points, Yugoslav air defense
deploys large numbers of SA-2, 3, 9, 10, 11 and 13 missile systems.
They also field man-portable, shoulder launched SA-7, 14 and 16
missiles.
	   It is still uncertain whether Yugoslav armed forces have been
able to purchase the Russian S-300 anti-aircraft, anti-missile
system, Moscow's answer to the American Patriot missile system.
	   Some analysts claim Belgrade tried to buy this equipment, but
failed because of its chronic lack of hard currency. If the
Yugoslavs have purchased S-300s, there are no more than two or
three units, which likely would be positioned to defend the
capital.

Boosted by Wall Street, Amsterdam bourse closes sharply higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prices on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange closed sharply higher Monday, boosted by surging Asian
markets, a stronger dollar and a strong performance on Wall Street.
	   The Dutch market had been on the rise the entire day, but shares
were given a further boost by strong gains on Wall Street when its
trade started in the European afternoon.
	   The 27-share AEX Index finished at 899.65 points, up 48.54
points, or 5.7 percent.
	   The dollar was fetching 1.85 guilders at 1435 GMT, up from late
Friday's 1.84 guilders.
	   Financial stocks were the biggest risers after the sharp losses
seen in recent weeks. Shares of leading Dutch bank ABN Amro closed
up 9.3 percent Monday, and the ING financial services group surged
12 percent.
	   The main loser Monday was Dutch software company Baan, which
issued a profit warning before the start of trade. The company said
it expects third-quarter losses of between 13 cents and 16 cents a
share on the back of the global economic problems.
	   Its shares plummeted to close down 29 percent after falling as
far as 42 percent earlier in the day.

Iranian foundation raises reward for killing Rushdie

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Rushdie foundation &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian foundation has added dlrs 300,000
to the reward for Salman Rushdie's death, just weeks after the
Iranian government tried to distance itself from the bounty.
	   The move was a striking show of the infighting within Iran's
fractured government between hard-liners and moderates gathered
around President Mohammad Khatami, who has sought to improve ties
with the West since he assumed office last year.
	   ``I, as the head of the Khordad Foundation, add dlrs 300,000 to
the reward for implementing the edict,'' Ayatollah Hassan Saneii
was quoted as saying by Jomhuri Islami newspaper Monday.
	   The semiofficial foundation had initially offered dlrs 2.5
million to anyone who killed the British author, whose book ``The
Satanic Verses'' was claimed by Iran to be blasphemous to Islam.
	   The comments by Saneii were the first by the foundation since
Iran's government distanced itself last month from the death edict,
helping improve relations with Britain. Saneii is the
representative of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in
the foundation.
	   ``To set a reward for killing Salman Rushdie has been a great
honor for this foundation and we will keep this honor. We should
not let this issue be forgotten,'' Saneii said.
	   On Saturday, a hard-line Iranian student group offered 1 billion
rials (dlrs 333,333) to anyone who kills Rushdie.
	   In London, the chairwoman of the Rushdie defense committee said
the development was ``extremely serious.''
	   ``There is no way that the organization is a private one,'' said
Frances D'Souza. ``It is undoubtedly sanctioned by the
government.''

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO nations began assessing a report
from special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on Monday's Kosovo talks
in Belgrade before deciding whether to take the last military step
needed to launch airstrikes against the Serbs.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana talked ``at length'' over
the phone with Holbrooke to be briefed on his latest attempts to
persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to abide by U.N.
Security Council demands in Kosovo, a NATO official, who demanded
anonymity, said.
	   No details of the discussions were available.
	   If the Holbrooke talks fail, NATO is expected to approve an
activation order later on Monday, a vital step before airstrikes
can be launched.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Former world No. 1 Jim Courier took advantage
of his wild card status to advance through the opening round of the
Singapore Open tennis tournament on Monday.
	   Courier, an American who won four Grand Slam titles but is
currently ranked 102 in the world, defeated Canada's Daniel Nestor
6-3, 6-2 in the first day's play at the dlrs 700,000 ATP Tour
tournament.
	   Despite recent problems with a lingering arm injury and several
poor performances, Courier made short work of Nestor.
	   Australian teenager Lleyton Hewitt produced the other notable
preliminary round performance, beating France's Lionel Roux 6-2,
7-6(8).
	   Hewitt, 17, is the youngest player currently in the top 200 ATP
tour singles players, ranked 139.
	   Also advancing past the first round on Monday was the
Netherlands' Sjeng Schalken, New Zealand's Brett Steven, and
Romania's Andrei Pavel.
	   Preliminary round singles action in the 32-player tournament
continues Tuesday and Wednesday, with Marcelo Rios of Chile, Goran
Ivanisevic of Croatia and American Michael Chang taking to the
court.

Kazakstan will join international thermonuclear project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Kazakstan will officially join an
international project to develop fusion, a process that could
provide cheap inexhaustible energy if properly harnessed, according
to an agreement signed Monday by Russian and Kazak officials.
	   Kazakstan has already been carrying out research under the
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project, or ITER,
at a research reactor located in the eastern part of the country.
Kazakstan's full participation may help reduce the cost of the dlrs
12 billion project, Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Billed as the best hope of proving fusion will work
commercially, ITER is tentatively scheduled to be built by 2010 by
Japan, West European nations, the United States and Russia.
	   But a decision by collaborating scientists to rethink the
design, as well as funding problems in the United States and
Russia, have slowed the project.
	   Fusion occurs when very light atoms, usually hydrogen, fuse
together after colliding at very high temperatures and pressure.
Heat energy released in the process can be converted to
electricity, with the eventual goal of harnessing more energy than
needed to run the reactor.

EU finance ministers look to contain financial turmoil

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers were unable
Monday to agree details of a common strategy for containing the
global market crisis and preventing further outbreaks of such
highly-contagious financial turmoil.
	   ``It's clear we need a form of crisis management. These
questions need to be solved urgently,'' said Austrian Finance
Minister Rudolf Edlinger, who chaired the day-long EU meeting.
	   There was broad backing for British and French proposals to
strengthen international financial institutions, but Edlinger
acknowledged ``we have not yet come up with a clear position.''
	   Outlining what he called a ``three-point action plan,'' British
Chancellor of the Exchequer called for a ``crisis prevention
mechanism'' to ensure greater openness in financial market so
potential dangers could be detected early.
	   He also urged reinforcing the International Monetary Fund so it
can quickly to tackle emerging crises and suggested enhanced
supervisory regulation of the global finance system.
	   ``I am determined that Europe plays its full part in addressing
the weaknesses of the international financial system and
contributing to growth and stability around the world,'' Brown told
reporters.
	   Although slower growth rates and fears of more gloom spreading
from Asia, Russia and South America are taking some of the shine
off preparations for the launch of the euro as the common currency
of 11 EU nations on Jan. 1, ministers insisted Europe would
continue to escape the worst of the global crisis.
	   ``In 1999 Europe will have the best growth among the industrial
powers,'' the EU's Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy
predicted.
	   German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said Europe was sheltered by
confidence that the euro will be a strong and stable currency.
	   ``In spite of all the problems in the world, the euro-zone is an
island of stability,'' Waigel told reporters. ``This is clear proof
that this process has been the right one.''
	   However, the ministers face mounting pressure for action to halt
any further decline in growth, including calls for interest rate
cuts to help business. But EU central bankers and a number of
ministers believe rates are low enough in core European economies
such as Germany and France.
	   ``The problem of bringing down rates is not one for Europe,''
said Irish Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy.
	   The ministers rejected an Austrian proposal for the EU to back
loans to Russia by the Union's lending arm, the European Investment
Bank. ``The overall conditions for such a commitment are still not
met,'' Edlinger acknowledged.
	   The one-day EU meeting was the last for Waigel. Defeat in last
month's elections means the Bavarian conservative is stepping down
after almost 10 years at the helm of the EU's biggest economy.
	   As a parting shot, Waigel knocked home Germany's tough line over
plans to overhaul the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget so the Union can
pay for it's planned expansion into eastern Europe.
	   Germany, along with Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, says it
pays too much into EU coffers and gets too little back in return.
Waigel insist any reform correct the imbalance.
	   ``There is a lack of burden sharing in the budget,'' he told a
news conference. ``This is something that cannot continue.''
	   Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi assured other
ministers the Friday's government collapse in Rome would not weaken
Italy's determination to cut debt and budget deficit. ``I have no
reason to believe that Italy won't continue to honor its pledges,''
De Silguy said.

U.S. bombers prepare for airstrikes amid marathon Kosovo talks

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO positioned itself Monday for
airstrikes on Yugoslavia, preparing to authorize an attack should
talks on Kosovo fail between the chief U.S. troubleshooter and
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Ambassadors of the 16-member alliance were meeting informally
pending the results of talks between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
and Milosevic. If the talks produce no agreement, the officials in
Brussels were expected to vote on an ``activation order'' _ an
essential step setting into motion the airstrike machinery.
	   NATO still may not use force immediately, but a flurry of
diplomatic evacuations by Western nations from Yugoslavia added to
a sense that intervention is imminent barring a breakthrough in
negotiations.
	   The international diplomats' mission observing events evacuated
Kosovo for neighboring Macedonia, with the Russian members the last
to depart. Sources at the American Embassy in Belgrade said all but
12 foreign staff were being evacuated to Budapest, and an embassy
statement said personnel in ``non-emergency situations'' had left.
	   A State Department advisory urged all U.S. citizens to leave
Yugoslavia, and Americans in the Serb part of neighboring Bosnia
also were advised to leave. The German, Austrian, British and other
foreign embassies closed down Monday.
	   Milosevic summoned a crew from state television to the White
Palace where talks with Holbrooke were being held, indicating he
was preparing a public statement. But it was not clear whether he
was ready to compromise in order to evade airstrikes.
	   The NATO order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
other military hardware needed for an airstrike from member
countries to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize
its deployment over Yugoslavia.
	   Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering
planes and missiles launched.
	   As NATO met in Brussels, Holbrooke resumed talks with Milosevic
on defusing the Kosovo crisis and avoiding the threatened strikes.
That meeting recessed by early afternoon and was to resume before
evening.
	   Holbrooke described his earlier overnight meeting with Milosevic
as ``intense, indeed, and at times very heated.'' He said the
standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can only be
called an emergency.''
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the outgoing German government said it intends to
allow German warplanes to participate in any attack.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, which
could last ``several days.''
	   Foreign presence was being reduced in anticipation of NATO
action.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a Yugoslav republic.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's request that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   The Belgrade daily Nasa Borba reported Monday that Milosevic was
reluctantly considering the demand, but there was no confirmation.
	   The U.N. Security Council demands include an immediate
cease-fire, a withdrawal of special troops in the province,
allowing refugees to return home and beginning talks with
independence-minded ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Milosevic's crackdown on the KLA has killed hundreds, and forced
at least 270,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   The Romanian government agreed to let NATO use its airspace in
an emergency, and Hungarian authorities were considering a similar
request from the organization.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, warned
neighboring countries Sunday that a NATO attack could turn the
Balkans into ``a powder keg.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov again expressed his
country's opposition to any NATO strike but said a military
response by Moscow to such an attack was ``out of the question.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.
	   Milosevic's office said Sunday that all U.N. conditions have
been met for a political settlement, but Washington disagrees.
	   Efforts to end the seven-month crisis intensified following
allegations that Serb police massacred scores of ethnic Albanian
refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will bring a humanitarian
disaster if thousands remain homeless by the first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. The U.S. administration
believes, however, that it does not need a new U.N. resolution for
the attacks.

EU sues Finland for ignoring 1995 habitats law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS reference to Aland &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission said Monday it
will take Finland to court for failing to apply 1995 European
legislation on habitats for endangered animals and plants in its
province of Aland.
	   The Commission, the European Union's executive body, said
Finland is over three years late in implementing the EU law on
habitats in Aland, an archipelago in the Baltic Sea between Finland
and Sweden.
	   Finland should have adopted the proper legislation when it
joined the EU on January 1, 1995, the Commission said.
	   ``With the exception of some hunting legislation, Finland has
not formally communicated any implementing legislation for (Aland),
which has legislative autonomy,'' the Commission noted.
	   Aland is an archipelago of about 7,000 islands in the Baltic
Sea. It is part of Finland. Fewer than 100 of the islands are
inhabited.

Central European presidents call for end to fighting in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The presidents of six Central European
nations appealed Monday for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
to meet the demands of the Contact Group and end the fighting in
the troubled province of Kosovo.
	   ``General historic experience, and the history of Central
European nations, shows that there is less suffering and fewer
human lives sacrificed the sooner we combat evil,'' the presidents
of Austria, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia and the Czech
Republic said in a statement.
	   The leaders called on Milosevic to fullfill the conditions set
out by the six-nation Contact Group in an attempt to end the
violence in Kosovo, which has left hundreds dead and an estimated
275,000 homeless.
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel criticized the international
community for ``notoriously repeating the mistakes of the past'' by
failing to prevent conflicts and only responding after the fact.
	   He called for representatives from Yugoslavia and Kosovo _ which
is dominated by ethnic Albanians _ as well as Albania, Macedonia,
the European Union and NATO, to sit down together at the
negotiating table.
	   But he didn't rule out the possibility of NATO airstrikes
against Yugoslavia.
	   Havel and the other heads of state gathered in Vienna for a
one-day summit to discuss issues affecting the region.
	   One of the key issues for Central Europe is EU expansion.
	   ``Austria would like to make expansion a priority of its
presidency,'' said Austrian President Thomas Klestil, whose country
currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
	   Germany will take over the presidency Jan. 1, and the other four
summit participants are front-runners to join the EU early next
century.

King: the Holyfield-Lewis fight will take place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis are closer than
ever to stepping into the ring to fight to become the undisputed
heavyweight champion of the World.
	   Holyfield's promoter Don King arrived for a meeting with Lewis'
manager Frank Maloney in London on Monday saying ``we are going to
make a deal.''
	   ``I don't know when and I don't know where the fight will take
place, but we are going to work to make it happen,'' King said
Monday.
	   ``It's important for the world to get these two champions
together.
	   ``The world at large is waiting with bated breath to see who is
going to be the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.''
	   King, who was in Paris on the weekend for a World title
promotion, has given the strongest indication yet that a deal can
be struck for a bout between Holyfield, WBA and IBF titlist, and
Lewis, the WBC champion.
	   In April, Holyfield declined a dlrs 20 million offer from the
Home Box Office cable television network to put his two world
heavyweight belts on the line against Lewis.
	   But now King, who screens his promotions on the Showtime
network, says he can come to a deal with HBO, which has a contract
with Lewis.
	   King is expected to hold talks with Maloney and Lewis' promoter
Panos Eliades during his visit to London.
	   Maloney, who has managed Lewis for nine years, is also expected
to discuss a business offer from King to manage his interests in
Britain.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ One of India's most popular movie stars
was arrested Monday on charges of hunting three rare antelope
during a break from filming in a wildlife preserve.
	   Police investigators arrested Salman Khan, who allegedly killed
two black bucks and a chinkara in a restricted wildlife preserve in
the western Rajasthan state, after a judge rejected his request for
bail, said Alka Kala, the state's highest forest official.
	   The charges carry a maximum imprisonment of seven years, she
said.
	   Members of the local Bishnoi tribe who worship the endangered
black bucks and chinkaras alerted forest officials to the hunt.
	   Another popular actor Saif Ali Khan and actresses Sonali Bendre,
Tabu and Neelam _ who were present at the killing in fort town of
Jodhpur _ were granted bail, officials said. Tabu and Neelam use
only their first names.
	   The other actors will still be tried, Kala said.
	   ``All were involved but the judge found that it was Salman who
pulled the trigger,'' Kala said, speaking from the state's capital
city of Jaipur.
	   Salman Khan, who has a reputation for being brash and rude, has
been the heartthrob of Indian women for almost a decade. He is seen
as a macho romantic, who fights for love in gut-wrenching fight
scenes and action sequences, and is compared in the Indian press to
U.S. actor Sylvester Stallone.
	   Wildlife organizations criticized the killings, and an attorney
of the Wildlife Protection Society of India helped the prosecution
at the court hearing.
	   More than 100 people _ including the driver whose jeep
transported one of the bleeding black bucks and the chef who cooked
it to the actors' specifications _ gave evidence against the film
stars, officials said.
	   The film stars were shooting a film near Jodhpur, a tourist hub
in the Thar desert that was once part of the medieval kingdom of
Rajput dynasty warriors. Jodhpur is 500 kilometers (300 miles)
southwest of New Delhi.
	   Members of the deer-worshipping Bishnoi tribe said they heard
gunshots and rushed to the site, where they found the two actors
and three actresses with the dead animals. The movie stars quickly
drove away with one black buck, tribe members said.
	   Tribe members buried the other two animals.

Extradition case against accused drug trafficker adjourned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP) _ A magistrate on Monday adjourned
the extradition case against an accused drug trafficker who
allegedly caused a stir by threatening to kill U.S. students on
this Caribbean island.
	   The United States has been attempting to extradite Charles
``Little Nut'' Miller since 1996 to try him in Florida on drug
trafficking charges. The case took on a high profile in August when
the State Department told students at the Ross University
veterinary school that Miller had threatened to kill Americans if
he were extradited.
	   Miller denied he ever made the threat and most of the 250 U.S.
students at the school stayed on, though some left the island.
	   On Monday, Magistrate Haynes Blackman adjourned a hearing on
Miller's extradition to consider defense motions to quash the
proceedings. Blackman did not say when he would issue a ruling.
	   The first attempt by the United States to extradite Miller was
denied by the magistrate's court in St. Kitts, but a higher court
sent the case back to be reconsidered.

Run-off local elections needed in most regions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Although conservatives celebrated election
gains against the governing Socialists, near complete results
Monday showed most races must be decided at next week's run-off
ballots.
	   The elections are considered a key referendum on the
government's policies, which include unpopular austerity programs
aimed at qualifying Greece for the European Union's single currency
club.
	   Athens' Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos was one of the few
candidates winning an outright majority in Sunday's elections with
a landslide 57.7 percent, returns said.
	   Other conservative candidates in Salonica and Piraeus also
gained majorities with 44.4 percent and 42.8 percent, respectively.
But they must face run-offs against Socialist candidates on Sunday.
	   The Socialists struggled to hide their dismay.
	   ``The course of the government ... will be judged at the end of
its term at the national elections of 2000,'' said acting
government spokesman Yiannis Nikolaou.
	   Local elections cannot change the socialists' grip on
parliament. But the outcome _ two years before the general
elections _ is widely interpreted as a test for Premier Costas
Simitis.
	   Of the 50 regional governor races across the country, 14
rendered winners through absolute majorities in the first round _
seven conservatives and seven Socialists.
	   Most of the 900 mayoral seats will also be decided in the
run-off vote.

Iranian foundation raises reward for killing Rushdie

foundation. Pick up 8th graf pvs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian foundation has added dlrs 300,000
to the reward for Salman Rushdie's death, just weeks after the
Iranian government tried to distance itself from the bounty.
	   The move was a striking show of the infighting within Iran's
fractured government between hard-liners and moderates gathered
around President Mohammad Khatami, who has sought to improve ties
with the West since he assumed office last year.
	   ``I, as the head of the Khordad Foundation, add dlrs 300,000 to
the reward for implementing the edict,'' Ayatollah Hassan Saneii
was quoted as saying by Jomhuri Islami newspaper Monday.
	   The semiofficial foundation had initially offered dlrs 2.5
million to anyone who killed the British author, whose book ``The
Satanic Verses,'' Iran claimed, was blasphemous to Islam.
	   The comments by Saneii were the first by the foundation since
Iran's government distanced itself last month from the death edict,
helping improve relations with Britain. Saneii is the
representative of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in
the foundation.
	   ``To set a reward for killing Salman Rushdie has been a great
honor for this foundation and we will keep this honor. We should
not let this issue be forgotten,'' Saneii said.
	   On Saturday, a hard-line Iranian student group offered 1 billion
rials (dlrs 333,333) to anyone who kills Rushdie.
	   In London, the chairwoman of the Rushdie defense committee said
the development was ``extremely serious.''
	   ``There is no way that the organization is a private one,'' said
Frances D'Souza. ``It is undoubtedly sanctioned by the
government.''

Portugal prepares new measures against ``mad cow'' disease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The government is drawing up new
measures to stem a sharp rise in cases of ``mad cow'' disease in
Portugal after the European Commission threatened to ban Portuguese
beef exports, an official said Monday.
	   ``The government will unveil the measures soon, possibly by the
end of this week,'' Agriculture Ministry spokesman Augusto Vilela
said. He declined to give any details about the measures.
	   Earlier this month, the European Commission threatened a
Europe-wide ban on beef exports from Portugal unless the government
tightened controls on bovine animal remains used in cattle feed.
	   Spain banned the import of Portuguese beef last month.
	   Portugal has reported 60 new cases of ``mad cow'' disease in the
past five months, compared with a total of cases 94 for all
previous years. In addition, there are at least 28 suspected but
unconfirmed cases.
	   The disease's incubation period is long, and the recent rise in
cases has sparked fears that the scale of the problem in Portugal
is only now beginning to emerge.
	   Once the animal has been infected, it takes up to eight years
before the first symptoms of the disease _ bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or BSE _ are detected.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO nations began assessing a U.S.
envoy's report on Monday's Kosovo talks in Belgrade before deciding
whether to take the last military step needed to launch airstrikes
against the Serbs.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana talked ``at length'' over
the phone with U.S. evoy Richard Holbrooke about his latest
attempts to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to abide
by U.N. Security Council demands in Kosovo, a NATO official, who
demanded anonymity, said.
	   No details of the discussions were available.
	   If the Holbrooke talks fail, NATO is expected to approve an
activation order later on Monday, a vital step before airstrikes
can be launched.

	   Bulatovic wished Milosevic success at his new post and stressed
the necessity to improve further on Russian-Yugoslav relations,
particularly in matters of defense.
	   ``Successful military, economic and scientific cooperation is of
mutual interest to both countries and a forceful impetus to
stability and peace in the Balkans,'' Bulatovic was quoted as
saying to Milosevic.
	   For Borislav, brother of Slobodan and former representative in a
chamber of commerce, this is the first posting in diplomacy.

Rights group calls for protection for Indonesian rape counselors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES last two grafs with minister's call to confer suspect
with volunteers/ &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A New York-based human rights group
Monday urged the Indonesian government to protect those trying to
help rape victims after one counselor was killed.
	   The body of Martadinata Haryono, 17, a counselor with the
Volunteers for Humanity group, was found in her home Friday night,
with stab wounds and a slashed neck.
	   Haryono, a member of the ethnic Chinese minority in Indonesia,
had been helping other ethnic Chinese women raped during May riots.
	   Police have arrested a 20-year-old male neighbor on suspicion he
killed her during a bungled burglary.
	   With police permission, the suspect appeared with his lawyers at
a news conference where he denied any political motive behind the
killing. He said that he intended to steal money or jewelry but
that she had caught him in the act.
	   Haryono's older sister, Evy Suryadinata, told reporters that her
family had not received any threats.
	   Women's groups, however, believe the killing is part of a
campaign of intimidation by those responsible for the May rapes.
	   Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group, said the Indonesian
government should provide ``better protection'' for members of
Volunteers for Humanity.
	   It also said the government ``has an obligation to conduct fully
transparent investigations'' into the murder as well as a series of
threats made against other rape counselors and activists.
	   Indonesian media reports have said that activists including
Haryono's mother received threats demanding them to stop counseling
rape victims and investigating cases.
	   Many ethnic Chinese homes and businesses were targeted by mobs
that killed about 1,200 people during the widespread unrest, which
led to the resignation of authoritarian President Suharto.
	   Human rights groups say at least 168 women, mostly ethnic
Chinese, were raped during the riots.
	   The government has confirmed that rapes occurred, but doesn't
know how many. The military and police have repeatedly said they
have no hard evidence that sexual assault was widespread.
	   Minister of Justice, Muladi on Monday urged the police to let
volunteers dealing with the victims of the May riots meet the
suspect.
	   ``The teams of volunteers need to meet the suspect, so that they
can know whether he was used by other people to kill or it was a
pure crime,'' Muladi said.

EU hunkers down for long battle over budget share out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; with EU-Finance &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers dug in Monday
for what is expected to be a long battle over how to share out the
EU's dlrs 100 million annual budget.
	   Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden say they pay too
much into the EU's coffers compared with what they get back in
benefits, and demand the money be divvied up more fairly.
	   ``There is a lack of burden-sharing in the budget,'' German
Finance Minister Theo Waigel told a news conference. ``This is
something that cannot be continued under the new system.''
	   Monday's day-long meeting of the 15 EU finance ministers, was
Waigel's last after almost 10 year's. He is stepping down following
the center-right government's defeat in last month's elections.
	   However, the incoming Social Democrat-led administration is not
expected to relax Germany's stance. ``Any German government that
abandoned that line would be doing itself a disservice,'' Waigel
claimed.
	   Resistance from other nations, notably France and Spain, seems
sure to ensure that the budget wrangle will drag on until the
deadline of June, 1999.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said any budget
reform should also look at the special deal won for Britain in 1984
by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when she famously told
other EU leaders ``we want our money back.''
	   ``Either we open the whole contributions file or we keep in
closed,'' Strauss-Kahn told reporters. ``We cannot have half
measures.''
	   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown insisted
there can be no tampering with the pay-back deal which is estimated
to save Britain about 2 billion pounds (dlrs 3.4 billion) a year.
	   Aside from who pays what, the budget reforms will seek to
completely overhaul EU spending for the six year's starting in
2000, a period when Cyprus and five eastern European nations are
expected to join the Union.
	   A key to success will be a reform of the EU's farm subsidy
program which currently eats up half of the overall budget.

Bonino eyes legal action against FT over EU fraud story
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Emma
Bonino said Monday she considered sueing the Financial Times of
London over an article which she said damaged her good name by
implicating her in a fraud case.
	   The article, published Monday, claimed that at a meeting last
week of the 20-member EU executive Commission, Bonino's colleagues
``castigated (her) over allegations of fraud and mismanagement'' at
the EU's humanitarian aid office for which she is responsible.
	   In a letter to the Financial Times, Bonino termed the report
``patently false.''
	   ``At no time during the Commission meeting referred to, or at
any time, have I been the subject of criticism or even critical
remarks by colleagues in relation to matters of mismanagement and
fraud,'' she wrote.
	   Speaking to reporters Monday she said, ``this article damaged my
reputation. Freedom of the press does not signify the freedom to
write just anything.''
	   The Commission has been the target of late of allegations of
fraud and irregularities in spending.
	   Its humanitarian aid office, known by its acronym of ECHO, has
come under particular scrutiny in a case involving the
disappearance of 540,000 ecu (dlrs 594,000).
	   Last month, Bonino acknowledged the funds had gone missing and
that one ECHO official was suspended. The funds were part of four
aid contracts earmarked for ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda in 1993-1994,
totaling 2.4 million ecus (dlrs 2.6 million). At that time, Bonino
was not responsible for ECHO.
	   Separately, EU anti-fraud officials are investigating the use of
funds in contracts between ECHO and three unnamed organizations.
	   Bonino's office would not give details on this affair.
	   The European parliament will vote this month whether to freeze
ECHO funds for next year until the fraud allegations have been
cleared up.
	   Bonino has repeatedly defended the integrity of her office and
said on Monday she feels bitter about being personally targeted.
	   ``I would have expected a paper as reputed as the Financial
Times to be more rigorous and to check the accuracy of its
reports,'' she said.
	   In her letter to the daily, she wrote she had instructed her
lawyers ``to take all necessary legal redress against the Financial
Times in respect of the injury caused to my good name, personal
dignity and political reputation as a result of the publication of
this article.''
	   One option under consideration, she said, was asking the paper
to publish a formal correction of Monday's article.

Yugoslav premier rails against NATO as alliance warship heads for
</HEADLINE>
his country &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Turkey-Balkan Summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ As Yugoslav Premier Momir Bulatovic
Monday railed against NATO, international criminals and foreign
intervention in his country, he failed to look out the window and
see what was coming.
	   ``Threats of military intervention are unacceptable, absolutely
counter-productive and can not resolve anything but can only
contribute to destabilization of the region with unforeseen
consequences,'' Bulatovic told Balkan leaders assembled in this
seaside resort.
	   In the distance the French aircraft carrier Foch was building up
steam and moving across this picturesque bay, with most of its 40
planes, on a journey towards the Adriatic Sea and the Yugoslav
coast to join an assembling NATO armada.
	   Earlier in Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his
country would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes,
which could last ``several days.''
	   Bulatovic failed to see the ship as he addressed a near hostile
crowd of prime ministers from Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia ,
Romania, Turkey, the foreign minister of Albania, and observers
from Bosnia and Croatia.
	   Railing against ``international criminals and terrorists,'' out
to get Yugoslavia, he said his country was ``striving to fully
contribute to the vision of a new, integrated, open and developed
Balkans.''
	   But with NATO airstrikes near imminent, some diplomats here were
trying to envision Yugoslavia after air strikes. Although many
countries, including alliance members Greece and Turkey, will
probably contribute to possible ground troops in the
Albanian-dominated province, some were trying to find alternatives
acceptable to the Yugoslavs.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has fought a request By
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke that he agree to an expanded
international monitoring mission in Kosovo to verify compliance
with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   One idea thrown around here was the possibility of using a
Balkan multinational force that was agreed upon during a meeting in
Macedonia on Sept. 26, although it is still in the planning stages.
	   The agreement was signed by three NATO countries - Italy, Turkey
and Greece - and five prospective alliance members in the Balkans -
Macedonia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania and Albania.

Fresh New Offerings from Vuitton for Spring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos PAR101-5
 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fresh as a spring day was Marc Jacobs's second
luxury ready-to-wear collection for Louis Vuitton. It was shown
Monday in a sun-filled glass box called a ``greenhouse'' at Andre
Citroen Park west of the Eiffel Tower.
	   The American designer's line for spring was ready for April
showers, too, with terrific rain gear in heavy cottons and
plastified fabrics.
	   He led off with a cream bonded (heavy) cotton poncho over
polyester stretch T-shirt and teeny shorts, later going into a
see-through poncho that could double as a shower curtain.
	   It all looked very modern, especially the pale chartreuse simple
brushed cotton blouse-jacket with little sleeves or khaki cotton
shorts, sported by Naomi Campbell.
	   Wrapped skirts, long or cropped lean cotton trousers and cotton
sweaters with cowl collars came out with plenty of class - as did
the double-faced wools, tunics and skirts below the knee, but not
too long.
	   Clever little velvet swimsuits, great soft color combinations
like grape and cyclamen or subtle flesh tones, the
mirror-sequin-embroidered tops all had a young look with quality
attention to detail: things like apron-tied tops gave the
collection originality, taking it away from strict minimalism.
	   The one spring print in bubbles was original and fun: on a
knee-length cotton dress or handsome rubberized cotton poncho.
	   Vuitton, best known for its great luggage and handbags, only
showed a few little pochette-belts with the collection. As if to
say ``look at the other garments!''
	   Some luxury houses are starting to feel the financial crisis
pinch.
	   But Bernard Arnault, head of LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy),
who controls several other fashion houses, including Givenchy and
Dior, looked serene as he progressed through an enthusiastic crowd
with his wife, Helene, to salute Jacobs.
	   Among other young designers who lit the fashion scene Monday,
Jean-Luc Amsler has a kind of funky Seventies look with long coats,
backless wrapped dresses, swimsuits and shorts. They're matched to
coats and pants in blue-jeans tones of synthetics and cottons.
	   His silvery mesh ponchos over silver pants and a bra for evening
and the fake leather looks, layers of color and hip huggers had a
very trendy-nostalgic look from the Age of Aquarius.
	   Jerome L'Huillier was on a more sophisticated trail, with a lot
of wet-look clingy fabrics - draped onto the body at times,
criss-cross wrapped and draped blouses, and many sweet knit
outfits.
	   His good square jackets in silky fabrics with split longer
skirts, glitter in the fabric, should help the junior set dress up
- along with a few classically-cut coats.
	   While nude-tan seems to be a favorite color for spring, the
clothes so far are not giving the paparazzi posse much of a sexy
look-see.

Lawyer: Former prison guard should be spared long sentence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with so-called `Serb Adolf'
testifying on behalf of former guard. &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A former Bosnian Muslim prison
guard charged with war crimes against Serb captives should get a
milder sentence because he suffers from mental problems worsened by
the war, his lawyer told a U.N. tribunal Monday.
	   The appeal came during the final phase of the months-long trial
of three Muslims and a Croat accused of atrocities at the Bosnian
government-run Celebici prison camp in 1992.
	   On trial are Hazim Delic, Celebici's deputy commander; Zdravko
Mucic, the camp's former commander; Esad Landzo, a former Celebici
guard; and Zejnil Delalic, who prosecutors claim had overall
responsibility for the camp.
	   All four defendants have pleaded innocent. If convicted, they
face maximum life sentences.
	   Although the three-judge panel at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal has not yet reached a verdict in the case, Monday's
hearing allowed lawyers to introduce evidence that could help
judges determine prison terms if the defendants are found guilty.
	   Landzo's lawyer, Cynthia McMurrey, was the first to present her
case, using arguments ranging from Landzo's supposed rehabilitation
to his fragile mental state during the war.
	   An expert witness testified that Landzo has a personality
disorder which was compounded by the trauma of war and eventually
led to diminished mental capacity, meaning he allegedly was unable
to exercise his own free will to disobey orders during the war or
to make decisions on his own.
	   In written arguments, Landzo's lawyers said his sentence _ if he
is convicted _ should not be longer than five years. They also
based their arguments on his age, 25; the fact that he had no
record before Celebici; and his voluntary surrender to the
tribunal.
	   Like all guards at Celebici, Landzo acted under the orders of
superiors in the camp, his lawyers said.
	   In a startling development Monday, Landzo even got some support
from fellow war crimes suspect Goran Jelisic, who is awaiting trial
on separate charges. Jelisic, who calls himself the ``Serb Adolf,''
took the stand and praised Landzo for keeping his cell clean,
giving Jelisic some clothes in jail and playing volleyball with
him.
	   ``He's truly a social person, very communicative and a great
joker,'' Jelisic said of Landzo.
	   Prosecutors have said that Serbs held at the central Bosnia camp
were ``murdered, tortured, raped and beaten.'' A 49-page indictment
alleges that inmates were beaten with steel cables and wooden and
metal bars, burned with heated scissors, wrapped with fuses that
were then lit, and kept in vats of water. At least 14 died.
	   The Celebici trial, which began in March 1997, was expected to
last only several months but has dragged on for 19 months, in part
because the U.N. court has five other trials in progress.
	   Taking up sentencing arguments before a trial has ended is part
of the tribunal's new efforts to streamline and speed up its work.
Lawyers for the other defendants, as well as prosecutors, were also
scheduled to make sentencing arguments this week.

	   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Holbrooke
wanted to brief NATO ambassadors on the results of his talks with
Milosevic aimed at convincing him to accept U.N. demands for ending
the crackdown in Kosovo.
	   Ambassadors from the 16 NATO members were meeting Monday at
headquarters in Belgium, Belgium to consider whether to approve an
activation order, the last military step before airstrikes can be
launched.
	   The source indicated Holbrooke had made enough progress that he
needed to update NATO personally.
	   A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an
activation order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in
Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated
275,000 uprooted since February's crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied

German exhibit on fate of Jehova's Witness members under Nazis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ An exhibit on the fate Jehova Witness
followers in Germany opened in Dresden Monday, showing that some
2,000 of the religious group's members lost their lives under the
Nazis.
	   About 300 Jehova's Witness believers were executed by the Nazis,
while 1,700 died in concentration camps, said Martin Jahn, an
exhibit organizer for the group. A total of 6,000 were jailed, he
said.
	   The Christian group was persecuted by the Nazis because they
followed the the biblical motto, ``Thou shalt not kill,'' said
Jahn. At least some were condemned for refusing to fight in
Hitler's army.
	   The persecution continued after the war, with communist
authorities in East Germany jailing about 5,000 members of the
group, Jahn said.
	   East Germany banned the group after the communist-ruled nation's
highest court ruled in October 1950 that Jehova Witness teachings
incited boycotts of the military, the exhibit shows.
	   The exhibit, titled ``Steadfast despite Persecution,'' is to run
to the end of the month.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO positioned itself Monday for
airstrikes on Yugoslavia, preparing to give a pre-attack
``activation order,'' should talks on Kosovo fail between the U.S.
envoy and President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Holbrooke briefed NATO Secretary General Javier Solana by phone
on his latest attempts to persuade Milosevic to abide by U.N.
Security Council demands in Kosovo, a NATO official, who spoke only
on condition of anonymity, said.
	   Ambassadors of the 16-member NATO were meeting in Brussels and
assessing the report from Holbrooke on Monday's talks in Belgrade.
If the talks failed, the officials in Brussels were expected to
vote on an ``activation order'' _ the last military step before any
military strike can be launched.
	   In Kuwait, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said the allies
were moving closer to making a decision. ``Our patience is running
out,'' he said.
	   The NATO order would transfer command over the airplanes and
other military hardware needed for an airstrike from member
countries to Supreme Allied Cmdr. Wesley K. Clark and authorize the
deployment over Yugoslavia.
	   Clark could then, in consultation with Solana, order planes and
missiles launched.
	   Holbrooke on Monday resumed talks with Milosevic on defusing the
Kosovo crisis and avoiding the threatened strikes. Their meeting
recessed by early afternoon and was to resume before evening.
Holbrooke and Milosevic have met every day for a week, excluding
Thursday, when Holbrooke met with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the German government said it intends to allow
German warplanes to participate in any attack.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide about 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes.
	   The foreign presence in Kosovo was being reduced in anticipation
of NATO action.
	   Most of an international diplomats' mission observing events in
Kosovo left for neighboring Macedonia before midday. Sources at the
U.S. Embassy in Belgrade said all but 12 foreign staff were being
evacuated to Budapest.
	   A U.S. State Department advisory urged all Americans to leave
Yugoslavia, and the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo asked Americans in the
Serb part of neighboring Bosnia to evacuate.
	   The German Embassy also closed its office in the northwestern
Bosnian Serb town of Banja Luka and advised other German
organizations to leave, an embassy official said.
	   The German and British embassies in Belgrade also were closed
Monday.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo, where 90 percent of the population is
ethnic Albanian, is a Serbian province in southern Yugoslavia.
	   The major obstacle appeared to be Holbrooke's request that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission in
Kosovo to verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security
Council.
	   The Belgrade daily Nasa Borba reported that Milosevic was
reluctantly considering the demand, but there was no confirmation.
	   Other Security Council demands include an immediate cease-fire,
a withdrawal of special troops from Kosovo, letting refugees return
home and beginning talks with independence-minded ethnic Albanians
on Kosovo's future.
	   Milosevic's crackdown on the KLA has killed hundreds and forced
at least 270,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived Sunday in Britain and
a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to Italy.
	   NATO authorities also met with Russian representatives at NATO
headquarters Monday to keep Moscow informed on the military
preparations.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov again expressed his
country's opposition to any NATO strike but said a military
response by Moscow to such an attack was ``out of the question.''
	   Ukraine is offering to mediate in the Kosovo conflict and has
already discussed its offer with Yugoslavia and the United States,
Foreign Minister Borys Tarasiuk said Monday.
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.
	   Milosevic's office said Sunday that all U.N. conditions have
been met for a political settlement, but Washington disagrees.
	   Efforts to end the crisis intensified following allegations that
Serb police massacred scores of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern
is mounting that winter will bring a humanitarian disaster if
thousands remain homeless by the first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. The U.S. administration
believes, however, that it does not need a new U.N. resolution for
the attacks.

British Aerospace and Daimler Benz Aerospace talking merger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with analyst comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Aerospace PLC is in merger talks with
Daimler-Benz Aerospace of Germany and other European airplane
makers, angling for a marriage that would create a giant European
defense contractor to compete with leading U.S. firms, the two
companies said Monday.
	   In terms of size and ability to compete, the merger would put
the companies ``in the same ballpark'' with U.S. giants Boeing Co.
and Lockheed Martin Co., said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst
for brokers Salomon Smith Barney in London.
	   ``It's a very attractive outcome. It solves the scale problem,
really,'' Cunningham said.
	   The announcement after a year of negotiations involving the big
airplane makers and governments in Britain, France, Germany, Sweden
and Spain means a ``big bang'' merger of the British and German
companies with the French firm Aerospatiale/Matra now seems
unlikely, the Financial Times newspaper reported Monday.
	   The main stumbling block, the newspaper said, was that
Aerospatiale/Matra is still partly government-owned and progress
toward full privatization has been slow.
	   The British and German companies oppose having a government as a
stakeholder in the new giant company, the paper said.
	   Daimler-Benz Aerospace spokesman Rainer Ohler said that while no
deadline has been set, the merger talks, which also involve the
French, are now ``under great pressure.''
	   ``It is possible we would merge with one partner,'' Ohler added,
in an apparent reference to the problem with the French company.
	   In a more cautiously worded statement, British Aerospace said it
``has for some years been engaged in discussions about the possible
restructuring of the European aerospace and defense industry.''
	   ``These discussions naturally include talks with Dasa
(Daimler-Benz Aerospace), but it is too early to say whether any of
these discussions will result in definitive proposals,'' the
statement added.
	   The big European aircraft makers agreed in principle in March to
seek a merger to compete with the Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
	   The Financial Times said British Aerospace and Daimler-Benz
Aerospace would merge initially, setting up a holding company
probably registered as a Dutch company for tax reasons.
	   ``However, there would be an invitation to Aerospatiale to be
represented on its board, as a signal of its intent to be part of
the group eventually,'' the newspaper said.
	   Other European defense firms, including Saab AB in Sweden and
Finmeccanica in Italy, could also join the merger when they are
ready, the newspaper quoted an unidentified businessman involved in
the negotiations as saying.
	   The proposed merger between Lockheed Martin and Northrop Gumman
and last year's merger between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
has spurred the Europeans.
	   ``The aim is to create one of the world's biggest
aerospace/defense companies, so that in a few years' time we could
buy one of the U.S. giants,'' the Financial Times quoted an
unidentified negotiator as saying.

Forest fires rage for second day in Israel

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Forest fires raged for the second consecutive
day Monday in northern and central Israel.
	   Some houses were burned and people were evacuated from two
villages, but no fatalities or serious injury were reported.
	   The biggest fire was on the slopes of the Carmel range south of
Haifa.
	   With hot weather and high winds, the blaze spread to the
picturesque artists village of Ein Hod and the communal village of
Nir Etzion in the Carmel forest. Both villages were evacuated.
	   Fourteen houses in Ein Hod were destroyed or damaged. Some
historic homes were damaged in Zichron Yaacov.
	   Air force helicopters and civilian crop-spraying light aircraft
were brought in to help the fire-fighters.
	   Smaller fires broke out again in the Carmel Forest below the
Haifa neighborhood of Deniya, where thousands of residents were
evacuated Sunday during what was described as the country's biggest
forest fire ever.
	   Firefighters said Monday's fire in the Carmel range was even
bigger, but was not close to any large town or neighborhood.
	   Forest fires also broke out in the Jerusalem area, Western
Galilee and around the Arab towns and villages of central Israel.
	   Four Israeli Arabs were arrested on suspicion of starting fires
in the past two weeks in the Wadi Ara area, Israel radio reported.
Police and Arab residents recently clashed in Wadi Ara over a land
dispute.
	   However Fire-Fighting Commissioner Moshe Vardi said
investigations so far showed that Monday's fires were caused by
picnickers leaving embers smoldering from their barbecues.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke will
leave Belgrade on Monday for Brussels to brief NATO envoys on the
results of his talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, a
U.S. source said.
	   In Moscow, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told Russia's
Interfax news agency said Milosevic agreed to allow a 1,500-member
international observer force in Kosovo to verify compliance with
U.N. Security Council demands to end the crackdown in the majority
Albanian province.
	   Interfax said Russia was prepared to provide aircraft to the
force. The verification force was believed to have been the major
obstacle to a deal to prevent NATO airstrikes.
	   The U.S. source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Holbrooke wanted to brief NATO ambassadors on the results of his
talks with Milosevic aimed at convincing him to accept U.N. demands
for ending the crackdown in Kosovo.
	   Ambassadors from the 16 NATO members were meeting Monday at

Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated
275,000 uprooted since February's crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over
Yugoslavia.

In Kosovo, NATO would face largest armed forces in region
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In launching an air attack on Yugoslavia, NATO would face an
armed force that is still the largest in the region despite the
crippling effects of years of embargo.
	   The chief threat likely would come from mobile air defense
systems, some of which reportedly have been upgraded recently.
Yugoslav fighter planes, while formidable, likely would be
outmatched by the superior radar and missile systems of Western,
especially American, air craft, analysts say.
	   ``NATO would prevail in an air battle. But the question is, at
what cost?'' said Clifford Beal, editor of Jane's Defense Weekly in
London.
	   Defense analysts predicted that NATO likely would first use
Tomahawk cruise missiles against fixed Yugoslavian air defense
systems, and then might send B-2 Stealth bombers and F-117 Stealth
fighters against mobile air defense systems, with subsequent
attacks on air bases, command and communications systems, tank
depots and other military targets.
	   Serb forces have a history of fierce resistance to outside
attack. In response to NATO strikes in 1995, Bosnian Serbs shot
down one French Mirage 2000 with a single SA-7 missile and an
American F-16 with a direct hit by SA-6.
	   ``The Yugoslavs have formidable air defenses and are not going
to be a pushover,'' said Dana Alenn of the International Institute
for Strategic Studies in London.
	   A serious threat to NATO warplanes would come from 60
self-propelled surface-to-air SA-12b missile systems, along with
SA-6 missiles upgraded with new warheads, seeking devices and
proximity fuses.
	   At airfields and other strategic points, Yugoslav air defense
deploys large numbers of SA-2, 3, 9, 10, 11 and 13 missile systems.
They also field man-portable, shoulder launched SA-7, 14 and 16
missiles.
	   Additionally, the Serbs are reported to have acquired a
Russian-designed SA-10 anti-aircraft missile, code-named Grumble
``that would pose some problems to a coalition air forces,'' Beal
said.
	   Years after the disintegration of former socialist Yugoslavia,
Serbia and Montenegro still have a sizable air force, consisting of
260 aircraft, divided into five fixed-wing brigades and three
helicopter regiments.
	   The fixed wing element include 16 MiG-29 fighters, of which two
are MiG-29 UTI training two-seaters unsuitable for combat. These
planes, purchased from the former Soviet Union in the early 1980s,
are based at Batajnica Airfield near Belgrade.
	   The Yugoslav version of the MiG-29 carries aging electronics and
radar, but their superb maneuverability and APHID and ACRID
air-to-air missiles could threaten incoming aircraft.
	   Although the MiG-29s are good in dog fights, their radar does
not have the range of the U.S. version, and they could be sitting
ducks.
	   ``U.S. air force would see the Serbs at a far greater distance
than the Serbs,'' Beal said. ``The pilot could be shot out of the
sky before he knew he had been seen.''
	   In addition, there are about 60 aging MiG-21 FT and BIS
interceptors that also can be thrown into the fray. This model
dates from the Vietnam and the Mideastern conflicts, and likely
would not mount serious opposition to NATO warplanes.
	   The Yugoslav air force also has about 65 close-support ORAO and
80 GALEB G4 and G2 aircraft, and other utility planes of various
kinds.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke was to
brief NATO late Monday on his talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic before the alliance will decide whether to take
the last military step needed to launch airstrikes against the
Serbs.
	   ``Apparently he got enough concessions from Milosevic to brief
the (NATO) ambassadors,'' said a NATO official, who demanded
anonymity.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana talked ``at length'' over
the phone with Holbrooke about his latest attempts to persuade Serb
leader Milosevic to abide by U.N. Security Council demands in
Kosovo, the official said.
	   Holbrooke left Belgrade and was to meet Solana around 8 p.m.
(1800GMT), the official said.
	   If the Holbrooke talks fail, NATO was expected to approve an
activation order later on Monday, a vital step before airstrikes
can be launched.

Security remains tight for city councilors despite ETA cease-fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Governing party town councilors are still
being provided with bodyguards and told to check under their cars
for bombs despite the truce declared by the armed separatist group
ETA, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Nearly four weeks since the cease-fire was announced security
measures remain tight because the government believes the
separatists are still monitoring the movements of governing party
town councilors as potential targets, leading daily El Pais
reported.
	   Prior to the cease-fire local-level representatives of Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar's Popular Party had become ETA's main
targets.
	   Five of the seven people killed over the last year by ETA _ an
acronym standing for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the Basque
language _ were Popular Party councilors.
	   Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja refused to confirm or deny
the El Pais report that ETA was still monitoring councilors as
possible victims.
	   But Mayor Oreja, the minister responsible for security in Spain,
did affirm that security measures for these politicians had not
been relaxed, national Spanish radio reported.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in its 30-year campaign for an
independent Basque homeland covering a small part of northern Spain
and southern France.
	   On Sept. 18 the group called its first ever indefinite
cease-fire, seeking to set in motion a peace process that would
produce a negotiated end the conflict.
	   The Spanish government reacted suspiciously to the truce,
rejecting the idea of political negotiations on the issue of Basque
self-determination and demanding that ETA prove it intended to lay
down its arms forever.
	   All political parties in the northern Basque County _ from
Aznar's Popular Party to the ETA-linked political coalition Herri
Batasuna _ are currently immersed in campaigning for regional
elections set for Oct 25.

Italian Olympic Committee antidoping prosecutor resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with players deciding against strike, edits to
conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The chief antidoping prosecutor of Italy's
Olympic Committee resigned Monday, the latest victim of a doping
scandal that has shaken Italian soccer.
	   But professional soccer players dropped the threat of a strike,
agreeing instead to measures designed to safeguard their health.
	   The players' association had threatened a six-month walkout to
protest the handling of the inquiries, which it claims violate
players' privacy.
	   Ugo Longo, the antidoping prosecutor, said ``difficult work
conditions'' motivated his decision.
	   Since the summer, Longo had been conducting one of four
inquiries into the use of banned substances by Italy's first
division soccer players. Investigators have reportedly discovered
that some tests were not complete and results of others might have
been hidden.
	   The doping debacle has already seen CONI president Mario
Pescante resign and the chief of CONI's Acqua Acetosa laboratory,
Emilio Gasbarrone, fired.
	   The Acqua Acetosa lab was shut down after an International
Olympic Committee (IOC) official deemed the facility
unsatisfactory.
	   AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman sparked the investigations in July
when he raised questions about the sudden muscular development of
certain players.

EU hunkers down for long battle over budget share out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With EU-Finance &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers dug in Monday
for what is expected to be a long battle over how to share out the
EU's dlrs 100 million annual budget.
	   Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden say they pay too
much into the EU's coffers compared with what they get back in
benefits, and demand the money be divvied up more fairly.
	   ``There is a lack of burden-sharing in the budget,'' German
Finance Minister Theo Waigel told a news conference. ``This is
something that cannot be continued under the new system.''
	   Monday's day-long meeting of the 15 EU finance ministers, was
Waigel's last after almost 10 year's. He is stepping down following
the center-right government's defeat in last month's elections.
	   However, the incoming Social Democrat-led administration is not
expected to relax Germany's stance. ``Any German government that
abandoned that line would be doing itself a disservice,'' Waigel
claimed.
	   Resistance from other nations, notably France and Spain, seems
sure to ensure that the budget wrangle will drag on until the
deadline of June 1999.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said any budget
reform should also look at the special deal won for Britain in 1984
by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when she famously told
other EU leaders ``we want our money back.''
	   ``Either we open the whole contributions file or we keep in
closed,'' Strauss-Kahn told reporters. ``We cannot have half
measures.''
	   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown insisted
there can be no tampering with the payback deal which is estimated
to save Britain about 2 billion pounds (dlrs 3.4 billion) a year.
	   Aside from who pays what, the budget reforms will seek to
completely overhaul EU spending for the six year's starting in
2000, a period when Cyprus and five eastern European nations are
expected to join the Union.
	   A key to success will be a reform of the EU's farm subsidy
program which currently eats up half of the overall budget.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke will
leave Belgrade on Monday for Brussels to brief NATO envoys on the
results of his talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, a
U.S. source said.
	   In Moscow, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told Russia's
Interfax news agency said Milosevic agreed to allow a 1,500-member
international observer force in Kosovo to verify compliance with
U.N. Security Council demands to end the crackdown in the majority
Albanian province.
	   Interfax said Russia was prepared to provide aircraft to the
force. The verification force was believed to have been the major
obstacle to a deal to prevent NATO airstrikes.
	   The U.S. source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Holbrooke wanted to brief NATO ambassadors on the results of his
talks with Milosevic aimed at persuading him to accept U.N. demands
for ending the crackdown in Kosovo.
	   Ambassadors from the 16 NATO members were meeting Monday at
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to consider whether to approve
an activation order, the last military step before airstrikes can
be launched.
	   The source indicated Holbrooke had made enough progress that he
needed to update NATO personally.
	   A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an
activation order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in
Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated
275,000 uprooted since February's crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over
Yugoslavia.

conditions exists for peaceful, political solution to the Kosovo

275,000 uprooted since February's crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over
Yugoslavia.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO nations began assessing a U.S.
envoy's report on Kosovo talks Monday in Belgrade before deciding
whether to take the last military step needed to launch airstrikes
against the Serbs.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana talked ``at length'' over
the phone with U.S. evoy Richard Holbrooke about his latest
attempts to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to abide
by U.N. Security Council demands in Kosovo, a NATO official, who
demanded anonymity, said.
	   No details of the discussions were available.
	   If the Holbrooke talks fail, NATO is expected to approve an
activation order later on Monday, a vital step before airstrikes
can be launched.
	   A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an
activation order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in
Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated
275,000 uprooted since February's crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over
Yugoslavia.
	   From then on, Gen. Clark would no longer need any approval from
the 16 member nations and proceed only in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana, NATO officials said on condition
of anonymity.
	   ``We are heading toward decision time now,'' said the NATO
official. Solana and Holbrooke have been in close touch over the
past week. The few days between any activation order and actual
airstrikes allow Milosevic more time to consider the consequences.
	   NATO authorities also met with Russian representatives at NATO
headquarters Monday in an ongoing attempt to keep Moscow informed
on the military preparations. Russia opposes airstrikes against
Yugoslavia and has long been lobbying for a negotiated solution.
Moscow has threatened to veto any U.N. resolution calling for
airstrikes.
	   Almost all NATO members have cleared barriers to participating
in airstrikes. On Monday, the outgoing German government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was also expected to back potential NATO
airstrikes.
	   Prior to the activation order, NATO officials agreed on rules of
engagement, targeting, liaison with humanitarian organizations in
Kosovo and the safety of NATO troops in Bosnia.
	   The NATO alliance also reached common ground on a legal basis
for airstrikes over the weekend, removing uncertainty whether an
additional U.N. resolution was necessary.
	   The Americans, and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a part of the Yugoslav republic.
	   On Monday, the alliance ambassadors were still hoping for a
change of mind on the part of Milosevic, but ``the latest
impression is that all is the same,'' said the NATO official.

BELGRADE: over Yugoslavia.

	   Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering
planes and missiles launched.
	   NATO still may not use force immediately, but a flurry of
diplomatic evacuations by Western nations from Yugoslavia added to
a sense that intervention is imminent barring a breakthrough in
negotiations.
	   The international diplomats' mission observing events evacuated
Kosovo for neighboring Macedonia, with the Russian members the last
to depart. Sources at the American Embassy in Belgrade said all but
12 foreign staff were being evacuated to Budapest, and an embassy
statement said personnel in ``non-emergency situations'' had left.
	   A State Department advisory urged all U.S. citizens to leave
Yugoslavia, and Americans in the Serb part of neighboring Bosnia
also were advised to leave. The German, Austrian, British and other
foreign embassies closed down Monday.
	   Milosevic was expected to make a statement on the evening TV
news after meeting with Holbrooke for seven of the past eight days,
including several hours on Monday.
	   Holbrooke described his earlier overnight meeting with Milosevic
as ``intense, indeed, and at times very heated.'' He said the
standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can only be
called an emergency.''
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the outgoing German government said it intends to
allow German warplanes to participate in any attack.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, which
could last ``several days.''
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a Yugoslav republic.
	   The major obstacle appeared to be Holbrooke's request that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   The Belgrade daily Nasa Borba reported Monday that Milosevic was
reluctantly considering the demand, but there was no confirmation.
	   The U.N. Security Council demands include an immediate
cease-fire, a withdrawal of special troops in the province,
allowing refugees to return home and beginning talks with
independence-minded ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Milosevic's crackdown on the KLA has killed hundreds, and forced
at least 270,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   The Romanian government agreed to let NATO use its airspace in
an emergency, and Hungarian authorities were considering a similar
request from the organization.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov again expressed his
country's opposition to any NATO strike but said a military
response by Moscow to such an attack was ``out of the question.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Fair to partly cloudy skies were observed across the local area
this morning as early morning showers and thunderstorms died over
water well before sunrise, leaving isolated showers across the
local waters. However, numerous showers and thunderstorms
associated with a tropical wave were beginning to spread into large
portions of the eastern Caribbean and will threaten our area by
Tuesday morning.
	   An upper-level low pressure system located over the Mona Passage
is expected to maintain very unstable atmospheric conditions
locally for the next few days, producing a good chance for
afternoon showers and thunderstorms across the mountains and
interior of Puerto Rico. Partly cloudy skies across the local
islands through noon time today will give way to increasing clouds
and the development of scattered showers and thunderstorms across
interior and western Puerto Rico. Widely scattered to scattered
showers and a few thunderstorms are expected to affect the
remainder of the local area, including the Virgin Islands and the
local coastal waters. A few of these showers and thunderstorms will
produce very heavy rainfall and dangerous lightning. Urban and
stream flooding should be expected across the interior of Puerto
Rico this afternoon.
	   A very active tropical wave moving into the Lesser Antilles this
morning is expected to bring widespread showers and thunderstorms
to the Virgin Islands beginning after midnight tonight and reaching
eastern Puerto Rico around sunrise Tuesday morning. Tuesday through
much of Tuesday night could prove to be a very rainy period for the
local islands as the tropical wave moves westward through the
region and very heavy rainfall will be possible across the entire
area.

Primakov warns NATO against airstrikes

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Monday that
NATO strikes against Yugoslavia could harm Russian-NATO relations,
and his defense minister said Russia might be willing to provide
military observation planes as part of a political solution to the
crisis in Kosovo province.
	   NATO bombardment ``will throw relations between NATO and Russia
far back, will jeopardize many of the cooperation accords that have
been reached in recent years,'' Primakov was quoted as saying by
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Russia vehemently opposes airstrikes against Yugoslavia, a
traditional ally with which it shares a Slavic heritage and
Orthodox religion, and has been lobbying for a negotiated solution
to the crisis in the ethnic Albanian-dominated province of Kosovo.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told reporters that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic had agreed to the stationing of 1,500
observers in Kosovo, and said Russia would consider taking part,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``We are prepared to provide our planes for international
control of Yugoslav air space,'' he was quoted as saying. No one
was available for comment at the Defense Ministry, and no other
details of Sergeyev's statement were provided.
	   Earlier Monday, Boris Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said
the president was ``cautiously optimistic'' that chances for a
peaceful solution have ``slightly increased'' because of U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke's extended talks with Milosevic, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Yakushkin said the Kosovo crisis was one of the reasons Yeltsin
agreed to cut short his trip to Central Asia. Doctors ordered him
to return to Moscow for health reasons.
	   The ``huge responsibility in connection with the situation
regarding Kosovo weighs on the president,'' Yakushkin said.
	   Sergeyev also expressed optimism, but he told reporters that the
government was looking at several alternative reactions to possible
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia, including a change in Russia's
relationship with the western alliance, Interfax said.
	   Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov warned that
Russia would break the arms embargo and annul all agreements with
NATO if the alliance launches airstrikes to force Serbia, the
leading republic in Yugoslavia, to end its violent crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   ``NATO should not think that Russia is weak and that its
historical geopolitical interests in the Balkans can be
disregarded,'' Zyuganov said before a meeting with Yugoslavia's
acting ambassador in Russia, Radoslav Paikovic.
	   Paikovic said that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
brother Borislav had been named ambassador to Moscow, Interfax
said.
	   Cautioning that Russia has ``commitments to an ally in the
Balkans,'' Zyuganov said that if war breaks out following NATO
attacks ``other laws go into effect, including the laws of allied
relations.''
	   Some Russian media sources have reported that the country's
state arms exporter, Rosvooruzheniye, has already violated the
embargo by supplying land-to-air missiles to Yugoslavia.
	   But the company's general director, Oleg Sidorenko, denied the
report Monday, Interfax said.
	   Russia has recalled its representative to NATO and its
ambassador to Belgium, where NATO has its headquarters, for
consultations. Foreign Ministry official Vladimir Chizov said their
return to Brussels will depend on developments, the Interfax news
agency reported Monday.
	   Russia is also considering whether to recall its 10 observers
based in Kosovo now that western diplomats have left the region,
which may no longer be safe, ITAR-Tass said.

BELGRADE: over Yugoslavia.
</HEADLINE>

	   Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering
planes and missiles launched.
	   NATO still may not use force immediately, but a flurry of
diplomatic evacuations by Western nations from Yugoslavia added to
a sense that intervention is imminent barring a breakthrough in
negotiations.
	   The international diplomats' mission observing events evacuated
Kosovo for neighboring Macedonia, with the Russian members the last
to depart. Sources at the American Embassy in Belgrade said all but
12 foreign staff were being evacuated to Budapest, and an embassy
statement said personnel in ``non-emergency situations'' had left.
	   A State Department advisory urged all U.S. citizens to leave
Yugoslavia, and Americans in the Serb part of neighboring Bosnia
also were advised to leave. The German, Austrian, British and other
foreign embassies closed down Monday.
	   Milosevic was expected to make a statement on the evening TV
news after meeting with Holbrooke for seven of the past eight days,
including several hours on Monday.
	   Holbrooke described his earlier overnight meeting with Milosevic
as ``intense, indeed, and at times very heated.'' He said the
standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can only be
called an emergency.''
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the outgoing German government said it intends to
allow German warplanes to participate in any attack.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, which
could last ``several days.''
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a Yugoslav republic.
	   The major obstacle appeared to be Holbrooke's request that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   The Belgrade daily Nasa Borba reported Monday that Milosevic was
reluctantly considering the demand, but there was no confirmation.
	   The U.N. Security Council demands include an immediate
cease-fire, a withdrawal of special troops in the province,
allowing refugees to return home and beginning talks with
independence-minded ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Milosevic's crackdown on the KLA has killed hundreds, and forced
at least 270,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   The Romanian government agreed to let NATO use its airspace in
an emergency, and Hungarian authorities were considering a similar
request from the organization.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov again expressed his
country's opposition to any NATO strike but said a military
response by Moscow to such an attack was ``out of the question.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Forest fires raged for the second consecutive
day Monday in northern and central Israel.
	   Some houses were burned and people were evacuated from three
villages, but no fatalities or serious injury were reported.
	   The biggest fire was on the slopes of the Carmel range south of
Haifa.
	   With hot weather and high winds, the blaze spread to the
picturesque artists village of Ein Hod, the nearby Arab village of
Ein Chud and the communal village of Nir Etzion in the Carmel
forest. Both villages were evacuated.
	   Fourteen houses in Ein Hod were destroyed or damaged. Some
historic homes were damaged in nearby Zichron Yaacov.
	   Air force helicopters and civilian crop-spraying light aircraft
were brought in to help the fire-fighters.
	   Smaller fires broke out again in the Carmel Forest below the
Haifa neighborhood of Deniya, where thousands of residents were
evacuated Sunday during what was described as the country's biggest
forest fire ever.
	   Firefighters said Monday's fire in the Carmel range was even
bigger, but was not close to any large town or neighborhood.
	   Forest fires also broke out in the Jerusalem area, Western
Galilee and around the Arab towns and villages of central Israel.
In the Jerusalem area the fire set off some mines in an old
minefield but nobody was hurt.
	   Four Israeli Arabs were arrested on suspicion of starting fires
in the past two weeks in the Wadi Ara area, Israel radio reported.
Police and Arab residents recently clashed in Wadi Ara over a land
dispute.
	   However investigations so far showed that Monday's fires were
caused by picnickers leaving embers smoldering from their
barbecues, Fire-Fighting Commissioner Moshe Vardi said.

Carlo Sirtori, early leader in cancer research, dies at 86
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Dr. Carlo Sirtori, a cancer specialist and a
leader in bringing medical information to the public, died Monday
at Palazzo Visconti, his Milan home. He was 86.
	   An international figure in cancer research, Sirtori was a
pioneer in classifying and naming tumors, Italy's ANSA news service
said.
	   Sirtori also served as cancer adviser to the U.N. World Health
Organization and director of the National Tumor Institute in Italy.
	   Known in Italy for bringing complicated medical information to
people in simple language, he appeared on television and wrote
weekly columns for Italian magazines, including the
mass-circulation ``Gente'' and ``Gioia.''
	   He died of cerebral vascular disease, his family said.
	   Sirtori is survived by his wife, Antonia Bincardi, and three
children. Funeral services take place Wednesday at his family home
and at the nearby church of St. Babila.

President appeals to parliament over government's fate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma asked the Ukrainian
parliament on Monday not to launch a vote of no-confidence against
his struggling government.
	   Such a step would only ``aggravate the situation in the
country'' and could negatively affect Ukraine's already battered
economy, Kuchma said at a Cabinet meeting.
	   ``Nobody would win, no political force would benefit from that,
and ordinary people would suffer, as usual,'' the president said.
	   The dominant centrist and leftist opposition legislators in the
Verkhovna Rada are insisting that parliament consider the fate of
Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko's government.
	   About 200 lawmakers in the 450-seat Rada voted last week to
include the issue of a possible no-confidence vote in parliament's
session agenda.
	   But parliament speaker Oleksandr Tkachenko and his deputies
argue that the government should first be allowed to present its
1999 budget and implement a series of planned steps to battle
Ukraine's deepening economic crisis.
	   The matter of no-confidence should be postponed at least until
November, Tkachenko said Monday, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Kuchma, meanwhile, lashed out at his centrist and Socialist
opponents for trying to bring down Pustovoitenko's Cabinet at a
difficult time for Ukraine, yet stressed that he would be prepared
to make ``serious changes'' in the government if his parliamentary
foes make such proposals.
	   Kuchma also said he would ``officially'' offer Communist leader
Petro Symonenko the chance to head the Cabinet if his faction,
which holds about a quarter of parliament seats, votes against the
current government.
	   The president has made such offers before, trying to show that
Communists were not ready to assume responsibility for leading the
nation.
	   Pustovoitenko gave the Cabinet a grim account of Ukraine's
economic situation, saying he feared the ``wave of the world
financial crisis that is approaching Ukraine.''
	   The former Soviet republic of 50 million people already has
suffered badly from the consequences of world economic
developments, notably the crisis in neighboring Russia.
	   Pustovoitenko reported a 0.3 percent drop in industrial output
since the start of the year and said prices for industrial goods
had grown by 9.4 percent in September alone.
	   The turmoil in Russia also has pushed the national hryvna
currency to lose 71 percent of its value so far this year,
including a 51 percent drop last month, Pustovoitenko said. The
hryvna traded at 3.42 to the U.S. dollar on Monday, down from about
2.1 before the Russian crisis.

Study finds Canada's Indians don't share high living standards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Though Canada is No. 1 in a United Nations
quality-of-life ranking, a new government study suggests Indians on
reserves have living conditions lower than those in Mexico or
Thailand.
	   For the past six years, Canada has topped a human-development
index compiled by the United Nations on the basis of per capita
income, education levels and life expectancy.
	   Canada's Department of Indian Affairs, applying the index
specifically to aboriginals for the first time, found that the
380,000 Indians living on reserves in Canada would rank 63rd among
the 173 countries in the U.N. index _ about the same level as
Brazil.
	   Indians living off reserves came in 35th, equal to Russia,
according to the study, which was made public Monday.
	   ``This is not a surprise for us,'' said Phil Fontaine, head of
the national assembly of Indian chiefs. ``We live this every day.
People have to be cautious about using the fact that we're No. 1,
that Canada is the best place in the world to live.''
	   According to recent government statistics, the life expectancy
of Indians on reserves is seven years less than the national
average, and income levels are about half the national average.

Handbag thief gets sentencing break, but still must serve three

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ An Irish woman ordered imprisoned for
nine years for stealing a handbag received a sentence reduction
Monday _ but still must serve six years.
	   Sabrina Walsh, 20, was originally sentenced in Dublin's Circuit
Court in June after stealing a handbag containing 10,000 Irish
pounds (dlrs 7,000) and jewellery from an English tourist in a
cafe.
	   Walsh's lawyer, Fergal Foley, argued for a reduction in the
sentence, saying his client had not been aware of the contents of
the bag when she stole it.
	   The Irish Court of Criminal Appeal agreed to lower the sentence
to six years, but Judge Hugh O'Flaherty warned that
handbag-snatching was ``like a cancer on society'' and had to be
stamped out.
	   He said people involved in stealing handbags ``will get
exemplary sentences from now on.''

Ukrainian court sentences two women for icon smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian court sentenced two women to
prison for trying to smuggle valuable icons abroad, a news agency
reported Monday.
	   The court in the city of Evpatoria on the Crimean Peninsula gave
each of the two unidentified women three years in prison after they
acknowledged their attempt to smuggle 20 icons dating back to the
early 19th century, Interfax reported.
	   The women were arrested last October in Evpatoria, located on
Crimea's Black Sea coast. On the same day, local customs officers
discovered the icons in a garbage container on a passenger ship
that was about to leave for Turkey.
	   Investigators found out that the women had brought the icons on
board under their clothes, and planned to sell them abroad.
	   The confiscated icons were valued at dlrs 6,000, Interfax said.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Continuing his dominance in Asia,
second-seeded Michael Chang captured the rain-delayed dlrs 315,000
Heineken Open Monday by defeating top-seeded Goran Ivanisevic 4-6,
6-1, 6-2.
	   The final had been pushed back a day by heavy rain.
	   It was Chang's second title of the year, and his 12th in Asia.
Chang, an American of Chinese descent, won five titles last year
and finished the season ranked third in the world. But his ranking
has fallen to 33rd this season after suffering a series of
injuries.
	   Ivanisevic failed in his bid to win his second title of the
year, falling to 4-6 lifetime to Chang. The 27-year-old left-hander
has now lost three finals since winning at his hometown of Split,
Croatia, in February. He was also runner-up at Wimbledon in July.
	   Chang earned dlrs 45,000.

Muslim leaders worldwide urge armed groups to join truce
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with Salvation Front reaction; rewrites; TRIMS
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Muslim leaders around the world have appealed to
Islamic insurgents in Algeria to lay down their arms and urged
authorities to seek reconciliation in a conflict in which more than
75,000 people have died.
	   The statement, dated Sunday and received here Monday, said blind
violence that kills women, children and the elderly _ which has
been widespread in the nearly 7-year-old insurgency _ is contrary
to Islam.
	   Hailing a truce called a year ago by the Islamic Salvation Army,
an insurgency faction, the statement said other insurgents should
join in and Algerian authorities should use it to ``strengthen the
bases for national global reconciliation.''
	   The statement was signed by 30 Muslim leaders and intellectuals
from Malaysia to Morocco, from the head of Egypt's banned Muslim
Brotherhood to university professors.
	   The signatories ``consider the truce ... a good work and a bold
patriotic position that has contributed in an appreciable manner to
diminishing the level of killings, destruction and attacks on
sacred laws,'' the statement said.
	   Accusations of apostasy by armed groups concerning fellow
Muslims are an ``ignominy,'' leading to ``great evil.'' Blind
killings, likewise, give ``the enemies of Islam the occasion to
deform'' the religion, the statement said.
	   Algerian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdelaziz Sbaa, in a dry
comment, said authorities ``have long waited'' for such a
statement.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Armed Islamic Group,
the radical insurgency movement held responsible for numerous
massacres.
	   The Islamic Salvation Army, the military wing of the banned
Islamic Salvation Front, called the truce in part to ``unmask the
enemy hiding behind the abominable massacres.''
	   But the truce has been belittled by some as a unilateral
cease-fire by a poorly equipped force. It even divided the Islamic
Salvation Front, some of whose members consider the truce a virtual
surrender.
	   The insurgency erupted after the army-backed government canceled
January 1992 legislative elections to thwart a likely victory by
the Islamic Salvation Front.
	   A spokesman for the Salvation Front's headquarters-in-exile,
Abdelkrime Ould Adda, said the Front hoped the statement ``can help
in finding a peaceful political solution to the crisis.''
	   Among signatories were: Mustapha Mashhour, leader of Egypt's

Gazza spends weekend in drying out clinic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English soccer's troubled genius Paul Gascoigne
has been admitted to a specialist drug and alcohol clinic at the
behest of Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson.
	   And former England teammate Paul Merson, who broke down Monday
as he tried to recount his own recovery at the clinic where
Gascoigne is being treated, predicted Gazza could be out of the
game for six weeks.
	   Gascoigne's manager last week said the Middlesbrough midfielder
he had superseded the late Princess Diana as the British media's
biggest target.
	   True to form, the fallen star's latest attempt to overcome his
well publicized drink problem was splashed across the front pages
of every national tabloid Monday.
	   The Sun headline read: ``Gazza in Booze Clinic. Sozzled star is
sent to dry out by soccer boss.''
	   The paper also offered a reward of a carton of beer to any
reader who spotted Gascoigne ``slipping back into his old habits.''
	   The 31-year-old former international was admitted to the Priory
Clinic, at Roehampton in south-west London, on the weekend. Reports
on his state of health and mind and calls of encouragement from
supporters and players have saturated the British media.
	   Gazza was involved in a spate of alcohol-related incidents last
week which culminated in his admission to the clinic.
	   He reportedly returned from a Middlesbrough team trip to Ireland
and was found drunk and sobbing at a train station. Earlier he
allegedly crashed the team bus and reportedly ran naked through the
club's training facility.
	   Robson, a former England teammate of Gascoigne's, said the media
had contributed to Gazza's problems by relentlessly hounding him.
	   Gascoigne has been followed by controversy since he was axed
from the England national team by Glenn Hoddle on the eve of the
France '98 World Cup for being unfit.
	   His axing followed reports of his drunken benders in nightclubs
in England and Spain in the leadup to tournament.
	   The England manager later slated Gascoigne in a World Cup book,
revealing how the Middlesbrough star went beserk and smashed up a
hotel room when he was given the news of his axing.
	   In the meantime, one of his closest friends died after spending
a night out with Gascoigne and his stormy two-year marriage ended
when his wife Sheryl was granted a ``quickie'' divorce on the
grounds of what was described as his unreasonable behavior.
	   Gascoigne had turned to 33-year-old Sheryl for support after he
was dropped from the England team. The couple went on a Florida
vacation together. But despite the player's hopes of a
reconciliation, Sheryl decided to go ahead with the divorce.
	   She said Monday that she had spoken to Gazza but he would not be
rejoining her at their former marital home.
	   Middlesbrough spokesman David Allan said Gascoigne would stay
away from the club until the clinic staff consider his symptoms.
	   ``The club will be guided by (the clinic's) advice over his
welfare,'' he said.
	   Robson confirmed that Gascoigne was suffering from alcohol and
stress related problems.
	   ``Gazza has got a problem. It's been building up for quite a few
years,'' he said.
	   ``We're going to try and help the lad. We're not like some other
people saying they want to help him because they've done nothing
but try to destroy him for the last six weeks.''
	   ``As a club, we're going to get on with that and as a manager
and a friend, I'm going to try and help Gazza as much as I can.''
	   Gascoigne joined Middlesbrough late last season from Glasgow
Rangers. He previously played for Newcastle, Tottenham and Italian
club Lazio.

Holbrooke leaves talks for Brussels; Milosevic concession reported
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES previous

 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke wrapped
up marathon talks with President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday and
left for Brussels to brief NATO amid indications a breakthrough was
near to avert airstrikes over Kosovo.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists in
Moscow that Milosevic has agreed to allow 1,500 international
observers to monitor compliance with U.N. demands to halt the
crackdown in Kosovo. If true, that would represent a key concession
by the Yugoslav leader.
	   Sergeyev expressed optimism that a political settlement could be
reached, even as NATO was positioning itself for airstrikes,
preparing to authorize an attack should the Milosevic-Holbrooke
talks fail.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of Milosevic's reported
concession. But a statement from Milosevic's office said Holbrooke
would return and hold more talks Tuesday.
	   It said Milosevic ``has concluded that undoubtably, necessary
conditions exist for a peaceful political solution to the Kosovo
problem.''
	   A U.S. source, speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated
that Holbrooke had made enough progress that he needed to update
NATO personally.
	   Sergeyev said Russia, which as Yugoslavia's ally has tried to
broker a deal that would avoid NATO intervention, was prepared to
provide planes and consider participating in the monitoring force.
	   Ambassadors from the 16 NATO members were meeting Monday at
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, and appeared set to approve an
activation order, the last military step before airstrikes can be
launched.
	   A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an
activation order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in
Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated
275,000 uprooted since February's crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over
Yugoslavia.
	   Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering
planes and missiles launched.
	   Holbrooke's last-minute mission to Brussels followed a flurry of
diplomatic evacuations by Western nations from Yugoslavia. That
added to a sense that intervention is imminent _ barring a
breakthrough in negotiations.
	   The international diplomats' mission observing events evacuated
Kosovo for neighboring Macedonia, with the Russian members the last
to depart. Sources at the American Embassy in Belgrade said all but
12 foreign staff were being evacuated to Budapest, and an embassy
statement said personnel in ``non-emergency situations'' had left.
	   A State Department advisory urged all U.S. citizens to leave
Yugoslavia, and Americans in the Serb part of neighboring Bosnia
also were advised to leave. The German, Austrian, British and other
foreign embassies closed down Monday.
	   Milosevic was expected to make a statement on the evening TV
news after meeting with Holbrooke for seven of the past eight days,
including several hours on Monday.
	   Holbrooke described his earlier overnight meeting with Milosevic
as ``intense, indeed, and at times very heated.'' He said the
standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav president ``can only be
called an emergency.''
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the outgoing German government said it intends to
allow German warplanes to participate in any attack.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, which
could last ``several days.''
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a Yugoslav republic.
	   The major obstacle appeared to be Holbrooke's request that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   The Belgrade daily Nasa Borba reported Monday that Milosevic was
reluctantly considering the demand, but there was no confirmation.
	   The U.N. Security Council demands include an immediate
cease-fire, a withdrawal of special troops in the province,
allowing refugees to return home and beginning talks with
independence-minded ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Milosevic's crackdown on the KLA has killed hundreds, and forced
at least 270,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   The Romanian government agreed to let NATO use its airspace in
an emergency, and Hungarian authorities were considering a similar
request from the organization.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov again expressed his
country's opposition to any NATO strike but said a military
response by Moscow to such an attack was ``out of the question.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.
	   Efforts to end the seven-month crisis intensified following
allegations that Serb police massacred scores of ethnic Albanian
refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will bring a humanitarian
disaster if thousands remain homeless by the first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. The U.S. administration
believes, however, that it does not need a new U.N. resolution for
the attacks.

Doctors say alleged Nazi fit to testify
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A court-appointed panel of doctors
said Monday that Aleksandras Lileikis is fit to stand trial on Nazi
war crimes charges, but warned that the stress of court proceedings
could endanger his life.
	   The ruling leaves in doubt whether the 91-year-old former U.S.
resident will be brought to trial. Attempts to start proceedings
against him on charges of genocide have repeatedly been delayed and
many critics contend Lithuanian authorities are hoping Lileikis
will die before a trial starts.
	   The trial was supposed to begin in mid-September, but Lileikis'
legal team said he was too ill to appear in court. Lithuanian law
does not allow trial in absentia for medical reasons and the court
ordered a panel of doctors to assess his health.
	   Lileikis was head of the security police in the Lithuanian
capital during the 1941-44 Nazi occupation. He is charged with
ordering the arrests of scores of Jews and turning them over to a
Nazi execution squad. About 90 percent of Lithuania's 240,000 Jews
were killed during World War II.
	   ``The current state of Lileikis' health does allow him to take
part and testify in the trial, but any stress could lead to a
health condition hazardous to his life,'' the doctors' panel said
Monday.
	   But the panel chairman, Henrikas Ulevicius, refused to be
comment on whether the trial should go ahead, saying only that
``the judge has do decide whether to bring Lileikis to the
courtroom.''
	   Lileikis' lawyer reacted angrily to the ruling.
	   ``I am deeply shocked by the news that physicians have allowed a
subpoena to be issued,'' Algimantas Matuiza told The Associated
Press. ``His health is getting worse every day.''
	   Lileikis emigrated to the United States in 1955, and lived in
Norwood, Mass., where he worked for a Lithuanian publishing house.
	   He returned to Lithuania more than two years ago as the United
was undertaking efforts to revoke his citizenship and deport him.

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ An Irish woman ordered imprisoned for
nine years for stealing a handbag received a sentence reduction
Monday _ but still must serve six years.
	   Sabrina Walsh, 20, was originally sentenced in Dublin's Circuit
Court in June after stealing a handbag containing 10,000 Irish
pounds (dlrs 7,000) and jewellery from an English tourist in a
cafe.
	   Walsh's lawyer, Fergal Foley, argued for a reduction in the
sentence, saying his client had not been aware of the contents of
the bag when she stole it.
	   The Irish Court of Criminal Appeal agreed to lower the sentence
to six years, but Judge Hugh O'Flaherty warned that
handbag-snatching was ``like a cancer on society'' and had to be
stamped out.
	   He said people involved in stealing handbags ``will get
exemplary sentences from now on.''

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three Americans won a Nobel prize on
Monday for discovering that the body uses nitric oxide to regulate
blood vessels, a finding that helped in developing the
anti-impotence drug Viagra.
	   The finding also has other applications ranging from treating
heart disease to shock.
	   The Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine went to Robert F.
Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott, 82, is a
pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn,
Ignarro, 57, is at University of California-Los Angeles and Murad,
62, is at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston.
	   The dlrs 978,000 prize is divided equally among the three
winners.
	   The researchers discovered that nitric oxide tells blood vessels
to relax and widen, an effect that helps control blood pressure.
	   Nitric oxide, a colorless gas, makes blood vessels dilate by
relaxing the vessels' smooth muscles. It can help trigger erection
of the penis the same way, because the relaxation lets blood flow
in. The wildly popular Viagra is designed to increase nitric
oxide's effect.
	   The prizewinning work, while important for science and medicine,
was ``a small piece of information'' that researchers used in
creating Viagra, said Mariann Caprino, spokeswoman for Viagra maker
Pfizer Inc.
	   The winners' research has sparked studies on a wide range of new
drugs, including those that can be used in the treatment of
atherosclerosis and shock.
	   Studies also show that white blood cells use the gas to kill
infectious invaders, and to defend against tumors. This has led to
tests to see whether nitric oxide could be used to halt tumor
growth.
	   ``It was a sensation that this simple common air pollutant ...
could exert important functions'' in animals and people, said the
Karolinska Institute, which awards the prize.
	   Nitric oxide is different from nitrous oxide, better known as
laughing gas.
	   The honored work touches on the personal life of Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established
the prizes in his will.
	   In later life, Nobel's physician told him to take nitroglycerin
_ one of the ingredients in dynamite _ to combat heart trouble.
``However, it would take 100 years until it was clarified that
nitroglycerin acts by releasing nitric oxide gas,'' the citation
noted.
	   Murad, who worked independently of the other two winners, called
the announcement ``a delightful surprise.''
	   At first, scientists didn't think nitric oxide had so many
effects, he said, but ``a lot of researchers have now discovered
that nitric oxide does so many things and is so important.''
	   Furchgott, reached at his Long Island home, said ``I'm very
pleased. I truly wasn't sure I'd ever get an award like this. I
wasn't sure that I deserved it.''
	   He said he had planned to go to the dentist and possibly play
golf today, but ``I guess that's all changed now. I'll be answering
calls all day.''
	   He said he hasn't had enough time to think about what he would
do with his dlrs 326,000 share of the prize.

Report: organized killers nabbed in Lithuania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Lithuanian police have broken up a
ring of professional killers, believed to be responsible for more
than a dozen murders, the Lietuvos Rytas daily reported.
	   The 30-member gang, mostly ex-convicts also included at least
one established businessman and an opera singer, the newspaper said
at the weekend. About 15 of the gang members were arrested earlier
this month. Police were hunting the others, the report said.
	   The gang reportedly specialized in murder, but also carried out
several armed robberies, bombings and kidnappings, Lietuvos Rytas
said.
	   Among the alleged victims were well-known businessmen, several
currency traders and a taxi driver. In all, the gang is believed to
have been involved in 13 murders and six attempted murders from
1992 to 1998.
	   During a recent raid, police seized a large stockpile of
explosives, sub-machine guns and equipment used by gang members to
disguise themselves, the report said.
	   Lithuania experienced a sharp rise in crime after it broke from
the Soviet Union in 1991. Local police say that the murders are
often gang-related.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Jehovah's Witnesses opened an exhibit
in the eastern city of Dresden on Monday focusing on the
persecution of its members under the Nazis.
	   About 300 Jehovah's Witnesses were executed by the Nazis and
another 1,700 died in concentration camps, said exhibit organizer
Martin Jahn. More than 6,000 were jailed or sent to concentration
camps.
	   Jehovah's Witnesses were persecuted by the Nazis largely because
of their opposition to military service, Jahn said.
	   The persecution continued after the war in communist East
Germany, where authorities banned the group in 1950 because of its
pacifist views, and jailed about 5,000 members of the group, Jahn
said.
	   The exhibit, including 500 documents and diagrams, is being
displayed in a former courthouse where the Nazis executed more than
1,300 people.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis are closer than
ever to stepping into the boxing ring to fight for the title of the
undisputed heavyweight champion of the World.
	   Holyfield's promoter Don King arrived for a meeting with Lewis'
manager Frank Maloney in London on Monday saying ``we are going to
make a deal.''
	   ``I don't know when and I don't know where the fight will take
place, but we are going to work to make it happen,'' King said
Monday.
	   ``It's important for the world to get these two champions
together.
	   ``The world at large is waiting with bated breath to see who is
going to be the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.''
	   King, who was in Paris on the weekend for a World title
promotion, has given the strongest indication yet that a deal can
be struck for a bout between Holyfield, WBA and IBF titlist, and
Lewis, the WBC champion.
	   ``If it doesn't take place soon, it won't take place at all, you
ain't got too many options here,'' King said.
	   ``I'm coming to London to see what I can do. It's going to be a
major match _ major, major, major,'' he added.
	   In April, Holyfield declined a dlrs 20 million offer from the
Home Box Office cable television network to put his two world
heavyweight belts on the line against Lewis.
	   But now King, who screens his promotions on the Showtime
network, says he can come to a deal with HBO, which has a contract
with Lewis.
	   King is expected to hold talks with Maloney and Lewis' promoter
Panos Eliades during his visit to London.
	   Maloney, who has managed Lewis for nine years, is also expected
to discuss a business offer from King to manage his interests in
Britain.

UN chief phones Milosevic, Yugoslav leader says he's trying to
</HEADLINE>
comply &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan phoned
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday to urge him to
comply with U.N. resolutions calling for a cease-fire and political
settlement in Kosovo, a spokesman said.
	   Milosevic responded that he was ``in the process of complying,
or trying to come into full compliance with the Security Council
resolutions,'' spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   Annan's call came hours before NATO began considering whether to
authorize military strikes against Serbs, who are trying to quash
an independence movement by Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   It also came as U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke wrapped up marathon
talks with Milosevic and prepared to brief NATO ambassadors on his
efforts to reach an agreement allowing for international observers
to oversee a cease-fire in the southern Serb province.
	   Annan and Milosevic discussed some of the details of the
Holbrooke talks, Eckhard said without elaborating.
	   The U.N. chief met Friday with Yugoslavia's acting U.N.
ambassador, Vladislav Jovanovic, and called for ``every effort to
be made'' to reach a political settlement, Eckhard said.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, have been fighting since February for independence from
Serbia. Hundreds have been killed and over 270,000 have fled their
homes in the wake of Serb reprisals.
	   The West doesn't support independence for Kosovo, but wants
Milosevic to restore the broad autonomy he stripped from the
province in 1989.
	   In a Sept. 23 resolution, the 15-member Security Council
demanded a cease-fire, the withdrawal of special Serb police units
from the province, and movement toward a negotiated settlement. It
demanded the safe return of refugees and humanitarian access to
them.
	   The council threatened unspecified action if both sides failed
to comply.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As NATO positioned itself for
airstrikes on Yugoslavia, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke left for
Brussels Monday to brief NATO amid reports of progress toward a
deal to avert military action over Kosovo.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told reporters in Moscow
that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has agreed to allow
deployment of 1,500 observers in the embattled Serb province _ a
move that would be a key concession by Yugoslavia.
	   There was no immediate confirmation, but a statement from
Milosevic's office said Holbrooke would return to Belgrade and hold
more talks on Tuesday.
	   It said Milosevic ``has concluded that undoubtedly, necessary
conditions exist for a peaceful, political solution to the Kosovo
problem.''
	   After meeting Monday with Milosevic, Holbrooke left for Brussels
to brief ambassadors of the 16-member NATO on the results of his
talks, a U.S. source said. The source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, indicated Holbrooke had made enough progress that he
needed to do the briefing personally.
	   The major obstacle in talks had appeared to be Holbrooke's
request that Milosevic agree to an expanded international
monitoring mission in the Serb province of Kosovo to verify
compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   Other Security Council demands include an immediate cease-fire,
a withdrawal of special troops from Kosovo, letting refugees return
home and beginning talks with independence-minded ethnic Albanians
on Kosovo's future.
	   The Americans and Europeans want Milosevic to halt the crackdown
he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army.
Kosovo, where 90 percent of the population is ethnic Albanian, is a
Serbian province in southern Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic's crackdown on the KLA has killed hundreds and forced
at least 270,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes.
	   Should the talks between Holbrooke and Milosevic fail, officials
in Brussels were expected to vote on an ``activation order'' _ the
last military step before any NATO military strike can be launched.
	   The NATO order would transfer command over the airplanes and
other military hardware needed for an airstrike from member
countries to Supreme Allied Cmdr. Wesley K. Clark and authorize the
deployment over Yugoslavia.
	   Clark could then, in consultation with NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana, order planes and missiles launched.
	   Holbrooke and Milosevic have met every day for a week, excluding
Thursday, when Holbrooke met with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the German government said it intends to let
German warplanes participate in any attack.
	   French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country would
provide about 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes.
	   The foreign presence in Kosovo was being reduced in anticipation
of NATO action.
	   Most of an international diplomats' mission observing events in
Kosovo left for neighboring Macedonia before midday. Sources at the
U.S. Embassy in Belgrade said all but 12 foreign staff were being
evacuated to Budapest.
	   A U.S. State Department advisory urged Americans to leave
Yugoslavia, and the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo asked Americans in the
Serb part of neighboring Bosnia to evacuate.
	   The German Embassy also closed its office in the northwestern
Bosnian Serb town of Banja Luka and advised other German
organizations to leave.
	   The German and British embassies in Belgrade also were closed
Monday.
	   NATO authorities met with Russian representatives at NATO
headquarters Monday to keep Moscow informed on the military
preparations.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov has repeated his country's
opposition to any NATO strike but said a military response by
Moscow to such an attack was ``out of the question.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.
	   Efforts to end the crisis intensified following allegations that
Serb police massacred scores of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern
is mounting that winter will bring a humanitarian disaster if
thousands remain homeless by the first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. The U.S. administration
believes, however, that it does not need a new U.N. resolution for
the attacks.

Orthodox leader visits Poland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Archbishop of Constantinople and
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I awarded Poland's prime minister
a medal Monday for good cooperation with the Orthodox church.
	   Jerzy Buzek, who became prime minister after last year's
parliament elections, is a member of the Solidarity party in the
ruling coalition. He also is Protestant, which is considered
unusual in the predominantly Roman Catholic country.
	   In 1991, the Solidarity government passed a law giving the
Orthodox church in Poland the same rights as the Catholic church,
according to Interior Ministry official Krzysztof Wiktor.
	   Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of nearly 300 million
Orthodox Christians, also met Monday with Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the
leader of Poland's Roman Catholic Church.
	   At a religious ceremony Sunday after his arrival on a week long
trip to Poland, Bartholomew I appealed for more dialogue and
cooperation between churches. He also met with President Aleksander
Kwasniewski and awarded him a medal for helping ensure equal status
of churches in Poland.
	   Bartholomew I also will visit Krakow, the Auschwitz Nazi death
camp and Bialystok, the center of Poland's 550,000-strong Orthodox
community.

Arafat says summit should lead to further Israeli withdrawal

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said on
Monday that he hoped that an upcoming Palestinian-Israeli summit
meeting in Washington would set the ground for a further Israeli
pullback from the West Bank.
	   ``We hope it will not only be talk, talk, talk,'' Arafat told
reporters after a two-hour meeting with Crown Prince Hassan. The
crown prince is acting as regent while King Hussein is abroad.
	   ``We hope that this round will lead to concrete results on
Jerusalem ... and to the implementation of the U.S. proposal,''
Arafat said before returning home.
	   The U.S. proposal calls for Israel to withdraw from another 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel earlier had given the Palestinians full or shared control
of about 27 percent of the land.
	   Arafat has called repeatedly for an end to the expansion of
Israeli settlements in Jerusalem. Peace talks broke down in March
1997 after Israel began a housing project for Jews in traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The four-day Palestinian-Israeli summit is set to begin Thursday
outside the U.S. capital.
	   In his brief remarks, Arafat accused Israel of ``intransigence''
and said it had not yet announced acceptance of the U.S. proposal,
which he described as a catalyst to ``save the peace process and
push it forward.''
	   He said he was confident that President Clinton ``will ... make
the effort to arrive at a positive conclusion and positive
results'' at the Washington meeting.
	   Hassan said he was equally optimistic because ``it is imperative
to arrive at a visible threshold of achievement and this is what we
expect.''

Run-off local elections needed in most regions of Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Although conservatives celebrated election
gains against the Greece's governing Socialists, near complete
results Monday showed most races must be decided at next week's
run-off ballots.
	   The elections are considered a key referendum on the
government's policies, which include unpopular austerity programs
aimed at qualifying Greece for the European Union's single currency
club.
	   Athens' Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos was one of the few
candidates winning an outright majority in Sunday's elections with
a landslide 57.7 percent, returns said.
	   Other conservative candidates in Salonica and Piraeus also
gained majorities with 44.4 percent and 42.8 percent, respectively.
But they must face run-offs against Socialist candidates on Sunday.
	   The Socialists struggled to hide their dismay.
	   ``The course of the government ... will be judged at the end of
its term at the national elections of 2000,'' said acting
government spokesman Yiannis Nikolaou.
	   Local elections cannot change the socialists' grip on
parliament. But the outcome _ two years before the general
elections _ is widely interpreted as a test for Premier Costas
Simitis.
	   Of the 50 regional governor races across the country, 14
rendered winners through absolute majorities in the first round _
seven conservatives and seven Socialists.
	   Most of the 900 mayoral seats will also be decided in the
run-off vote.

Addiction recovery center created by rock star opens in Caribbean
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT HOFFMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ A dlrs 6.5 million addiction recovery
center completely underwritten by British rock star Eric Clapton
will accept its first patient Tuesday and promises to turn away no
one who needs treatment.
	   Clapton, himself once addicted to drugs, built the 36-bed
Crossroads Centre of Antigua over the past five years. It will
offer intensive, 29-day recovery programs to people addicted to
drugs or alcohol at a cost of dlrs 9,000.
	   For those unable to pay, foundations have been formed in
Antigua, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom to offer
financial aid.
	   ``No one will be turned away,'' said administrator Anne Vance,
who for 11 years worked at the Betty Ford Center in Southern
California. It was Vance who met Clapton in 1994 in London and
eventually persuaded the singer and virtuoso guitarist to provide
the financing for the Caribbean's only such facility.
	   But there is no free ride. ``For those who cannot pay the full
fee, we will expect some kind of voluntary contribution in the form
of work after the patient has recovered,'' Vance said.
	   Clapton, who maintains a residence here on a bluff overlooking
the Atlantic not far from the center, has said he will work
directly with patients from time to time, drawing on his own
experiences.
	   The idea of the facility was conceived in St. John's more than
five years ago by Antiguan residents Hans and Nancy Smit, along
with Dr. Tom Martin, now the resident physician.
	   ``This is a wonderful day for us,'' Nancy Smit said as she and
her husband toured Crossroads on Sunday with members of the
nonprofit Hourglass Foundation they established to help bring the
project to fruition. ``Dreams do come true.''
	   Set on the edge of breathtaking Willoughby Bay on the southeast
side of this tiny island some 300 miles (480 kilometers)
east-southeast of Puerto Rico, the entirely new campus provides
spartan yet modern accommodations. Each room has two or three
single beds.
	   ``Part of the basic therapy is that a patient is never left
alone,'' said admissions counselor Kim Chapman said. ``But this is
not to say they won't have any privacy.''
	   A swimming pool, massage room and small gymnasium are available
to patients. The hospital also offers a week-long non-resident
``family program'' that counsels relatives or friends of addicts at
a cost of about dlrs 200 per person, Vance said.
	   Vance said most of the center's patients are expected come from
the United States and Britain, but at least one-third of the beds
are to be reserved for clients from the Caribbean. By the end of
the week, at least six patients were expected to be in residence.

Yeltsin cuts short Central Asia trip with respiratory infection

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut
short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory
infection that revived questions about his overall health and
ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin's premature return to Moscow also prompted doubts about
his capacity to respond decisively in the Kosovo crisis, in which
Russia has been leading a campaign to forestall airstrikes.
Moscow's NTV station said it was a crucial time for Russia, when
``presidential decisions'' are needed.
	   There was no indication that Yeltsin's illness would sideline
him for any length of time, and aides said the president would
maintain his schedule for the rest of the week.
	   But after a series of health problems in recent years, including
heart bypass surgery in 1996, every new ailment unleashes a flurry
of speculation about the president's ability to function. The
president insists he has no major health problems and will serve
out the remaining two years of his term.
	   Yeltsin's aides said the president was taking antibiotics to
ward off a bout of bronchitis and a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius
(99.3 Fahrenheit). There were no plans to hospitalize Yeltsin, who
was expected back in Moscow late Monday night from Almaty,
Kazakstan, a day earlier than planned.
	   ``The president has a cold and a cough. You're supposed to stay
in bed when you have a cold,'' said Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   Yeltsin's last illness was in March, when he had acute
laryngitis which resulted in a bad cough, a hoarse voice and a
reduced workload.

Sampras clears first-round hurlde
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Top-ranked Pete Sampras, who got into the
event thanks to the generosity of Boris Becker, advanced to the
second round of the ATP Vienna tournament Monday.
	   Sampras beat qualifier Jan Kroslak 6-2, 7-5 in the opening round
of the dlrs 800,000 indoor tournament that has seven of the top 10
players.
	   After his early exit from the Swiss indoor last week in Basel,
Sampras asked for a wild card from the organizers in Vienna. But
they turned him down because all wild cards already had been
allocated.
	   Sampras then asked Boris Becker if he could have his wild card
and Becker agreed.
	   ``Pete needs it much more than I do,'' said Becker, who is in
semi-retirement and only plays selected tournaments.
	   Sampras said it was an ``incredible gesture'' by Becker. ``I
don't think you'd find another guy doing that,'' he said. ``I was
practically already on the way home.''
	   The American wants to become the first player to finish the
season as No. 1 for six consecutive years and desperately needs to
increase his margin over No. 2 and U.S. Open champion Patrick
Rafter.
	   In other matches Monday, Cedric Pioline defeated Richard
Fromberg 6-3, 7-6 (9-7), Magnus Norman edged Daniel Vacek 7-5, 6-4,
and Jonas Bjorkman beat David Prinosil 6-4, 7-6 (7-1).

Lithuanian doctors say alleged Nazi fit to testify
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A 91-year-old former Lithuanian
security chief is fit to stand trial on genocide charges, a
court-appointed panel of doctors said Monday, but they warned that
the stress of court proceedings could endanger his life.
	   The ruling leaves in doubt whether Aleksandras Lileikis, a
former U.S. resident, will be brought to trial. Attempts to start
proceedings against him on war crimes charges have repeatedly been
delayed and many critics contend Lithuanian authorities are hoping
Lileikis will die before a trial starts.
	   The trial was supposed to begin in mid-September, but Lileikis'
legal team said he was too ill to appear in court. Lithuanian law
does not allow trial in absentia for medical reasons and the court
ordered a panel of doctors to assess his health.
	   Lileikis was head of the security police in the Lithuanian
capital during the 1941-44 Nazi occupation. He is charged with
ordering the arrests of scores of Jews and turning them over to a
Nazi execution squad. About 90 percent of Lithuania's 240,000 Jews
were killed during World War II.
	   ``The current state of Lileikis' health does allow him to take
part and testify in the trial, but any stress could lead to a
health condition hazardous to his life,'' the doctors' panel said
Monday.
	   But the panel chairman, Henrikas Ulevicius, refused to be
comment on whether the trial should go ahead, saying only that
``the judge has do decide whether to bring Lileikis to the
courtroom.''
	   Lileikis' lawyer reacted angrily to the ruling.
	   ``I am deeply shocked by the news that physicians have allowed a
subpoena to be issued,'' Algimantas Matuiza said. ``His health is
getting worse every day.''
	   Lileikis emigrated to the United States in 1955, and lived in
Norwood, Massachusetts, where he worked for a Lithuanian publishing
house.
	   He returned to Lithuania more than two years ago as the United
was undertaking efforts to revoke his citizenship and deport him.

Forest fires rage for second day in Israel

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Forest fires raged for the second consecutive
day Monday in northern and central Israel. One of them was
described as the biggest in the country's history, but no
fatalities or serious injury were reported.
	   Firefighters found that one of the fires was started
deliberately but most were caused by carelessness on the part of
picnickers.
	   The biggest blaze was on the slopes of the Carmel range south of
Haifa. Firefighters said it was even bigger than Sunday's blaze in
the Carmel Forest below the neighborhood of Deniya on the outskirts
of Haifa, Israel's third-biggest city.
	   With hot weather and high winds, the flames spread to the
picturesque artists village of Ein Hod, the nearby Arab village of
Ein Chud and the communal village of Nir Etzion. All three villages
were evacuated.
	   Fourteen houses in Ein Hod were destroyed or damaged. Some
historic homes were damaged in Zichron Yaacov.
	   Air force helicopters and civilian crop-spraying light aircraft
were brought in to help the fire-fighters.
	   Smaller fires broke out again in the Carmel Forest below the
Haifa neighborhood of Deniya, where thousands of residents were
evacuated Sunday during what was described then as the country's
biggest fire ever.
	   Forest fires also started in the Jerusalem area, Western Galilee
and around the Arab towns and villages of central Israel. Two
hotels and a number of picnic sites were evacuated.
	   In the Jerusalem area the fire set off some mines in an old
minefield but nobody was hurt. Firefighters believed one One of the
fires in that area was started deliberately, Israel radio reported.
	   However investigations so far showed that most of Monday's fires
were caused by picnickers leaving embers smoldering from their
barbecues, Fire-Fighting Commissioner Moshe Vardi said.
	   In central Israel four Israeli Arabs were arrested on suspicion
of starting fires in the past two weeks in the Wadi Ara area,
Israel radio reported. Police and Arab residents recently clashed
in Wadi Ara over a land dispute.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ With half its member nations
either participating in foreign military interventions or hosting
them, a southern African alliance postponed a joint peacekeeping
exercise on Monday.
	   ``Due to recent events in the sub-region, it has become
necessary to postpone exercise Blue Crane,'' the South African
government _ which was to have hosted the Nov. 3-21 exercise
involving 13 countries _ said in a statement.
	   The exercise was to have been held under the auspices of the
Southern African Development Community.
	   Troops from SADC member countries Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia
are in Congo _ also an SADC member _ fighting rebels on behalf of
Congo President Laurent Kabila.
	   Soldiers from South Africa and Botswana, meanwhile, are in
Lesotho to quash an army mutiny and end other unrest. All three
countries are also SADC members.
	   Other countries in the 14-member regional group are Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, Swaziland, Tanzania and Zambia.
	   Officials will discuss next month when to reschedule exercise
Blue Crane, the statement said.

Boca Juniors widen lead in Argentina; Rio's Flamengo and Vasco win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's Boca Juniors
distanced themselves from the pack over the weekend, stretching
their first-division lead to six points with a 3-0 victory over
Ferro.
	   Martin Palermo leaped between two Ferro defenders and hit a
driving header to give Boca a 2-0 lead in the first half.
	   Palermo continued his scoring frenzy that has him leading the
league. In 10 games, the 25-year-old striker, expected to make the
jump to the Italian leagues next year, has scored 11 goals.
	   After meeting Brazil's Flamengo Wednesday in a Copa Mercosur
match, Boca will play Velez Sarsfield on Sunday. Velez, last
season's champion, is seven points back in the standings.
	   The Velez game will be Boca's biggest test this season. Facing
the former team of new Boca coach, Carlos Bianchi, is expected to
give an added dose of energy and emotion to an already heated
rivalry.
	   And recent disparaging comments by Velez's always controversial
goalkeeper, Jose Luis Chilavert, should also help raise the
temperature of the match.
 &UR; BRAZIL &QC; 
	   Rio's top two teams, Flamengo and Vasco de Gama, used weekend
victories to help gain ground on Sao Paulo's leading clubs,
currently holding top places in the standings.
	   Flamengo defeated Corinthians, and new Brazil manager Wanderely
Luxemburgo, 4-1.
	   Vasco outpaced second-placed Santos 3-1.
	   Flamengo's fourth consecutive victory moved them into 11th
place, tied with crosstown rival Vasco. But it came at a price:
star striker Romario limped off the field in the first half with a
thigh injury. He's likely to return next week but will miss
Wednesday's matchup against Argentina's Boca Juniors.
	   Sao Paulo's Palmeiras beat Internacional 1-0 to hold on to the
league's top spot with 38 points after 17 games.
	   In the weekend's most exciting game, Botafogo scored three goals
in the final nine minutes to draw Atletico-Minas Gerais 5-5. The
tie keeps Botafogo out of the league's basement.
 &UR; CHILE &QC; 
	   Led by Argentine striker Leonardo Rodriguez, Universidad de
Chile defeated Concepcion 3-0 to grab second place in the league,
five points below Colo Colo.
	   The two teams are the top contenders for the championship, with
Universidad's remaining schedule giving them a slight advantage.
Universidad will play four of the remaining nine games away, while
Colo Colo will have five.
	   Many fans will be focused on next week's Italian league matchup
featuring two of Chile's biggest stars: Internazionale's Ivan
Zamorano and Lazio's Marcelo Salas.
	   It will be the first meeting of the two dangerous goal scorers
who helped lead Chile in its successful World Cup '98 appearance.

Sampras clears first-round hurdle

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix typo in overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Top-ranked Pete Sampras, who got into the
event thanks to the generosity of Boris Becker, advanced to the
second round of the ATP Vienna tournament Monday.
	   Sampras beat qualifier Jan Kroslak 6-2, 7-5 in the opening round
of the dlrs 800,000 indoor tournament that has seven of the top 10
players.
	   After his early exit from the Swiss indoor last week in Basel,
Sampras asked for a wild card from the organizers in Vienna. But
they turned him down because all wild cards already had been
allocated.
	   Sampras then asked Boris Becker if he could have his wild card
and Becker agreed.
	   ``Pete needs it much more than I do,'' said Becker, who is in
semi-retirement and only plays selected tournaments.
	   Sampras said it was an ``incredible gesture'' by Becker. ``I
don't think you'd find another guy doing that,'' he said. ``I was
practically already on the way home.''
	   The American wants to become the first player to finish the
season as No. 1 for six consecutive years and desperately needs to
increase his margin over No. 2 and U.S. Open champion Patrick
Rafter.
	   In other matches Monday, Cedric Pioline defeated Richard
Fromberg 6-3, 7-6 (9-7), Magnus Norman edged Daniel Vacek 7-5, 6-4,
and Jonas Bjorkman beat David Prinosil 6-4, 7-6 (7-1).

Primakov confers with executives on economic plans

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov huddled with top
Russian executives Monday to discuss the government's economic
plans, but no comprehensive, long-term strategy was expected to
materialize.
	   The Finance Ministry said Monday it would present a draft of an
emergency budget for the rest of the year to the Cabinet early next
week. But Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Sunday that the
government has no comprehensive strategy for rescuing Russia's
economy, and does not even plan to draft one this year.
	   The Russians got more bad news Monday, when the Finance Ministry
announced that the emergency budget will not adjust wages and
pensions to compensate for inflation.
	   Russian consumer prices jumped by 38 percent in September,
following the the effective devaluation of ruble in mid-August.
Inflation was only 0.2 percent in July.
	   Primakov, meanwhile, was to continue his closed-door
consultations on Tuesday, before outlining the government's
economic plans before the upper chamber of Russia's parliament on
Wednesday.
	   Details of the plan are not expected to be made public before
Oct. 20. Zadornov has said the plan would only set out immediate
tasks for the government to implement.
	   Primakov maintains that the government's plans _ and therefore
the future of Russia's economy _ hinge on whether the country gets
foreign aid.
	   But the Russian government's failure to spell out its plans has
forced the International Monetary Fund to postpone a visit by its
delegation to Moscow, said Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin. The
visit was to have begun Monday.
	   Primakov has made only general statements about his Cabinet's
plans, saying that its priorities are paying off huge backlogs of
state workers' wages and pensions, propping up the banking system
and stabilizing prices.
	   His government has not confirmed reports from the European Union
that Russia is seeking food and medical aid. But former Deputy
Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said Monday that U.S. officials had
told him the Russian government was also seeking humanitarian aid
from the United States.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik tried to assuage Russians'
worries about possible food shortages, saying that the country
would continue the food imports that make up nearly half the food
in Russia's stores.
	   ``As to humanitarian aid, it may be extended to the regions....
Government and international organizations are free to hold talks
directly with the regions concerned,'' the Interfax news agency
quoted him as saying.
	   In other economic news Monday:
	   _ The Central Bank ordered private banks to suspend dollar sales
to foreign investors at previously agreed rates until the end of
the year. Because the deals were arranged before the ruble was
effectively devalued on Aug. 17, they would have meant big losses
to Russian banks.
	   _ The ruble closed down against the dollar in slow trading
Monday, in part because of worries over President Boris Yeltsin's
health. Yeltsin cut short his visit to Central Asia on Monday due
to a respiratory infection. On the Moscow Interbank Currency
Exchange, the ruble closed at 16.1 to 16.15 to the dollar, down
from 15.8-16 on Friday.

EU hunkers down for long battle over budget share out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS budget amount in lead to 100 billion sted million &QL; 
 &UR; With EU-Finance &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers dug in Monday
for what is expected to be a long battle over how to share out the
EU's dlrs 100 billion annual budget.
	   Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden say they pay too
much into the EU's coffers compared with what they get back in
benefits, and demand the money be divvied up more fairly.
	   ``There is a lack of burden-sharing in the budget,'' German
Finance Minister Theo Waigel told a news conference. ``This is
something that cannot be continued under the new system.''
	   Monday's day-long meeting of the 15 EU finance ministers, was
Waigel's last after almost 10 year's. He is stepping down following
the center-right government's defeat in last month's elections.
	   However, the incoming Social Democrat-led administration is not
expected to relax Germany's stance. ``Any German government that
abandoned that line would be doing itself a disservice,'' Waigel
claimed.
	   Resistance from other nations, notably France and Spain, seems
sure to ensure that the budget wrangle will drag on until the
deadline of June 1999.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said any budget
reform should also look at the special deal won for Britain in 1984
by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when she famously told
other EU leaders ``we want our money back.''
	   ``Either we open the whole contributions file or we keep in
closed,'' Strauss-Kahn told reporters. ``We cannot have half
measures.''
	   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown insisted
there can be no tampering with the payback deal which is estimated
to save Britain about 2 billion pounds (dlrs 3.4 billion) a year.
	   Aside from who pays what, the budget reforms will seek to
completely overhaul EU spending for the six year's starting in
2000, a period when Cyprus and five eastern European nations are
expected to join the Union.
	   A key to success will be a reform of the EU's farm subsidy
program which currently eats up half of the overall budget.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's moderate defense minister
resigned unexpectedly Monday, signifying that hard-liners have
prevailed in a rift in President Franjo Tudjman's ruling party and
within his government.
	   The move by Andrija Hebrang is the second high-level resignation
by a political moderate in the government. Another close aide to
Tudjman, Hrvoje Sarinic, quit Friday as his Cabinet chief.
	   Both cited Tudjman's failure to support them in their conflicts
with hard-liners.
	   Hebrang, considered a devoted Tudjman supporter, also said he
would no longer head the medical team caring for the 76-year-old
president. In addition, he resigned as vice president of Tudjman's
Croatian Democratic Union.
	   A split has existed for years in Tudjman's ruling party between
pro-Western moderates and hard-line nationalists who oppose broader
democratic reforms.
	   Tudjman evidently has now chosen to back the hard-liners, who
control the army and much of the police force. Such a choice could
lead to even more rigid rule in a country criticized by the West
for failing to promote democracy.
	   Last month, Sarinic charged in an interview that military
counter-intelligence was behind a media campaign against the more
liberal members of the ruling party. He said their actions were
likely commanded by another Tudjman aide, hard-liner Ivic Pasalic.
	   Sarinic's claims highlighted Tudjman's opponents' claims that
his party, or some of its members, use state institutions for
political or personal gains.
	   Hebrang replaced the late Gojko Susak as defense minister in May
and vowed to reorganize the army according to NATO standards.
	   It has long been known that in the process, Hebrang wanted to
dump military counter-intelligence chief Markica Rebic and Vlado
Zagorac, who leads the ministry's firm for arms purchases. Both men
were protegees of Susak, a hard-liner, and they reportedly opposed
Hebrang's planned reforms.
	   In his letter to Tudjman, released by the state-run news agency
HINA, Hebrang said Tudjman's failure to uphold his attempts to
replace the two prompted him to resign.
	   ``Without your support, all my attempts to carry on the complex
programs which are also crucial for our country become futile,''
Hebrang wrote, adding: ``May God help you in recognizing good from
evil.''
	   Meanwhile, Rebic appeared before the parliamentary commission
that is to examine Sarinic's claims that counterintelligence was
implicated in the media attacks.
	   Sarinic and Pasalic also were summoned for the closed-door
hearings.

World Bank to grant dlrs 200 million loan to Ukrainian capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The World Bank will grant Kiev a dlrs 200
million loan to modernize the city's electricity and heating
systems, the mayor said Monday.
	   The loan agreement will be signed in Washington on Wednesday,
said Mayor Oleksandr Omelchenko. He is to lead a city delegation to
the United States on Tuesday.
	   The 20-year loan will be used to finance most of a dlrs 249.4
million electricity and heating system renovation project, with the
rest of the funds supplied by the Kyivenergo energy company, he
said.
	   Omelchenko said Kiev's electricity system can only provide for
86 percent of the city's needs at peak hours, while most of Kiev's
heating utilities are more than 50 years old, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Ukraine has received more than dlrs 1 billion for various
projects from the World Bank since it became a member in 1992.
	   Omelchenko also said that his delegation, which will stay in the
United States until Sunday, would be bringing 400 projects that
concern all aspects of the city's life and could be of interest to
potential investors.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ In a show of national unity, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's outgoing Cabinet on Monday committed 14 German jet
fighters to possible NATO strikes in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province
with the approval of Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder.
	   Germany's role in any airstrikes has been in question since the
left's Sept. 27 election victory. But Kohl and Schroeder agreed
during a meeting Monday that the old government should take the
initiative.
	   Deployment of the Tornado fighters must be approved by the
sitting parliament, which will meet Friday. Parliamentary approval
seems assured because both major parties, the Social Democrats and
Kohl's Christian Democrats, largely support committing German
troops.
	   The emphasis on a unified German position that will span the
transition to Schroeder's government was an important signal to
Germany's allies as NATO decides whether to go ahead with strikes.
	   ``There was a desire for political unity by the United States,''
said Schroeder, who is expected to be sworn in as chancellor Oct.
27. Until then, Kohl remains in power.
	   Gaining approval by the sitting parliament allows Germany's
future governing partners _ Schroeder's Social Democrats and the
Greens party _ to skirt a potentially divisive issue.
	   Though the Greens approve of NATO airstrikes, they have rejected
German participation without a clear U.N. mandate. And Schroeder
hinted that a number of Greens members were expected to vote
against participation.
	   But he emphasized after coalition talks with Greens leaders that
both sides broadly agreed on continuity in foreign policy,
including a commitment to NATO that the Greens have rejected in the
past.
	   Schroeder said ``there are absolutely no doubts about the
Greens' reliability in foreign policy.''
	   Schroeder was accompanied in the meeting with Kohl by his likely
foreign minister, Greens' leader Joschka Fisher, a party moderate
who has given his backing to the airstrikes.
	   ``I have to say that in general there was an excellent climate
and awareness of the responsibility both for our country and for
German soldiers during this last phase, when no wrong signals can
be given,'' Defense Minister Volker Ruehe told a press briefing.
	   Ruehe said he believed the deployment would be ``the most
dangerous'' foreign assignment for the German military under NATO
deployment. The Tornados' job would be to take out the
``sophisticated'' Yugoslav air defenses, he said.

Pension, wage debts in Ukraine reach nearly dlrs 2.5 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Despite government efforts to reduce wage
and pension debts in Ukraine, the debts still amount to nearly dlrs
2.5 billion, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said Monday.
	   Ukrainian enterprises owe their workers 6.5 billion hryvna (dlrs
1.9 billion) in back wages, with 42.8 percent of the sum owed by
government-run companies and institutions, Pustovoitenko said.
	   The government also owes nearly 2 billion hryvna (dlrs 585
million) to millions of pensioners throughout Ukraine, and the
pension situation remains ``extremely complex,'' he said.
	   At the same time, companies and institutions, including various
state-run companies and ministries, owe the state Pension Fund as
much as 3.1 billion hryvna (dlrs 906 million), Pustovoitenko told a
Cabinet meeting.
	   In recent months, Pustovoitenko has launched a crackdown on
biggest tax dodgers and Pension Fund debtors, including such
measures as bringing the top debtor executives to a tent camp for
purported civil defense training.
	   The crackdown, however, has yielded little result, only
underlining the government's chronic inability to collect taxes and
other budget payments.

Ex-Soviet defense minister injured in car crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Soviet Defense Minister Sergei Sokolov was
injured Monday when his Volga sedan collided with another vehicle.
	   Sokolov, 88, suffered multiple injuries to his head, chest and a
leg, and was hospitalized in ``moderately serious condition,'' said
a Defense Ministry spokesman who refused to give his name.
	   Police were still investigating who was at fault for the
accident, the spokesman said. It was not known whether anybody else
was injured.
	   Sokolov had been fired as defense minister over a highly
embarrassing incident in 1987, when West German pilot Mathias Rust
entered Soviet airspace in a small plane and flew all the way to
Moscow's Red Square.
	   In 1994, Sokolov headed the 50th Anniversary of Victory Fund _ a
non-government organization that prepared anniversary celebrations
of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin awarded Sokolov a medal for
``Contribution to the Fatherland'' in 1996.

U.S. envoy briefs NATO; Milosevic concession reported

details. Changes byline.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As NATO stood poised to approve
airstrikes, a top U.S. envoy left marathon talks with Slobodan
Milosevic on Monday to brief the alliance amid reports a
breakthrough was near to avert airstrikes over Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke's mission to Brussels, Belgium, came with
Western nations evacuating diplomats from Yugoslavia _ adding to a
sense that a last-minute deal was necessary to avoid intervention.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists in
Moscow that the Yugoslav president had agreed to allow 1,500
international observers to monitor compliance with U.N. demands to
halt the Serb crackdown in Kosovo.
	   If true, that would represent a key last-minute concession by
Milosevic that came only hours before NATO planned to authorize the
attack against Milosevic's forces.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of Milosevic's reported
concession. But a statement from Milosevic's office said Holbrooke
would return and hold more talks Tuesday.
	   It said Milosevic ``has concluded that undoubtedly, necessary
conditions exist for a peaceful political solution to the Kosovo
problem'' _ a position that Western officials previously have
disputed.
	   A U.S. source, speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated
that Holbrooke had made enough progress that he needed to update
NATO personally as its ambassadors met in Brussels to OK an
activation order _ the last formal step before airstrikes could be
launched.
	   A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an
activation order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in
Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and tens of
thousands uprooted since Feb. 28 crackdown against ethnic Albanian
rebels started.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over
Yugoslavia.
	   Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering
planes and missiles launched.
	   Sergeyev said Russia, which as Yugoslavia's ally has tried to
broker a deal that would avoid NATO intervention, was prepared to
provide planes for controlling Yugoslav airspace, and consider
participating in the monitoring force.
	   Earlier Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
phoned Milosevic to urge him to comply with U.N. resolutions to end
the Kosovo turmoil.
	   Milosevic responded that he was ``in the process of complying,
or trying to come into full compliance with the Security Council
resolutions,'' spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   Holbrooke's mission to Brussels followed a flurry of diplomatic
evacuations by Western nations from Yugoslavia. That added to a
sense that intervention was imminent _ barring a breakthrough in
negotiations.
	   The international diplomats' mission observing events evacuated
Kosovo for neighboring Macedonia, with the Russian members the last
to depart. Sources at the American Embassy in Belgrade said all but
12 foreign staff were being evacuated to Budapest, and an embassy
statement said personnel in ``non-emergency situations'' had left.
	   A State Department advisory urged all U.S. citizens to leave
Yugoslavia, and Americans in the Serb part of neighboring Bosnia
also were advised to leave. The German, British, Danish and other
foreign embassies closed down Monday.
	   Holbrooke, who has met with Milosevic seven times in the past
eight days for a total of roughly 50 hours, described his earlier
overnight meeting with Milosevic as ``intense, indeed, and at times
very heated.'' He said the standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav
president ``can only be called an emergency.''
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched against the separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army. Kosovo the southern Serbian province where ethnic Albanians
represent 90 percent of its 2 million people.
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the outgoing German government said it intends to
allow German warplanes to participate in any attack.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, which
could last ``several days.''
	   The major obstacle appeared to be Holbrooke's request that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   The Security Council demands include an immediate cease-fire, a
withdrawal of special troops in the province, allowing refugees to
return home and beginning talks with independence-minded ethnic
Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   The Pentagon was making military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission failed. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.

Electricity company shuts down power supply to Indian state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An electricity company owned by the
Indian government cut off power to one province that was behind in
paying its bills, and similarly threatened two other states.
	   Residents in the West Bengal state were girding for power
outages after the National Thermal Power Corporation suspended its
supplies from the Farakka power plant in the eastern Indian
province because of arrears of 7.1 billion rupees (dlrs 170
million), The Statesman newspaper said.
	   Indian states currently are between nine and 17 months behind in
payments.
	   The provincial governments buy electricity from the national
utility and sell it to individuals and companies. Rather than
paying their bills, many use the money from consumers' electricity
tariffs to shore up budget deficits.
	   The utility has also threatened to similarly shut down power to
neighboring Bihar, one of India's poorest states, and the coastal
province of Orissa. In all, outstanding dues in eastern India stand
at over 30 billion rupees (dlrs 714 million), The Times of India
reported.
	   Despite the suspension of power supply, West Bengal was nowhere
near a crisis, said officials who hope to overcome the shortfall
from a new unit of a provincial government-owned power station
commissioned Sunday.
	   West Bengal draws over 430 megawatt of power each day from the
NTPC power plant of the 2,000 megawatt needed during peak supply
hours. Officials said there would be a shortage of between 150 and
200 megawatts even after utilizing all electricity sources in the
state.

Forest fires rage for second day in Israel

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Forest fires raged Monday for a second day in
northern Israel, in what are believed to be the largest blazes in
recent history. No fatalities or serious injuries were reported
from those fires or smaller ones burning in central Israel.
	   Firefighters found that one of the fires was started
deliberately but most were caused by carelessness on the part of
picnickers.
	   The biggest blaze was on the slopes of the northern Carmel
range, south of Haifa, Israel's third-biggest city. Firefighters
said it was even bigger than Sunday's blaze in the Carmel Forest
below the neighborhood of Deniya on the outskirts of Haifa.
	   With hot weather and high winds, the flames spread to the
picturesque artists village of Ein Hod, the nearby Arab village of
Ein Chud and the communal village of Nir Etzion. All three villages
were evacuated.
	   Fourteen houses in Ein Hod were destroyed or damaged. Some
historic homes were damaged in Zichron Yaacov.
	   Air force helicopters and civilian crop-spraying aircraft were
brought in to help the firefighters.
	   Smaller fires broke out again in the Carmel Forest below the
Haifa neighborhood of Deniya, where thousands of residents were
evacuated Sunday during what was described then as the country's
biggest fire ever.
	   Forest fires also started in the Jerusalem area, Western Galilee
and around the Arab towns and villages of central Israel. Two
hotels and a number of picnic sites were evacuated.
	   That fire set off some mines in an old minefield but nobody was
hurt. Firefighters believed one of the fires in that area was
started deliberately, Israel radio reported.
	   However investigations so far showed that most of Monday's fires
were caused by picnickers leaving embers smoldering from their
barbecues, Firefighting Commissioner Moshe Vardi said.
	   In central Israel, four Israeli Arabs were arrested on suspicion
of starting fires in the past two weeks in the Wadi Ara area,
Israel radio reported. Police and Arab residents recently clashed
in Wadi Ara over a land dispute.

Russian scientists propose Moon exploration project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian scientists have designed a plan for
studying the Moon by putting a space station in lunar orbit, but
the project is likely to be grounded by a lack of funding, a
researcher said Monday.
	   The plan calls for putting a small space station in orbit around
the Moon, and using the station to send probes, seismic stations
and other equipment to the Moon, said Erik Galimov, director of
Russia's Vernadsky Institute for Geochemistry and Analytical
Chemistry.
	   A major goal of the experiment would be finding whether there is
water or ice on the Moon, Galimov said, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency. The question has divided scientists for years, he
said.
	   The project will also focus on collecting information on the
Moon's interior, helping scientists to establish how and when it
was formed.
	   But the project would cost dlrs 50 million, and chances that
Russia's government will agree to finance it are next to nil.
	   The government has repeatedly failed to make its payments for
construction of the international space station, forcing the
project to be delayed several times.

Sudan, rebels agree to 3-month extension of cease-fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Sudanese government and rebels have
agreed to extend a cease-fire in a southern province for another
three months to allow humanitarian aid to get to famine-stricken
Sudanese, officials said Monday.
	   The cease-fire in Bahr el-Ghazal will enable the United Nations
and other international aid organizations to feed suffering
Sudanese even after the end of the rainy season, when fighting in
the province usually heats up, the U.N. humanitarian aid
coordinator, Sergio Vieira de Mello, said in a statement.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army had said Friday that the
cease-fire _ which will go into effect Wednesday when the previous
one expires _ would cover the provinces of Bahr el-Ghazal and
Western Upper Nile.
	   There was no immediate comment from the SPLA on Monday and no
word on why the cease-fire was confined to only Bahr el-Ghazal.
	   The Sudanese government has said the current cease-fire covers
all of southern Sudan. But a statement from the Foreign Ministry,
faxed to Nairobi, Kenya, from Khartoum, said the extension only
covered Bahr el-Ghazal.
	   The government said it would have preferred a lasting solution
to the 15-year civil war, but settled for a three-month cease-fire
so that badly needed aid could be provided.
	   The rebels, mostly Christian and animist southern Sudanese, have
fought the mainly Arab and Islamic government for 15 years to gain
greater autonomy.
	   The civil war often has led to famine because both rebels and
government-backed militia burn or steal crops to deny food to their
enemies. About 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
famines.
	   The SPLA has been engaged in a new offensive with government
forces in the southern province of East Equatoria since Sept. 14
and made repeated advances around the town on Juba in recent weeks.
Juba, the second largest town under government control in the
south, is 1,200 kilometers (740 miles) south of Khartoum.
	   De Mello, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator, said he was
particularly concerned about the humanitarian situation in Western
Upper Nile, Bor County and East Equatoria ``and over the need for
the intensive relief operation to continue until next year's
harvest.''
	   Carl Tintsman, coordinator for Operation Lifeline Sudan, a
consortium of aid groups based in Nairobi, welcomed the extension
for Bahr el-Ghazal.
	   ``The cease-fire that has been in effect in Bahr el-Ghazal the
past three months has been critical to stepping up the humanitarian
response in southern Sudan,'' he said. Operation Lifeline Sudan,
however, wanted to see the cease-fire cover a broader area, he
said.

Lawyer: Former Bosnian Muslim prison guard should be spared long
</HEADLINE>
sentence &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with so-called `Serb Adolf'
testifying on behalf of former guard. &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A former Bosnian Muslim prison
guard charged with war crimes against Serb captives should get a
milder sentence because he suffers from mental problems worsened by
the war, his lawyer told a U.N. tribunal Monday.
	   The appeal came during the final phase of the months-long trial
of three Muslims and a Croat accused of atrocities at the Bosnian
government-run Celebici prison camp in 1992.
	   On trial are Hazim Delic, Celebici's deputy commander; Zdravko
Mucic, the camp's former commander; Esad Landzo, a former Celebici
guard; and Zejnil Delalic, who prosecutors claim had overall
responsibility for the camp.
	   All four defendants have pleaded innocent. If convicted, they
face maximum life sentences.
	   Although the three-judge panel at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal has not yet reached a verdict in the case, Monday's
hearing let lawyers introduce evidence to help judges determine
prison terms if the defendants are found guilty.
	   Landzo's lawyer, Cynthia McMurrey, was the first to present her
case, using arguments ranging from Landzo's supposed rehabilitation
to his fragile mental state during the war.
	   An expert witness testified that Landzo has a personality
disorder which was compounded by the trauma of war and eventually
led to diminished mental capacity, meaning he allegedly was unable
to exercise his own free will to disobey orders during the war or
to make decisions on his own.
	   In written arguments, Landzo's lawyers said his sentence _ if he
is convicted _ should not be longer than five years. They also
based their arguments on his age, 25; the fact that he had no
record before Celebici; and his voluntary surrender to the
tribunal.
	   Like all guards at Celebici, Landzo acted under the orders of
superiors in the camp, his lawyers said.
	   In a startling development Monday, Landzo even got some support
from fellow war crimes suspect Goran Jelisic, who is awaiting trial
on separate charges. Jelisic, who calls himself the ``Serb Adolf,''
took the stand and praised Landzo for keeping his cell clean,
giving Jelisic some clothes in jail and playing volleyball with
him.
	   ``He's truly a social person, very communicative and a great
joker,'' Jelisic said of Landzo.
	   Prosecutors have said that Serbs held at the central Bosnia camp
were ``murdered, tortured, raped and beaten.'' A 49-page indictment
alleges that inmates were beaten with steel cables and wooden and
metal bars, burned with heated scissors, wrapped with fuses that
were then lit, and kept in vats of water. At least 14 died.
	   The Celebici trial, which began in March 1997, was expected to
last only several months but has dragged on for 19 months, in part
because the U.N. court has five other trials in progress.
	   Taking up sentencing arguments before a trial has ended is part
of the tribunal's new efforts to streamline and speed up its work.
Lawyers for the other defendants, as well as prosecutors, were also
scheduled to make sentencing arguments this week.

Mood is grim as Yugoslavs prepare for the worst
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The mood is grim, in Kosovo and
across Yugoslavia.
	   Embassies are closing. Diplomats are fleeing. Observers are
packing up and leaving. Humanitarian organizations await the word
to pull out. And Yugoslavs in Kosovo, Albanians and Serbs, are
loading their guns and waiting for the worst.
	   All eyes were fixed on Brussels on Monday, where NATO
ambassadors were poised to authorize airstrikes, and on Belgrade,
where Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was deliberating
concessions in talks aimed at halting Serb repression against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Serbia's poor southern province.
	   The Serbs here are angry. And they like to carry guns. Not only
do they hate the Albanians for having got them into this fix, they
hate the foreigners whose nations are preparing to pound them with
missiles and bombs.
	   In the hinterlands, where hundreds of ethnic Albanians have been
killed over the past seven months and hundreds of thousands driven
from their homes, forcing many to live in the open under plastic
sheets, the fear is palpable. Though many would welcome NATO
airstrikes, they also are afraid Serb police will exact a terrible
vengeance upon them.
	   Some people, however, just think the West is after the wrong
target.
	   ``I hate Americans,'' said Ljubisa, a civil servant from Pec who
didn't want to give his last name. ``If they have anything against
Slobo, why don't they just shoot him? I have three little kids and
I didn't hurt anybody.''
	   Jasna, 30, who also declined to give her last name, was talking
tough.
	   ``If they bomb, I told my husband to send the kids and me to
Serbia,'' she said. ``Then I'm coming back and we're going to get
even with the Albanians.''
	   The last American, European Union and Russian diplomats from the
Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, sent here in July at the
suggestion of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to monitor the
situation on the ground, pulled out of Kosovo Monday and headed
south for safety Macedonia.
	   In Belgrade, the British, German and Danish embassies closed and
their staffs began the drive to Budapest, Hungary. The American
Embassy was down to 12 people, mostly in support of the Holbrooke
mission.
	   ``For God's sake, let's get it over with, one way or another,''
said anguished Belgrade housewife Milena Popovic, adding that the
uncertainty was worse than anything else.
	   In some districts of the capital, mailboxes were stuffed with
leaflets instructing people on how to recognize air raid sirens by
the length and type of sound and what to do in case of air raids.
	   The independent daily Blic published a poll on where various
politicians intend to be if the bombs start falling.
	   ``If the bombing actually happens, I'll be at the Students
Square,'' Blic quoted Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic as
saying. ``Let NATO and Clinton explain to their people how and why
they killed a democrat.''
	   Social Democrat leader Vuk Obradovic said he planned to be in
uniform, serving his country by ``defending the dignity and honor
of its people.''
	   Near the ethnic Albanian village of Gollubovic, west of
Pristina, 66-year-old Qazim Berisha stood outside his temporary
shelter made of dried cornstalks. He and 27 of his relatives have
been on the move for the past four months. Two of his sons have
been abducted by Serbs.
	   ``If Milosevic comes to his senses, it will be good,'' said
Berisha. ``We'd all like to have peace. But if he doesn't want to
come to his senses, we would like NATO to help us because we are
dying.''
	   Back in Pristina, Afrim Jerlliu, 42, an ethnic Albanian
schoolteacher, said somebody has to stop the bloodshed.
	   ``No one can do it in Pristina and Belgrade,'' he said. ``No one
has done it since 1989 when Kosovo's autonomy was suspended. The
international community and NATO can do it. Only a tough lesson
like that will be able to stop Serb brutality in Kosovo.''
	   One focus of Serb anger is the Grand Hotel in Pristina, where
journalists from several NATO countries are staying: Italians,
Britons, Americans and others.
	   Every night, a crowd of drunks gathers outside, screaming
obscenities at the reporters inside, threatening to kill them and
smash their cars. Eventually they are chased away by official and
secret Serb police, stationed at the hotel to keep an eye on the
foreigners.

Afghan refugees get into Prague onboard of a Moldavian plane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ More than 100 Afghan refugees were
detained by Czech police Monday after they flew into the country
illegally aboard a Moldavian Airlines plane, TV Nova reported.
	   According to police sources quoted by the station, 52 men, 22
women and 31 children arrived onboard of an Moldavian Airlines
flight in the morning and tried to enter the country without travel
documents.
	   The refugees reportedly paid dlrs 5,000 per adult and dlrs 2,500
per child to unspecified organizers just to get to Prague.
	   After Czech authorities refused to allow them into transit, the
passengers forced a 7-year old child out of the plane in protest.
	   They were all then escorted out of the plane and will be offered
a place in a refugee camp in northern Bohemia, the television said.
	   Czech republic is a busy transit country for refugees from Asia
and the Balkans usually looking for ways to penetrate the border
into neighboring Germany and continue their journey into western
Europe in search of a better life.

Smoky cockpit forces plane landing

<TEXT>
	   THUNDER BAY, Ontario (AP) _ An Air Canada Airbus 320 passenger
jet was forced to make an emergency landing Sunday night after
pilots detected smoke in the cockpit.
	   ``There was a visible smoke haze in the cockpit and a smell of
smoke, so they decided to make an emergency landing,'' said Air
Canada spokesman John Hamilton.
	   The flight from Toronto to Winnipeg, Manitoba, was carrying 125
passengers. Hamilton said the landing in Thunder Bay went smoothly.
	   ``For all intents and purposes it was a normal landing. The
passengers were extremely calm _ there wasn't any nervousness or
fear on board,'' he said, adding he wasn't aware of any previous
problems with the jet.
	   The passengers flew from Thunder Bay to Winnipeg on another
plane.
	   The jet will be checked to determine the source of the smoke.

	   IZMIR, Turkey (AP) _ A boat loaded with Greenpeace activists
blocked ships bound for a Turkish chemical plant Monday, leaving
only when Turkey's coast guard allegedly threatened to open fire.
	   The activists were trying to interrupt production of polyvinyl
chloride, better known as PVC, at the Petkim factory near the
Aegean port city of Izmir.
	   Twenty-two protesters sank concrete blocks at the entrance of
the port and circled the docks of the plant, Petkim said in a
statement.
	   After an eight-hour standoff, the Greenpeace vessel Sirius was
forced to leave when the coast guard threatened to open fire,
Greenpeace activist Tolga Temuce said.
	   Temuce, speaking from the Sirius, said the ship was currently
being forced to sail to Izmir by the coast guard, where the
activists expected to be detained.
	   Petkim is Turkey's largest producer of PVC.
	   Greenpeace has been protesting its use in children's products,
saying it is a danger to health and to the environment.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Angered by classroom overcrowding, thousands of
high school students took to the streets in several French cities
Monday to demand that the leftist government hire more teachers and
buy more equipment.
	   The students _ chanting ``Solidarity!'' _ set off at midday from
squares in the east and south of Paris, and headed for the
Education Ministry, where they planned to rally in the late
afternoon.
	   ``Through strikes you can dream,'' said stickers the students
slapped on lampposts and telephone boxes along the way. ``We're
angry students ... and fed up with the chaos,'' others sang.
	   Students have been protesting in a number of French cities over
the last 10 days, barely weeks after starting the new school year.
But Monday's demonstration was the first in the capital.
	   Protests were held in more than a dozen cities on Monday,
including as many as 10,000 in Paris, at least 8,000 in Bordeaux
and 7,000 in Toulouse.
	   Police patrolled the Paris demonstrations, which are often
marred by violence, but did not cut off traffic, leaving the
students to maneuver in and out of passing cars.
	   Police intervened to disperse hundreds of students who were
rampaging through a shopping center in Montparnasse, in southern
Paris. Dozens of others, their faces masked, stole from music shops
and bakeries, police said. A scooter was set on fire.
	   Several people were detained in Thionville, a town in eastern
France, after dozens of students wielding baseball bats and
throwing stones smashed shop windows and turned cars over. About
1,000 students had protested during the day.
	   ``We hope there will be some improvements, but we probably won't
get everything we want,'' said 18-year-old student Mathieu Agneau.
	   Yaelle Dorison, 17, said her school was well equipped, but that
she was there to show solidarity with friends from a school outside
Paris that did not have computers.
	   Education Minister Claude Allegre said he understood the
students' concerns, but suggested they be patient. ``There will be
improvements _ but Paris wasn't built in a day.''
	   Late Monday, a student delegation met at the Education Ministry
with Bernard Toulemonde, director of scholastic instruction. He
reminded the group that Allegre has already announced the creation
of 3,000 teachers for next year and 20,000 student jobs.
	   Allegre is reined in by the Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's determination to keep the budget deficit under 3 percent
of the gross domestic product, as required for the euro single
currency that takes effect at the end of the year.
	   But the head of the student group FIDL, the Independent
Democratic Lycee Federation, called for more protests. Olivia Jean
said the movement should extend ``to all students.''

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Some 1,400 children have been hospitalized
after eating tainted school biscuits, a police official said
Monday.
	   The 1,376 children were rushed to hospitals Sunday and treated
for food poisoning after eating the biscuits in various primary,
middle and secondary schools in Darin village, in the Nile delta
province of Mansoura, the official said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The village is 120 kilometers northeast of Cairo.
	   Most of the students were discharged from the hospitals, but
five still remain in intensive care units, the official said.
	   Maj. Gen. Fakreddin Khaled, the governor of Mansoura, ordered
police to detain the distributor of the biscuits pending an
investigation into the poisonings, the official said.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey said Monday that Syria appeared to
have moved toward meeting its demands in a confrontation over
Kurdish rebels _ the first sign of a breakthrough in a 2-week-old
crisis that has threatened war between the two neighbors.
	   According to Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, Syria relayed a
message Monday through Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, whose
government has been trying to mediate the crisis.
	   Cem said the message ``indicates that there is an effort on the
Syrian side to meet the concerns that we have raised.''
	   ``We have regarded this with a positive interest and we are
pursuing it,'' Cem said, adding that ``based on past experiences
with Syria we have to be cautious. We have to see the
implementation.''
	   Turkey accuses Syria of sheltering and supporting Kurd rebels
responsible for cross-border attacks. Two weeks ago, saying its
patience had run out, it suggested it might carry out an
unspecified military operation.
	   Syria denies the accusations. Its leaders have had little to say
about the negotiations, other than that they believe the dispute
can be resolved peacefully.
	   Turkey's Sabah daily claimed Monday that Syria had given in to
Turkish demands and agreed to end its alleged support for the
Turkish Kurd rebels.
	   The rebels are fighting for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey's
southeast. The conflict has killed 37,000 people since fighting
started in 1984.
	   The German-based Kurdish news agency, DEM, quoted rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan as saying Turkey has stepped up its attacks on the
Kurds during the dispute.
	   ``It is our patience that has run out,'' DEM quoted Ocalan as
saying.
	   Turkish officials said they were planning maneuvers along its
Syrian border in November. There have been unconfirmed reports of a
Turkish troop buildup along the border.

Davenport ousts Hingis from world No. 1 spot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A new era in women's tennis dawned on
Monday, and Lindsay Davenport, the new world number one, missed it
by sleeping in.
	   The 22-year-old American officially took over as the world's top
player from Martina Hingis on Monday morning at the European
Championships, but wasn't motivated to get up and play tennis.
	   ``I woke up late this morning and I didn't feel like hitting a
ball,'' said Davenport, the winner of five titles this season,
including the U.S Open. ``That was my first though as No. 1.''
	   But Davenport's thoughts will soon turn to defending her
European title and solidifying her place atop the rankings.
	   The soft-spoken American, who climbed to the top almost
unnoticed until she was at the summit, will not play her first
match until Wednesday, when she faces French qualifier Julie
Halard-Decugis.
	   The modest American is quickly discovering the demands placed on
the number one player, holding audience with a room full of
reporters and TV crews Monday afternoon before rushing off to a
photo shoot.
	   Although comfortable with the media, Davenport cherishes her
time out of the limelight, but will have to get used to the
attention and the thrill attached to her new status.
	   ``It's one of those things you feel deep in your stomach and it
makes you a little emotional,'' said Davenport. ``But you have to
move on. You've got to play tennis day in and day out and you have
to keep trying to improve.''
	   Even though Davenport began her reign on the Swiss star's home
turf, she won't have the opportunity to face the 18-year-old in
Zurich, with Hingis pulling out due to a strained ankle.
	   Davenport brought to an end Hingis's 80 week stay at the top of
the rankings, which dated back to March 1997, when she became the
youngest player ever to hold the position.
	   Davenport's task at the dlrs 1 million European Championship has
been made even easier with world No.3 Jana Novotna and No.6 Monica
Seles also pulling due to injury. World No. 4 Arantza
Sanchez-Vicario will also be absent.
	   As a result, Davenport's main opposition will come from
compatriot Venus Williams, seeded second, who also has her sights
sets on the No. 1 spot.
	   France's Sandrine Testud, who beat out Davenport in the final at
Filderstadt on Sunday, will be looking for a second consecutive
title.
	   Fifth-seed Patty Schnyder, who won five title this season and
reached the final of the Grand Slam Cup, will carry Swiss hopes in
Hingis's absence.
	   Regardless of Davenport's result in Zurich, Hingis's withdrawal
means the American cannot be overtaken and is guaranteed at least
another week as the No. 1.
	   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Hingis, who fell from the top
spot after a quarterfinal loss to Dominique Van Roost in
Filderstadt. ``But I consulted the doctor, and he advised me not to
play this week.''
	   Davenport holds a 396 point lead over Hingis, who plans only to
compete in two more tournaments this season, Philadelphia and the
season-ending Chase Championships. The American, on the otherhand,
plans to play in Moscow, Philadelphia and New York.
	   Davenport is only the eighth player to attain the number one
ranking since the inception of the WTA rankings in 1975.
	   ``You always look up to the No.1 players in the world and think
what great players they are or were,'' said Davenport. ``I'm very
honoured to be a part of that. I hope to continue a bit longer at
No. 1 and will keep trying to stay at the top.''
	   Davenport is the third American-born player to join the
exclusive club, and the first since Chris Evert in 1985.
	   Martina Navratilova and Monica Seles, who both took American
citizenship, are also part of the club, as well as American Tracy
Austin, Germany's Steffi Graf, Hingis, and Sanchez-Vicario of
Spain.
	   ``Making it to the top was never really an obsession of mine and
I never thought I'd get to number one in the world,'' said
Davenport. ``I've definitely been criticized for that with people
calling it lack of drive and confidence.
	   ``But to get to No.1 and be in the top-10 for four of five years
now, obviously there's some competitiveness and drive in me,''
reasoned Davenport. ``I just don't think you have to come out and
say I'm the greatest, no one can beat me, I'm going to be here a
long time.''

Bat sonar puts human technology to shame
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; For release at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) &QL; 
 &UR; By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Bat sonar is so much better than anything
devised by human technology that the little creatures seem to enjoy
rubbing it in.
	   ``The bats were essentially turning to us and thumbing their
noses,'' researcher James Simmons of Brown University said of tests
aimed at challenging bats sonar ability.
	   Simmons experiments, reported in Monday's issue of Proceedings
of the National Academy of Science, are aimed at improving the U.S.
Navy's sonar to help detect mines under water.
	   Sonar systems send out a sound and then listen for the echo to
bounce back. The time it takes to return tells how far away
something is and in which direction. A major factor is the ability
to differentiate between two echoes that arrive at almost the same
time.
	   At the wavelengths under study, electronic sonar can
differentiate between echoes about 12 millionths of a second apart.
With a lot of work, that can be cut to 6 millionths to 8 millionths
of a second, Simmons said.
	   ``Bats do 2 to 3 (millionths of a second) relatively easily,''
Simmons said. ``That's the part that's little distressing.''
	   Being able to separate such sounds means the bats could tell the
difference between objects just 0.3 millimeters (0.01 inches) apart
_ about the width of a pen line on paper.
	   In the experiment, the bats were sitting on a platform in a
familiar situation, he noted. They probably don't do as well at
night, chasing insects through the trees.
	   ``They seem to be fat and happy all the time, which means they
are intercepting their targets,'' though, Simmons observed. ``The
things they do are shocking.''
	   To succeed in such chases, bats need to be able to differentiate
sounds 10 millionths of a second apart, Simmons explained in a
telephone interview. ``We'd have to do a lot of work to match what
they're doing so easily.''
	   While they're still trying to determine why bats are so much
better than human technology, they have begun experiments to record
bats' brain cell activity as they process sounds.
	   And Simmons is working on tweaking naval sonars, both in
listening for return sounds and in processing that information, to
make them a bit more like bats.
	   Dolphins also use sonar, and some have been trained by the Navy
to help find mines. But Simmons said it isn't practical to do
experiments on dolphins. Working with bats, on the other hand, he
hopes to learn ways to improve both underwater sonar and airborne
radar.
	   In Simmons' experiments, the bats are trained to differentiate
sounds with large gaps between them, getting a reward of mealworms
for each correct decision. Then the timing of the sounds is
shortened to test the bats' response.
	   ``They cooperate in these experiments. ... They perform very
fast,'' Simmons said. In an experiment, the bat makes its decision
about the sound and then runs forward to get the mealworm. ``They
don't fly off; they just sit there and go right to it,'' he said.
	   Working with Simmons on the project were Michael Ferragamo, now
at Gustavus Adolphus College, and Cynthia Moss, now at the
University of Maryland.

U.S. loses WTO appeal over shrimp import ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States on Monday lost an appeal over a
World Trade Organization ruling that U.S. import restrictions on
shrimp were inconsistent with its obligations.
	   The panel of the WTO's Appellate Body, which functions as an
appeals court, said the U.S. restrictions amounted to arbitrary and
unjustifiable discrimination.
	   In April, a WTO panel decided that a U.S. embargo on shrimp
imports from India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand is an illegal
attempt to impose U.S. standards on other countries.
	   The United States has blocked shrimp imports from the four under
a law restricting the import of shrimp caught with trawling nets
and equipment that harm endangered species of sea turtles.
	   The countries have declined to adopt measures to ensure trawling
nets won't ensnare and kill the turtles. Environmentalists say
failure to equip shrimp nets with turtle-excluder devices costing
dlrs 75 each causes the death of 150,000 turtles a year worldwide.
	   Although faulting the United States for the way its rules were
carried out, the panel upheld WTO members' right to adopt laws for
the purpose of conserving exhaustible natural resources.
	   ``The Appellate Body has rightly recognized that our
shrimp-turtle law is an important and legitimate conservation
measure, and not protectionist,'' U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky said in a statement.
	   ``But we disagree with (its) assessment that we have not
implemented the law in an even-handed manner.''
	   Barshefsky also welcomed a ruling by the body that submissions
by non-governmental organizations can be considered by WTO panels.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Angered by classroom overcrowding, thousands of
high school students took to the streets in several French cities
Monday to demand that the leftist government hire more teachers and
buy more equipment.
	   The students _ chanting ``Solidarity!'' _ set off at midday from
squares in the east and south of Paris, and headed for the
Education Ministry, where they planned to rally in the late
afternoon.
	   ``Through strikes you can dream,'' said stickers the students
slapped on lampposts and telephone boxes along the way. ``We're
angry students ... and fed up with the chaos,'' others sang.
	   Students have been protesting in a number of French cities over
the last 10 days, barely weeks after starting the new school year.
But Monday's demonstration was the first in the capital.
	   Protests were held in more than a dozen cities on Monday,
including as many as 10,000 in Paris, at least 8,000 in Bordeaux
and 7,000 in Toulouse.
	   Police patrolled the Paris demonstrations, which are often
marred by violence, but did not cut off traffic, leaving the
students to maneuver in and out of passing cars.
	   Police intervened to disperse hundreds of students who were
rampaging through a shopping center in Montparnasse, in southern
Paris. Dozens of others, their faces masked, stole from music shops
and bakeries, police said. A scooter was set on fire.
	   Two police officers were injured and thirteen people were
arrested, authorities said. Six cars were damaged and the windows
of ``several stores'' and phone booths were broken.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Touring Eastern Europe on Monday,
U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton started the day with a pep
talk to Bulgarian businesswomen and spent a rainy afternoon
debating world affairs with Czech political leaders.
	   Avoiding the press as she has throughout the brief overseas
tour, visited President Vaclav Havel and his wife Dagmar at their
private villa and spent a quiet hour chatting by the fireplace,
ahead of a final day of speeches and public appearances.
	   Before arriving in the Czech Republic on the second day of the
four-day trip to promote women's rights and civil society, Mrs.
Clinton met with businesswomen at a Sofia bakery and discussed the
challenges of running a business in the new Bulgaria.
	   ``We're very impressed by the reform effort and the difficult
decisions that your government is making on behalf of the future,''
she told the women.
	   Mrs. Clinton also accepted an offer to allow her book ``It Takes
a Village'' to be translated and published into Bulgarian.
Businesswoman Iren Komitova suggested the proceeds go to the
American University in Bulgaria's southwestern city of Blagoevgrad.
	   Mrs. Clinton met with some 500 students at the American College
of Sofia, where she also toured the school, talked to teachers and
alumni and looked at their computer laboratory.
	   ``I saw the future of Bulgaria in the eyes of the brilliant and
dynamic students I met at the American College of Sofia,'' she
said.
	   ``That school is but one example of the ties of trade,
investment, culture and friendship between our two countries.''
	   The college, established in 1860 while Bulgaria was still under
Turkish rule, was closed down in 1942 and turned into a police
training academy after the communists came to power. College alumni
were persecuted, but the school's book collection was preserved at
the local monastery and the college was resurrected in 1992.
	   The first lady flew later Monday to Prague to meet with Czech
leaders and speak at a conference organized by President Vaclav
Havel and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel.
	   She is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech on the future of
civil society at the conference Tuesday morning before leaving for
Washington later in the day.
	   After her arrival in Prague, Mrs. Clinton met briefly with Czech
Premier Milos Zeman.
	   Czech television reported the first lady discussed economic
issues with Zeman and thanked his government for allowing
U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty to broadcast from Czech
territory.
	   Together with the Havels, she then attended a
multi-denominational service at Prague's gothic St. Vitus
Cathedral.
	   She and the Czech president were among those who lit ``candles
of hope'' at the end of the prayers before departing for a gala
dinner at the Prague Castle.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian professional soccer players on
Monday called for random blood tests to protect their health _ and
their reputations, jeopardized by a spreading doping scandal.
	   At the same time, the players associations, representing players
from the three major divisions, dropped the threat of a strike to
protest the handling of the doping investigations, which it claims
violates the players' privacy.
	   A player walkout _ which has happened only once before in
Italy's soccer history _ could have stopped the Serie A and second
and third division matches for weeks.
	   Lawyer Sergio Campana, president of the players association,
strongly protested media leaks about alleged involvement of some
players and clubs in the scandal.
	   ``Until the conclusion of the investigations, it's unfair of the
media to name players as doping suspects,'' Campana said.
	   He added the association decided to give priority to stiffer
anti-doping measures intended to protect players from
administration of forbidden substances.
	   Several clubs have admitted use of creatine and other
supplements, which are legal but whose long-term effects are
uncertain.
	   ``There could be drug abuse without the players knowing of it,''
said Dr. Piero Volpi, physician for Internazionale of Milan, who
attended the association meeting in a Milan hotel.
	   Campana said the Association will urge establishment of random
blood tests during the week and tests of urine and blood at the end
of matches.
	   ``The Italian (soccer) federation could enforce our demands in
the short term,'' said Campana, who also made public the request of
the association for a medical case sheet for each player including
all medicines given by team doctors.
	   The Milan meeting, attended by leading association members such
as internationals Demetrio Albertini of AC Milan and Inter-Milan
captain Giuseppe Bergomi, capped weeks of allegations about a
doping scandal involving some prestigious players and clubs.
	   It started in summer, when Roma's Czech coach Zdenek Zeman
suggested systematic drug abuse by some clubs and expressed
amazement at the muscle growth of some past and present players of
rival club Juventus of Turin.
	   Since then, magistrates in Rome, Turin and other cities have
been investigating the matter.
	   Ugo Longo, the chief anti-doping prosecutor of Italy's Olympic
Committee resigned Monday, citing difficult work conditions
following the closure of the committee's laboratory.
	   The lab was shut, and its chief Emilio Gasbarrone fired, after
the International Olympic Committee deemed the facility
unsatisfactory.
	   Mario Pescante, president of Italy's Olympic Committee, resigned
in the wake of the scandal.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Forest fires raged for the third consecutive
day Monday in northern and central Israel. One of them was
described as the biggest in the country's history, but no
fatalities or serious injury were reported.
	   Firefighters suspected that one of the fires was started
deliberately but most were caused by carelessness on the part of
picnickers.
	   No official count was issued of the number of fires but at least
ten big ones were reported.
	   The biggest blaze was on the slopes of the Carmel range south of
Haifa. Firefighters said it was even bigger than Sunday's blaze in
the Carmel Forest below the neighborhood of Deniya on the outskirts
of Haifa, Israel's third-biggest city. However no large towns were
threatened in Monday's fires.
	   With hot weather and high winds, the flames spread to the
picturesque artists village of Ein Hod, the nearby Arab village of
Ein Chud and the communal village of Nir Etzion. All three villages
were evacuated.
	   Fourteen houses in Ein Hod were destroyed or damaged. Some
historic homes were damaged in Zichron Yaacov.
	   Air force helicopters and civilian crop-spraying light aircraft
were brought in to help the fire-fighters.
	   Smaller fires broke out again in the Carmel Forest below Deniya,
where thousands of residents were evacuated Sunday during what was
described then as the country's biggest fire ever. About 5,000
dunams (1,250 acres) of natural vegetation were destroyed in
Sunday's fire but no figure was available for Monday's.
	   Forest fires also started in the Jerusalem area, Western Galilee
and around the Arab towns and villages of central Israel. Two
hotels and a number of picnic sites were evacuated.
	   In the Jerusalem area one fire set off some mines in an old
minefield but nobody was hurt. A second fire in the Jerusalem hills
was started deliberately, police and firefighters believed, but the
others were probably caused by carelessness on the part of
picnickers who left embers smoldering after their barbecue.
	   ``So far we believe most of the fires were caused by negligence.
We suspect that the fire in the Jerusalem hills was caused by
arson,'' said Police Commissioner Yehuda Wilk.
	   Firefighters said a long spell of dry weather also contributed
to causing the fires.
	   In central Israel four Israeli Arabs were arrested on suspicion
of starting fires over the past two weeks in the Wadi Ara area,
Wilk said. Police and Arab residents recently clashed in Wadi Ara
over a land dispute.

More than 100,000 left homeless by flooding in Nigeria

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ More than 100,000 people have been left
homeless in western Nigeria after torrential weekend rains
overwhelmed two dams, the Nigerian news agency said Monday.
	   Dozens of villages were submerged by the flooding and bodies
could still be seen floating Monday in flood waters in western
Kwara state, some 375 kilometers (225 miles) northeast of Lagos,
the news agency said.
	   The chairman of the local government, Yahaya Yusuf, called for
urgent financial and material assistance, saying authorities were
struggling to find housing for the displaced people.
	   There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or death,
though two people died in Lagos on Sunday because of heavy
downpours there and hundreds of homes were destroyed. The two
people were killed when a mud home collapsed over them, the agency
reported.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday
he expects a resolution over U.N. demands in Kosovo within a few
days ``one way or the other.''
	   Cohen, who is visiting U.S. troops here, said the NATO allies
were moving closer to making a decision on authorizing the use of
force to force compliance with U.N. demands for peace in the
Serbian province.
	   ``I think you will see some resolution of the issue one way or
the other over the next several days,'' Cohen told reporters.
	   Cohen told some 1,000 U.S. Army troops conducting exercises in
Kuwait that he hoped that military action was not going to be
necessary.
	   ``We are hoping not to have to deploy any American troops into
Kosovo,'' he said, addressing them from a camouflaged tent.

	   SAN REMO, Italy (AP) _ Defending world champion Tommi Makinen
led his top rival Carlos Sainz by 30.7 seconds after the first
stage of the San Remo auto rally on Monday.
	   The Finnish driver, in a Mitsubishi, completed the first day of
the 11th World Championship event in one hour, 22 minutes, 45.6
seconds, beating Piero Liatti's Subaru by 3.7 seconds.
	   France's Didier Auriol drove his Toyota to third place, with a
gap of 21.1 seconds.
	   Sainz, who leads Makinen and Britain's Colin McRae 47 to 38
points in the championship standings, came in fourth, in a Toyota.
	   McRae was a distant ninth in a Subaru, more than one minute
behind Makinen.
	   While the battle for the world title still was wide open with
three races left, Gustavo Trelles of Uruguay clinched the Group-N
FIA title for the third straight year as his closest rival, Manfred
Stohl, withdrew shortly after the start Monday.
	   The Italian race ends in this riviera resort Wednesday.
Tuesday's second stage of 173 kilometers includes 10 special
trials.
	   The rally of Australia on Nov. 5-8 and Britain's RAC on Nov.
21-24 will complete the championship round.

U.S. loses WTO appeal over shrimp import ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more detail in 3rd, 10th, 11th grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States on Monday lost an appeal over a
World Trade Organization ruling that U.S. import restrictions on
shrimp were inconsistent with its obligations.
	   The panel of the WTO's Appellate Body, which functions as an
appeals court, said the U.S. restrictions amounted to arbitrary and
unjustifiable discrimination.
	   The United States should determine how to bring its
implementation of the law in line with its trading obligations, it
said.
	   In April, a WTO panel decided that a U.S. embargo on shrimp
imports from India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand is an illegal
attempt to impose U.S. standards on other countries.
	   The United States has blocked shrimp imports from the four under
a law restricting the import of shrimp caught with trawling nets
and equipment that harm endangered species of sea turtles.
	   The countries have declined to adopt measures to ensure trawling
nets won't ensnare and kill the turtles. Environmentalists say
failure to equip shrimp nets with turtle-excluder devices costing
dlrs 75 each causes the death of 150,000 turtles a year worldwide.
	   Although faulting the United States for the way its rules were
carried out, the panel upheld WTO members' right to adopt laws for
the purpose of conserving exhaustible natural resources.
	   ``The Appellate Body has rightly recognized that our
shrimp-turtle law is an important and legitimate conservation
measure, and not protectionist,'' U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky said in a statement.
	   ``But we disagree with (its) assessment that we have not
implemented the law in an even-handed manner.''
	   Barshefsky said the ruling won't affect U.S. efforts to promote
sea turtle conservation.
	   ``We will evaluate our options in the light of what best
achieves our firm objective of protecting endangered sea turtles,''
she said.
	   She welcomed a ruling by the body that submissions by
non-governmental organizations can be considered by WTO panels.

Primakov warns NATO against airstrikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Ivanov quotes, ADDS Primakov
conversation with Prodi, Russian observers leave Kosovo. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ As Russian officials warned against NATO
airstrikes in Yugoslavia, the defense minister offered military
observation planes on Monday as part of a last-ditch political
solution to the crisis in Kosovo province.
	   NATO bombardment ``will throw relations between NATO and Russia
far back, will jeopardize many of the cooperation accords that have
been reached in recent years,'' Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said in a telephone conversation with Italy's acting premier,
Romano Prodi, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov echoed the warning, telling
Russia's ORT television that NATO's decision to enter final
preparations for airstrikes was ``very dangerous.''
	   The decision ``will carry us to the red line that, from our
point of view, shouldn't be crossed, because it could entail the
most serious consequences,'' Ivanov said.
	   Russia vehemently opposes airstrikes against Yugoslavia, a
traditional ally with which it shares a Slavic heritage and
Orthodox religion, and has been lobbying for a negotiated solution
to the crisis in the ethnic Albanian-dominated province of Kosovo.
	   Even as NATO appeared poised to launch airstrikes, Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev told reporters that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic had agreed to the stationing of 1,500 observers
in Kosovo, and said Russia would consider taking part, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   ``We are prepared to provide our planes for international
control of Yugoslav air space,'' he was quoted as saying. No one
was available for comment at the Defense Ministry, and no other
details of Sergeyev's statement were provided.
	   Earlier Monday, Boris Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said
the president was ``cautiously optimistic'' that chances for a
peaceful solution have ``slightly increased'' because of U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke's extended talks with Milosevic, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Yakushkin said the Kosovo crisis was one of the reasons Yeltsin
had agreed to cut short his trip to Central Asia. Doctors ordered
him to return to Moscow for health reasons.
	   Sergeyev also expressed optimism, but he told reporters that the
government was looking at several alternative reactions to possible
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia, including a change in Russia's
relationship with the western alliance, Interfax said.
	   Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov warned that
Russia would break the arms embargo and annul all agreements with
NATO if the alliance launches airstrikes to force Serbia, the
leading republic in Yugoslavia, to end its violent crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   ``NATO should not think that Russia is weak and that its
historical geopolitical interests in the Balkans can be
disregarded,'' Zyuganov said before a meeting with Yugoslavia's
acting ambassador in Russia, Radoslav Paikovic.
	   Paikovic said that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
brother Borislav had been named ambassador to Moscow, Interfax
said.
	   Cautioning that Russia has ``commitments to an ally in the
Balkans,'' Zyuganov said that if war breaks out following NATO
attacks ``other laws go into effect, including the laws of allied
relations.''
	   Some Russian media sources have reported that the country's
state arms exporter, Rosvooruzheniye, has already violated the
embargo by supplying land-to-air missiles to Yugoslavia.
	   But the company's general director, Oleg Sidorenko, denied the
report Monday, Interfax said.
	   Russia has recalled its representative to NATO and its
ambassador to Belgium, where NATO has its headquarters, for
consultations. Foreign Ministry official Vladimir Chizov said their
return to Brussels will depend on developments, the Interfax news
agency reported Monday.
	   Ten Russian observers left Kosovo after the government ordered
them home, the RTR television station reported.

Sierra Leonean officers handed death sentence for 1997 coup

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A military court condemned 34
officers Monday to death by firing squad for crimes linked to the
bloody coup that toppled Sierra Leone's president last year.
	   The 34 were found guilty of treason, murder and other crimes
committed by the junta, which held sway for 10 months until
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah was restored to power by a
Nigerian-led West African intervention force in March.
	   Three other officers were acquitted while another died in
custody during the court martial, which lasted more than two
months.
	   Military court president Col. Tom Carew ruled that the convicts,
who will not be given a chance to appeal and can only receive
clemency from Kabbah himself, were among the chief architects of
the May 25, 1997 coup.
	   Although it was not clear when the executions would take place,
human rights watchdog Amnesty International said they could be
imminent and appealed to Sierra Leone's president to overturn the
ruling.
	   ``The use of the death penalty will not contribute to the
process of reconciliation in Sierra Leone,'' Amnesty said in a
statement released in London. ``Everyone convicted of a crime shall
have the right to his conviction and sentence being reviewed.''
	   Information Minister Julius Spencer said the court martial had
been conducted fairly by international standards, despite calls for
clemency.
	   ``The public clamor has been for retribution,'' said Spencer.
``There is no international convention prohibiting the execution of
the death sentence.''
	   Among the convicts is Col. F.Y. Koroma, the brother of former
junta leader Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, who has gone into hiding
in the eastern interior with the remnants of his ousted forces.
	   Last month, 16 civilians were convicted of treason for
collaborating with the junta.
	   Another 38 civilians are on trial in separate cases for treason
connected with junta rule, while former rebel leader Foday Sankoh
is standing trial on various charges, including crimes against
humanity.
	   Although Kabbah's return was hailed as a victory for democracy
in West Africa, fighting between Kabbah's loyalist forces and
ousted junta fighters and their rebel allies has continued in the
country's east.
	   Hundreds of alleged opponents of Kabbah have been rounded up and
detained without charge on suspicion of aiding the rebellion.

Davenport ousts Hingis from world No. 1 spot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A new era in women's tennis dawned on
Monday, and Lindsay Davenport, the new world No. 1, missed it by
sleeping in.
	   The 22-year-old American officially took over as the world's top
player from Switzerland's Martina Hingis when the rankings were
released Monday morning. She got the top spot based on her
performance at the Porsche Grand Prix in Filderstadt, Germany,
where she reached the finals.
	   Davenport, playing at the European Championships in Zurich,
didn't feel like celebrating by playing tennis.
	   ``I woke up late this morning and I didn't feel like hitting a
ball,'' said Davenport, the winner of five titles this season,
including the U.S Open. ``That was my first thought as No. 1.''
	   Davenport will not play her first match until Wednesday, when
she faces French qualifier Julie Halard-Decugis.
	   ``Making it to the top was never really an obsession of mine and
I never thought I'd get to No. 1 in the world,'' said Davenport.
	   ``You always look up to the No.1 players in the world and think
what great players they are or were,'' said Davenport. ``I'm very
honored to be a part of that. I hope to continue a bit longer at
No. 1 and will keep trying to stay at the top.''
	   Even though Davenport began her reign on Hingis' home turf, she
won't have the opportunity to face the 18-year-old in Zurich, with
Hingis pulling out due to a strained ankle.
	   Hingis' withdrawal means Davenport cannot be overtaken and is
guaranteed at least another week as the No. 1.
	   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Hingis, who fell from the top
spot after a quarterfinal loss to Dominique Van Roost in
Filderstadt. ``But I consulted the doctor, and he advised me not to
play this week.''
	   Hingis had spent 80 weeks at the top of the rankings, dating
from March 1997, when she became the youngest player ever to hold
the position.
	   Davenport's task at the dlrs 1 million European Championship has
been made even easier with world No. 3 Jana Novotna and No. 6
Monica Seles also pulling out due to injury. World No. 4 Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario will also be absent.
	   As a result, Davenport's main opposition will come from
compatriot Venus Williams, seeded second, who also has her sights
set on the No. 1 spot.
	   France's Sandrine Testud, who beat out Davenport in the final at
Filderstadt on Sunday, will be looking for a second consecutive
title.
	   Fifth-seed Patty Schnyder, who won five title this season and
reached the final of the Grand Slam Cup, will carry Swiss hopes in
Hingis' absence.
	   Davenport is only the eighth player to hold the No. 1 ranking
since the inception of the WTA rankings in 1975.

Makinen leads after first stage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN REMO, Italy (AP) _ Defending world champion Tommi Makinen
led top rival Carlos Sainz by 30.7 seconds after the first stage of
the San Remo auto rally on Monday.
	   The Finnish driver, in a Mitsubishi, completed the first day of
the 11th World Championship event in 1 hour, 22 minutes, 45.6
seconds, beating Piero Liatti's Subaru by 3.7 seconds.
	   France's Didier Auriol drove his Toyota to third place, 21.1
seconds behind.
	   Sainz, who leads Makinen and Britain's Colin McRae 47-38 in the
championship points standings, was fourth in a Toyota.
	   McRae was a distant ninth in a Subaru, more than one minute
behind Makinen.
	   While the battle for the world title still was wide open with
three races left, Gustavo Trelles of Uruguay clinched the Group-N
FIA title for the third straight year as his closest rival, Manfred
Stohl, withdrew shortly after the start Monday.
	   The Italian race ends in this Riviera resort Wednesday.
	   The Australian rally on Nov. 5-8 and Britain's RAC on Nov. 21-24
will complete the championship round.

Albanian leader welcomes reports Milosevic agreed to monitors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top ethnic Albanian leader in
strife-torn Kosovo welcomed indications late Monday that Yugoslav
president was about to accept international monitors in the
province.
	   ``International monitoring could prove useful and provide a way
out of the Kosovo crisis without further war,'' Fehmi Agani, head
of the ethnic Albanian team set up to negotiate with Belgrade
authorities, told The Associated Press.
	   Just as U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke ended his marathon talks
with president Slobodan Milosevic and left Belgrade to brief NATO,
Russian defense minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists in Moscow
that Milosevic had agreed to allow 1,500 international observers to
monitor compliance with U.N. demands to halt the Serb crackdown in
Kosovo.
	   ``If Milosevic really accepts an international monitoring force,
it would create a position of equilibrium in which the two sides
can then negotiate,'' Agani said.
	   ``A monitoring force would annul Milosevic's war gains and open
up an opportunity for dialogue on an equal basis. Only such
dialogue can have a chance to succeed,'' Agani concluded.
	   According to Agani, Milosevic had attempted by waging war in
Kosovo, to create an upper-hand position ahead of talks with Kosovo
Albanians.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke arrived
here Monday evening to brief the NATO allies on his Kosovo peace
efforts.
	   He arrived at the Brussels airport at 1845GMT and headed for the
NATO complex about a mile (1.5 kilometers) away.
	   Holbrooke came here from marathon talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade amid indications a breakthrough was
near in talks about ending the violence in Kosovo and thus avert
NATO air strikes.
	   Holbrooke was to return for more talks in Belgrade on Tuesday.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said in Moscow Milosevic
has agreed to allow 1,500 international observers to monitor
compliance with U.N. demands to halt the crackdown in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke met here with the ambassadors of the 16 NATO nations
who have been meeting daily to discuss the Kosovo crisis.
	   Despite reported progress on the diplomatic front, NATO was
still expected to approve the last military step needed to launch
airstrikes against the Serbs, a NATO official said Monday.
	   They planned to transfer command over the airplanes and other
hardware necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied Commander
Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As NATO stood poised to approve
airstrikes, a top U.S. envoy left marathon talks with Slobodan
Milosevic on Monday to brief the alliance amid reports a
breakthrough was near to avert airstrikes over Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke's mission to Brussels, Belgium, came with
Western nations evacuating diplomats from Yugoslavia _ adding to a
sense that a last-minute deal was necessary to avoid intervention.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists in
Moscow that the Yugoslav president had agreed to allow 1,500
international observers to monitor compliance with U.N. demands to
halt the Serb crackdown in Kosovo.
	   If true, that would represent a key last-minute concession by
Milosevic that came only hours before NATO planned to authorize the
attack against Milosevic's forces.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of Milosevic's reported
concession. But a statement from Milosevic's office said Holbrooke
would return and hold more talks Tuesday.
	   It said Milosevic ``has concluded that undoubtedly, necessary
conditions exist for a peaceful political solution to the Kosovo
problem'' _ a position that Western officials previously have
disputed.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, a senior ethnic Albanian leader
said that if Milosevic agrees to such a force, it ``could prove
useful and provide a way out of the Kosovo crisis without further
war.''
	   ``If Milosevic really accepts an international monitoring force,
it would create a position of equilibrium in which the two sides
can then negotiate,'' said Fehmi Agani, head of the ethnic Albanian
team set up to negotiate with Belgrade authorities.

Italian president begins consultations to form new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS with 7 graf to UPDATE with far-left leader calling for
Prodi's reinstatement. Picks up 7th graf prvs, `Prodi has ...' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Three days after the collapse of Premier Romano
Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president started calling
in political leaders Monday to try to reach a consensus on a new
government.
	   Following the talks, which are expected to last several days,
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi to try again with a
new majority. He could also name a new premier, or appoint a
government of technocrats.
	   If Scalfaro feels no candidate is capable of mustering a
majority, he could call early elections. Because the president
cannot dissolve Parliament during the last six months of his term,
elections would have to be scheduled by December.
	   Scalfaro has named Prodi as caretaker premier for the interim.
	   Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoked the
crisis when it withdrew support for the government over the 1999
deficit-cutting budget, which it said did not do enough to
stimulate job creation.
	   Despite help from a breakaway faction of the Communists, who on
Sunday formed a new party, Prodi lost Friday's vote of confidence
by a single vote when a member of his own coalition defected.
	   On Monday, far-left leader Armando Cossuta called for Prodi's
reinstatement for the sole purpose of getting the 1999 budget
passed. The only other viable option was early elections, said
Cossuta, who led a breakaway Communist faction that supported Prodi
in Friday's vote.
	   Prodi has said he won't take the job back unless his new
government could stick to the policies of its old one, an unlikely
scenario given the divided Parliament.
	   An alternative to Prodi could be Massimo D'Alema, leader of the
Democrats of the Left, the largest party in Prodi's coalition.
	   In the case of a so-called ``technical'' government, the names
of Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini have been circulated. A government of technicians
would get Italy through the volatile period of approving the 1999
budget and the launch of the common European currency, the euro, in
January 1999.
	   Prodi presided over cost cuts that got Italy into the debut of
the European Monetary Union, outlasting all but one other
post-World War II Italian government in the process.

Clinton's popularity rises in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Despite President Clinton's
involvement in the Monika Lewinsky affair, his popularity as a
politician has grown in Germany from 55 to 67 percent, a reputable
German polling institute said Monday.
	   The poll, which surveyed 1,129 people between Sept. 16-22,
showed that of those asked, only 8 percent said they had a bad
opinion of Clinton as a politician, compared to 17 percent in a
poll taken at the beginning of September.
	   Twenty-five percent of those asked had no opinion in the latest
poll, compared to 28 percent in the earlier survey, the Allensbach
polling institute said.
	   The institute said that those Germans surveyed who approved of
Clinton were most impressed with the steadfastness he has shown in
continuing to do his job under a tough pressure situation.
	   Although the survey ended the day after Clinton's video-taped
questioning by a grand jury was broadcast on international
television, the institute said it felt that the positive opinion of
the American president would remain steady.
	   While no margin of error was given for the latest poll,
Allensbach usually claims a plus or minus 3 percent for a survey of
that size.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least three people were killed and three
injured Monday in a gas explosion at a Russian shipyard, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The blast at the Admiralty Shipyard in St. Petersburg also
sparked a blaze that took more than two hours to extinguish. Rescue
teams continued searching for victims into the night, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   The report, which cited sources close to the shipyard
administration, said that the dead including a woman and two men
who had worked at the shipyard. The three injured were also
workers, ITAR-Tass said, citing local emergency officials.
	   Meanwhile, city prosecutors on Monday were carrying out a probe
into another explosion that occurred in St. Petersburg over the
weekend.
	   Dmitry Filippov, the head of the financial company Rosko, was
badly wounded by a bomb explosion at the entrance of his apartment
building on Saturday. He is in critical condition in a city
hospital.
	   His predecessor in the job was shot and killed two years ago.
	   Filippov also serves as chairman of the board of Menatep Bank in
St. Petersburg and as chairman of the board of bankers and
industrialists, a local government organization.
	   Until 1993, he was head of the St. Petersburg Tax Inspectorate
and the St. Petersburg Fuel Company. The energy sector in St.
Petersburg is widely believed to be infiltrated by organized
criminal groups.
	   Contract shootings and bombings have become customary in Russia
as mobsters wage turf battles and fight for control over profitable
businesses.

<TEXT>
	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ Traditional enemies Greece and Turkey
united Monday to pressure Yugoslavia into making concessions on
Kosovo, but the two neighbors failed to make any progress on
disputes which could lead the two NATO allies to war.
	   ``We discussed our bilateral relations and found that we have
problems,'' Greek Premier Costas Simitis said after his meeting
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz. ``This is a known phenomenon
in Greek-Turkish relations and I hope that one day we may be able
to overcome these difficulties.''
	   Solving their own intractable problems is important if the two
countries hope to set an example for other leaders gathered in this
Mediterranean resort, and help some in the turbulent region realize
their dream of European Union and NATO membership. Prime ministers
from Bulgaria, Macedonia and Romania are at the two-day summit as
are the foreign minister of Albania and observers from Bosnia and
Croatia.
	   Simitis said they did not discuss the one issue which could lead
the two NATO allies to conflict this year: the deployment of
Russian-made S-300 missiles by Greek Cypriots on the war-divided
island.
	   ``The S-300 were not discussed at all, but I referred to
Cyprus,'' Simitis added.
	   Turkey has said it will use military force to prevent the
installation of the missiles, an action which Athens has said will
translate into war. A clash between the region's two most powerful
countries would make the Kosovo crisis pale by comparison.
	   Cyprus is an issue on which Turkey does not fool around. It
invaded and occupied its northern third in 1974 in the wake of an
abortive Athens-backed coup by Greek-Cypriot supporters of union
with Greece. It retains more than 30,000 combat troops in the
Turkish Cypriot breakaway state, recognized only by Ankara.
	   Turkey's apparent determination to start a war with military
powerhouse Syria over its harboring of Turkish Kurdish insurgents
is indicative of the no-nonsense approach taken by its military,
which essentially pulls Ankara's foreign policy strings.
	   Simitis and Yilmaz did however discuss their countries'
longstanding disputes in the Aegean Sea, which have twice led them
to the brink of war in the past 11 years, but failed to reach any
consensus about how to deal with them.
	   ``I believe that any discussion is useful. It may not solve
problems but contributes to there being better information between
the two sides and a better understanding of solving problems,''
Simitis said in an effort to find a positive note.
	   But the two premiers did find common ground in their effort to
convince Yugoslavia to accept a request by U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke that President Slobodan Milosevic agree to an expanded
international monitoring mission in Kosovo.
	   ``The climate seems positive to find a solution without having
to resort to war action,'' Simitis said.
	   Turkey and Greece also spent the entire day pressuring Yugoslav
Premier Momir Bulatovic to accept a reference to Kosovo in their
joint statement and avert his country's political ouster from
future joint Balkan initiatives.
	   But as Bulatovic earlier in the day railed against NATO and the
international community before the frustrated Balkan leaders, he
failed to look out the window and see what was coming.
	   In the distance the French aircraft carrier Foch was building up
steam and moving across this picturesque bay on a journey towards
the Adriatic Sea and the Yugoslav coast to join an assembling NATO
armada.

Fresh New Offerings from Vuitton for Spring

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fresh as a spring day was Marc Jacobs's second
luxury ready-to-wear collection for Louis Vuitton, shown Monday in
a sun-filled greenhouse at Andre Citroen Park west of the Eiffel
Tower.
	   The American designer's line for spring was ready for April
showers, too, with terrific rain gear in heavy cottons and
plastified fabrics.
	   He led off with a cream bonded (heavy) cotton poncho over
polyester stretch T-shirt and teeny shorts, later going into a
see-through poncho that could double as a shower curtain.
	   It all looked very modern, especially the pale chartreuse simple
brushed cotton blouse-jacket with little sleeves or khaki cotton
shorts, sported by Naomi Campbell.
	   Wrapped skirts, long or cropped lean cotton trousers and cotton
sweaters with cowl collars came out with plenty of class - as did
the double-faced wools, tunics and skirts below the knee, but not
too long.
	   Clever little velvet swimsuits, great soft color combinations
like grape and cyclamen or subtle flesh tones, the
mirror-sequin-embroidered tops all had a young look with quality
attention to detail: things like apron-tied tops gave the
collection originality, taking it away from strict minimalism.
	   The one spring print in bubbles was original and fun: on a
knee-length cotton dress or handsome rubberized cotton poncho.
	   Vuitton, best known for its great luggage and handbags, only
showed a few little pochette-belts with the collection. As if to
say ``look at the other garments!''
	   Some luxury houses are starting to feel the financial crisis
pinch.
	   But Bernard Arnault, head of LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy),
who controls several other fashion houses, including Givenchy and
Dior, looked serene as he progressed through an enthusiastic crowd
with his wife, Helene, to salute Jacobs.
	   Among other young designers who lit the fashion scene Monday,
Jean-Luc Amsler has a kind of funky Seventies look with long coats,
backless wrapped dresses, swimsuits and shorts. They're matched to
coats and pants in blue-jeans tones of synthetics and cottons.
	   His silvery mesh ponchos over silver pants and a bra for evening
and the fake leather looks, layers of color and hip huggers had a
very trendy-nostalgic look from the Age of Aquarius.
	   Jerome L'Huillier was on a more sophisticated trail, with a lot
of wet-look clingy fabrics - draped onto the body at times,
criss-cross wrapped and draped blouses, and many sweet knit
outfits.
	   His good square jackets in silky fabrics with split longer
skirts, glitter in the fabric, should help the junior set dress up
- along with a few classically-cut coats.
	   While nude-tan seems to be a favorite color for spring, the
clothes so far are not giving the paparazzi posse much of a sexy
look-see.
	   It was a safari for the rich in Hermes' Faubourg Saint-Honore
shop, as casual clothes came out among covetable objects like a
crocodile golf bag that must cost upwards of dlrs 40,000.
	   Martin Margiela - former upstart weird designer, showed in his
second collection for Hermes that he knows what elegance is all
about. It was a pretty dull show, with whites, beiges, putty and
soft khakis dominating in the great double faced cashmeres, linens
and cottons.
	   But what class! These clothes would have graced any Hemingway
safari campfire, with the easy long skirts, crisp poplin blouses,
soft lambskin T-shirts and jackets.
	   Pants were wide and easy over luxury walking shoes. Plenty of
vests came out, worn as sleeveless blouses with the skirts or wide
pants. Sporty weekenders would love the ribbon-knit tunic
pullovers.
	   ``I admire the proportions, the great fabrics, the quality, very
much,'' said designer Azzedine Alaia
	   Unlike many other luxury houses here, Hermes does not seem to
suffer from the worldwide financial uproar, announcing a sales
growth of 14 percent in the first half of the year.
	   ``We don't know about our clothing sales of Margiela's designs
yet,'' said Hermes president Jean-Louis Dumas. ``But I know there's
certainly nothing to be unhappy about.''

NATO ready to approve order to bring air strikes closer

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Despite progress on the diplomatic
front, NATO was still expected to approve on Monday the last
military step needed to launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia to get
President Slobodan Milosevic to comply with international demands
on Kosovo.
	   ``There is no reason not to sustain the military pressure,''
said a NATO official, who demanded anonymity.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke arrived here to brief the
ambassadors of the 16 NATO nations meeting in emergency session on
his Kosovo peace efforts.
	   He came here from marathon talks with Milosevic in Belgrade amid
indications a breakthrough was near in talks about ending the
violence in Kosovo and thus avert allied airstrikes.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said in Moscow Milosevic
has agreed to allow 1,500 international observers to monitor
compliance with U.N. demands to halt the crackdown in Kosovo.
	   The NATO official said the alliance would proceed with plans for
airstrikes to keep the pressure on Milosevic. ``The military
preparations are going ahead,'' the official said.
	   That would likely include the issuance _ later Monday _ of an
``activation order'' to put planes and other hardware to be used in
airstrikes under joint NATO command.
	   Officials said that would show NATO's resolve to end the
violence in Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and
an estimated 275,000 uprooted since February's crackdown on ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   The ``activation order'' would transfer command over airplanes
and military equipment necessary for an airstrike from national
governments to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark and
authorize its deployment over Yugoslavia.
	   From then on, Gen. Clark would no longer need any approval from
the 16 member nations and proceed only in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana, NATO officials said on condition
of anonymity.
	   ``We are heading toward decision time now,'' said the NATO
official. Solana and Holbrooke have been in close touch over the
past week. The few days between any activation order and actual
airstrikes allow Milosevic more time to consider the consequences.
	   NATO authorities also met with Russian representatives at NATO
headquarters Monday to keep Moscow informed on the military
preparations. Russia opposes airstrikes against Yugoslavia, a
traditional ally. Moscow has long been lobbying for a negotiated
solution and has threatened to veto any U.N. resolution calling for
airstrikes.
	   Almost all NATO members have cleared barriers to participating
in airstrikes. On Monday, the outgoing German government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was also expected to back potential NATO
airstrikes.
	   Prior to the activation order, NATO officials agreed on rules of
engagement, targeting, liaison with humanitarian organizations in
Kosovo and the safety of NATO troops in Bosnia.
	   The NATO alliance also reached common ground on a legal basis
for airstrikes over the weekend, removing uncertainty whether an
additional U.N. resolution was necessary.
	   The Americans, and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a part of the Yugoslav republic.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Customs officials in Kyrgyzstan found weapons and
explosives hidden among humanitarian aid on an Iranian train, and
believe they were going to be smuggled into Afghanistan, a news
agency said Monday.
	   Customs officials inspected the 16-car Iranian train in the
southern Kyrgyz city of Osh on Friday, ITAR-Tass said. Five hundred
tons of weapons and ammunition were found hidden in the
humanitarian aid, it said.
	   Documents found on the train indicate the shipment was to be
loaded onto trucks and taken into Afghanistan, ITAR-Tass said,
quoting the deputy chairman of the State Customs Inspectorate,
Nadyrbek Turganbayev. He refused to give any more details.
	   The Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry denied any involvement in the
shipment, ITAR-Tass reported. The news agency said that Kyrgyz
media had claimed the Foreign Ministry had been told of the
shipment through diplomatic channels and had given permission for
it.
	   Kyrgyzstan and other former Soviet republics in Central Asia
fear an influx of refugees and weapons from Afghanistan, and
possibly a spill over of fighting that has wracked the country.

Arafat says summit should lead to further Israeli withdrawal
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
Monday that he hoped an upcoming Palestinian-Israeli summit meeting
in Washington would expedite a further Israeli military pullback
from the West Bank.
	   ``We hope it will not only be talk, talk, talk,'' Arafat told
reporters after a two-hour meeting with Crown Prince Hassan. The
crown prince is acting as regent while King Hussein is abroad.
	   ``We hope that this round will lead to concrete results on
Jerusalem ... and to the implementation of the U.S. proposal,''
Arafat said before returning home.
	   The United States has asked Israel to withdraw from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank, which Israel captured in
the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians have already agreed to the
U.S. proposal.
	   Israel earlier had given the Palestinians full or shared control
of about 27 percent of the land.
	   Arafat has called repeatedly for an end to the expansion of
Israeli settlements in Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem. Peace talks
broke down in March 1997 after Israel began a housing project for
Jews in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians fear that Israel is stalling for time by opposing
an additional troop withdrawal while at the same time expanding its
settlements in Jerusalem and the West Bank.
	   The four-day Palestinian-Israeli summit is set to begin Thursday
outside the U.S. capital.
	   In his brief remarks, Arafat accused Israel of ``intransigence''
and said it had not yet announced acceptance of the U.S. proposal,
which he described as a catalyst to ``save the peace process and
push it forward.''
	   He said he was confident that President Bill Clinton ``will ...
make the effort to arrive at a positive conclusion and positive
results'' at the Washington meeting.
	   Hassan said he was equally optimistic because ``it is imperative
to arrive at a visible threshold of achievement and this is what we
expect.''

Cohen says Gulf allies receptive to missile defense system

	   UDAIRI RANGE, Kuwait (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
said Monday that Washington's Gulf allies have been receptive to
the idea of a regional missile defense system.
	   Cohen said that such a system has become ``imperative'' to
protect civilians and U.S. soldiers from the threat of missiles
from countries such as Iran.
	   He said the United States wants its allies to help fund the
development of anti-missile systems or ``cooperate in the future as
far as deployment is concerned.''
	   ``The response I think has been quite positive,'' Cohen told
reporters after visiting hundreds of American troops training at
this desert outpost some 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Iraqi
border.
	   Cohen visited Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman
before arriving in Kuwait Monday. He travels later to Saudi Arabia.
	   The U.S. Theater High-Altitude Area Defense missile program or
THAAD has cost so far some dlrs 3.2 billion.
	   It has suffered five successive test failures, and top U.S.
officials have been considering whether to cancel it.
	   THAAD is supposed to be an improvement on the Patriot missile
system that was used during the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Cohen has called for a continuation of the program, saying an
anti-missile system is needed to protect soldiers from long-range
missiles.
	   Kuwaiti and U.S. troops have conducted scores of military
exercises since the end of the 1991 Gulf War that forced Iraqi
soldiers from Kuwait.

Chechen official: No trace found of British, New Zealand hostages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statistics on hostages in last graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's security service is conducting a
round-the-clock search for three Britons and a New Zealander
kidnapped in the breakaway republic, but no trace of the hostages
has been found, the service's chief said Monday.
	   No ransom demands have been made for the four hostages,
Chechnya's acting Security Minister Aslambek Arsayev said.
	   Arsayev said that investigators believe the four may be held by
the same gang that kidnapped another high-profile hostage, Russian
presidential envoy Valentin Vlasov, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Vlasov, kidnapped on May 1, remains missing.
	   Chechnya's security forces launched a 10-day crackdown last
week, seeking to capture rebel armed groups and possibly find leads
to the hostages. A particularly thorough search is being conducted
in Chechnya's mountainous regions, where hostages are usually held,
Arsayev said.
	   Several suspects in other cases have been detained during the
operation, and dozens of firearms and more than 18 kilograms (about
40 pounds) of marijuana have been seized, he said. However, no
leads to the hostages have been found, Arsayev said.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped on Oct. 3.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Arsayev said previously that investigators believe the Britons
and the New Zealander are being moved from place to place by their
captors.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of its two-year war for independence from
Russia in 1996.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia and 90 of them released, the
Interfax news agency reported, citing law enforcement officials. Of
the 176, 46 were foreign nationals, and seven foreigners were still
being held in addition to the four captured over the weekend: two
Turks, a Frenchman, a Yugoslav, a Slovak, a Saudi, and a Slovene.

Cuban refugees aiming for Puerto Rico reach Jamaica instead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Police in Jamaica were searching Monday
for four Cuban refugees who were part of a group of 14 who set out
in a boat for Puerto Rico but ended up on the north coast of
Jamaica instead.
	   Ten of the refugees _ three women and seven men _ were
apprehended Sunday evening after they landed near Hope Bay on the
north coast of the island after seven days at sea. The other four
remain at large.
	   Police said the refugees set out from Santiago de Cuba in a
14-foot fishing boat but drifted helplessly after their outboard
motor failed.
	   The 10 Cubans in custody were examined by medical personnel and
were in good health, according to police. Local and international
officials will consider their cases and they will be returned to
Cuba if they are not granted asylum in another country.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Forest fires raced through more than a dozen
homes in northern and central Israel for a third day Monday,
forcing officials to evacuate three villages in what has been
described as the biggest series of fires in the country's history.
	   No fatalities or serious injuries were reported. At least 10
fires were reported, though no exact count on the number of blazes
was available.
	   The biggest fire was on the slopes of the Carmel range south of
Haifa, Israel's third-biggest city. Firefighters said it was even
bigger than Sunday's blaze in the Carmel Forest on the outskirts of
Haifa, which claimed 1,250 acres (500 hectares).
	   It was unclear, however, how many acres were burned Monday.
	   With temperatures hovering at 90 degrees (32 C) accompanied by
high winds, the blaze spread to the picturesque artist's village of
Ein Hod, the nearby Arab village of Ein Chud and the communal
village of Nir Etzion in the Carmel forest. All three villages were
evacuated.
	   Fourteen houses in Ein Hod were destroyed or damaged. Some
historic homes were damaged in nearby Zichron Yaacov.
	   Air force helicopters and civilian crop-spraying light aircraft
were brought in to help the firefighters.
	   Smaller fires broke out again Monday in the Carmel Forest below
the Haifa neighborhood of Deniya, where thousands of residents were
evacuated Sunday.
	   Forest fires also broke out near Jerusalem and in Western
Galilee. Near Jerusalem, a fire set off mines in an old minefield,
though no one was hurt.
	   Authorities suspect that a fire in the Jerusalem hills was
started deliberately, Police Commissioner Yehuda Wilk said. Most of
the other fires are believed to be the result of negligence,
coupled with recent hot dry weather.
	   In central Israel four Israeli Arabs were arrested on suspicion
of starting fires over the past two weeks in the Wadi Ara area,
Wilk said. Police and Arab residents recently clashed in the area
over a land dispute.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As NATO stood ready to approve
airstrikes, a top U.S. envoy left marathon talks with Slobodan
Milosevic on Monday to brief the alliance amid reports a
breakthrough was near that would avert airstrikes over Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke's mission to Brussels, Belgium, came with
Western nations evacuating diplomats from Yugoslavia _ adding to a
sense that a last-minute deal was necessary to avoid intervention.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists in
Moscow that the Yugoslav president had agreed to allow 1,500
international observers to monitor compliance with U.N. demands to
halt the Serb crackdown in Kosovo.
	   If true, that would represent a key last-minute concession by
Milosevic that came only hours before NATO planned to authorize the
attack against Milosevic's forces.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of Milosevic's reported
concession. But a statement from Milosevic's office said Holbrooke
would return and hold more talks Tuesday.
	   It said Milosevic ``has concluded that undoubtedly, necessary
conditions exist for a peaceful political solution to the Kosovo
problem'' _ a position that Western officials previously have
disputed.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, a senior ethnic Albanian leader
said that if Milosevic agrees to such a force, it could ``provide a
way out of the Kosovo crisis without further war.
	   ``If Milosevic really accepts an international monitoring force,
it would create a position of equilibrium in which the two sides
can then negotiate,'' said Fehmi Agani, head of the ethnic Albanian
team set up to negotiate with Belgrade authorities.

Israel to ease blockade of Palestinian areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will early Tuesday ease the blockade of
the Palestinian areas which it imposed October 2, the army
spokesman announced Monday.
	   As from 2 a.m. (midnight gmt) Tuesday, 21,000 Palestinian
workers from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will be allowed to go
to their jobs in Israel, the spokesman said.
	   The total closure has been in force with brief respites for 22
days, since the beginning of the Jewish holiday period.
	   It was imposed after Israeli security services warned that the
Islamic Hamas group planned to carry out a major suicide bomb
attack or kidnap an Israeli soldier in retaliation for the killing
of two of its leaders by Israeli special forces.
	   Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in
Israel since 1994, killing scores of Israelis.
	   The Israeli closures cause extensive economic hardship in the
Palestinian areas where unemployment is high. Before it was imposed
on Sept. 20, about 60,000 Palestinians had permits to work in
Israel.
	   Palestinian leaders have condemned the closures as collective
punishment.

Efforts under way to prove herbal supplements work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The herb industry is attempting to counter
growing complaints about dietary supplements' quality and
effectiveness by turning to science: A fledgling movement uses
pharmaceutical-style testing to ensure consumers get what they pay
for.
	   It might even turn some popular herbs into prescription drugs.
	   ``We're trying to give people some rational basis'' for choosing
to take a particular herb, said Bernie Landes, chief executive of
Paracelsian Inc., which hunts the active ingredients that make
herbs work.
	   ``We want to be the Underwriters Laboratory for herbals,'' said
Elliot Friedman who heads competitor PharmaPrint Inc., which just
announced its testing had discovered that five ingredients may help
St. John's wort ease depression _ not the lone ingredient
advertised by most herbal brands.
	   Americans are expected to spend dlrs 4.3 billion this year on
herbal supplements such as saw palmetto, gingseng and others that
promise to do everything from lifting depression and shrinking
men's swollen prostates to fighting colds and easing stress.
	   So far, there's little scientific proof behind many of the
claims of better health.
	   And if an herb does help, consumers would need a
``standardized'' brand that carries a consistent dose of the
ingredients that make it work. Just as wine varies from vineyard to
vineyard and melons from one field are sweet while those from
another are tasteless, an herb's dozens of mysterious ingredients
vary depending on rainfall and other growing conditions.
	   St. John's wort, for example, recently made headlines when
laboratory testing found competing brands often don't contain
levels of the active ingredient hypericin promised on the bottle.
No brand advertises all four additional ingredients that
PharmaPrint claims consumers also need.
	   Testing is ``a step in the right direction,'' said Dr. H.B.
Matthews of the National Institutes of Health, which organized a
meeting last month where scientists demanded better quality from
the booming industry.
	   The two companies are running herbs through the same lab tests
that prescription medicines must pass _ called bioassays _ to
uncover just what biologically active ingredients they contain.
	   Then the companies contract with herb manufacturers to guarantee
certain brands carry high levels of the most biologically active
ingredients. American Home Products next month begins selling six
PharmaPrint-tested herbs under its popular Centrum supplement
brand: Echinacea, garlic, ginkgo, ginseng, saw palmetto and St.
John's wort. Paracelsian promises competing brands early next year.
	   The companies also plan to seek Food and Drug Administration
approval to sell the most effective herbs as prescription drugs, so
doctors wary of the largely unregulated supplements could choose,
for a little higher price, a fully tested medicine version.
	   PharmaPrint has begun clinical trials of its first drug
candidate, saw palmetto, to measure whether men taking the herbal
pills have their enlarged prostates shrink more than men who get a
dummy pill. Company testing shows saw palmetto is biologically
active; the question is whether the effect is big enough to help.
	   There already is some scientific data from Europe, where Germany
sells herbs as drugs, that some herbs have healthful effects. That
data prompted the NIH to finance a study starting this winter
comparing St. John's wort to the prescription antidepressant
Zoloft, to see which better helps moderately depressed Americans.
	   Such careful studies are new for the U.S. supplement industry,
which has run largely on folklore.
	   But ``to assume something the Seminole Indians used for
maintaining the health of their prostate 500 years ago is identical
to something in a bottle today _ it really begs the whole issue of
science,'' said Paracelsian's Landes.

	   CANCUN, Mexico (AP) _ Leaders of Mexico's ruling party say they
need to prepare better for the future if they want to retain their
seven-decade hold on power. Some southern governors say what they
really need is to return to the past.
	   Party reforms in recent years have led to cleaner elections,
opposition gains and more openness within the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI. But old guard party members claim
what's really needed are traditional politicians more in touch with
their people.
	   The debate marks the latest shots in a war for the soul of the
party _ one that will determine whether it will extend its 70-year
rule beyond the 2000 elections.
	   The most recent battle occurred last week when Mario Villanueva,
governor of Quintana Roo state, broke off relations with his own
party. He was back on speaking terms Monday, but he still told The
Associated Press he would continue his battle against PRI
``bureaucrats.''
	   Villanueva has built an old-style fiefdom in his southern state,
and he thinks the rest of the country should do the same. He has
allied with two other old-guard PRI governors in an attempt to get
one of them nominated as the PRI presidential candidate for 2000.
	   On Monday, Villanueva accused national party leader Carlos Rojas
of funding opposition groups and trying to dissolve caucuses in the
state and party where the PRI's old guard is based.
	   ``Rojas has financed groups that oppose the PRI, and is trying
to create opposition in outlying states,'' Villanueva said in a
telephone interview, referring to Rojas and others as ``bureaucrats
with no political sense.''
	   Rojas responded in a statement accusing the governor of
``old-style authoritarianism that we are determined to get rid
of.''
	   Being called old-style doesn't bother Villanueva. In an
interview shortly before he broke contact with the national
leadership Thursday, Villanueva said his party ``has to return to
its origins,'' a reference to the regional political bosses who
submitted to an all-powerful presidency in 1929.
	   Villanueva dropped his demand for Rojas' resignation Saturday
and pledged to obey party orders, but his short-lived rebellion was
the second by a state governor this year in response to reforms
within the PRI and Mexican politics.
	   Villanueva and two other governors _ all of whom say they have
been accused of illegal activities for political reasons _ say the
so-called ``technocrats,'' reformers who have dominated the
government this decade, are out of touch with the Mexican people.
	   ``Society is demanding flesh-and-blood people ... who they can
believe in because of their profile, because of their
personality,'' Villanueva said.
	   The PRI has become much more open in recent years due to reforms
supported by President Ernesto Zedillo.
	   Paradoxically, that new openness has helped those who want to
revert to the past. Villanueva conceded that a confrontation with
the PRI leadership, like the one he started Thursday, would have
been unthinkable years ago.
	   Villanueva's brief rebellion follows a similar attack in
February by Gov. Manuel Bartlett of Puebla, who predicted ``a war,
a terrible fight'' against national leaders who he said wanted to
turn over power to the opposition.
	   Villanueva said he has joined with Bartlett and a third southern
governor, Roberto Madrazo Pintado of Tabasco, in a bid to get one
of the latter two nominated as the PRI's presidential candidate in
the 2000 elections.

Extradition case against accused St. Kitts drug trafficker
</HEADLINE>
adjourned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP) _ An extradition case was adjourned
Monday against an accused St. Kitts drug trafficker who allegedly
threatened to kill U.S. students if the extradition went through.
	   The United States has been attempting to extradite Charles
``Little Nut'' Miller since 1996 to try him in Florida on charges
of conspiring to smuggle cocaine.
	   The case took on a high profile in August when the U.S. State
Department told students at the Ross University veterinary school
that Miller had threatened to kill Americans if he were extradited.
	   Miller denied making the threat, and most of the 250 U.S.
students stayed on the island.
	   Described in published reports as a millionaire who drives a
bulletproof BMW, Miller has eluded St. Kitts authorities for years.
	   On Monday, Magistrate Haynes Blackman adjourned a hearing on
Miller's extradition to consider defense motions to quash the
proceedings. Blackman did not say when he would issue a ruling.
	   The first attempt by the United States to extradite Miller was
denied by the magistrate's court in St. Kitts, but a higher court
sent the case back to be reconsidered.
	   A recent Newsweek article said Miller testified in a U.S. court
against a murderous Jamaican drug gang in 1989, was given immunity
and enrolled in the U.S. witness protection program. A U.S. Justice
Department spokesman declined comment.
	   Miller also reportedly helped finance the campaign of St. Kitts
Prime Minister Denzil Douglas, but Douglas denies any links to
Miller.

said two ethnic Albanians were wounded Monday when ``newly-arrived
Serb forces shot at a village'' in central Drenica region.
	   The center also reported shooting near Malisevo, 40 kilometers
(25 miles) southwest of Pristina, and army troops deployment of 40
vehicles near Podujevo, 25 kilometers (16 miles) north of the
provincial capital.
	   Serb sources claimed there were no clashes Monday in the
province. None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
Ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people
and most want independence or self-rule.
	   Holbrooke arrived in Brussels as NATO ambassadors were meeting
to approve an activation order _ the last formal step before
airstrikes could be launched.
	   A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an
activation order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in
Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and tens of
thousands uprooted since Feb. 28 crackdown against ethnic Albanian
rebels started.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over
Yugoslavia.
	   Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering
planes and missiles launched.
	   Sergeyev said Russia, which as Yugoslavia's ally has tried to
broker a deal that would avoid NATO intervention, was prepared to
provide planes for controlling Yugoslav airspace, and consider
participating in the monitoring force.
	   Earlier Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
phoned Milosevic to urge him to comply with U.N. resolutions to end
the Kosovo turmoil.
	   Milosevic responded that he was ``in the process of complying,
or trying to come into full compliance with the Security Council
resolutions,'' spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   Holbrooke's mission to Brussels followed a flurry of diplomatic
evacuations by Western nations from Yugoslavia. That added to a
sense that intervention was imminent _ barring a breakthrough in
negotiations.
	   The international diplomats' mission observing events evacuated
Kosovo for neighboring Macedonia, with the Russian members the last
to depart. Sources at the American Embassy in Belgrade said all but
12 foreign staff were being evacuated to Budapest, and an embassy
statement said personnel in ``non-emergency situations'' had left.
	   A State Department advisory urged all U.S. citizens to leave
Yugoslavia, and Americans in the Serb part of neighboring Bosnia
also were advised to leave. The German, British, Danish and other
foreign embassies closed down Monday.
	   Holbrooke, who has met with Milosevic seven times in the past
eight days for a total of roughly 50 hours, described his earlier
overnight meeting with Milosevic as ``intense, indeed, and at times
very heated.'' He said the standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav
president ``can only be called an emergency.''
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the outgoing German government said it intends to
allow German warplanes to participate in any attack.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, which
could last ``several days.''
	   The major obstacle appeared to be Holbrooke's request that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   The Security Council demands include an immediate cease-fire, a
withdrawal of special troops in the province, allowing refugees to
return home and beginning talks with independence-minded ethnic
Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   The Pentagon was making military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission failed. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Amid international calls for
clemency, a military court condemned 34 officers Monday to death by
firing squad for crimes linked to the bloody coup that toppled
Sierra Leone's president last year.
	   The 34 were found guilty of treason, murder and other crimes
committed by the junta, which held sway for 10 months until
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah was restored to power by a
Nigerian-led West African intervention force in March.
	   Three other officers were acquitted while another died in
custody during the court martial, which lasted more than two
months.
	   Addressing a hushed courtroom, military court president Col. Tom
Carew ruled that the convicts will not be given a chance to appeal
and can only be given mercy from Kabbah himself.
	   Outside, throngs of silent passerbys strained to glimpse the
condemned officers being whisked away to prison in armored
vehicles.
	   Carew said those found guilty were among the chief architects of
the May 25, 1997 coup.
	   Although it was not clear when the executions would take place,
human rights watchdog Amnesty International said they could be
imminent and appealed to Sierra Leone's president to overturn the
ruling.
	   Several ``friendly'' governments had also called on Sierra Leone
to show mercy to all those accused of treason, Information Minister
Julius Spencer said without giving details.
	   ``The use of the death penalty will not contribute to the
process of reconciliation in Sierra Leone,'' Amnesty said in a
statement released in London. ``Everyone convicted of a crime shall
have the right to his conviction and sentence being reviewed.''
	   The Information Minister said the court martial had been
conducted fairly by international standards.
	   ``The public clamor has been for retribution,'' said Spencer.
``There is no international convention prohibiting the execution of
the death sentence.''
	   Among the convicts is Col. F.Y. Koroma, the brother of former
junta leader Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, who has gone into hiding
in the eastern interior with the remnants of his ousted forces.
	   Last month, 16 civilians were convicted of treason for
collaborating with the junta.
	   Another 38 civilians are on trial in separate cases for treason
connected with junta rule, while former rebel leader Foday Sankoh
is standing trial on various charges, including crimes against
humanity.
	   Although Kabbah's return was hailed as a victory for democracy
in West Africa, fighting between Kabbah's loyalist forces and
ousted junta soldiers and their rebel allies has continued in the
country's east.
	   Hundreds of alleged opponents of Kabbah have been rounded up and
detained without charge on suspicion of aiding the rebellion.

U.S. loses WTO appeal over shrimp import ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS final grafs with environmental group reaction. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States on Monday lost an appeal over a
World Trade Organization ruling that U.S. import restrictions on
shrimp were inconsistent with its obligations.
	   The panel of the WTO's Appellate Body, which functions as an
appeals court, said the U.S. restrictions amounted to arbitrary and
unjustifiable discrimination.
	   The United States should determine how to bring its
implementation of the law in line with its trading obligations, it
said.
	   In April, a WTO panel decided that a U.S. embargo on shrimp
imports from India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand is an illegal
attempt to impose U.S. standards on other countries.
	   The United States has blocked shrimp imports from the four under
a law restricting the import of shrimp caught with trawling nets
and equipment that harm endangered species of sea turtles.
	   The countries have declined to adopt measures to ensure trawling
nets won't ensnare and kill the turtles. Environmentalists say
failure to equip shrimp nets with turtle-excluder devices costing
dlrs 75 each causes the death of 150,000 turtles a year worldwide.
	   Although faulting the United States for the way its rules were
carried out, the panel upheld WTO members' right to adopt laws for
the purpose of conserving exhaustible natural resources.
	   ``The Appellate Body has rightly recognized that our
shrimp-turtle law is an important and legitimate conservation
measure, and not protectionist,'' U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky said in a statement.
	   ``But we disagree with (its) assessment that we have not
implemented the law in an even-handed manner.''
	   Barshefsky said the ruling won't affect U.S. efforts to promote
sea turtle conservation.
	   ``We will evaluate our options in the light of what best
achieves our firm objective of protecting endangered sea turtles,''
she said.
	   She welcomed a ruling by the body that submissions by
non-governmental organizations can be considered by WTO panels.
	   In San Francisco, the environmental group Earthjustice Legal
Defense Fund expressed concern the ruling would discourage the
United States from using import restrictions to protect other
imperiled species.
	   ``Much as we would encourage the United States to stand by its
law, I don't really expect that to happen,'' said Martin Wagner,
the fund's director of international programs.
	   The decision was also deplored by the Sierra Club and the Earth
Island Institute.

Portuguese authorities step up probe into public works corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with Prime Minister's address to the
nation
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Prime Minister Antonio Guterres
announced Monday tough new measures against graft in an effort to
defuse pressure on his government over a high-level kickback
scandal.
	   The measures included the creation of a powerful anti-corruption
unit that will immediately probe recent allegations that political
parties for the past six years received kickbacks for awarding
public roadbuilding contracts, Guterres said.
	   In a televised address to the nation, Guterres said new staff
will be recruited and trained to detect white-collar crimes,
especially corruption in state-owned companies.
	   He also unveiled a witness protection program, access to
suspects' bank accounts, and tighter controls on public works
contracts.
	   ``I don't want a Portugal where crimes are committed with
impunity,'' Guterres said.
	   Guterres put the final touches to the anti-corruption package
during a two-hour meeting earlier in the day with Justice Minister
Jose Vera Jardim and Attorney-General Jose Cunha Rodrigues.
	   The illegal party financing scandal erupted when Garcia dos
Santos, the former head of the state-run national roadbuilder JAE,
alleged that officials and parties had received payoffs to grant
public works contracts to some construction companies.
	   The Attorney-General launched an investigation into graft at the
JAE four years ago, after businessmen made similar allegations.
	   He dropped the case a year later because of a lack of evidence
and complained of a lack of manpower to deepen the probe.
	   Garcia dos Santos, who quit as JAE President in June, was quoted
in the weekly Expresso newspaper claiming that members of the
current Socialist government knew about the corruption.
	   The allegations rocked Guterres's minority Socialist government
after Garcia dos Santos received a personal letter from Finance
Minister Antonio Sousa Franco saying he knew of government members
who allegedly connived in the scam.
	   Sousa Franco said he had also informed the Attorney-General of
his suspicions.
	   Meanwhile, Infrastructure and Transport Minister Joao Cravinho
insisted that internal inquiries had found no evidence of
corruption in his ministry.
	   Sousa Franco and Cravinho had previously clashed over funding
for local authorities. Relations between the two ministers
reportedly are tense.
	   The current Socialist government, in office in 1995, and the
previous Social Democrat government have spent hundreds of millions
of dollars on roadbuilding programs since Portugal joined the
European Union in 1986.

allegations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Benetton's Turkish licensee said Monday it was
suspending all dealings with an Istanbul factory accused of
employing children as young as 9 years old, Italy's ANSA news
service reported.
	   Bogazici Ready Wear said it had begun an investigation into the
allegations, raised by a Turkish textile workers group.
	   The factory employs children between the ages of 9 and 13 and
pays them less than $90 a month, making clothing under the name of
the Italian-based clothing manufacturer and retailer, alleged
Dervis Kaplan, leader of the textile workers group.
	   ``This scandal should cease,'' Italy's Corriere della Sera daily
quoted Kaplan as saying.
	   Benetton's offices in Turkey did not immediately return calls
for comment late Monday.
	   According to Corriere della Sera, Benetton responded, ``If it's
true, we will intervene. Our Turkish partner, in fact, guaranteed
us in writing it would respect the laws on labor.''
	   Bogazici Ready Wear said it had suspended dealings with the
factory at the request of an Italian textile group.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Turkey says it could build its part of the
pipeline &QL; 
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ President Suleyman Demirel insisted Monday
that Caspian Sea oil will be transported through Turkey, despite a
report claiming that companies favored a cheaper and shorter route.
	   ``Baku-Ceyhan will definitely be constructed,,'' Demirel told an
oil conference in reference to a pipeline project running from the
Azeri capital of Baku to Turkey's Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
``It is the safest route and has the backing of the United
States.''
	   Demirel's optimism conflicted with Sunday's report in The New
York Times that U.S. efforts for the Turkish project appeared to be
failing.
	   Azerbaijan's oil reserves in the Caspian Sea, which started
flowing through a preliminary Russian pipeline last fall, are
considered to be the world's richest after the Middle East.
	   According to the newspaper, companies from the United States and
seven other nations are expected to announce Oct. 29 that they will
rely on a much shorter and cheaper pipeline already being built
from Azerbaijan to the port of Supsa, on Georgia's Black Sea coast,
or an enlarged pipeline along the same route.
	   From Georgia, the oil would be loaded into tankers and shipped
through Turkey's narrow Bosporus Strait, a proposal strongly
opposed by Turkey as it would increase the risk of oil tanker
accidents in the strait dividing Istanbul.
	   Energy Minister Cumhur Ersumer said the report was baseless,
private NTV television said. Ersumer said Turkey will sign an
agreement with Georgia and Azerbaijan this month to allow the
Turkish pipeline to cut through their territories.
	   Ersumer also indicated that Turkey would help financing the
project by constructing its part of the pipeline on its own.
	   ``Turkey has the power to build its part of the pipeline if all
three countries (Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan) agree on
constructing the pipeline within their borders,'' Ersumer said.
	   The Turkish proposal foresees the construction of a
1,730-kilometer (1,081-mile) pipeline, via Georgia, capable of
carrying 50 million metric tons (7.1 million barrels) of oil a
year. It is expected to cost dlrs 2.5 billion.
	   It was unclear whether Ersumer's proposal would be officially
relayed to the companies that will decide on the main route.
According to some analysts, the proposal could tip the balance in
Turkey's favor as the companies appear to base their decision on
economic concerns.
	   Washington has favored the Baku-Ceyhan route because it would
avoid crossing Iran, which has also proposed an alternative route.

FDA approves device that lets high-speed water drill cavities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ People scared of the dentist could soon have a
new option for dealing with cavities: a machine that uses water
particles to cut into teeth without as much pain and noise as the
dreaded drill.
	   Biolase Technology Inc. announced Food and Drug Administration
approval of its Millennium device Monday.
	   Laser energy bombards water droplets until they move at such
high speed that they become a ``hydrokinetic'' drill. Despite a
faint burning smell, the tooth remains cool to touch because only
cool water, not the laser's heat energy, actually reaches it.
	   Biolase said the water drills would sell for dlrs 39,000 to dlrs
45,000, somewhat higher than a regular dental drill and about the
same as a heat laser the FDA approved for cavity drilling last
year.
	   Dr. Lewis Eversole of the University of the Pacific studied 66
people who had two teeth with cavities the same size. One tooth got
regular drilling, the other was drilled with Millennium. Both
systems were comparable, he concluded after seeing the fillings
were equally intact six months later.
	   But the Millennium didn't cause the high-pitched grinding that
makes ``a lot of people want to jump out of the chair,'' he said.
In 20 people who opted not to receive anesthesia for either
filling, patients reported significantly less discomfort on the
Millennium-drilled tooth, he said.
	   But the Millennium is only for certain kinds of cavities, so
it's uncertain how often dentists would be able to use it,
cautioned Dr. Wayne Wozniak of the American Dental Association. For
example, it can't treat a cavity that forms behind an existing
filling, he said. It's also for adults only.
	   ``It's something that still needs further research to decide
just how useful such a device would be in the dental office,'' he
said.

International agency to take nuclear power to poor nations

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Developing countries are being hampered by
tight safeguards from building nuclear power plants, nuclear
scientists complained Monday, but the International Atomic Energy
Agency promised to help them build safe reactors.
	   Agency representatives at an international conference on nuclear
power said the IAEA was prepared to play an active role in the safe
use of nuclear plants to generate electricity in poor countries.
	   ``Developing countries trying to start nuclear power programs
feel frightened by safety and threatened by safeguards,'' R.
Chidambaram, chairman of India's Atomic Energy Commission. ``It is
the responsibility of IAEA that this does not come in the way of
the growth of nuclear power in developing countries.''
	   Victor Mourogov, deputy director general of IAEA, said nuclear
power appealed to countries with large populations and fast-growing
economies.
	   ``Whether these countries will be able to make use of nuclear
power ... will depend heavily on the extent of international
cooperation in financing and technology sharing by the
industrialized countries,'' Mourogov said.
	   About 65 scientists were meeting to explore the role of nuclear
power in meeting the growing electricity demands in developing
countries. Among the 31 countries represented were China, France,
Russia, Austria, Indonesia and Iran.
	   Mourogov said the demand for nuclear power had stagnated in
North America and Western Europe after contributing to electricity
supplies there for the past 40 years. But developing countries in
Asia find nuclear power an attractive option.
	   Stanley Hatcher, former president of the American Nuclear
Society, said hurdles must be overcome, ``because I fervently
believe that developing countries are going to need nuclear power
as part of their energy mix to improve standards of living and meet
environmental needs.''
	   Hatcher said the initial cost of building a nuclear power plant
was the biggest barrier. If the cost was prohibitive, not enough
nuclear power plants would be built to help meet poor nations'
energy needs, he said.
	   The conference was focusing on regulatory requirements, ways to
pay for nuclear power programs and technology transfer, organizers
said.

Strawberry remains hospitalized

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ New York Yankees slugger Darryl Strawberry will
have to watch Game 6 of the American League Championship from his
hospital room as he recovers from colon cancer surgery.
	   ``His spirits are good, he's gaining strength, he has no fever,
and his blood counts are normal,'' a statement from
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center said Monday. ``He is not yet
able to eat normally and therefore will remain in the hospital for
several more days.''
	   The hospital declined further comment.
	   A 16-inch portion of the outfielder's large intestine was
removed during a three-hour operation Oct. 3 to get rid of a 2
1/2-inch (6.35-cm) cancerous tumor that nearly obstructed his
intestine.
	   The Yankees, leading the best-of-7 series 3-2, play the
Cleveland Indians in Game 6 of the American League Championship
Series Tuesday night. His teammates have stitched Strawberry's No.
39 on the back of their baseball caps.

NATO ready to approve order to bring air strikes closer

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Despite diplomatic progess, NATO was
still expected to approve on Monday the last military step needed
to launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia in an effort to force
President Slobodan Milosevic to comply with international demands
on Kosovo.
	   ``There is no reason not to sustain the military pressure,''
said a NATO official, who demanded anonymity.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke arrived here to brief the
ambassadors of the 16 NATO nations meeting in emergency session on
his Kosovo peace efforts.
	   He came here from marathon talks with Milosevic in Belgrade amid
indications a breakthrough was near in talks about ending the
violence in the secessionist Serbian province and thus avert allied
airstrikes.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said in Moscow Milosevic
has agreed to allow 1,500 international observers to monitor
compliance with U.N. demands to halt the crackdown in Kosovo.
	   The NATO official said the alliance would proceed with plans for
airstrikes to keep the pressure on Milosevic. ``The military
preparations are going ahead,'' the official said.
	   That would likely include the issuance later Monday of an
``activation order'' to put planes and other hardware to be used in
airstrikes under joint NATO command.
	   Officials said that would show NATO's resolve to end the
violence in Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and
an estimated 275,000 uprooted since February's crackdown by Serb
forces on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The ``activation order'' would transfer the command over
airplanes and military equipment necessary for an airstrike from
national governments to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark
and authorize deployment over Yugoslavia.
	   From then on, Gen. Clark would no longer need any approval from
the 16 member nations but would need to consult with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana before proceeding with airstrikes,
NATO officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   ``We are heading toward decision time now,'' said the NATO
official. Solana and Holbrooke have been in close touch over the
past week. The few days between an activation order and actual
airstrikes allow Milosevic more time to consider the consequences.
	   NATO authorities also met with Russian representatives at NATO
headquarters Monday to keep Moscow informed on the military
preparations. Russia opposes airstrikes against Yugoslavia, a
traditional ally. Moscow has long been lobbying for a negotiated
solution and has threatened to veto any U.N. resolution calling for
airstrikes.
	   Almost all NATO members have cleared barriers to participating
in airstrikes. On Monday, the outgoing German government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was also expected to back potential NATO
airstrikes.
	   Prior to the activation order, NATO officials agreed on rules of
engagement, targeting, liaison with humanitarian organizations in
Kosovo and the safety of NATO troops in Bosnia.
	   The NATO alliance also reached common ground on a legal basis
for airstrikes over the weekend, removing uncertainty whether an
additional U.N. resolution was necessary.
	   The Americans, and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a part of the Yugoslav republic.

Yeltsin cuts short Central Asia trip with respiratory infection

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut
short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory
infection that revived questions about his overall health and
ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin's premature return to Moscow also prompted doubts about
his capacity to respond decisively in the Kosovo crisis, in which
Russia has been leading a campaign to forestall airstrikes.
Moscow's NTV station said it was a crucial time for Russia, when
``presidential decisions'' are needed.
	   There was no indication that Yeltsin's illness would sideline
him for any length of time, and aides said the president would
maintain his schedule for the rest of the week.
	   But after a series of health problems in recent years, including
heart bypass surgery in 1996, every new ailment unleashes a flurry
of speculation about the president's ability to function. The
president insists he has no major health problems and will serve
out the remaining two years of his term.
	   Yeltsin's aides said the president was taking antibiotics to
ward off a bout of bronchitis and a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius
(99.3 Fahrenheit). There were no plans to hospitalize Yeltsin, who
arrived in Moscow late Monday night from Almaty, Kazakstan, a day
earlier than planned.

Runners now have trials date to shoot for
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBIA, South Carolina (AP) _ Now, every American female long
distance runner can circle a date on their Olympic calenders _ Feb.
26, 2000.
	   That's when the U.S. Women's Olympic Marathon Trials returns
here, the same city where the race was held before the Atlanta
Games two years ago.
	   Organizers announced the date Monday, about five months after
the city was picked as the first to hold consecutive marathon
trials.
	   The three qualifiers will have about seven months to get ready
for the Sydney Games, where the women's Olympic marathon will be
run the final week of September.
	   ``We like to keep it far away from the Olympics,'' said Carol
McLatchie, who headed the women's site selection committee for USA
Track and Field. ``I've always been a big proponent of giving the
athletes time to rest, and then come back and have a little bit of
extra time to get over the cold or the flu or something like
that.''
	   That may have been part of the problem in 1996, when Jenny
Spangler _ a surprise champ after qualifying 61st coming into the
trials _ couldn't finish the Atlanta marathon because of an
achilles' injury.
	   While the date is in place, the course is not. The traditional
layout in South Carolina's capitol region has included long
stretches of grueling hills and a steady elevation onto the city's
main roads.
	   McLatchie said she heard from competitors and officials that the
city may be too hilly for Olympic preparation.
	   ``We're trying to listen to them,'' McLatchie said. ``But if
you're training to come to the Olympic trials and run in the
Olympic marathon, you need as tough a course as you can get.
Strength is an important factor.''
	   Russ Pate, the trials' race director, said his group might
soften some rises. But no drastic changes will be made when the
final plan comes out in several months, he said.
	   Pate said the Carolina Marathon Association, overseeing the
trials, has raised about 80 percent of the dlrs 800,000 in
sponsorship money it bid for the event.
	   In 1996, sponsor money flowed freely as Columbia was a key
location in the Olympic trek. The women's marathon trials was the
first competitive U.S. qualifying race run that year. The Olympic
torch snaked through the state and several foreign teams finished
pre-Olympic training in the Palmetto State.
	   Pate and others weren't sure how fund raising would go this
time. ``This was a different sell, but in some ways it was
easier,'' Pate says, ``One reason may be that the last event was so
successful.''
	   About 50,000 people turned out for the trials two years ago. A
study from the University of South Carolina said the race had an
economic impact of dlrs 2 million to the Midlands region.
	   Pate said 84 runners have met the qualifying mark of 2 hours, 50
minutes. He said 20 runners, including Linda Somers-Smith and Gwyn
Coogan _ the third- and fourth-place finishers from the 1996 trials
_ have surpassed the ``A'' standard of 2:42:00.
	   Kristy Johnson's time of 2:32:37 in Sunday's Chicago Marathon
left her the top qualifier so far. McLatchie says qualifying ends
about a month before the trials.
	   ``We keep returning here and I keep thinking, the road to Sydney
is running through Columbia,'' McLatchie said.

Netanyahu moves to overcome reject right wing resistance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTING for AMs. CHANGES byline, NEW throughout to update

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will reject
an attempt by hard liners in his cabinet to restrict his freedom to
negotiate at a U.S. summit this week, an Israeli official said
Monday.
	   He will be meeting President Clinton and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat Thursday at Wye Plantation, Maryland to discuss a
withdrawal of Israeli forces from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Right wing ministers Yitzhak Levy and Shaul Yahalom are opposed
to the 13 percent withdrawal and intend to urge the cabinet Tuesday
to forbid Netanyahu to agree to the second redeployment, as the
withdrawal is called, unless the Palestinians clamp down on Islamic
militants and fulfill a number of other conditions.
	   However an Israeli official said Netanyahu will certainly reject
the right wing move. ``No negotiator would agree to his freedom
being circumscribed in such a way before the talks,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Netanyahu will, however, stress the need for the Palestinians to
fulfill their security commitments, the official said.
	   Earlier a senior Palestinian negotiator said the success of the
Wye Plantation summit depends on a clear-cut ``yes'' from Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the American initiative.
	   ``It is time to deliver,'' Saeb Erekat told reporters Sunday
night after a meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   Palestinians also were expressing growing unease over the naming
of hawkish former Israeli general Ariel Sharon as Netanyahu's
foreign minister.
	   Sharon, whose appointment last week was widely seen as a bid to
keep far-right allies from toppling Netanyahu's government, has
been quoted as saying he would refuse to shake the hand of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Wye Plantation.
	   ``It's worrisome,'' Erekat said. Previously, the Palestinian
leadership had said the appointment was an internal Israeli affair.
	   Monday was a Jewish holiday and there was no immediate Israeli
comment on summit prospects. However, the Israeli newspaper Yediot
Ahronot said over the weekend that Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet,
due meet Tuesday, was balking at agreeing to an American-authored
plan for an Israeli pullback in the West Bank.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians hope the four-day summit would mark
the end of a long round of meetings and the start of implementation
of accords.
	   ``It depends on Mr. Netanyahu. If he says `yes' to the American
initiative and stops attempts to change the references of the
interim agreement, we will reach an agreement in no time,'' Erekat
said.
	   The Palestinians accepted the American plan, which includes
security conditions they must fulfill.
	   The Israeli government has said it will authorize implementing
any deal only after the Palestinians take a series of
security-related steps including disarming militants and annulling
sections of the PLO charter.
	   Israel accuses the Palestinians of consistently failing to
implement security commitments they already made, and insists on
more detailed commitments, with time-tables.
	   In a statement issued after its meeting, the Palestinian Cabinet
said it stood by an Israel-Palestinian security memorandum reached
under American auspices in December 1997, calling on both sides to
deal with security in reciprocity.
	   ``Security cannot be separated from the peace process. Real
security comes through the implementation of the agreement,'' the
statement read.
	   Also on the summit agenda are sticky points such as a third
troop redeployment and outstanding issues such as the opening of a
Palestinian airport and port, and the status of Palestinian
prisoners.

Israel to ease blockade of Palestinian areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Tuesday will ease the blockade of
Palestinian areas that it imposed on October 2, the army spokesman
announced.
	   As of 2 a.m. (midnight GMT) Tuesday, 21,000 Palestinian workers
from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will be allowed to go to
their jobs in Israel, the spokesman said Monday.
	   The blockade was imposed after Israeli security services warned
that Hamas, a Palestinian group opposed to current Mideast peace
efforts, planned to make a major suicide bomb attack or kidnap an
Israeli soldier in retaliation for the killing of two of its
leaders by Israeli special forces.
	   Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in
Israel since 1994, killing scores of Israelis.
	   The Israeli closures cause extensive economic hardship in the
Palestinian areas where unemployment is already high. Before the
most recent blockade, about 60,000 Palestinians had permits to work
in Israel.
	   Palestinian leaders have condemned the closures as collective
punishment.

Netanyahu moves to overcome reject right wing resistance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from Israeli official saying
Netanyahu rejecting pressure from right-wing officials. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will reject
an attempt by hard-liners in his Cabinet to restrict his freedom to
negotiate at a U.S. summit this week, an Israeli official said
Monday.
	   He will be meeting President Bill Clinton and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat Thursday at Wye Plantation, Maryland, to discuss an
American plan calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   Right-wing ministers Yitzhak Levy and Shaul Yahalom oppose the
13 percent withdrawal and intend to urge the cabinet Tuesday to
forbid Netanyahu to agree to the withdrawal unless the Palestinians
clamp down on Islamic militants and fulfill other conditions.
	   However an Israeli official said Netanyahu will certainly reject
the right-wing move. ``No negotiator would agree to his freedom
being circumscribed in such a way before the talks,'' the official
said on condition of anonymity.
	   Netanyahu will, however, stress the need for the Palestinians to
fulfill their security commitments, the official said.
	   Earlier a senior Palestinian negotiator said the success of the
summit depends on a clear-cut ``yes'' from Netanyahu to the
American initiative.
	   ``It is time to deliver,'' Saeb Erekat told reporters Sunday
night after a meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   Palestinians also were expressing growing unease over the naming
of hawkish former Israeli general Ariel Sharon as Netanyahu's
foreign minister.
	   Sharon, whose appointment last week was widely seen as a bid to
keep far-right allies from toppling Netanyahu's government, has
been quoted as saying he would refuse to shake Arafat's hand at Wye
Plantation.
	   ``It's worrisome,'' Erekat said. Previously, the Palestinian
leadership had said the appointment was an internal Israeli affair.
	   Monday was a Jewish holiday and there was no immediate Israeli
comment on summit prospects. However, the Israeli newspaper Yediot
Ahronot said over the weekend that Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet,
due meet Tuesday, was balking at agreeing to the American plan.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians hope the four-day summit would mark
the end of a long round of meetings and the start of implementation
of existing agreements.
	   ``It depends on Mr. Netanyahu. If he says `yes' to the American
initiative and stops attempts to change the references of the
interim agreement, we will reach an agreement in no time,'' Erekat
said.
	   The Palestinians accepted the American plan, which includes
security conditions they must fulfill. The Palestinians already
have full or partial control over about one-quarter of the West
Bank.
	   The Israeli government has said it will implement any deal only
after the Palestinians take a series of security-related steps,
including disarming militants and annulling sections of the PLO
charter.
	   Israel accuses the Palestinians of consistently failing to
implement security commitments they already made, and insists on
more detailed commitments, with timetables.
	   After its meeting, the Palestinian Cabinet said it stood by an
Israel-Palestinian security memorandum reached under American
auspices in December 1997.
	   ``Security cannot be separated from the peace process. Real
security comes through the implementation of the agreement,'' the
statement read.
	   Also on the summit agenda are sticky points such as a third
troop withdrawal and outstanding issues such as the opening of a
Palestinian airport and port, and the status of Palestinian
prisoners.

Libyan radio begins calling itself the ``Voice of Africa''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In another sign of Libyan anger toward Arab
leaders, the state radio's foreign service has begun to call itself
the ``Voice of Africa,'' instead of the ``Voice of the Greater Arab
Homeland.''
	   The radio's new name was announced in a Monday broadcast.
	   The report was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. and
received in Cairo.
	   Libya has praised African countries for voting in June to ignore
the U.N. air embargo against Libya. Several African leaders,
including the heads of the Congo, Chad and Sudan, have defied the
U.N. sanctions since the vote.
	   Libya had asked the Arab League to join the Organization of
African Unity in ignoring the sanctions, but the Arab League has
refused.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has sharply criticized Arab
leaders since the Arab League decision and has told his people that
they their true supporters are in Africa and not the Arab
countries.
	   The sanctions were imposed in 1992 to try and force Libya to
hand over for trial two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an
American airliner of Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.

U.S. envoy briefs NATO, Milosevic concession reported
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with conflicting claims by ethnic
Albanian, Serb media on Kosovo violence Monday. &QL;

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO poised to approve
airstrikes, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke consulted late into the
night Monday with alliance members amid reports he and Yugoslavia's
president were near a breakthrough in defusing the Kosovo crisis.
	   Holbrooke traveled to Belgium while Western nations evacuated
diplomats from Yugoslavia _ adding to the sense that a last-minute
deal was necessary to avoid the bombing of Serbian targets.
Holbrooke flew to Brussels Monday evening and went right to the
NATO complex a mile (kilometer) away.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists in
Moscow that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had agreed to
allow 1,500 international observers to monitor compliance with U.N.
demands to halt the Serb crackdown in Kosovo.
	   If true, that would represent a key last-minute concession by
Milosevic that came only hours before NATO planned to authorize the
attack against Milosevic's forces.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of Milosevic's reported
concession. But a statement from Milosevic's office said Holbrooke
would return and hold more talks Tuesday.
	   In the Kosovo capital of Pristina, a senior ethnic Albanian
leader, Fehmi Agani, said that if Milosevic agrees to such a force,
it could ``provide a way out of the Kosovo crisis without further
war.'' Agani is head of the ethnic Albanian team set up to
negotiate with Belgrade authorities.
	   A U.S. source, speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated
that Holbrooke had made enough progress that he needed to update
NATO personally as its ambassadors met in Brussels to OK an
activation order _ the last formal step before airstrikes could be
launched.
	   A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an
activation order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in
Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and tens of
thousands uprooted since a crackdown against ethnic Albanian rebels
started on Feb. 28. Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize their deployment over
Yugoslavia.
	   Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering
planes and missiles launched.
	   Sergeyev said Russia, which as Yugoslavia's ally has tried to
broker a deal that would avoid NATO intervention, was prepared to
provide planes for controlling Yugoslav airspace, and consider
participating in the monitoring force.
	   Earlier Monday, U.N. chief Kofi Annan phoned Milosevic to urge
him to comply with U.N. resolutions to end the Kosovo turmoil.
	   Milosevic responded that he was ``in the process of complying,
or trying to come into full compliance with the Security Council
resolutions,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   The United Nations has condemned massacres of ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo but has not supported airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke's mission to Brussels followed a flurry of diplomatic
evacuations by Western nations from Yugoslavia. That added to a
sense that intervention was imminent _ barring a breakthrough in
negotiations.
	   The international diplomats' mission evacuated Kosovo for
neighboring Macedonia, with the Russian members the last to depart.
	   Holbrooke, who has met with Milosevic seven times in the past
eight days for a total of roughly 50 hours, described his earlier
overnight meeting with Milosevic as ``intense, indeed, and at times
very heated.'' He said the standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav
president ``can only be called an emergency.''
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched against the separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army. Ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people.
	   In Kosovo, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center
said that two ethnic Albanians were wounded Monday when
``newly-arrived Serb forces shot at a village'' in the central
Drenica region.
	   The center also reported shooting near Malisevo, 40 kilometers
(25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Serb sources claimed there were no clashes Monday in the
province. None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the outgoing German government said it intends to
allow German warplanes to participate in any attack.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, which
could last ``several days.''
	   The U.N. Security Council demands include an immediate
cease-fire, a withdrawal of special troops in the province,
permission for refugees to return home and the start of talks with
independence-minded ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   The United States was making military preparations if
Holbrooke's mission failed. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in
Britain on Sunday and a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew
from Germany to Italy.
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.

First official admission missing political opponents are dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABDELHAKIM YAMANI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ A Moroccan official admitted for the first
time Monday that dozens of missing political opponents were dead,
and he pledged to investigate other cases.
	   Among 112 people declared missing by their families or by
non-governmental organizations since the 1960s, 56 ``are dead and
their death certificates will soon be delivered to their
families,'' said Driss Dahak, head of the official human rights
body.
	   Speaking at a news conference, Dahak declined to elaborate on
the circumstances surrounding the 56 deaths during years of
political repression by the government of King Hassan II.
	   Rights activists have also reported 500 missing ethnic Sahrawis
from the Western Sahara, a territory Morocco claims as its own,
which Dahak also declined to discuss.
	   But the official said his Consultative Council for Human Rights
(CCDH) would on Tuesday establish a commission ``to establish lists
of disappeared people and to study their situations case-by-case.''
	   Regarding the rest of the 112 reported disappeared, Dahak said
12 people, including a Libyan, were freed. But the whereabouts of
44 remained unknown, including six who were likely dead and 18 who
disappeared ``under mysterious conditions,'' Dahak said without
elaborating.
	   As the government periodically does, Dahak also announced that
28 political prisoners would be soon freed by royal pardon.
	   Hassan, who has in recent years loosened his grip on the
government and sought to liberalize the country, on Friday told the
Moroccan parliament that the remaining cases before the official
human rights council should be settled within six months.
	   For years, Morocco was known to maintain secret detention
centers in Rabat and Casablanca, as well as an internment camp in
the south. Most of those detained were leftists, though many
members of the military were arrested after a foiled coup in 1972.

	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies
on Monday said they captured Kindu, a strategic government-held air
base in the eastern part of the country.
	   After eight days of fighting, a rebel commander said 9,000 rebel
fighters entered the town and its air base, 80 kilometers (50
miles) southwest of Kalima, at around 7 p.m. (1700 GMT).
	   ``The whole town and the airport are in our hands,'' Arthur
Mulunda, a rebel battalion commander, said.

	   No independent confirmation was immediately possible. In Kalima,
a rear base of the rebel attack, soldiers fired celebratory gunfire
and sang.
	   Mulunda said his men had captured many government prisoners but
did not say how many.
	   Kindu is the biggest prize in a two-month rebel campaign to
topple President Laurent Kabila.
	   Kabila had turned Kindu into a launching pad for a
counter-offensive against rebel eastern strongholds.
	   Mulunda said the victory will open routes to the diamond-rich
province of Eastern Kasai and its capital, Mbuji-Mayi, as well as
to southern Katanga Province, Kabila's home.

	   ``This is a big victory for us,'' Mulunda said. ``Kabila wanted
to use Kindu for a big counter-offensive. He cannot do anything
now,'' he said. ``Mbuji-Mayi is next.''
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ have been reinforced with troops
and weapons from neighboring Rwanda.
	   Kabila has so far refused to negotiate with the rebels, accusing
them of being the puppets of Rwanda and neighboring Uganda.
	   Both countries say they have legitimate security interests in
eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the border area
of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The mood is grim, in Kosovo and
across Yugoslavia.
	   Embassies are closing. Diplomats and observers are fleeing.
Humanitarian organizations await the word to pull out.
	   There were hints in the capital Belgrade on Monday that a
settlement in the crisis was in the works, following talks between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. negotiator Richard
Holbrooke. However, no deal was certain and the threat of NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia remained.
	   Word of the possible diplomatic breakthrough had little
immediate impact across Yugoslavia, where most people must get
their news almost exclusively from state radio, which did not
report the development.
	   The Serbs in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, are angry, both at the
ethnic Albanians, whose more radical wings are fighting for
independence, and at foreigners, whose nations are preparing
military action against them.
	   Fear is palpable in Kosovo's hinterlands, where hundreds of
ethnic Albanians have been killed over the past seven months and
hundreds of thousands driven from their homes. Though many would
welcome NATO airstrikes, they also are afraid Serb police will
exact a terrible vengeance upon them.
	   Some people, however, just think the West is after the wrong
target.
	   ``I hate Americans,'' said Ljubisa, a civil servant from
Kosovo's second largest city, Pec, who didn't want to give his last
name. ``If they have anything against (Milosevic), why don't they
just shoot him? I have three little kids and I didn't hurt
anybody.''
	   Jasna, 30, who also declined to give her last name, was talking
tough.
	   ``If they bomb, I told my husband to send the kids and me to
Serbia,'' she said. ``Then I'm coming back and we're going to get
even with the Albanians.''
	   The last American, European Union and Russian diplomats from the
Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, sent here in July to monitor
the situation, pulled out of Kosovo Monday and headed south for
safety Macedonia.
	   In Belgrade, the British, German and Danish embassies closed and
their staffs began the drive to Budapest, Hungary. The American
Embassy was down to 12 people, mostly in support of the Holbrooke
mission.
	   ``For God's sake, let's get it over with, one way or another,''
said anguished Belgrade housewife Milena Popovic, adding that the
uncertainty was worse than anything else.
	   Near the ethnic Albanian village of Gollubovic, west of
Pristina, 66-year-old Qazim Berisha stood outside his temporary
shelter made of dried cornstalks. He and 27 of his relatives have
been on the move for the past four months. Two of his sons have
been abducted by Serbs.
	   ``If Milosevic comes to his senses, it will be good,'' said
Berisha. ``We'd all like to have peace. But if he doesn't want to
come to his senses, we would like NATO to help us because we are
dying.''
	   One focus of Serb anger is the Grand Hotel in Pristina, where
journalists from several NATO countries are staying: Italians,
Britons, Americans and others.
	   Every night, a crowd of drunks gathers outside, screaming
obscenities at the reporters inside, threatening to kill them and
smash their cars. Eventually they are chased away by official and
secret Serb police, stationed at the hotel to keep an eye on the
foreigners.

	   Kabila, who is supported by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and
Namibia, defeated the rebels on the outskirts of the capital,
Kinshasa, in mid-August.
	   Since then, the rebels have been contained in their eastern
strongholds, including the city of Kisangani in north-central
Congo.
	   The rebels made slow progress in taking Kindu, which was
defended by a force of about 5,000 troops. Rebel fighters shot down
a Boeing 727 airplane on Saturday, claiming it was transporting 40
government troops and ammunition to Kindu.
	   But Congo Airlines, which owned the aircraft, said the victims
were civilians fleeing fighting in Kindu. There was no independent
confirmation.
	   Since then, rebels said they had closed down all routes from the
town and had fired shells each day into Kindu and the air base, 4
kilometers (2 miles) away.
	   Rebels said most of the civilian population is believed to have
fled the fighting into surrounding forests.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The mood is grim, in Kosovo and
across Yugoslavia.
	   Embassies are closing. Diplomats are fleeing. Observers are
packing up and leaving. Humanitarian organizations await the word
to pull out. And Yugoslavs in Kosovo, Albanians and Serbs, are
loading their guns and waiting for the worst.
	   All eyes were fixed on Brussels on Monday, where NATO
ambassadors were poised to authorize airstrikes, and on Belgrade,
where Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was deliberating
concessions in talks aimed at halting Serb repression against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Serbia's poor southern province.
	   The Serbs here are angry. And they like to carry guns. Not only
do they hate the Albanians for having got them into this fix, they
hate the foreigners whose nations are preparing to pound them with
missiles and bombs.
	   In the hinterlands, where hundreds of ethnic Albanians have been
killed over the past seven months and hundreds of thousands driven
from their homes, forcing many to live in the open under plastic
sheets, the fear is palpable. Though many would welcome NATO
airstrikes, they also are afraid Serb police will exact a terrible
vengeance upon them.
	   Some people, however, just think the West is after the wrong
target.
	   ``I hate Americans,'' said Ljubisa, a civil servant from Pec who
didn't want to give his last name. ``If they have anything against
Slobo, why don't they just shoot him? I have three little kids and
I didn't hurt anybody.''
	   Jasna, 30, who also declined to give her last name, was talking
tough.
	   ``If they bomb, I told my husband to send the kids and me to
Serbia,'' she said. ``Then I'm coming back and we're going to get
even with the Albanians.''
	   The last American, European Union and Russian diplomats from the
Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, sent here in July at the
suggestion of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to monitor the
situation on the ground, pulled out of Kosovo Monday and headed
south for safety Macedonia.
	   In Belgrade, the British, German and Danish embassies closed and
their staffs began the drive to Budapest, Hungary. The American
Embassy was down to 12 people, mostly in support of the Holbrooke
mission.
	   ``For God's sake, let's get it over with, one way or another,''
said anguished Belgrade housewife Milena Popovic, adding that the
uncertainty was worse than anything else.
	   In some districts of the capital, mailboxes were stuffed with
leaflets instructing people on how to recognize air raid sirens by
the length and type of sound and what to do in case of air raids.
	   The independent daily Blic published a poll on where various
politicians intend to be if the bombs start falling.
	   ``If the bombing actually happens, I'll be at the Students
Square,'' Blic quoted Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic as
saying. ``Let NATO and Clinton explain to their people how and why
they killed a democrat.''
	   Social Democrat leader Vuk Obradovic said he planned to be in
uniform, serving his country by ``defending the dignity and honor
of its people.''
	   Near the ethnic Albanian village of Golubovic, west of Pristina,
66-year-old Qazim Berisha stood outside his temporary shelter made
of dried cornstalks. He and 27 of his relatives have been on the
move for the past four months. Two of his sons have been abducted
by Serbs.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO poised to approve
airstrikes, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke consulted late into the
night Monday with alliance members amid reports he and Yugoslavia's
president were moving closer to an agreement to defuse the Kosovo
crisis.
	   Holbrooke traveled to Belgium while Western nations evacuated
diplomats from Yugoslavia _ adding to the sense that a last-minute
deal was necessary to avoid the bombing of Serbian targets.
Holbrooke flew to Brussels Monday evening and went right to the
NATO complex.
	   He was to return to the Yugoslav capital for more talks with
President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists in
Moscow that Milosevic had agreed to allow 1,500 international
observers to monitor compliance with U.N. demands to halt the Serb
crackdown in Kosovo.
	   If true, that would represent a key last-minute concession by
Milosevic that came only hours before NATO planned to authorize the
attack against Milosevic's forces.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of Milosevic's reported
concession. In Washington, however, a Clinton administration
official said there were still divisions over the verification
issue.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was
a lot of motion in the Belgrade talks but that Milosevic still was
not in compliance with the demands laid out by the U.N. Security
Council last month.
	   In the Kosovo capital of Pristina, a senior ethnic Albanian
leader, Fehmi Agani, said that if Milosevic agrees to such a force,
it ``could prove useful and provide a way out of the Kosovo crisis
without further war.'' Agani is head of the ethnic Albanian team
set up to negotiate with Belgrade authorities.
	   A U.S. source, speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated
that Holbrooke had made enough progress that he needed to update
NATO personally as its ambassadors met in Brussels to OK an
activation order _ the last formal step before airstrikes could be
launched.
	   A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an
activation order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in
Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and tens of
thousands uprooted since Feb. 28 crackdown against ethnic Albanian
rebels started. Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over
Yugoslavia.
	   Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering
planes and missiles launched.
	   Sergeyev said Russia, which as Yugoslavia's ally has tried to
broker a deal that would avoid NATO intervention, was prepared to
provide planes for controlling Yugoslav airspace, and consider
participating in the monitoring force.
	   Earlier Monday, U.N. chief Kofi Annan phoned Milosevic to urge
him to comply with U.N. resolutions to end the Kosovo turmoil.
	   Milosevic responded that he was ``in the process of complying,
or trying to come into full compliance with the Security Council
resolutions,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   The United Nations has condemned massacres of ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo but has not supported airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke's mission to Brussels followed a flurry of diplomatic
evacuations by Western nations from Yugoslavia. That added to a
sense that intervention was imminent _ barring a breakthrough in
negotiations.
	   The international diplomats' mission observing events evacuated
Kosovo for neighboring Macedonia, with the Russian members the last
to depart. Sources at the American Embassy in Belgrade said all but
12 foreign staff were being evacuated to Budapest, and an embassy
statement said personnel in ``non-emergency situations'' had left.
	   Holbrooke, who has met with Milosevic seven times in the past
eight days for a total of roughly 50 hours, described his earlier
overnight meeting with Milosevic as ``intense, indeed, and at times
very heated.'' He said the standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav
president ``can only be called an emergency.''
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched against the separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army. Ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people.
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the outgoing German government said it intends to
allow German warplanes to participate in any attack.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, which
could last ``several days.''
	   The U.N. Security Council demands include an immediate
cease-fire, a withdrawal of special troops in the province,
allowing refugees to return home and beginning talks with
independence-minded ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   The Pentagon was making military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission failed. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.

	   ``I hate Americans,'' said Ljubisa, a civil servant from
Kosovo's second largest city, Pec, who didn't want to give his last
name. ``If they have anything against (Milosevic), why don't they
just shoot him? I have three little kids and I didn't hurt
anybody.''
	   Jasna, 30, who also declined to give her last name, was talking
tough.
	   ``If they bomb, I told my husband to send the kids and me to
Serbia,'' she said. ``Then I'm coming back and we're going to get
even with the Albanians.''
	   The last American, European Union and Russian diplomats from the
Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, sent here in July to monitor
the situation, pulled out of Kosovo Monday and headed south for
safety Macedonia.
	   In Belgrade, the British, German and Danish embassies closed and
their staffs began the drive to Budapest, Hungary. The American
Embassy was down to 12 people, mostly in support of the Holbrooke
mission.
	   ``For God's sake, let's get it over with, one way or another,''
said anguished Belgrade housewife Milena Popovic, adding that the
uncertainty was worse than anything else.
	   Near the ethnic Albanian village of Golubovic, west of Pristina,
66-year-old Qazim Berisha stood outside his temporary shelter made
of dried cornstalks. He and 27 of his relatives have been on the
move for the past four months. Two of his sons have been abducted
by Serbs.

NBA labor talks to resume Tuesday morning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When David Stern and Billy Hunter sit down
across from each other in a hotel conference room, it will be their
last opportunity to save the league's uninterrupted string of
35,001 games over 51 seasons.
	   Judging from the pessimism so abundant on both sides, their
chances of keeping the NBA's perfect record intact are roughly
equal to those of Michael Jordan airballing a title-clinching
jumper _ slim and none.
	   The last chance to save a full, 82-game season comes Tuesday
when owners, led by commissioner Stern, and players, led by union
chief Hunter, meet for collective bargaining talks at a Manhattan
hotel.
	   Barring a quick settlement, the league will cancel games for the
first time in its history. The regular season is scheduled to begin
Nov. 3.
	   ``I think it's a real shame,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ
Granik said of the perfect record. ``The people it means the most
to, probably, are those of us in the league office. David's been at
this for 30-some years, and I've been at it for more than 20, so
that's something we have taken a lot of personal pride in.
	   ``We feel pretty bad about it, but at some point you have to
accept that there are other issues that are more important. And the
overall financial health of the league has to take precedence over
that record that we hadn't missed a game,'' Granik said.
	   The sides have met for only two formal bargaining sessions since
the lockout began July 1, and their meeting last Thursday was more
of a question-and-answer parley than a bargaining meeting.
	   About 15 players met at the union's offices Monday to discuss
the specifics of a counterproposal. When it is presented Tuesday,
the owners will not be expected to respond positively unless the
players have accepted the demand to somehow place a definitive
limit on the amount of league revenues that will be devoted to
player salaries.
	   Putting it in the lingo of the business, the current ``soft''
salary cap must be replaced by a ``hard'' cap, or at least a
``harder'' cap.
	   Otherwise, no deal.
	   ``Certainly this is the least successful (negotiation),'' Granik
said. ``In terms of reaching a deal, this is the worst we've ever
had. We've never gotten to this point without being able to make a
deal.''
	   The NBA is a dlrs 2 billion-a-year business, and it is
incomprehensible to most fans that the owners and players haven't
been able to come up with a way to divvy the pie.
	   Like the disastrous baseball strike of 1994, the
less-destructive hockey lockout of 1994-95 and the NFL strike of
1987, the combatants in the NBA lockout stand to do more harm to
their sport than good.
	   The NBA has enjoyed leaps in prosperity that would have been
unimaginable less than two decades ago in Magic Johnson's and Larry
Bird's rookie season when the finals were televised on a
tape-delayed basis.
	   Since then, the league has enjoyed a renaissance and gained a
worldwide appeal that has shown no sign of ebbing _ even with the
current possibility that Jordan will retire from the six-time
champion Chicago Bulls.
	   As the game's popularity has soared, so, too, have the revenues.
Franchises that were worth only a few million dollars in the 1980s
have become worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and player
contracts that were formerly valued in the hundreds of thousands
have grown to be worth more than dlrs 100 million for the most
promising young players.

Congolese rebels say they capture strategic eastern air base

<TEXT>
	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies
said Monday they had captured the strategic, government-held air
base of Kindu in eastern Congo.
	   After eight days of fighting, a rebel commander said 9,000 rebel
fighters entered the town and its air base, 80 kilometers (50
miles) southwest of Kalima, late Monday.
	   ``The whole town and the airport are in our hands,'' said Arthur
Mulunda, a rebel battalion commander.
	   The claim could not immediately be confirmed. If true, Kindu
would be the rebels' biggest prize in their two-month campaign to
topple President Laurent Kabila.
	   Kabila had turned Kindu into a launching pad for a
counter-offensive against rebel eastern strongholds.
	   Mulunda said his men had captured many government prisoners but
did not give a figure. In Kalima, a rear base for the rebel attack,
soldiers sang and fired weapons in celebration.
	   Mulunda said the victory will open routes to the diamond-rich
province of Eastern Kasai and its capital, Mbuji-Mayi, as well as
to southern Katanga Province, Kabila's home.
	   ``This is a big victory for us,'' Mulunda said. ``Kabila wanted
to use Kindu for a big counter-offensive. He cannot do anything
now,'' he said. ``Mbuji-Mayi is next.''
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ have been reinforced with troops
and weapons from neighboring Rwanda.
	   Kabila has so far refused to negotiate with the rebels, accusing
them of being the puppets of Rwanda and neighboring Uganda.
	   Both countries say they have legitimate security interests in
eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the border area
of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   Kabila, who is supported by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and
Namibia, defeated the rebels on the outskirts of the capital,
Kinshasa, in mid-August.
	   Since then, the rebels have been contained in their eastern
strongholds, including the city of Kisangani in north-central
Congo.
	   The rebels made slow progress in taking Kindu, which was
defended by a force of about 5,000 troops.
	   Rebel fighters shot down a Boeing 727 airplane on Saturday,
claiming it was transporting 40 government troops and ammunition to
Kindu. Congo Airlines, which owned the aircraft, said the victims
were civilians fleeing fighting in Kindu. There was no independent
confirmation.
	   Since then, rebels said they had cut off all routes from Kindu
and had fired shells each day into it and the air base, four
kilometers (two miles) away.
	   Rebels said most of the civilian population is believed to have
fled the fighting into nearby forests.

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Byron Dafoe, who had a career-high six shutouts
last season, stifled New York with his first of the 1998-98 season
Monday as the Boston Bruins beat the Islanders 3-0.
	   Dmitri Khristich scored his first goal of the season at 14:00 of
the opening period and Steve Heinze made it 2-0 with his second at
15:18.
	   The Islanders lost their opener Saturday 4-3 to the Pittsburgh
Penguins, who scored three goals in a 72-second stretch, starting
with 4:50 gone in the game.
	   Dafoe, who stopped 29 shots in a 3-3 season-opening tie Saturday
night against the St. Louis Blues, made 28 saves Monday, none
better than the ones with about five minutes left in the game. He
stopped Jason Dawe's point-blank shot from the slot with his left
glove, then smothered Sergei Nemchinov's rebound attempt.
	   Dafoe, obtained from the Los Angeles Kings in August 1997, had
an outstanding first season with the Bruins with a career-high 65
games and a career-low 2.24 goals against average.
	   P.J. Axelsson scored Boston's third goal Monday when he skated
behind the net and tucked the puck between Tommy Salo's left pad
and the post.

UN chief says envoy's mission critical
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The dispute between Iran and Afghanistan's
Taliban militia over the slaying of Iranian diplomats poses a real
threat to stability in the region, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said Monday.
	   In a report, Annan said the ongoing mission to the region by his
envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, is ``of critical importance'' to try to
bring about a settlement between the two sides.
	   ``The outcome of his efforts will depend primarily upon
determination of all parties involved, Afghan as well as their
neighbors, to reach agreement on a pragmatic and practical formula
to return Afghanistan to a stability and an appreciable degree of
normality,'' Annan wrote.
	   The U.N. chief authorized Brahimi to travel to Taliban
headquarters in southern Afghanistan on Monday as part of a tour
that has taken him to Iran and Pakistan.
	   Annan stressed that the visit was an exceptional measure since
the United Nations withdrew all its international personnel from
the country following the Aug. 21 fatal shooting of a U.N. military
adviser. The United Nations is demanding a full report from the
Taliban on the slaying of Lt. Col. Carmine Calo of Italy.
	   Annan dispatched Brahimi to the region after the Taliban
acknowledged its soldiers, acting on their own, killed several
Iranian diplomats when the militia captured the northern Afghan
city of Mazar-e-Sharif from the opposition in August.
	   Iran has deployed more than 200,000 soldiers, hundreds of tanks
and scores of jet fighters on its border with Afghanistan and has
threatened to retaliate. Tehran has demanded an apology from the
Taliban and the arrest and deportation of those who killed the
diplomats. So far the Taliban has refused both requests.
	   The Taliban has accused Iran of arming and financing the Afghan
opposition, while Pakistan is believed to be supporting the
Taliban.
	   In his report, Annan decried the failure of peace talks and
intensified fighting between the Taliban, who control roughly 90
percent of the country, and troops loyal to the opposition alliance
that includes President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was ousted from
Kabul in 1996.
	   ``The prolonged civil war in Afghanistan, itself a massive
humanitarian tragedy, is now threatening to become a regional
conflict and poses a real danger to stability in the region,''
Annan said.
	   He urged all sides respect the human rights of civilians. And he
particularly urged care for cultural relics in war zones,
particularly ancient statues of Buddha in Bamiyan.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Despite progress on the diplomatic
front, NATO was still expected to approve Tuesday the last military
step needed to launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia to get
President Slobodan Milosevic to comply with international demands
on Kosovo.
	   ``There is no reason not to sustain the military pressure,''
said a NATO official, who demanded anonymity.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke briefed the ambassadors of the 16
NATO nations on the ``emergency'' situation in Kosovo but later
declined all comment on his talks.
	   However, Holbrooke denied he was trying to make a deal with
Milosevic.
	   ``That is not the case,'' he told reporters. ``We are discussing
the situation in Kosovo in intense detail. Tomorrow morning, we'll
see President Milosevic again (in Belgrade) and we'll proceed from
there.''
	   He said his aim remained to get Milosevic to provide ``full and
effective compliance with United Nations Security Council
resolutions'' calling on him to end his crackdown on Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke talked with Milosevic in Belgrade Monday, then flew
here to brief the NATO envoys and to meet with Polish Foreign
Minister Bronislaw Geremek whose country now heads the Organization
for Security and Cooperation which he said had a ``major role'' to
play in bringing peace to Kosovo.
	   There were indications a breakthrough was near in the talks
about ending the violence in Kosovo and thus avert allied
airstrikes.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said in Moscow Monday
Milosevic had agreed to allow 1,500 international observers to
monitor compliance with U.N. demands to halt the crackdown in
Kosovo.
	   A NATO official said the alliance would proceed with plans for
airstrikes to keep the pressure on Milosevic. That would likely
include the issuance _ later Monday _ of an ``activation order'' to
put planes and other hardware to be used in airstrikes under joint
NATO command.
	   Officials said that would show NATO's resolve to end the
violence in Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and
an estimated 275,000 uprooted since February's crackdown on ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   The ``activation order'' would transfer command over airplanes
and military equipment necessary for an airstrike from national
governments to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark and
authorize its deployment over Yugoslavia.
	   From then on, Gen. Clark would no longer need any approval from
the 16 member nations and proceed only in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana, NATO officials said on condition
of anonymity.
	   NATO authorities also met with Russian representatives at NATO
headquarters Monday to keep Moscow informed on the military
preparations. Russia opposes airstrikes against Yugoslavia, a
traditional ally. Moscow has long been lobbying for a negotiated
solution and has threatened to veto any U.N. resolution calling for
airstrikes.
	   Almost all NATO members have cleared barriers to participating
in airstrikes. On Monday, the outgoing German government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was also expected to back potential NATO
airstrikes.
	   Prior to the activation order, NATO officials agreed on rules of
engagement, targeting, liaison with humanitarian organizations in
Kosovo and the safety of NATO troops in Bosnia.
	   The NATO alliance also reached common ground on a legal basis
for airstrikes over the weekend, removing uncertainty whether an
additional U.N. resolution was necessary.
	   The Americans, and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a part of the Yugoslav republic.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO poised to approve
airstrikes, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke consulted late into the
night Monday with alliance members amid reports he and Yugoslavia's
president were near a breakthrough in defusing the Kosovo crisis.
	   Holbrooke traveled to Belgium while Western nations evacuated
diplomats from Yugoslavia _ adding to the sense that a last-minute
deal was necessary to avoid the bombing of Serbian targets.
Holbrooke flew to Brussels Monday evening and went right to the
NATO complex a mile (kilometer) away.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists in
Moscow that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had agreed to
allow 1,500 international observers to monitor compliance with U.N.
demands to halt the Serb crackdown in Kosovo.
	   If true, that would represent a key last-minute concession by
Milosevic that came only hours before NATO planned to authorize the
attack against Milosevic's forces.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of Milosevic's reported
concession. In Washington, however, a Clinton administration
official said there were still divisions over the verification
issue.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was
a lot of motion in the Belgrade talks but that Milosevic still was
not in compliance with the demands laid out by the U.N. Security
Council last month.
	   A statement from Milosevic's office said Holbrooke would return
and hold more talks Tuesday.

Satellite nearing historic rendezvous and orbit of asteroid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADISON, Wisconsin (AP) _ A small satellite launched more than
two years ago is just weeks from becoming the first manmade object
to be placed into an orbit around a distant asteroid, researchers
said Monday.
	   The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous, or NEAR, spacecrafts will
fire rockets on Dec. 20 to settle into an orbit of an asteroid
called Eros that is streaking across space some 163 million miles
from Earth.
	   Andy Cheng, a Johns Hopkins University researcher and the
project scientist for NEAR, said that all instruments on the
spacecraft are working well and that the small satellite is on
target for its deep space meeting with Eros.
	   The rocket firing comes while NEAR is still distant from Eros,
and the satellite will not start orbiting the asteroid until Jan.
10, 1999.
	   During months of circling the asteroid, the craft will be slowly
lowered until its orbit is just 21 miles (34 kilometers) above the
space rock, said Cheng. The craft will give the first prolonged,
up-close look at an asteroid, which are minor planets.
	   Six instruments aboard NEAR will analyze the composition,
magnetic field and mass of the asteroid, sending the data back to
Earth by radio.
	   Eros is something of a mystery. The rock is about the size of a
mountain, 24 miles (39 kilometers) by 8 miles (13 kilometers). Its
orbit routinely carries it close to the orbit of Earth.
	   Scientists don't know if the rock is solid or if it is a highly
porous body with empty cavities or chunks of ice.
	   But it is similar to the asteroids that pounded Earth early in
the planet's history. One such asteroid smashed into Earth 65
million years ago and is thought to have caused the extinction of
the dinosaurs.
	   Like most asteroids, said Cheng, Eros probably formed early in
the history of the solar system. What isn't known is whether Eros
was once part of a bigger planet or if it formed independently.
	   ``There were many collisions in the early solar system,'' said
Cheng.
	   Sometimes huge chunks of a planet were knocked into space by
such celestial smashups and became independent bodies. The Earth's
moon is thought to come such a collision.
	   Asteroids could also form from the leftover debris of
planet-building. Bits of stray rock and dust slowly clump together
until they form a larger object.
	   The process may not be finished, said Cheng. He said there is
some concern that wandering space rocks or gravel may imperil the
NEAR.
	   As NEAR approaches Eros, researchers will use cameras and
instruments on board to search for any stray bits of rock or gravel
that are still orbiting the asteroid.
	   After months in orbit of Eros, researchers may attempt to land
the craft on the asteroid, although the spacecarft was not designed
to do that. The density of Eros is unknown, but the asteroid is so
small that its gravity force will be only a fraction of Earth's,
making landing there less violent.
	   But it would still be tricky steering the craft to a touchdown
because Eros is so far away that there is a long delay between
sending a signal and getting a response.
	   Cheng said it takes about 45 minutes for a radio signal to make
a round trip between Earth and NEAR.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Despite diplomatic progress, NATO
officials met into the early hours Tuesday to consider taking the
last military step needed to launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia
to force President Slobodan Milosevic to comply with international
demands on Kosovo.
	   ``There is no reason not to sustain the military pressure,''
said a NATO official, who demanded anonymity.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke briefed ambassadors of the 16 NATO
nations on the ``emergency'' situation in Kosovo but later declined
all comment on his talks.
	   However, Holbrooke denied he was trying to make a deal with
Milosevic.
	   ``That is not the case,'' he told reporters. ``We are discussing
the situation in Kosovo in intense detail. Tomorrow morning, we'll
see President Milosevic again (in Belgrade) and we'll proceed from
there.''
	   He said his aim remained to get Milosevic to provide ``full and
effective compliance with United Nations Security Council
resolutions'' calling on him to end his crackdown on the
secessionist province of Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke talked with Milosevic in Belgrade Monday, then flew
here to brief the NATO envoys and to meet with Polish Foreign
Minister Bronislaw Geremek, whose country now heads the
Organization for Security and Cooperation _ a body that Hobrooke
said had a ``major role'' to play in bringing peace to Kosovo.
	   There were indications a breakthrough was near in the talks
about ending the violence in Kosovo and thus avert allied
airstrikes.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said in Moscow Monday
that Milosevic had agreed to allow 1,500 international observers to
monitor compliance with U.N. demands to halt the crackdown.
	   A NATO official said the alliance would proceed with plans for
airstrikes to keep the pressure on Milosevic. That would likely
include the issuance on Tuesday of an ``activation order'' to put
planes and other hardware to be used in airstrikes under joint NATO
command.
	   Officials said that would show NATO's resolve to end the
violence in Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and
an estimated 275,000 uprooted since February's crackdown on ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   The ``activation order'' would transfer command over airplanes
and military equipment necessary for an airstrike from national
governments to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark and
authorize their deployment over Yugoslavia.
	   From then on, Gen. Clark would no longer need any approval from
the 16 member nations but could proceed only after consultation
with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, NATO officials said on
condition of anonymity.
	   NATO authorities also met with Russian representatives at NATO
headquarters Monday to keep Moscow informed on the military
preparations. Russia opposes airstrikes against Yugoslavia, a
traditional ally. Moscow has long been lobbying for a negotiated
solution and has threatened to veto any U.N. resolution calling for
airstrikes.
	   Almost all NATO members have cleared barriers to participating
in airstrikes. On Monday, the outgoing German government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was also expected to back potential NATO
airstrikes.
	   Prior to the activation order, NATO officials agreed on the
rules of engagement, targeting, liaison with humanitarian
organizations in Kosovo and the safety of NATO troops in Bosnia.
	   The NATO alliance reached common ground on a legal basis for
airstrikes over the weekend, removing uncertainty about whether an
additional U.N. resolution was necessary.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the
population of Kosovo, a province of Serbia _ the main republic of
the Yugoslav republic.

Is there a quarterback crisis in the NFL?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Tony Banks had a good game for the St. Louis
Rams and Pittsburgh's Kordell Stewart continued his climb back to
where he was last season.
	   But New York's quarterbacks regressed. Danny Kanell of the
Giants and Glenn Foley of the Jets got only one break: The Yankees
are in the playoffs, reserving the back pages and the call-in lines
for baseball.
	   That's somewhat typical in a league where half the starting
quarterbacks have three years or less of experience at No. 1 and
many backups should be third-stringers.
	   So every Sunday, we get inconsistency or worse, like the
travails of Kanell and Foley, plus the misadventures of erstwhile
third-stringers Donald Hollas for Oakland and Trent Green for
Washington.
	   Hollas, filling in for Jeff George against Ryan Leaf and the
Chargers, was 12-of-31 for 101 yards and the Raiders punted 16
times, one short of the NFL record.
	   So it was left to 39-year-old Wade Wilson to pull out a 7-6 win
for Oakland on a 68-yard TD pass to James Jett with 1:28 remaining.
By that time, Leaf was on the bench for the second time in three
weeks after going 7-of-17 for 78 yards with three interceptions.
	   Green's misfortune was symbolized by one series after an
offsides in the Winless Bowl, which his Redskins lost 17-12 to the
Philadelphia Eagles.
	   On first-and-15, Green missed a handoff to Terry Allen, followed
Allen into a hole and gained 8 yards.
	   On second down, he tripped going the other way and lost 11
yards.
	   On third down, he was sacked and fumbled, setting up
Philadelphia's first touchdown.
	   In the second half, Norv Turner replaced Green with Gus
Frerotte, who was yanked after two straight interceptions in the
opener. Frerotte gets the start in Minnesota next week.
	   Here's a telling stat:
	   After six weeks, there are 11 NFL teams two games over .500 or
better. Seven have quarterbacks 30 or older, most of them well over
30. Those seven (John Elway, Dan Marino, Steve Young, Chris
Chandler, Randall Cunningham, Troy Aikman and George) have a total
of 89 seasons of NFL experience.
	   Add Seattle's 41-year old Warren Moon and Doug Flutie of
Buffalo, who will turn 36 in 10 days; 36-year-old Bubby Brister,
who filled in admirably for Elway when he was hurt; and 32-year-old
Jason Garrett, filling in for the injured Aikman, and it sure looks
like an old guy's position.
	   The young guys on winning teams?
	   Brett Favre, Drew Bledsoe and Mark Brunell, three stars in their
prime, plus Elvis Grbac, who needs to stay healthy. The 30-year-old
George _ yes, the Raiders are 4-2 _ always had the talent, but not
the temperament.
	   Of the youngsters, Peyton Manning looks like he'll be all right.
He makes good plays and bad ones, but he's improving every week.
	   Leaf, however, has had four straight horrible games and it
doesn't help his confidence that Kevin Gilbride has been willing to
lift him.
	   So you have to hope he doesn't go the way of Kerry Collins, who
had one good year, but was halfway through a second straight bad
one, and walked out of the starting job in Carolina last week.
	   Collins could join Rick Mirer, Todd Marinovich, Kelly Stouffer
and Dan McGwire (Mark's brother), as first-round quarterbacks who
lack the talent or temperament to become NFL stars.
	   That's left teams to go with lower-round guys like Foley, Kanell
and Bobby Hoying and hope for the best.
	   As for the old guys ...
	   ``I wish I was 28 years old ... but I'm not,'' said Flutie, who
failed to make it on his first try in the NFL, then went to Canada
and starred. ``I'm getting a little smarter in my old age and a lot
more comfortable.''

Three Americans win Nobel Medicine Prize

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Nitric oxide doesn't just pollute the
air: it also saves lives and enhances men's sexual performance.
Unlocking its secrets won three American researchers the Nobel
Medicine Prize on Monday.
	   The 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 978,000) award is divided equally
between Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad, who
discovered new properties of the gas, which helped in developing
the anti-impotence drug Viagra.
	   In 1977, while at the University of Virginia, Murad was
researching how nitroglycerin _ often given to heart patients to
dilate blood vessels _ releases nitric oxide. In 1980, Furchgott
concluded that blood vessels dilate because cells in their inner
lining produce a signal molecule. Ignarro, working on his own and
with Furchgott, proved this molecule was nitric oxide.
	   The conclusions of Furchgott and Ingarro, published in 1986,
opened up a new field of medical research based on the properties
of nitric oxide, and led to studies on a wide range of new drugs.
	   ``It was a sensation that this simple common air pollutant ...
could exert important functions'' in animals and people, said the
Karolinska Institute, which awards the prize.
	   Furchgott, 82, is a pharmacologist at the State University of
New York in Brooklyn. Ignarro, 57, works at the University of
California-Los Angeles and Murad, 62, now is at the University of
Texas Medical School in Houston.
	   Furchgott, reached at his Long Island home, said ``I'm very
pleased. I truly wasn't sure I'd ever get an award like this. I
wasn't sure that I deserved it.''
	   Nitric oxide, which can ease chest pains, has been used to find
stronger and more selective drugs to treat cardiovascular
conditions.
	   Scientists are now testing to see whether the colorless gas can
be used to stop the advance of cancer because of its ability to
defend against tumors and kill infectious bacteria, fungi and
parasites.
	   Patients in intensive care often are made to inhale the gas,
which has provided ``good results and even saved lives,'' the
Karolinska Institute said.
	   It is also being used to fight bacterial infections, as well as
diagnose lung conditions, including asthma.
	   Nitric oxide can trigger erection of the penis by dilating blood
vessels. The wildly popular Viagra is based on this effect.
	   ``This is a new general principle ... which will help us to
develop lots of new medicines, for example ones that directly relax
or retain tension in muscles, as in the new impotence drug,
Viagra,'' said Hans Joernvall, professor of medical chemistry at
the Karolinska Institute.
	   The studies on nitric oxide touch on the personal life of Alfred
Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who
established the prizes in his will.
	   In later life, Nobel's physician told him to take nitroglycerin
_ one of the ingredients in dynamite _ to combat heart trouble. But
it took 100 years before science clarified that nitroglycerin acts
by releasing nitric oxide gas, the Karolinska Institute said.
	   ``This year's Nobel prize goes to the body's own
nitroglycerin,'' said Goeran Hansson, professor of experimental
cardiovascular research at Karolinska Institute.
	   The announcement is ``great news,'' said Dr. Gerald Levey, dean
of the UCLA School of Medicine. ``We were hoping he (Ignarro) would
win it. We thought he had a strong chance to win. It's well
deserved.''
	   The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be
announced this year. Last week, the literature prize went to
Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the
economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.

	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies
said Monday they had captured the strategic, government-held air
base of Kindu in eastern Congo.
	   After eight days of fighting, a rebel commander said 9,000 rebel
fighters entered the town and its air base, 80 kilometers (50
miles) southwest of Kalima, late Monday.
	   ``The whole town and the airport are in our hands,'' said Arthur
Mulunda, a rebel battalion commander.
	   The claim could not immediately be confirmed. If true, Kindu
would be the rebels' biggest prize in their two-month campaign to
topple President Laurent Kabila.
	   Kabila had turned Kindu into a launching pad for a
counter-offensive against rebel eastern strongholds.
	   Mulunda said his men had captured many government prisoners. Bob
Ngoy, another rebel commander, said 1,377 government troops had
surrendered on Monday and that 17 rebel fighters had been killed in
earlier fighting.
	   In Kalima, a rear base for the rebel attack, soldiers sang and
fired weapons in celebration.

Mars is place of violent winds and floods, researchers find
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADISON, Wisconsin (AP) _ Mars is a planet of natural violence
far greater than is known on Earth, with winds gusting to 350 mph
(560 kph) and evidence of immense floods that swamped vast areas.
	   ``Mars is a small planet that does things in a very big way,''
John Pearl of Goddard Space Flight Center said at meeting Monday of
the planetary division of the American Astronomical Society.
	   Researchers analyzing pictures taken by the Mars Observer said
that the red rock and soils of Mars are imprinted with marks of
high-speed wind storms that cover virtually a whole side of the
planet, and of waters that race out of dammed up craters at speeds
of more than 100 mph (160 kph).
	   ``The floods could have lasted for months,'' said Michael C.
Malin, a research scientist on the Mars Observer team who analyzed
one such flood. The water flow, he said, was 1,000 times greater
than floods that have struck the U.S. Midwest in recent years.
	   The waters poured out of a high crater that towers over nearby
flat plains and churned across the planet's surface, rolling huge
boulders and carving canyons in a matter of weeks. Eventually, the
water slowed and spread out into a flat basin and turned into a mud
flow.
	   Malin said the water then either evaporated into the dry Martian
atmosphere or seeped back into the soil.
	   The water may have been the result of a massive impact from an
asteroid, a mountain falling from space.
	   Malin speculated that an impact smashed far beneath the surface
and created a large crater with raised sides. Subsurface water
flowed into the crater, eventually creating a lake that he
estimated to be 1,600 feet (500 meters) deep and the size of the
state of Utah.
	   When the sides of the crater eroded away, the water was released
in one massive spill and began flowing in 300-foot-deep
(100-meter-deep) cascades traveling at about 130 mph (200 kph).
	   Satellite instruments monitoring a Martian storm and clocked
winds that raged at 360 mph (560 kph)_ almost five times stronger
than a minimum hurricane, said Pearl.
	   He said the satellite observed one storm from start to finish.
In just 36 hours, said Pearl, a small disturbance covering about 60
square miles (150 square kilometers) grew to a monster covering
more than 1,000 miles (2,500 square kilometers).
	   ``It was like a small storm that grew up to cover all of the
western United States,'' said Pearl.
	   It is the dust in the Mars atmosphere that may make its storms
so violent, he said. The suspended particles capture sunlight and
heat up rapidly, rising by about 20 degrees (10 degrees Celsius)
just after sunrise. The captured heat sets off a vortex of moving
air that grows and grows until it dwarfs an earthly hurricane.
	   Other photos have captured dust devils like those frequently
seen in deserts. These whirling disturbances suck up dust and carry
it high into the air. Though the dust devils lack great violence,
they help keep the Martian atmosphere filled with the red dust that
absorbs sunlight and helps to energize the major storms.

	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ Traditional enemies Greece and Turkey
united Monday to pressure Yugoslavia into making concessions on
Kosovo, but the two neighbors failed to make any progress on
disputes that could lead the two NATO allies to war.
	   ``We discussed our bilateral relations and found that we have
problems,'' Greek Premier Costas Simitis said after meeting Turkish
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
	   ``This is a known phenomenon in Greek-Turkish relations, and I
hope that one day we may be able to overcome these difficulties.''
	   Solving their own intractable problems is important if the two
countries hope to set an example for other leaders gathered in this
Mediterranean resort and to help some in the turbulent region
realize their own dreams of membership in the European Union and
NATO. Prime ministers from Bulgaria, Macedonia and Romania attended
the two-day summit as did the foreign minister of Albania and
observers from Bosnia and Croatia.
	   Simitis said they did not discuss the one issue now threatening
to trigger conflict between the two NATO allies: the deployment by
Greek Cypriots of Russian-made S-300 missiles on war-divided
Cyprus.
	   ``The S-300 were not discussed at all, but I referred to
Cyprus,'' Simitis added.
	   Turkey has said it will use military force to prevent
installation of the missiles, an action that Athens has said will
mean war.
	   Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in
1974, after an abortive Athens-backed coup by Greek Cypriots
seeking to unite the island with Greece. More than 30,000 troops
are based in the Turkish Cypriot breakaway state, which is
recognized only by Ankara.
	   Turkey's apparent determination to risk war with neighboring
Syria over Syria's harboring of Kurdish insurgents indicates the
hard-nosed approach the Turkish military is taking elsewhere.
	   Simitis and Yilmaz discussed longstanding disputes in the Aegean
Sea that have twice led Greece and Turkey to the brink of war in
the past 11 years. The leaders failed, however, to reach agreement
on how to solve them.
	   The two premiers did find common ground in their effort to
convince Yugoslavia to accept a request by U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke that President Slobodan Milosevic agree to an expanded
international monitoring mission in the secessionist province of
Kosovo.
	   Turkey and Greece also spent Monday pressuring Yugoslav Premier
Momir Bulatovic to accept a reference to Kosovo in their joint
statement.

Japanese upper house approves bank failure measures

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan took a big step toward ending its banking
crisis with the passage of laws that will allow the government to
take over foundering banks to fix them or shut them down.
	   The legislation, passed Monday, establishes rules for how the
government will deal with banks doomed to fail and establishes a
public institution similar to the U.S. Resolution Trust Corp.,
created during the 1980s U.S. savings and loan crisis to buy the
bad debt from banks.
	   The new laws were the first half of a broader plan to strengthen
the debt-ridden financial system.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling party has a comfortable
majority in the powerful lower house, but needs some cooperation in
the opposition-dominated upper house.
	   The package is crucial for cleaning up nearly dlrs 1 trillion in
bad loans left by the collapse in the early 1990s of runaway real
estate and stock prices.
	   It is also a key first step in Japan's efforts to overcome its
deepest recession since the end of World War II.
	   The laws passed Monday established a framework for bank bailouts
but didn't specify how much public money could be used. The ruling
Liberal Democratic Party originally proposed using about 10
trillion yen (dlrs 86 billion).
	   But through negotiations with opposition parties the total
public funds to be used will amount to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 513
billion), including 17 trillion yen (dlrs 145.3 billion) for use in
protection of depositors, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Toyoo Gyohten, a special adviser to the prime minister for
financial affairs, had said in Singapore earlier Monday that the
bailout could reach 60 trillion yen (dlrs 513 billion).
	   ``Adequate public funds will be made available,'' he said.
	   The markets took the news as a sign the country is getting
serious about fixing its financial problems.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average surged 675.04 points, or 5.24
percent, closing the day's trading at 13,555.01.
	   Japan could use a boost.
	   Bank problems have made new loans hard to get and business has
been suffering, especially small and medium-size companies.
Unemployment is at a record high, bankruptcies are soaring and
consumer spending is falling.
	   Growth shows no sign of coming back soon. The Economic Planning
Agency announced last week that the economy would shrink by 1.8
percent this year, and the head of the agency said on Sunday that
it could shrink next year as well.
	   Under the new laws, a committee will be set up to handle bank
failures. The committee will take one of three steps: nationalize
the bank temporarily through the government's purchase of its
shares; order the liquidation of the institution; or transfer the
bank's operations to a public bridge bank.
	   The laws cleared the upper house of Parliament on Monday after
passing the more powerful lower house on Oct. 2.
	   Shortly after the bills passed, politicians from the ruling and
opposition camps announced an agreement on a bank recapitalization
proposal to inject public funds into the banking system to ease the
nation's credit crunch.
	   That is expected to be approved in the lower house Tuesday and
voted into law Friday in the upper house, with the backing of the
two opposition parties, national broadcaster NHK said.
	   With Japan under pressure to turn around its economy and help
Asian neighbors, the bills are a major victory for Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi and end one phase of a fierce dispute between his
ruling party and the opposition.
	   The first test case of the new legislation will be the troubled
Long-Term Credit Bank, which has been rumored to be on the verge of
collapse since summer.
	   LTCB, one of Japan's biggest lenders, is struggling under the
weight of failed real estate loans.
	   In June, LTCB announced it was in talks to merge with Sumitomo
Trust _ a move that was widely regarded as a government-directed
bailout. But under the new legislation, the bank will be
nationalized temporarily and its bad loans will be sold, Kyodo News
agency reported.
	   The bills also abolish a 13 trillion yen (dlrs 113 billion) fund
that previously provided public money to be pumped into the banking
system to recapitalize banks.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Despite diplomatic progress, NATO met
into the early hours Tuesday to consider taking the last military
step needed to launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia to force
President Slobodan Milosevic to comply with international demands
on Kosovo.
	   After talks with the 16-nation alliance, U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke said ``some movement in Belgrade'' had improved chances
for a negotiated settlement on Kosovo, with the Organization for
Security and Cooperation playing an important role.
	   ``We think that's a very positive, potentially positive
development and we welcome it,'' Holbrooke said of OSCE involvement
in solving the Kosovo crisis. Russia and Milosevic also back this.
	   Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, whose country holds
the OSCE presidency, said the 54-nation regional security
organization could send thousands of unarmed civilians to verify a
Kosovo settlement.
	   But as long as no agreement was reached, NATO planned to keep up
the pressure, including the threat of airstrikes.
	   ``There is no reason not to sustain the military pressure,''
said a NATO official, who demanded anonymity.
	   Holbrooke denied he was trying to cut a deal with Milosevic.
``That is not the case,'' he told reporters. ``We are discussing
the situation in Kosovo in intense detail. Tomorrow morning, we'll
see President Milosevic again (in Belgrade) and we'll proceed from
there.''
	   He said his aim remained to get Milosevic to provide ``full and
effective compliance with United Nations Security Council
resolutions'' calling on him to end his crackdown on the
secessionist province of Kosovo.
	   There were indications a breakthrough was near in the talks
about ending the violence in Kosovo and thus avert allied
airstrikes.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said in Moscow Monday
that Milosevic had agreed to allow 1,500 international observers to
monitor compliance with U.N. demands to halt the crackdown. Geremek
spoke about the need for ``thousands.''

Court rules for release of Tyson psychological records
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson lost a fight Monday to keep
psychological records that could prove embarrassing to the former
heavyweight champion out of public view.
	   The Nevada Supreme Court refused to block a lower court's order
that allows the documents to be made public once they are given to
the Nevada Athletic Commission.
	   The ruling means that dozens of pages of records compiled by a
team of psychiatrists who examined Tyson last month could be made
public _ if Tyson wants to go ahead with his application to regain
his boxing license in Nevada.
	   However, there was a split among the five justices in just what
should be released. Two of the justices suggested in separate
opinions that the commission could have discretion in just what it
will release out of the records.
	   ``We've told them we want them immediately,'' said Kirk
Hendrick, a deputy attorney general, said of the records.
	   The ruling came a week before Tyson goes before state boxing
officials once again to try and get back the license they revoked
15 months ago when he bit Evander Holyfield's ears during the third
round of their aborted fight for the heavyweight title.
	   The commission had set a deadline of 5 p.m. PDT Monday (2400
GMT) to get the records if Tyson wants to keep next Monday's
hearing date. Tyson and his advisers want the hearing as soon as
possible because they want Tyson to fight a comeback fight in
December if he gets his license back.
	   Tyson's attorneys said they would comply with the commission's
deadline no matter which way the Supreme Court ruled on the issue.
	   Those close to Tyson say his wife, Monica, was the driving force
behind the attempt to block the release of the records, which could
reveal some embarrassing things about the boxer.
	   The records were compiled by psychiatrists at Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston, who examined Tyson for five days last
month at the request of the commission to see if he is
psychologically fit to return to the ring.
	   Tyson also faces one more big hurdle before the commission
meeting, one his attorneys have been working for more than a week
trying to resolve.
	   Tyson faces trial in Montgomery County, Md., the same day the
commission meets on assault charges filed by two men stemming from
an Aug. 31 traffic accident in a Washington, D.C., suburb.
	   Tyson's attorneys have been trying to negotiate a settlement
with the two men, although prosecutors in Maryland say they plan to
go ahead with the case even if a settlement is reached.
	   A quick decision on regaining his boxing license is crucial to
Tyson because the former heavyweight champion is in financial
trouble and wants to begin his comeback with a December fight in
Las Vegas that could earn him enough money to pay off a dlrs 13
million IRS lien.
	   If Tyson's relicensing is delayed even further, there would not
be enough time to put together a comeback fight by the end of the
year.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke briefed
NATO on his talks with the Yugoslav president before heading back
for Belgrade early Tuesday to try to overcome the final obstacles
to an agreement to defuse the Kosovo crisis.
	   Holbrooke traveled Monday evening to NATO headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium, while Western nations evacuated diplomats from
this Yugoslav capital _ adding to the sense that a last-minute deal
was necessary to avoid military action against targets in the Serb
republic.
	   ``We've had some movement in Belgrade in recent days and hours
and I'm going to return there to see if we can build on that,''
Holbrooke said. After two hours of talks, the American envoy told
reporters the situation is ``extremely serious'' and that no deal
had been struck with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   In Washington, a Clinton administration official said divisions
between Milosevic and Holbrooke persisted over the issue of how to
verify Yugoslav compliance with U.N. orders to halt the crackdown
in Kosovo.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
international observers need to be able to verify any commitments
that Milosevic agrees to. He refused to discuss how many monitors
Holbrooke is proposing.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists in
Moscow that Milosevic had agreed to allow 1,500 international
observers to monitor compliance with U.N. demands to halt the Serb
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province in southern
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   If true, that would represent a key last-minute concession by
Milosevic that came only hours before NATO planned to authorize the
attack against Milosevic's forces.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of Milosevic's reported
concession.
	   Holbrooke said his aim remained to get Milosevic to provide
``full and effective compliance with United Nations Security
Council resolutions'' calling on him to end his crackdown on
Kosovo.
	   Before leaving Brussels, Holbrooke met Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, whose country currently heads the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Holbrooke said the regional security organization ``has an
important and positive role to play in Kosovo and Yugoslavia.''
That could indicate that the OSCE would be responsible for the
proposed monitor force under any final agreement.
	   In the Kosovo capital of Pristina, a senior ethnic Albanian
leader, Fehmi Agani, said that if Milosevic agrees to such a force,
it ``could prove useful and provide a way out of the Kosovo crisis
without further war.'' Agani is head of the ethnic Albanian team
set up to negotiate with Belgrade authorities.
	   A U.S. source, speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated
that Holbrooke had made enough progress that he needed to update
NATO personally as its ambassadors met in Brussels to OK an
activation order _ the last formal step before airstrikes could be
launched.
	   A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an
activation order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in
Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and tens of
thousands uprooted since Feb. 28 crackdown against ethnic Albanian
rebels started.
	   The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over
Yugoslavia.
	   Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering
planes and missiles launched.
	   Sergeyev said Russia, which as Yugoslavia's ally has tried to
broker a deal that would avoid NATO intervention, was prepared to
provide planes for controlling Yugoslav airspace, and consider
participating in the monitoring force.
	   Earlier Monday, U.N. chief Kofi Annan phoned Milosevic to urge
him to comply with U.N. resolutions to end the Kosovo turmoil.
	   Milosevic responded that he was ``in the process of complying,
or trying to come into full compliance with the Security Council
resolutions,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   The United Nations has condemned massacres of ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo but has not supported airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke's mission to Brussels followed a flurry of diplomatic
evacuations by Western nations from Yugoslavia. That added to a
sense that intervention was imminent _ barring a breakthrough in
negotiations.
	   The international diplomats' mission observing events evacuated
Kosovo for neighboring Macedonia, with the Russian members the last
to depart. Sources at the American Embassy in Belgrade said all but
12 foreign staff were being evacuated to Budapest, and an embassy
statement said personnel in ``non-emergency situations'' had left.
	   Holbrooke, who has met with Milosevic seven times in the past
eight days for a total of roughly 50 hours, described his earlier
overnight meeting with Milosevic as ``intense, indeed, and at times
very heated.'' He said the standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav
president ``can only be called an emergency.''
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched against the separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army. Ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people.
	   Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the outgoing German government said it intends to
allow German warplanes to participate in any attack.
	   In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, which
could last ``several days.''
	   The U.N. Security Council demands include an immediate
cease-fire, a withdrawal of special troops in the province,
allowing refugees to return home and beginning talks with
independence-minded ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   The Pentagon was making military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission failed. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.

North Korea will continue to demand pullout of U.S. troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea says withdrawing U.S.
troops from South Korea and signing a peace treaty with the United
States should form the main agenda of upcoming Korean peace talks.
	   Both Koreas, along with the United States and China, are to
resume talks in Geneva next Tuesday to work out a durable peace on
the divided Korean Peninsula.
	   Two previous rounds of the four-party talks, also held in Geneva
in November and April, broke down over the same North Korean
demands.
	   ``The DPRK (North Korea) will not bargain away matters of
principle related to the issue of Korea's reunification which is
vital to the Korean nation,'' a spokesman for the North's Foreign
Ministry said.
	   In a report carried by the Korean Central News Agency late
Monday night, the unidentified spokesman said the two issues are
``the key to eliminating the root cause of the acute political and
military confrontation on the Korean Peninsula.''
	   U.S. and South Korean officials have indicated that the
withdrawal of American troops from South Korea can be an agenda
item but made clear that they would not agree to discuss the
signing of a peace treaty between Washington and Pyongyang.
	   About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense treaty.
	   The conclusion of a peace treaty with the United States
excluding rival South Korea is a longstanding North Korean demand.
Washington maintains that any Korean peace treaty should be signed
between the two Koreas.
	   The two divided countries have been in a technical state of war
since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty.
	   A resumption of the four-party Korean peace talks is part of a
package deal struck between the United States and North Korea in a
series of negotiations in New York last month.
	   North Korea also agreed to resume talks with the United States
to discuss terms of restricting its development and sales of
Scud-type missiles.
	   In return, the North's communist government won a U.S. pledge to

Success finally bringing Flutie respect

<TEXT>
	   ORCHARD PARK, New York (AP) _ Rob Johnson may be the Buffalo
Bills' quarterback of the future. At the RCA Dome in Indianapolis
on Sunday, Doug Flutie was the quarterback of the moment.
	   If Johnson is the franchise, Flutie is the corner store.
	   For years and years the 5-foot-10 (1.75-meter) Flutie _ every
backyard quarterback's hero _ heard the same thing: You're too
small, too small, too small.
	   Even when it wasn't worded exactly that way, that's what it
always sounded like to him. But on Sunday, the 35-year-old got a
big chance to prove he can play. And he made the most of it.
	   After Johnson, who led the team to an upset of San Francisco the
week before, was injured early against the Colts, Flutie led the
Bills (2-3) to a 31-24 victory.
	   Flutie was 23-of-28 for 213 yards and two touchdowns with no
interceptions. He also rushed for 23 yards and avoided getting
sacked.
	   As good as Flutie looked on paper, though, he looked even better
on the field. He scrambled, he ran, he passed. He made things
happen. On this day at least, nobody told Flutie he was too small
to be a quarterback in the NFL.
	   Certainly not Bills coach Wade Phillips.
	   ``Doug had an outstanding game,'' said Phillips, who noted that
on a couple of occasions when Colts quarterback Peyton Manning had
his passes batted down Flutie jokingly yelled, ``He's too short!
He's too short!''
	   The Colts found out Flutie was tall enough, thanks. He found
eight receivers including Andre Reed, who lugged his injured
shoulder into the game and made five catches. Flutie's 24-yarder to
Reed helped set up the Bills' first touchdown, a 7-yard pass to
tight end Jay Riemersma in the second quarter.
	   After stints with the Patriots and Bears and eight Canadian
Football League seasons in which he captured the league's Most
Outstanding Player award an unprecedented six times, Flutie decided
to give the NFL another try.
	   Despite the fact he led the Canadian Football League in passing
while leading Toronto to its second straight Grey Cup title in
1997, the NFL welcomed Flutie with an upturned nose.
	   The Bills acquired Johnson from Jacksonville for a first-round
draft pick, and immediately named him the starter, even though he
had started just one NFL game. Flutie, who had hoped the position
would be fought for in camp, was left to battle for the backup
spot.
	   Flutie accepted his role with a minimum of grumbling, and
waited. But not for long.
	   Johnson was knocked out in the second half of the season opener
at San Diego. Flutie, making his first NFL appearance in this
decade, threw two touchdown passes and drove the team within field
goal range only to have Steve Christie miss.

U.S. envoy briefs NATO, Milosevic concession reported

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke briefed
NATO on his talks with the Yugoslav president before heading back
for Belgrade early Tuesday to try to overcome the final obstacles
to an agreement to defuse the Kosovo crisis.
	   Holbrooke traveled Monday evening to NATO headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium, while Western nations evacuated diplomats from
the Yugoslav capital _ adding to the sense that a last-minute deal
was necessary to avoid military action against targets in Serbia,
Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   ``We've had some movement in Belgrade in recent days and hours
and I'm going to return there to see if we can build on that,''
Holbrooke said. After two hours of talks, the American envoy told
reporters the situation is ``extremely serious'' and that no deal
had been struck with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   In Washington, a Clinton administration official said divisions
between Milosevic and Holbrooke persisted over the issue of how to
verify Yugoslav compliance with U.N. orders to halt the Serb
crackdown in Kosovo.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
international observers need to be able to verify any commitments
that Milosevic agrees to. He refused to discuss how many monitors
Holbrooke is proposing.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists in
Moscow that Milosevic had agreed to allow 1,500 international
observers to monitor compliance with U.N. demands to halt the Serb
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province in southern
Serbia.
	   If true, that would represent a key last-minute concession by
Milosevic that came only hours before NATO planned to authorize the
attack against Milosevic's forces.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of Milosevic's reported
concession.
	   Holbrooke said his aim remained to get Milosevic to provide
``full and effective compliance with United Nations Security
Council resolutions'' calling on him to end his crackdown on
Kosovo.
	   Before leaving Brussels, Holbrooke met Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, whose country currently heads the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Holbrooke said the regional security organization ``has an
important and positive role to play in Kosovo and Yugoslavia.''
That could indicate that the OSCE would be responsible for the
proposed monitoring force under any final agreement.

Honduras Indian groups symbolically `execute' Columbus
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A Honduran Indian-rights group
wound up a three-month symbolic trial of Christopher Columbus
Monday by finding him guilty of crimes against humanity and
`executing' a painting of the explorer with arrows.
	   The navigator credited with discovering the Americas was found
guilty of 10 charges, including kidnapping, rape, trading slaves,
invasion, murder, torture, genocide and cultural genocide against
the Indian peoples of the hemisphere.
	   ``Columbus and his crew committed innumerable crimes against our
Indian ancestors and there is no statute of limitations on those
crimes ... He is guilty and will receive and exemplary
punishment,'' said Oswaldo Martinez, an organizer of the event.
	   About 2,000 protesters watched as four archers representing
Indian ethnic groups fired their arrows at Columbus' portrait in a
downtown Tegucigalpa square after a jury of ten academics,
activists and Indians announced their unanimous guilty verdict.
	   The trial was convened by the Committee of People's and Indian
Organizations and timed to coincide with the 506th anniversary of
Columbus' first landing in the Americas, an event celebrated in
Latin America as a holiday.
	   Columbus was `defended' by a lawyer in the proceedings.
	   The Tegucigalpa protesters demanded more government aid to
Indian groups and thorough investigations in the unsolved murders
of 43 Indian leaders in Honduras in the last six years.
	   Indians of the Chorti ethnic group continued to block tourist
entrances to the Copan ruins 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of
Tegucigalpa Monday in support of the same demands.

 &UR; ANTIGUA: Eric Clapton's addiction recovery center opens &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ A dlrs 6.5 million addiction recovery
center completely underwritten by British rock star Eric Clapton
will accept its first patient Tuesday and promises to turn away no
one who needs treatment.
	   Clapton, himself once addicted to drugs, built the 36-bed
Crossroads Centre of Antigua over the past five years. It will
offer intensive, 29-day recovery programs to people addicted to
drugs or alcohol at a cost of dlrs 9,000.
	   For those unable to pay, foundations have been formed in
Antigua, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom to offer
financial aid.
	   ``No one will be turned away,'' said administrator Anne Vance,
who for 11 years worked at the Betty Ford Center in Southern
California. It was Vance who met Clapton in 1994 in London and
eventually persuaded the singer and virtuoso guitarist to provide
the financing for the Caribbean's only such facility.
 &UR; ST. KITTS: Extradition case delayed in case of alleged drug
trafficker
	   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP) _ A magistrate on Monday adjourned
the extradition case against an accused drug trafficker who
allegedly caused a stir by threatening to kill U.S. students on
this Caribbean island.
	   The United States has been attempting to extradite Charles
``Little Nut'' Miller since 1996 to try him in Florida on drug
trafficking charges. The case took on a high profile in August when
the State Department told students at the Ross University
veterinary school that Miller had threatened to kill Americans if
he were extradited.
	   Miller denied he ever made the threat and most of the 250 U.S.
students at the school stayed on, though some left the island.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Police seek Cuban refugees who were adrift for a week
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Police in Jamaica were searching Monday
for four Cuban refugees who were part of a group of 14 who set out
in a boat for Puerto Rico but ended up on the north coast of
Jamaica instead.
	   Ten of the refugees _ three women and seven men _ were
apprehended Sunday evening after they landed near Hope Bay on the
north coast of the island after seven days at sea. The other four
remain at large.
	   Police said the refugees set out from Santiago de Cuba in a
14-foot fishing boat but drifted helplessly after their outboard
motor failed.
	   The 10 Cubans in custody were examined by medical personnel and
were in good health, according to police. Local and international
officials will consider their cases and they will be returned to
Cuba if they are not granted asylum in another country.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Despite diplomatic progress, NATO
officials met into the early hours Tuesday to consider taking the
last military step needed to launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia
to force President Slobodan Milosevic to comply with international
demands on Kosovo. U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke briefed ambassadors
of the 16 NATO nations on the ``emergency'' situation in Kosovo but
later declined comment on the meeting. There were signs a
breakthrough was near in the talks aimed at ending violence in the
secessionist Serbian province and thus avert allied airstrikes. A
NATO official said the alliance would proceed with plans for
airstrikes to keep the pressure on Milosevic. They would likely
include the issuance on Tuesday of an ``activation order'' to put
planes and other hardware to be used in such an attack under joint
NATO command. (NATO-KOSOVO)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey said Monday that Syria appeared to
have moved toward meeting its demands in a confrontation over
Kurdish rebels _ the first sign of a breakthrough in a two-week-old
crisis that has threatened war between the two neighbors. According
to Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, Syria relayed a message Monday
through Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, whose government has
been trying to mediate the crisis. Cem said the message ``indicates
that there is an effort on the Syrian side to meet the concerns
that we have raised.'' Turkey accuses Syria of sheltering and
supporting Kurd rebels responsible for cross-border attacks. Two
weeks ago, saying its patience had run out, it suggested it might
carry out an unspecified military operation. Syria denies the
accusations. (TURKEY-SYRIA)
	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies
said Monday they had captured the strategic, government-held air
base of Kindu in eastern Congo. After eight days of fighting, rebel
commander Arthur Mulunda said 9,000 rebel fighters entered the town
and its air base, 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Kalima,
late Monday. The claim could not immediately be confirmed. If true,
Kindu would be the rebels' biggest prize in their two-month
campaign to topple President Laurent Kabila. Kabila had turned
Kindu into a launching pad for a counter-offensive against rebel
eastern strongholds. Bob Ngoy, a rebel commander, said 1,377
government troops surrendered in Kindu on Monday. (CONGO)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will reject
an attempt by hard-liners in his Cabinet to restrict his freedom to
negotiate at a U.S. summit this week, an Israeli official said
Monday. He will be meeting President Bill Clinton and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat Thursday to discuss an American plan calling
for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from 13 percent of the West
Bank. Right-wing ministers Yitzhak Levy and Shaul Yahalom oppose
the withdrawal and intend to urge the cabinet Tuesday to forbid
Netanyahu to agree to it unless the Palestinians clamp down on
Islamic militants and fulfill other conditions. However an Israeli
official said Netanyahu will certainly reject the right-wing move.
``No negotiator would agree to his freedom being circumscribed in
such a way before the talks,'' the official said on condition of
anonymity. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Nitric oxide doesn't just pollute the
air: it also saves lives and enhances men's sexual performance.
Unlocking its secrets won three American researchers the Nobel
Medicine Prize on Monday. The 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 978,000)
award is divided equally between Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J.
Ignarro and Ferid Murad, who discovered new properties of the gas,
which helped in developing the anti-impotence drug Viagra. Nitric
oxide can ease chest pains and has been used to find stronger and
more selective drugs to treat cardiovascular conditions. Scientists
are now testing to see whether the colorless gas can be used to
stop the advance of cancer because of its ability to defend against
tumors and kill infectious bacteria, fungi and parasites.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Technology stocks led a sharp advance Monday,
with the Dow jumping back above 8,000 just days after threatening
to sink below its summer low of 7,400. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 101.95 points _ or by 1.3 percent _ to 8,001.47 after
peaking at midday with a gain of 185 points. The blue-chip
barometer has now bounced more than 500 points from the bottom of a
274-point slide on Thursday, hopping back above this year's
break-even point, 7,908.25. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Aerospace PLC is in merger talks with
Daimler-Benz Aerospace of Germany and other European airplane
makers, angling for a marriage that would create a giant European
defense contractor to compete with leading U.S. firms, the two
companies said Monday. In terms of size and ability to compete, the
merger would put the companies ``in the same ballpark'' with U.S.
giants Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Co., said Nick Cunningham, an
aerospace analyst for brokers Salomon Smith Barney in London. The
announcement after a year of negotiations involving the big
airplane makers and governments in Britain, France, Germany, Sweden
and Spain means a ``big bang'' merger of the British and German
companies with the French firm Aerospatiale/Matra now seems
unlikely. (BRITAIN-AEROSPACE MERGER)
	   AUBURN HILLS, Michigan (AP) _ Increased sales of profitable new
models helped Chrysler Corp. generate a 55 percent increase in
third-quarter earnings and set a company record for the period, the
automaker announced Monday. Chrysler's profit totaled dlrs 682
million, or dlrs 1.02 a diluted share, for the three months ended
Sept. 30. That compared with dlrs 441 million, or 65 cents a share,
during the third quarter of 1997. Chrysler's performance far
exceeded expectations of Wall Street analysts. The average estimate
of 15 analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. last week was 87 cents
a share. The earnings broke the previous third-quarter record of
dlrs 680 million set in 1996. (US-EARNS-CHRYSLER)
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers struggled
Monday to produce a strategy for containing the global market
crisis and prevent further outbreaks of such highly contagious
financial turmoil. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon
Brown said he was seeking EU support for strengthening
international financial institutions. Outlining what he called a
``three-point action plan,'' Brown called for a ``crisis prevention
mechanism'' to ensure greater openness in financial market so
potential dangers could be detected early. He also urged
reinforcing the International Monetary Fund so it can quickly to
tackle emerging crises and suggested enhanced supervisory
regulation of the global finance system. (EU-FINANCE)
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers dug in Monday
for what is expected to be a long battle over how to share out the
EU's dlrs 100 billion annual budget. Germany, Austria, the
Netherlands and Sweden say they pay too much into the EU's coffers
compared with what they get back in benefits, and demand the money
be divvied up more fairly. ``There is a lack of burden-sharing in
the budget,'' German Finance Minister Theo Waigel told a news
conference. ``This is something that cannot be continued under the
new system.'' Monday's day-long meeting of the 15 EU finance
ministers, was Waigel's last after almost 10 year's. He is stepping
down following the center-right government's defeat in last month's
elections. (EU-BUDGET BATTLE)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan took a big step toward ending its banking
crisis Monday with the passage of laws that will allow the
government to take over foundering banks to fix them or shut them
down. The legislation establishes rules for how the government will
deal with banks doomed to fail and establishes a public institution
similar to the U.S. Resolution Trust Corp., created during the
1980s U.S. savings and loan crisis to buy the bad debt from banks.
The new laws were the first half of a broader plan to strengthen
the debt-ridden financial system. A bill that allows the government
to pour public funds into banks to induce them to lend more was
expected to clear Parliament by the end of the week. (JAPAN-BANK

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Prince Charles is donating one of his
lithographs of Windsor Castle to benefit a hospital that treated
victims of Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist attack.
	   The signed and dated lithograph will be auctioned Wednesday in
support of County Tyrone Hospital in Omagh, where an Aug. 15 car
bomb planted by Irish Republican Army dissidents killed 29 people
and wounded 370.
	   ``This is the first time a piece of art by Prince Charles has
been auctioned anywhere in the world, so we have not placed a
reserve price on it,'' said John de Vere White, Dublin's premier
auctioneer of fine art.
	   Christie's London office has valued the lithograph at 2,000 to
3,000 British pounds (dlrs 3,400 to dlrs 5,100).
	   The heir to the British throne visited the hospital and the
bomb-ravaged town three days after the attack.

	   IRVINE, California (AP) _ The reclusive Brian Wilson belted out
``Surfin' USA'' and ``California Girls'' during a rare live
appearance.
	   The former Beach Boy joined Jimmy Buffett and his Coral Reefer
Band on Sunday night at Irvine Meadows as Buffett wrapped up his
summer tour.
	   A serious-faced Wilson, who just recorded a new CD, appeared
slightly uncomfortable and raised his arms when he got a standing
ovation.
	   Wilson, 56, lives most of the year in St. Charles, Illinois,
with his wife and twin daughters.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ A man trying to escape police survived a
110-foot (35-meter) plunge off a highway bridge into the Cuyahoga
River, but was caught when authorities followed his wet footprints.
	   The man, whose identity was not released, attacked his former
girlfriend and her new boyfriend with a baseball bat at the woman's
apartment early Sunday in the suburb of Euclid, police said.
	   When police responded, he fled in a station wagon through
downtown Cleveland and one of his tires blew out. He parked on a
bridge and leapt into the Cuyahoga River, Euclid police Detective
Mike Grida said.
	   The river at that spot is about 25 to 30 feet (8 to 9 meters)
deep. The man crawled out, leaving a trail of wet footprints.
Cleveland police tracked the suspect to a phone booth and arrested
him.
	   The man was treated for minor injuries and taken to Euclid City
Jail, police said.
	   His former girlfriend and her boyfriend sustained minor
injuries.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ A dlrs 6.5 million addiction recovery
center underwritten by British rock star Eric Clapton opens Tuesday
with promises to turn away no one who needs treatment.
	   Clapton, who himself overcame a drug and alcohol addiction in
the 1970s, built the 36-bed Crossroads Centre of Antigua over the
past five years. It will offer an intensive, 29-day recovery
program for drug and alcohol addictions at a cost of dlrs 9,000.
	   For those unable to pay, foundations have been formed in
Antigua, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom to offer
financial aid.
	   ``No one will be turned away,'' said administrator Anne Vance.
	   But there is no free ride. ``For those who cannot pay the full
fee, we will expect some kind of voluntary contribution in the form
of work after the patient has recovered,'' Vance said.
	   Clapton, who maintains a residence in Antigua on a bluff
overlooking the Atlantic not far from the center, has said he will
work directly with patients from time to time, drawing on his own
experiences.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 4-year-old Iraqi girl who came to Britain six
months ago for leukemia treatment returns home Tuesday with her
cancer in remission, doctors said.
	   Mariam Hamza ``has responded well ... and we wish to be
optimistic,'' said Ken Thompson, chief of Yorkhill Hospital, a
children's hospital in Glasgow, Scotland.
	   Mariam was brought to Britain by lawmaker George Galloway, a
left-wing member of Britain's governing Labor Party, who met her
during a visit to Iraq.
	   Galloway said he wanted to highlight the suffering of the Iraqi
people as a result of U.N. sanctions imposed in 1991 after the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which led to the Gulf War.
	   Iraqi opposition groups were outraged, saying Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein's government had plenty of money to import food and
medicine under a U.N. program that allows Iraq to sell oil to pay
for such humanitarian goods.

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Byron Dafoe, who had a career-high six shutouts
last season, stifled New York with his first of the 1998-98 season
Monday as the Boston Bruins beat the Islanders 3-0.
	   Dmitri Khristich scored his first goal of the season at 14:00 of
the opening period and Steve Heinze made it 2-0 with his second at
15:18.
	   The Islanders lost their opener Saturday 4-3 to the Pittsburgh
Penguins, who scored three goals in a 72-second stretch, starting
with 4:50 gone in the game.
	   Dafoe, who stopped 29 shots in a 3-3 season-opening tie Saturday
night against the St. Louis Blues, made 28 saves Monday, none
better than the ones with about five minutes left in the game. He
stopped Jason Dawe's point-blank shot from the slot with his left
glove, then smothered Sergei Nemchinov's rebound attempt.
 &UR; Canucks 4, Kings 2
	   In Vancouver, British Columbia, Peter Zezel scored two goals,
including the game-winner 10:48 into the third period, as the
Canucks won their season opener over the Los Angeles Kings.
	   The Kings' Yanic Perreault scored two shorthanded goals, one
short of matching an NHL record. Perreault has had a hand in all
four goals the Kings have scored in their first two games of the
season, with three goals and an assist.
	   Zezel's go-ahead goal came on the power play after the Canucks
had squandered their first seven opportunities. Set up at the
bottom of the right circle by Brad May, Zezel rifled a rising shot
that beat Kings goaltender Jamie Storr on the short side. Earlier,
Zezel had tied the game 1-1 when he deflected Todd Bertuzzi's point
shot with 5:12 left in the second period.
	   Dave Scatchard also scored for the Canucks, tying the game 2-2
when he swept in Adrian Aucoin's rebound behind a helpless Storr
1:44 into the third period. Alexander Mogilny, set up by Zezel,
rounded out the scoring with an empty-net goal.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO alliance on Tuesday finalized
plans for airstrikes against Yugoslavia, possibly as early as the
coming weekend, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said.
	   He said despite the fact U.S envoy Richard Holbrooke was making
progress in talks with Slobodan Milosevic, the allies agreed to
increase the airstrikes threat to get the Yugoslav president to
back down in Kosovo.
	   ``We have to maintain this pressure,'' Solana told a news
conference after a meeting of the NATO ambassadors.
	   At that meeting, Solana said, Holbrooke briefed the allies on
his talks with Milosevic and ``reported there had been progress ...
largely due to the pressure of the alliance'' to use the threat of
military force.
	   Solana said the allies issued an ``activation order'' formally
putting warplanes and other hardware belonging to NATO governments
under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark.
	   He said order was for both ``limited air strikes and a phased
air campaign'' against Yugoslavia.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Latin American pride has caused nations to
clash over disputed borders and even a soccer game, but Chile and
Peru are at each other's throat over a fiery liquor called Pisco.
	   The Andean neighbors both claim the colorless brandy distilled
from mashed grapes as their national drink, launching marketing
campaigns and even taking their case to international bodies to
determine who can use the name.
	   Only the brave dare say that Pisco is Chilean in Peru or
Peruvian in Chile. Both consider Pisco their own, drinking it
straight or in a tart lime cocktail called a Pisco Sour.
	   Afraid Chile was winning the Pisco war through aggressive
lobbying and production, Peru in September launched an
international marketing campaign to convince the world that Pisco
was as Peruvian as llamas and Machu Picchu.
	   Its goal is to boost its exports and have the International Wine
Association in France declare that Pisco originated in Peru, giving
it bragging rights.
	   ``Chile entered the international market ahead of us, but now
we're starting to compete with them,'' said Agnes Franco, Peru's
vice minister of industry.
	   Chile dominates international sales, exporting seven times
Peru's volume. And while Chile has almost doubled production since
1992, Peru produces what it did in 1984.
	   Feeding the rivalry is a grudge between the South American
nations from a war they fought in the late 19th century in which
Chile grabbed a part of southern Peru that Peruvians still claim.
	   Peruvians see Chilean imperialism everywhere, including in the
Pisco war.
	   Showing more business savvy than Peru, Chile patented the name
Pisco in 1931, in a move that enraged Peruvians.
	   ``Peru has a city, a port and a valley called Pisco. Pisco is
Peruvian. Chile is trying to take what is ours again,'' said
restaurant owner Isabel Alvarez.
	   Pisco was first produced in Peru's southern Pisco valley as far
back as the 16th century, made from grapes brought by the Spanish
conquerors, Peruvians argue.
	   The word ``pisco'' means ``bird'' in the Quechua language of
Peru's Inca Indians.
	   Peruvians charge that in the 1930s Chile even tried to create a
town called Pisco to back its claim, a charge denied by Chile.
	   Chile in turn argues that the name Pisco was given to the drink
by early Chilean producers who exported it through the Peruvian
port of Pisco.
	   Most Chileans see Peru's claim to Pisco as absurd since Chile
has done much more to develop and market the liquor.
	   ``Are we going to have to start offering `Booze Sour' instead of
Pisco Sour at cocktail parties now?'' said Santiago caterer Julio
Larenas.
	   In 1995, Chile petitioned the International Wine Association to
declare Pisco Chilean, but a Peruvian delegation narrowly managed
to block the motion, Peruvians producers say.
	   The wine association has yet to pronounce on which country
originated Pisco.
	   Another bone of contention between the countries is who invented
the Pisco Sour, which is made by mixing Pisco with lime juice,
sugar, ice and egg white.
	   Chilean historians say the Pisco Sour was developed in the early
1900s by American and European steamship passengers traveling
around the continent's southern tip who stopped for a layover in
the Chilean port of Coquimbo.
	   The ships stopped in Chile ``to fill up with Pisco and flamingo
girls. Gringos (foreigners) couldn't drink it so they had to mix it
as a cocktail,'' said cocktail expert George Gilder.
	   Peruvian historians contend, however, that the Pisco sour was
invented in the early 1900s by an English barman at the luxury
Maury hotel in downtown Lima when he didn't have whisky to prepare
a Whisky Sour.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marco Bassano's day started on a heavenly note.
	   ``I'm in paradise,'' the Italian tourist said, contemplating the
Sony digital camera he had just bought from a video store in Times
Square. ``It's almost half the price you'd pay for it in Europe.
What a bargain!''
	   Lured by the sheer volume of retail goods and bargain prices,
foreign visitors increasingly are going on shopping expeditions
during vacations in the United States.
	   They are spending billions of dollars at American shops and
malls for items that are more costly or less available at home,
such as CDs, car stereos, sports equipment, leather goods, designer
clothing, jeans and electronics.
	   ``As a shopping foreign tourist, I can say there's a lot more
variety, better service and it's cheaper than in other parts of the
world,'' said Bassano, a 38-year-old physician from Rome, who added
that he paid ``about 400 dollars'' for the floppy disk camera.
	   Comparatively, a Sony digital camera sells for about 1.1 million
lire (dlrs 709) in Italy and for 100,000 yen (dlrs 854) in Japan.
	   The New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau said that in
1995, the most recent year of record, 5.4 million international
visitors spent dlrs 4.7 billion in New York, the top city visited
by foreigners in the United States.
	   More than a quarter of that amount _ dlrs 1.3 billion, or an
average of dlrs 240 per person _ went for retail goods.
	   International visitors are expected to top 6 million in 1998 and
spending for consumer goods is expected to jump as well, the bureau
said.
	   Shopping is so popular that Bloomingdale's department store is
rated the third-biggest tourist attraction in New York after the
Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty.
	   Store managers and salespersons agree that the lure of bargains
can prove irresistible to foreigners.
	   At Structure, an apparel chain store across the street from the
Empire State Building, Masashi Nakamura bought two cotton shirts at
the ``buy one, get one free'' day's discount, paying dlrs 24.99 for
both.
	   ``This stuff is made in Hong Kong. It's good quality,'' the
Japanese tourist said.
	   New York has a special image because of the huge volume of
merchandise on the market and the appealing way shelves display new
goods _ many at a discount _ to attract customers, said Arsenio
Amadis, a salesman at Structure.
	   ``When it comes to chasing after bargains, this city has no
peer,'' he said, referring to the numerous promotions, sales and
clearances.
	   Economists also point to the Americans' consumer-oriented
culture and to the fact that consumer spending accounts for
two-thirds of the nation's overall economic activity.
	   For some visitors, shopping is a big winner: Bargains look more
attractive and prices for U.S.-made big-brand wares are lower than
at home.
	   ``The bargain goods in Germany are low quality,'' said Michael
Dittmer, a German tourist, as he tried on a pair of jeans retailing
for dlrs 38 at Gap, an apparel chain. ``On the other hand, brand
items like Nike or Levi's can be two times more expensive (in
Germany).''
	   Camping gear is high on the shopping list of German tourists. An
MSR (Mountain Safety Research) cooking stove that costs about dlrs
60 in the United States, retails for more than 170 marks (dlrs 100)
in Germany, German visitors say.
	   At Lord and Taylor on Fifth Avenue, discount sales abound.
	   ``Additional 25 percent off on already reduced summer fashions _
total savings up to over 65 percent,'' according to a sign in the
dresses' department. ``Shoes: take 30 percent off the ticketed
price.''
	   Though goods often carry original tags with artificially high
prices that are for ``markdowns,'' such deep discounts are often
the rule _ not the exception.
	   Customers were waiting in line to make a purchase at the ladies'
handbags counter, which in Japan, for example, can cost anywhere
from 50,000 to 100,000 yen (dlrs 427 to dlrs 854).
	   ``Foreign tourists buy (American) designer leather handbags
which are cheaper than overseas. Even the dlrs 300 handbags sell
very well,'' said Lord and Taylor saleswoman Ghislaine Nocera.
``Our clients know what they want and why they want it.''
	   For some Latin Americans, shopping gets the upper hand.
	   According to the Visitors Bureau, South Americans _ particularly
Brazilians and Chileans _ often come to the city for 3-5 days to
load up on goods.
	   Thanks to their overvalued currency, the real, traveling and
shopping abroad has become cheaper for many Brazilians, and the
United States is their favorite destination. Shopping abroad for
upscale designer labels may also be popular because they are hard
to come by in Brazil.
	   The number of Brazilians visiting New York has more than doubled
in recent years _ from 131,000 in 1993 to 333,000 in 1997,
according to bureau statistics.
	   With the vacation market booming, tour organizers across the
United States want a bigger piece of the action, and sometimes they
go in cyberspace to publicize their offers.
	   Shop New York Tours, which has an Internet Web site, promotes
tours where for dlrs 25 a day visitors are bused to selected stores
``which offer quality, value and great prices,'' manager Joshua
Kamens said.
	   And the stronger dollar is not an impediment.
	   ``Even if the exchange rates for the dollar are higher for
European, Asian and Latin American shoppers, it's still cheaper for
them to buy things in the United States. We give them better value
for their money (at a lower price),'' said salesman Steve Maverick
from Computer Warehouse in midtown Manhattan.
	   Among his customers are tourists from Kuwait, Lebanon and Saudi
Arabia, who buy cameras, computers and video recorders. Personal
organizers are particularly strong sellers.
	   According to 1996 figures, Canada topped the list of New York
visitors with slightly over 1 million visitors, followed by Britain
with 562,000; Germany, 471,000; Japan, 446,000; Brazil, 258,000;
and France, 254,000.
	   New York isn't the only shopping mecca for bargain hunters from
abroad. Los Angeles and Miami placed second and third as
destinations for non-U.S. tourists.
	   And Las Vegas, a gambling haven, is fast becoming a shopping
paradise.
	   Among the most popular destinations is The Forum Shops, a mall
that resembles an Italian piazza. Opened in 1992, it is the most
successful shopping center in the United States with more than
50,000 people visiting each day, including overseas shoppers.

<TEXT>
	   BEAVERTON, Oregon (AP) _ For years, the Nike name conjured up
heroic images of Jordan, Agassi and Tiger. The swoosh made many
people feel as if they were winners.
	   That Nike cachet has been clouded by a new image _ of Asian
workers in hot, noisy factories, stitching together shoes for as
little as 80 cents a day.
	   Suddenly, Nike doesn't seem so cool anymore. The biggest swoosh
now is the sound of falling profits.
	   ``I don't want to be a billboard for a company that would do
these things,'' said James Keady, a graduate assistant soccer coach
at St. John's in New York who quit this year rather than wear the
swoosh as part of an endorsement deal between Nike and the nation's
largest Roman Catholic university.
	   Keady is one of the most striking examples of a backlash against
Nike, which felt it necessary to confront its image problem this
summer by putting a few of the negative letters it has received on
the cover of its annual report.
	   ``Your actions so disgust me that I will never buy one of your
products again,'' read one. ``I hope my attitude proves to be
universal.''
	   Nike officials refused repeated requests to discuss the
company's image and labor practices.
	   Yet the criticism continues as Nike deals with woes such as an
Asian financial crisis and a glut of expensive merchandise that
have led to slumping sales and record losses.
	   In many ways, Nike has become a victim of its own success. Many
young people wonder what's left to like about a company that rakes
in dlrs 9.6 billion a year, grabs nearly half of the U.S. athletic
shoe market and puts the swoosh on everything from polo shirts to
basketballs.
	   ``All you have to do is walk into the student store and the
entire rack of clothing has a swoosh on it,'' said Christine
Williams, a University of North Carolina junior who led a campus
campaign last year opposing Nike labor policy after the school
signed a dlrs 7.1 million endorsement deal. ``It's gotten really
scary to me how much corporate America has gotten into our
university.''
	   The ``Just Do It'' era has given way to a ``Just Cool It''
philosophy. Nike is toning down use of the swoosh, removing it from
its corporate letterhead and most advertising nowadays, replacing
it with an understated, lower case ``nike.''
	   And Nike Chairman Phil Knight, who acknowledged he has been
described as ``the perfect corporate villain for these times,''
took direct aim at the criticism in May with plans for reforms.
	   Knight promised to raise the minimum age for workers at Nike's
contract plants in Asia to 18, improve factory air quality, allow
independent monitoring and provide free education for workers.
	   But critics said the reforms did nothing to address the main
problem _ that workers at those plants aren't paid a living wage.
	   They say U.S. companies in Asia pay workers in China and Vietnam
dlrs 1.60 a day and workers in Indonesia less than dlrs 1 when
these employees say they need dlrs 3 a day to maintain an adequate
living standard.
	   Nike officials have said the company pays the minimum wage or
the industry standard in whatever country they operate in.
	   ``These factories are sweatshops,'' said Medea Benjamin,
spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based human rights group Global
Exchange. ``They're clean, well-lighted sweatshops, but they're
still sweatshops.''
	   John Harrington, a California investment manager who oversees a
dlrs 100 million fund of socially responsible companies, faced
Knight at last month's shareholder's meeting in Memphis, Tennessee,
and suggested the company could solve its image problem by doubling
the 80 cents-a-day wages of its Indonesia workers.
	   Harrington said Nike could afford the raise by cutting dlrs 20
million out of its dlrs 1.13 billion advertising budget, or less
than 2 percent.
	   ``I think that the publicity they'd receive from that would be
tenfold,'' said Harrington, whose proposal was overwhelmingly shot
down.
	   ``If they paid living wages, I'd be telling everyone to support
them. But I just don't see it happening.''
	   In another response to critics, Nike appointed a vice president
for corporate responsibility, Maria Eitel, who told shareholders at
the annual meeting that the company plans to have an independent
monitoring program at its factories by the end of the year.
	   ``We don't believe that corporate responsibility is a separate
function that can be put into a box,'' she told shareholders. ``It
has to be integrated into everything we do at the company. It's a
company of honest, caring people who want to learn from the past,
and make the company the best it can be.''
	   Critics say that no matter how much Nike policy may change, the
company still must deal with the rich-man, poor-man image of
Knight's wealth _ estimated at dlrs 3.5 billion _ set against a
factory worker's monthly earnings of dlrs 20.
	   ``Last May, I said, 'Mr. Knight, we want to work with you, we
want to have a dialogue,' and he screamed in front of people, 'We
will never have a dialogue with you!''' Benjamin said.
	   However, she is the first to admit that critics have attacked
Nike, rather than competitors such as Reebok and Adidas, solely
because Nike is the world's biggest athletic shoe and apparel
company.
	   ``We've always had the strategy that if you can change Nike, you
change the industry,'' Benjamin said.
	   Despite all the criticism, analysts say Nike can change its
image and the brand name is more than strong enough to survive the
1,900 layoffs announced this year, when the company has earned half
as much as it did in 1997.
	   ``I have to believe that Knight and the other people at Nike
were in awe of the power of this creature they built,'' said Clay
Timon, chairman and CEO of Landor Research, a brand-consulting
company in San Francisco.
	   ``Whatever the swoosh touched turned to gold. Now the hardships
they're going through are going to make them work for it.''

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson lost a fight Monday to keep
psychological records that could prove embarrassing to the former
heavyweight champion out of public view.
	   A divided Nevada Supreme Court refused to block a lower court's
order that allows the documents to be made public once they are
given to the Nevada Athletic Commission.
	   The ruling means that dozens of pages of records compiled by a
team of psychiatrists who examined Tyson last month could be made
public _ if Tyson wants to go ahead with his application to regain
his boxing license in Nevada.
	   A spokesman for Tyson said late Monday afternoon that the boxer
was out on an errand and his attorneys were trying to find him to
sign a release for the documents. The commission had given Tyson
until 5 p.m. PDT Monday (2400 GMT) to submit the records or face
forfeiting a hearing next Monday on his license application.
	   ``We will find out shortly if and when Mike gives his OK,''
spokesman Peter Seligman said.
	   Commission executive director Marc Ratner said he was keeping
the commission deadline.
	   ``I'm waiting for them to send us the records,'' Ratner said.
``They have until 5 p.m. if they want an Oct. 19 hearing.''
	   Tyson's attorneys had previously said they would comply with the
deadline and turn over the reports even if the high court ruled
against the boxer.
	   Though the court rejected the motion to keep the records secret,
two of the five justices questioned why all the details of Tyson's
psychological tests had to be revealed.
	   ``Today's majority ruling unfairly and needlessly puts Mr. Tyson
in a dilemma: He may choose, to his great personal and financial
loss, to withdraw his application, or he must risk the
embarrassment that may result from the unlawful release of
confidential matters,'' Justice Charles Springer said in dissent.
	   But Justice Miriam Shearing, siding with the majority, said that
Tyson was seeking a privileged license to box, and that the
commission has no authority to edit the reports to keep
embarrassing details out of public view.
	   The ruling came a week before Tyson goes before state boxing
officials once again to try and get back the license they revoked
15 months ago when he bit Evander Holyfield's ears during the third
round of their aborted fight for the heavyweight title.
	   Tyson and his advisers want the hearing as soon as possible
because they want Tyson to fight a comeback fight in December if he
gets his license back.
	   Those close to Tyson say his wife, Monica, was the driving force
behind the attempt to block the release of the records, which could
reveal some embarrassing things about the boxer.
	   The records were compiled by psychiatrists at Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston, who examined Tyson for five days last
month at the request of the commission to see if he is
psychologically fit to return to the ring.
	   Tyson also faces one more big hurdle before the commission
meeting, one his attorneys have been working for more than a week
trying to resolve.
	   Tyson faces trial in Montgomery County, Maryland, the same day
the commission meets on assault charges filed by two men stemming
from an Aug. 31 traffic accident in a Washington, D.C., suburb.
	   Tyson's attorneys have been trying to negotiate a settlement
with the two men, although prosecutors in Maryland say they plan to
go ahead with the case even if a settlement is reached.
	   A quick decision on regaining his boxing license is crucial to
Tyson because the former heavyweight champion is in financial
trouble and wants to begin his comeback with a December fight in
Las Vegas that could earn him enough money to pay off a dlrs 13
million IRS lien.
	   If Tyson's re-licensing is delayed even further, there would not
be enough time to put together a comeback fight by the end of the
year.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO alliance on Tuesday made final
plans for airstrikes against Yugoslavia, possibly by the end of the
week, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said.
	   He said that despite some progress by U.S envoy Richard
Holbrooke in talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the
allies agreed to strengthen the threat of airstrikes in an effort
to force the Yugoslav president to back down in Kosovo.
	   ``We have to maintain this pressure,'' Solana told a news
conference after a meeting of the NATO ambassadors.
	   At that meeting, Solana said, Holbrooke briefed the allies on
his talks with Milosevic and ``reported there had been progress ...
largely due to the pressure of the alliance'' to use the threat of
military force.
	   Solana said the allies issued an ``activation order'' formally
putting warplanes and other hardware belonging to NATO governments
under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark.
	   He said the order was for both ``limited air strikes and a
phased air campaign'' against Yugoslavia.

	   Solana said the allies agreed airstrikes could come ``no earlier
than 96 hours from today,'' meaning the first war planes and
missiles could be heading for targets across Yugoslavia as early as
next Saturday.
	   ``We hope this will help negotiations bear fruit. I still
believe that diplomacy can succeed and that the use of military
force can be avoided,'' said Solana.
	   Holbrooke briefed the NATO envoys on what he called the
``emergency'' situation in Kosovo. He denied he tried to cut a deal
with Milosevic.
	   ``We are discussing the situation in Kosovo in intense detail.
Tomorrow morning, we'll see President Milosevic again (in Belgrade)
and we'll proceed from there,'' he told reporters.
	   He said there was ``some movement in Belgrade'' and that he said
his aim remained to get Milosevic to provide ``full and effective
compliance with United Nations Security Council resolutions''
calling on him to end his crackdown on Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke talked with Milosevic in Belgrade Monday, then flew
here to brief the NATO envoys and to meet with Polish Foreign
Minister Bronislaw Geremek whose country now heads the Organization
for Security and Cooperation.
	   Geremek said the 54-nation OSCE could send thousands of unarmed
civilians to verify a Kosovo settlement.
	   ``We think that's a very positive, potentially positive
development and we welcome it,'' Holbrooke said.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said in Moscow Monday
Milosevic had agreed to allow 1,500 international observers to
monitor compliance with U.N. demands to halt the crackdown in
Kosovo. Geremek spoke about the need for ``thousands.''
	   Officials hailed the issuance of the ``activation orders''
putting NATO effectively on a war footing as showing the alliance's
resolve to end the violence in Kosovo, where hundreds of people
have been killed and an estimated 275,000 uprooted since February's
crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   After the four-day notice period of the ``activation orders''
expires, Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark will no longer
need any approval from the 16 NATO governments and proceed only in
consultation with Solana, NATO officials said.

	   NATO authorities also met with Russian representatives at NATO
headquarters Monday to keep Moscow informed on the military
preparations. Russia opposes airstrikes against Yugoslavia, a
traditional ally. Moscow has long been lobbying for a negotiated
solution and has threatened to veto any U.N. resolution calling for
airstrikes.
	   Almost all NATO members have cleared barriers to participating
in airstrikes.
	   Prior to the activation order, NATO officials agreed on rules of
engagement, targeting, liaison with humanitarian organizations in
Kosovo and the safety of NATO troops in Bosnia.
	   The NATO alliance also reached common ground on a legal basis
for airstrikes over the weekend, removing uncertainty whether an
additional U.N. resolution was necessary.
	   The Americans, and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army. Kosovo is a 90-percent ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, a part of the Yugoslav republic.

Top Australian cricketers offered less money: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A Sydney newspaper said Tuesday that
leading Australian test cricketers who have spent a year
campaigning for more money face pay cuts this season.
	   The Daily Telegraph said the Australian Cricket Board has
reduced the contracts to its top six players _ captain Mark Taylor,
Mark and Steve Waugh, Shane Warne, Ian Healy and Glenn McGrath.
	   Last season, Australia's top six players were paid a base
contract fee of 200,000 Australian dollars (about 120,000 US dlrs).
The newspaper says that figure has been reduced to between 160,000
and 190,000 Australian dollars (between 96,000 and 114,000 US
dlrs).
	   The report said the extra money will go to domestic Sheffield
Shield players, lower-tier ACB players and the players' bargaining
agent James Erskine.
	   The report said several players, including Mark Waugh, were
angry about the move. Waugh was quoted as saying the pay cut was
``insane.''
	   ACB chief executive Malcolm Speed said he was happy with the
system and said it was put into place with the players' assistance.
	   ``What we are putting in place is exactly what has been
suggested by the players' association,'' Speed said. (djp)

Proposed price of Yankees deal depends on success
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Cablevision's proposed offer to buy the New York
Yankees would automatically increase in price if the team wins the
AL pennant or the World Series, The New York Times reported Monday.
	   ``There's so much for the division series, so much for the
league series, so much for the World Series,'' an unidentified
baseball official was quoted as saying by the newspaper. ``It's not
cumulative. There's a certain amount for each level.''
	   Cablevision, which owns the television rights to Yankees games
under a dlrs 486 million, 12-year contract that expires after the
2000 season, has offered to buy the team and let George
Steinbrenner remain in charge, perhaps for several years, perhaps
as long as he wants. Most reports say a deal would be worth dlrs
600 million to dlrs 650 million, but the Times said one official
said he heard it could be worth as much as dlrs 900 million.
	   ``It's based on having a deal, and I don't have a deal,''
Steinbrenner told the Times. ``We don't have any agreement. In the
future that may be in there, but it's not in there for this year
unless we have a deal, and we don't have a deal.''
	   Cablevision also owns Madison Square Garden, and officials have
said recently that Steinbrenner could be offered operating control
of the NBA's New York Knicks and the NHL's New York Rangers as part
of a Yankees sale.
	   Baseball officials said they had heard only second-hand about
the possible sale talks and weren't sure what Steinbrenner would do
in the end.
	   Steinbrenner led a group that purchased the Yankees from CBS
Inc. in 1973 for about dlrs 10 million. Steinbrenner and his family
own about 55 percent of the team.

Dollar rises against yen, Tokyo stocks lower in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Tuesday,
while Japanese stock prices fell on profit-taking after Monday's
rally.
	   The dollar bought 117.90 yen in early trading, up 1.18 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
117.63 yen overnight.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 252.23 points, or 1.86
percent, to 13,302.78 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Monday, the Nikkei surged 675.04 points, or 5.24 percent.
	   The dollar moved higher against the yen as traders covered
short, or oversold, dollar positions amid speculation that Japan's
central bank may further ease credit after its policy board meeting
Tuesday, dealers said.
	   Last month, the Bank of Japan lowered short-term interest rates
in an attempt to lessen a reported credit crunch among small firms
affected by the nation's recession-hit economy.
	   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices opened mixed in a
favorable reaction to an overnight rise on Wall Street, where the
Dow Jones industrial average closed Monday's trading at 8,001.47,
up 101.95, or 1.3 percent.
	   But profit-takers soon gained the upper hand, pushing the
market's main index into negative territory. The Nikkei had rallied
on Monday following the passage of legislation to revitalize
Japan's debt-ridden banking system.
	   Among Tuesday's early gainers were some banking issues, which
were bought following news that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
and two political allies agreed on a new framework for pumping
public funds into the ailing banking system to recapitalize
debt-plagued banks.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 16.49 points, or 1.61 percent, to 1,006.85. The
TOPIX closed up 40.84 points, or 4.16 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.880 percent from Monday's finish of 0.900 percent,
driving its price up to 108.20 yen from 108.01 yen.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO alliance on Tuesday gave
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic four days to comply with
international demands on Kosovo or face airstrikes as early as this
weekend. The threat appeared to be working.
	   NATO Secretary-General said the 16 member nations completed the
airstrike plan against Yugoslavia to bolster the negotiating
position of U.S envoy Richard Holbrooke, who was trying to put the
finishing touches on a peace plan for Kosovo during a new round of
talks with Milosevic on Tuesday.
	   ``I still believe diplomacy can succeed and the use of military
force can be avoided,'' Solana said at NATO headquarters early
Tuesday.
	   In Washington, Clinton administration officials said Milosevic
has already agreed to comply with U.N. demands to end his
seven-month crackdown on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians and accepted the
deployment of 2,000 monitors to ensure that he abides by his
promises.
	   Holbrooke lauded NATO's resolve to attack as a necessary stick
for forcing Milosevic to relent in Kosovo, a Serbian province where
Albanians are battling for independence. A U.S. official said
Milosevic agreed to aerial monitoring of Yugoslav compliance in
addition to the stationing of monitors on the ground.
	   The allies issued an ``activation order'' formally putting
warplanes and other hardware belonging to NATO governments under
the command of the Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark. The
order is the last military move barring actual airstrikes.
	   Solana said the allies agreed to give Milosevic a breathing
space of four days to agree on a comprehensive deal on Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke talked with Milosevic in Belgrade Monday, then flew
here to brief the NATO envoys and to meet with Polish Foreign
Minister Bronislaw Geremek whose country now heads the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Holbrooke said a monitoring force from the OSCE ``could be a
very important'' part of the Kosovo plan.
	   ``We think that's a very positive, potentially positive
development and we welcome it,'' Holbrooke said of OSCE involvement
in solving the Kosovo crisis. Russia and Milosevic also back this.
	   Geremek said the 54-nation regional security organization could
send thousands of unarmed civilians to verify a Kosovo settlement.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said in Moscow Monday
Milosevic had agreed to allow 1,500 international observers to
monitor compliance with U.N. demands to halt the crackdown in
Kosovo.
	   Officials hailed the issuance of the ``activation orders,''
which put NATO effectively on a war footing, as showing the
alliance's resolve to end the violence in Kosovo, where hundreds of
people have been killed and an estimated 275,000 uprooted since
February's crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   After the four days expires, Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K.
Clark will no longer need any approval from the 16 NATO governments
and can proceed only in consultation with Solana, NATO officials
said.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori named a new foreign
minister Monday after the last minister resigned in the middle of
talks to end a dispute with Ecuador that led to war in 1995.
	   Fernando de Trazegnies, a former head of Peru's delegation in
the peace talks, replaces Eduardo Ferrero, who resigned Oct. 2.
	   Analysts say Ferrero resigned when Fujimori decided to take over
negotiations himself, sidelining the foreign ministry and Ferrero.
	   The talks are snagged over where to draw 49 miles (78
kilometers) of unmarked border shared by Ecuador and Peru in the
forested Cordillera del Condor region.
	   Ecuador and Peru have fought wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995 _ the
last two over the disputed stretch of Andean foothills.
	   Nationalist sentiments are strong in both countries, making
territorial concessions by the leaders unacceptable back home,
analysts say.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ It's hard to paper over 50 million pesos
(dlrs 5 million), but Mexico City's opposition government can't
figure out how else paper costs could have dropped by 80 percent
since it took office nine months ago.
	   The Mexico City comptroller general's office is investigating
former government authorities suspected of rigging contracts for
paper and other supplies, the newspaper Reforma reported Monday.
	   Comisa, the company that buys supplies for the Mexico City
government, revealed that prices for paper products have dropped by
up to 80 per cent during the administration of Mayor Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party.
	   Prices for the paper used to make subway tickets alone dropped
from 46,000 pesos (dlrs 4,600) to 10,000 pesos (dlrs 1,000) a ton,
Comisa director Salvador Nava told Reforma.
	   The Cardenas administration has investigated several former city
officials of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party over
alleged corruption and embezzlement.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ With the peso collapsed and interest rates
sky-high in 1995, Mexico's Supreme Court negotiated a sweetheart
deal allowing employees to get loans at 1994 interest rates, news
media reported Monday.
	   The news reports followed a Supreme Court decision last week to
let banks charge compound interest on loans _ charging interest on
interest _ despite a debtors group's argument that the practice was
illegal.
	   It was unclear whether any of the 11 Supreme Court justices
benefited from the reported sweetheart deal. Neither the court nor
the bank were immediately available for comment.
	   News media suggested the recent ruling could have been a
conflict of interest and Xavier Gomex Coronel, head of the National
Bar of Lawyers, told the Reforma newspaper that he would call for
the justices' impeachment for failing to recuse themselves from the
bank interest case.
	   When the Mexican peso collapsed in December 1994, interest rates
jumped from about 25 percent to more than 110 percent. Many
borrowers, already unable to make payments, watched their debts
spiral further out of control.
	   ___ 
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ The United States Embassy suspended its
search Monday for a single-engine plane carrying a missionary
family from Minnesota that disappeared two weeks ago in the
Bolivian rain forests.
	   The search has ended with the plane not found, said a statement
by the World Gospel Mission. The group said it would ask for an
expanded search.
	   The plane disappeared two weeks ago Monday while flying from the
village of Yucuma on the eastern slopes of the Andes to the city of
Santa Cruz.
	   Bolivian air force and missionary planes and helicopters have
combed a densely forested area in the middle of the country, said
Ron Gouge, a member of the World Gospel Mission in Santa Cruz, 450
miles (720 kilometers) east of La Paz.
	   Aboard the missing plane were U.S. missionary and pilot John
Henry Trosen of Wadena, Minnesota.; his wife, Masako Ari Trosen,
originally from Kyoto, Japan, but now a US citizen; their children,
Isaiah Tsubasa Trosen, 3, and Sophia Hikari Trosen, 9 months;
Bolivian pastor Juan Carlos Suazo, 31; seminary student Jhonny
Mamani; and Mamani's wife, Silveria Lucia Pinto.

Lidia, oh, Lidia _ the new U.S. television cooking star
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY350 &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUGLAS J. ROWE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ From antipasti to zuppe to dolci, Lidia
Matticchio Bastianich displays her virtuosity in making the full
meal. Anyone who's eaten her food knows she's the real deal _ and
she's becoming a big deal in the nation's culinary consciousness.
	   Her weekly half-hour cooking series, ``Lidia's Italian Table,''
is premiering on U.S. public television network stations this
month. The companion cookbook already is in bookstores, and her
latest eatery, Lidia's Restaurant, will open later this month in
Kansas City, Missouri. It is her first venture outside of New York,
where she's involved in four restaurants.
	   She's even started a line of pasta sauces and a tour company
with daughter Tanya and a family friend that conducts gourmet trips
to her native Italy.
	   If all of that sounds like she should cry ``basta!'' _ enough! _
she simply explains that her full plate of activities is ``part of
my evolution,'' which began 28 years ago when she and Felice, her
husband at the time, started a restaurant.
	   ``I think my passion _ I think? I know! _ my passion for food
came really during my formative years when I spent a lot of time
with my maternal grandmother and grandfather ... .They grew
everything we ate,'' she says in the opening segment of her 26-week
series. ``So I had an opportunity to really see food from the
ground up, and understand how it grows, and to understand what
makes it what it is.''
	   In an interview at her 17-year-old flagship, Felidia's
Ristorante in Manhattan, she cited an intellectual element to her
passion, too. She has taken courses in food anthropology and the
science of food _ interests that flow from her undergraduate days
as a biology major with an eye on a career in medicine. (Until she
quit school to get married, much to her mother's displeasure). Just
a few weeks ago she came back from Oxford, where she attended a
symposium on food as art, and she returns to Italy several times a
year to learn new things.
	   ``So I accumulate a lot of knowledge and there comes, I guess, a
point when you want to share this,'' she said.
	   Even with her experience in front of the camera, she admits to a
little stage fright, which initially comes across as stiffness on
the air. But she clearly relaxes as each program unwinds, and she
weaves her cooking instructions with memories of her childhood and
anecdotes about family and friends. She loosens up so much in the
second show that she even makes a mustache out of a bay leaf as she
reminisces.
	   She was born after World War II in the Italian coastal town of
Pula on Istria, a peninsula atop the Adriatic Sea. There, her
earliest recollections of food involve her little fingers stuck in
dough, kneading bread as she stood on a stool to reach the table.
	   Her grandparents had a little trattoria, more an extension of
their kitchen than a restaurant, and whatever her grandmother
cooked that day was what everybody ate.
	   After the war, her town became part of communist Yugoslavia and
her family became refugees, eventually immigrating to the United
States in 1958.
	   In the years just before that, Lidia helped a great-aunt who
cooked for a wealthy family in Trieste, and she thinks of her as
the first semiprofessional chef she worked with.
	   Once in America, she met Felice, and they opened their first
restaurant in 1971, then a second, before starting Felidia. In
between, she had son Joseph and her daughter.
	   With her son, she co-owns two other restaurants, Becco and
Frico, and they recently collaborated with TV Food Network star
Mario Batali to open Babbo, which _ like Felidia _ has earned a
rare three-star rating from The New York Times.
	   Now 51, Lidia concedes that the path to epicurean excellence has
had its downside: mostly, the pangs of guilt she suffered while the
children were growing up as she worked 16-hour days.
	   Despite that, she's close to her children as mother as well as
business partner, and she feels life has been good to her.
	   ``I did something that I loved, and I was rewarded in many ways
for it,'' she said. ``And it's time for me to share.''

Indians protest Columbus' destruction of Mexican culture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A poet stripped off his clothing and climbed
naked on to a statue of Christopher Columbus in Mexico City on
Monday, to call attention to the ``destruction of the Mexican
culture'' sparked by the explorer's voyage to the Americas.
	   Jose Luis Chavez read a poem from atop the statue on the city's
main boulevard and called for the image to be replaced by one
honoring Moctezuma, one of the last Aztec rulers, the government
news agency Notimex reported.
	   More than 1,000 protesters, many dressed in Indian costumes,
marched down the Paseo de la Reforma boulevard on the 506th
anniversary of Columbus' landing, known as Dia de la Raza or Day of
the Race in Latin America. Dancers wearing plumed feather
headdresses performed indigenous ceremonies.
	   At the city's central Zocalo plaza, protest leaders called on
the government to respect indigenous customs and peace agreements
with Zapatista rebels who took up arms in 1994 to demand greater
rights for Indians in Chiapas state.

Japan's Nippon Life, U.S. Putnam confirm fund alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An investment trust management unit of Japan's
Nippon Life Insurance Co. and U.S.-based Putnam Investments
confirmed Tuesday they will strengthen an alliance formed in 1997
by developing an investment trust product line.
	   Nissay Asset Management Corp. and Putnam will develop the joint
product line and strengthen sales training and distribution
capabilities in the investment trust management market, they said.
	   Putnam has also pledged to take a 10 percent capital position in
Nissay Asset.
	   Putnam and Nissay Asset will prepare for a joint entry into the
Japanese market for defined contribution retirement savings
programs resembling U.S. 401(k) accounts, the two companies said.
	   Putnam and Nissay Asset formed a strategic alliance in 1997,
under which the companies have developed and marketed products for
institutional investors.

Four dead in train crash in eastern Mexico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A freight train collided head-on with a
passenger train Monday in eastern Mexico, killing four people and
injuring more than 50, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   The accident apparently was caused by an error in a track
change, the television network Televisa said.
	   The passenger train, traveling to Mexico City from the Gulf
coast port city of Veracruz, crashed into the eastbound freight
train near the community of Rio Blanco in Veracruz state about 210
kms (130 miles) east of Mexico City, Notimex said.
	   Roberto Garcia Pena, an official with Mexico's government-owned
National Railways _ which operated the passenger train _ said the
number of injured could increase as rescue efforts continued,
Notimex reported.
	   The four people killed have not been identified, he said.

Armed with NATO order, Holbrooke meets to overcome final obstacles
</HEADLINE>
to Kosovo deal &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with Milosevic's agreement to comply
with UN demands, NATO activation order. &QL; 
 &UR; By VESELIN TOSHKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Armed with a NATO order moving the
alliance closer to launching airstrikes against Yugoslavia, U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke is trying to overcome the last obstacles to
an agreement with the Yugoslav president to defuse the Kosovo
crisis.
	   The threat of military attack appears to be working. Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed Monday to comply with U.N.
demands to end his seven-month repression of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians.
	   In New York, U.S. President Bill Clinton said late Monday that
Milosevic had agreed to allow a ``robust'' team of international
inspectors _ monitoring both by land and air _ to see that Serb
troops pull back, that refugees be allowed to return to their
homes, and that other conditions of the U.N. Security Council be
met.
	   Holbrooke was returning to the Yugoslav capital on Tuesday after
NATO gave Milosevic a 96-hour deadline to comply with the U.N.
orders.
	   The 16-nation alliance took the decision after Holbrooke flew to
NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to brief ambassadors on his
talks with Milosevic.
	   Before heading back to Belgrade, Holbrooke told reporters
``we've had some movement ... in recent days and hours'' and that
he was returning ``to see if we can build on that.''
	   Shortly afterward, Clinton said that the NATO alliance had
agreed to delay military air strikes for four days to allow time
for international inspectors to verify that Milosevic has fully met
his commitments on withdrawing forces from Kosovo and initiating
peace negotiations.
	   ``Commitments are not compliance,'' Clinton said in an impromptu
statement after a campaign fund-raising event. ``Balkan graveyards
are filled with President Milosevic's broken promises.''
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said there would be about
2,000 inspectors.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Ninety percent of its 2 million people are ethnic Albanians, many
of whom want to secede. The Serbs, however, consider Kosovo part of
their historic heartland.
	   In Brussels, Holbrooke met with Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, whose country currently heads the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Diplomatic sources have suggested the OSCE, headquartered in
Vienna, Austria, could oversee the observer mission.
	   In the Kosovo capital of Pristina, a senior ethnic Albanian
leader, Fehmi Agani, said that an observer force ``could prove
useful and provide a way out of the Kosovo crisis without further
war.'' Agani is head of the ethnic Albanian team set up to
negotiate with Belgrade authorities.
	   As Holbrooke was returning to Belgrade, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana announced the alliance had issued an ``activation
order'' placing military resources on a war footing.
	   ``We have to maintain this pressure,'' Solana told a news
conference.
	   Solana said the order formally places warplanes and other
military hardware under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander
Wesley K. Clark. He said order was for both ``limited air strikes
and a phased air campaign'' against Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic launched the crackdown on Feb. 28 against the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is battling for independence for Kosovo.
	   The United States and the Europeans oppose the KLA's goal of
independence, fearing it would fuel calls for a ``Greater Albania''
uniting ethnic Albanian communities in other countries of the
southern Balkans.
	   Although the KLA has opposed a negotiated settlement short of
full independence, the Serbs have beaten the guerrillas in recent
fighting.
	   Diplomats hope that if the crackdown ends, most Albanians will
eventually support autonomy within the Yugoslav federation rather
than independence.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A freight train collided head-on with a
passenger train Monday in eastern Mexico, killing four people and
injuring 48, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   The accident apparently was caused by an error in a track
change, the television network Televisa said.
	   The passenger train, traveling to Mexico City from the Gulf
coast port city of Veracruz, crashed into the eastbound freight
train near the community of Rio Blanco in Veracruz state about 210
kms (130 miles) east of Mexico City, Notimex said.
	   The four people killed were all train crewmen, the
government-owned train company, National Railways, said in a
statement.

Mars is place of violent winds and floods, researchers find

<TEXT>
	   MADISON, Wisconsin (AP) _ Mars is a planet of natural violence
far greater than is known on Earth, with winds gusting to 350 mph
(560 kph) and evidence of immense floods that swamped vast areas.
	   ``Mars is a small planet that does things in a very big way,''
John Pearl of Goddard Space Flight Center said at meeting Monday of
the planetary division of the American Astronomical Society.
	   Researchers analyzing pictures taken by the Mars Observer said
that the red rock and soils of Mars are imprinted with marks of
high-speed wind storms that cover virtually a whole side of the
planet, and of waters that race out of dammed up craters at speeds
of more than 100 mph (160 kph).
	   ``The floods could have lasted for months,'' said Michael C.
Malin, a research scientist on the Mars Observer team who analyzed
one such flood. The water flow, he said, was 1,000 times greater
than floods that have struck the U.S. Midwest in recent years.
	   The waters poured out of a high crater that towers over nearby
flat plains and churned across the planet's surface, rolling huge
boulders and carving canyons in a matter of weeks. Eventually, the
water slowed and spread out into a flat basin and turned into a mud
flow.
	   Malin said the water then either evaporated into the dry Martian
atmosphere or seeped back into the soil.
	   The water may have been the result of a massive impact from an
asteroid, a mountain falling from space.
	   Malin speculated that an impact smashed far beneath the surface
and created a large crater with raised sides. Subsurface water
flowed into the crater, eventually creating a lake that he
estimated to be 1,600 feet (500 meters) deep and the size of the
state of Utah, or about 85,000 square miles (212,500 square
kilometers).
	   When the sides of the crater eroded away, the water was released
in one massive spill and began flowing in 300-foot-deep
(100-meter-deep) cascades traveling at about 130 mph (200 kph).
	   Satellite instruments monitoring a Martian storm and clocked
winds that raged at 360 mph (560 kph) _ almost five times stronger
than a minimum hurricane, said Pearl.
	   He said the satellite observed one storm from start to finish.
In just 36 hours, said Pearl, a small disturbance covering about 60
square miles (150 square kilometers) grew to a monster covering
more than 1,000 miles (2,500 square kilometers).
	   ``It was like a small storm that grew up to cover all of the
western United States,'' said Pearl.
	   It is the dust in the Mars atmosphere that may make its storms
so violent, he said. The suspended particles capture sunlight and
heat up rapidly, rising by about 20 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees
Celsius) just after sunrise. The captured heat sets off a vortex of
moving air that grows and grows until it dwarfs an earthly
hurricane.
	   Other photos have captured dust devils like those frequently
seen in deserts. These whirling disturbances suck up dust and carry
it high into the air.
	   Though the dust devils lack great violence, they help keep the
Martian atmosphere filled with the red dust that absorbs sunlight
and helps to energize the major storms.

Tyson attorney says report shows fighter both mentally and
</HEADLINE>
physically fit &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Tyson statement &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson's attorney said psychological exams
to be released Tuesday will show that the former heavyweight
champion is mentally and physically fit to return to the ring.
	   ``He is sound mentally, he is sound physically, and he is sound
neurologically,'' attorney Jim Jimmerson said Monday.
	   Jimmerson said a team of psychiatrists concluded in their
reports that Tyson occasionally reacts in anger, but can control
his feelings through additional counseling.
	   However, Jimmerson acknowledged that there are certain aspects
of the report that Tyson would prefer the public not see.
	   ``It is a hard-hitting report,'' Jimmerson said. ``There are
going to be things that talk about his innermost thoughts and
innermost feelings.''
	   Jimmerson said he reviewed the reports for two hours on Monday
and turned them over to the Nevada Athletic Commission at 7:57 p.m.
EDT (2357 GMT), three minutes before the deadline for next Monday's
hearing on whether Tyson will be granted a new boxing license.
	   The commission plans to release copies of the reports at 11 a.m.
EDT (1500 GMT) Tuesday.
	   Jimmerson said the reports answer ``in the affirmative'' the
five questions the commissioners asked the doctors at Massachusetts
General Hospital to answer during their five days of evaluating
Tyson.
	   The major question asked by the commission was whether the
doctors believe Tyson is mentally fit to compete without having
another incident like his biting of Evander Holyfield's ears.
	   The other questions centered around Tyson's ability to handle
stress and his current mental diagnosis.
	   ``The report is specific in noting the probability of Mr. Tyson
ever repeating what occurred last June is very remote,'' Jimmerson
said.
	   Earlier Monday, Tyson lost a fight to keep the records out of
public view.
	   A divided Nevada Supreme Court refused to block a lower court's
order that allows the documents to be made public once they are
given to the athletic commission.
	   Though the court rejected the motion to keep the records secret,
two of the five justices questioned why all the details of Tyson's
psychological tests had to be revealed.
	   ``Today's majority ruling unfairly and needlessly puts Mr. Tyson
in a dilemma: He may choose, to his great personal and financial
loss, to withdraw his application, or he must risk the
embarrassment that may result from the unlawful release of
confidential matters,'' Justice Charles Springer said in dissent.
	   But Justice Miriam Shearing, siding with the majority, said that
Tyson was seeking a privileged license to box, and that the
commission has no authority to edit the reports to keep
embarrassing details out of public view.
	   Tyson issued a statement which indicated he was not happy the
reports were released, but that he would do whatever he had to get
licensed again.
	   ``On numerous occasions I have apologized for my actions in the
ring versus Evander Holyfield,'' Tyson said. ``I am willing to do
whatever the Nevada Athletic Commission wants me to do in order to
regain my license to fight.''
	   The ruling came a week before Tyson goes before state boxing
officials once again to try and get back the license they revoked
15 months ago when he bit Holyfield's ears during the third round
of their aborted fight for the heavyweight title.
	   Tyson and his advisers want the hearing as soon as possible
because they want Tyson to have a comeback fight in December if he
gets his license back.
	   ``It will be a very interesting hearing,'' said Marc Ratner, the
commission's executive director.
	   Those close to Tyson say his wife, Monica, was the driving force
behind the attempt to block the release of the records. Jimmerson
said Tyson was still reluctant to have them released, but
understood he needed to if he wanted to fight by the end of the
year.
	   Tyson has one more big hurdle before the commission meeting, one
his attorneys have been working for more than a week trying to
resolve.
	   Tyson faces trial in Montgomery County, Maryland, the same day
the commission meets on assault charges filed by two men stemming
from an Aug. 31 traffic accident in a Washington, D.C., suburb.
	   A quick decision on regaining his boxing license is crucial to
Tyson because the former heavyweight champion is in financial
trouble and wants to begin his comeback with a December fight in
Las Vegas that could earn him enough money to pay off a dlrs 13
million IRS lien.
	   The fight would likely be Dec. 5 against an opponent in the top
10 in at least one of the three major boxing organizations.
	   If Tyson's re-licensing is delayed even further, there would not
be enough time to put together a comeback fight by the end of the
year.

US could lose vote in General Assembly if Congress doesn't approve
</HEADLINE>
money &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States could lose its vote in
the General Assembly if Congress doesn't approve close to dlrs 200
million in U.N. payments as part of the budget being debated in
Washington, officials say.
	   U.S. lawmakers agreed Monday to give themselves two more days to
try to wrangle out an agreement. Still being debated was the final
amount to be paid to the U.N. regular and peacekeeping budgets.
	   Washington would automatically lose its vote in the 185-member
assembly Dec. 31 if lawmakers don't come up with the money.
	   While the U.S. Security Council vote isn't affected, loss of the
assembly vote would cost Washington considerable influence,
particularly as it tries to make the United Nations more efficient.
	   Washington had made reform of the world body conditional upon
its paying its bills. U.N. member states, however, are growing
increasingly frustrated that their reform efforts aren't being
matched by U.S. cash _ and increasingly reluctant to follow through
with Washington's demands as a result, diplomats say.
	   ``The issue is reform and restoring U.S. credibility,'' said
Steven Dimoff, vice president of the United Nations Association of
the United States of America, a U.N. advocacy group.
	   Richard Sklar, the deputy U.S. ambassador responsible for reform
and management, said he was optimistic Congress would approve an
estimated dlrs 197 million, which would allow the United States to
keep its vote.
	   ``I'm anticipating a passage of an appropriations bill that ...
will pass and this problem will not be with us this fall,'' he said
in an interview Monday.
	   The dlrs 197 million, coupled with an estimated dlrs 150 million
that has been authorized and is expected to be paid before Dec. 31,
would bring Washington just over the threshold necessary to keep
the vote, according to top U.N. financial official, Joseph E.
Connor.
	   The money comes from payment of current U.N. assessments.
	   Still unresolved, however, is the issue of what the United
Nations estimates is the dlrs 1.3 billion in arrears owed by the
United States. A bill that would authorize dlrs 819 million of the
payments has yet to be sent to the White House, U.S. officials say.
	   But even if it escapes a presidential veto, the bill contains so
many conditions that settlement of the past U.N. dues seems
unlikely, said Dimoff. As a result, the threat of a loss of vote
will return next year, and the year after unless Washington gets
its payments up to date, he said.
	   Washington isn't the only one threatened, however. The United
Nations too, is suffering from the lost money _ an estimated dlrs
2.5 million in unpaid dues.
	   Because of the shortfall, the United Nations has found itself
borrowing more an more from a fund for peacekeeping costs, which
then makes it indebted to member states who contribute to the fund.
	   ``The financial state of the United Nations is precarious,''
Connor told a recent U.N. budget committee meeting, adding the
shortfall threatened the United Nations' ability to simply do its
job.

Nobel Prize goes for blood vessel work that helped lead to Viagra

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Three Americans won the Nobel Prize in medicine
for discovering that the body uses nitric oxide gas to make blood
vessels relax and widen _ a finding that helped lead to Viagra and
could also pay off in treatments for heart disease.
	   In addition, it has triggered research that could lead to new
treatments for cancer and septic shock.
	   The prize, announced Monday in Sweden, went to Robert F.
Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Dr. Ferid Murad. Furchgott, 82, is
a pharmacologist at the State University of New York Health Science
Center at Brooklyn; Ignarro, 57, is at the University of California
at Los Angeles; and Murad, 62, is at the University of Texas
Medical School in Houston.
	   They will split the dlrs 978,000 prize.
	   Cells in the body make nitric oxide, which, paradoxically, is
also an air pollutant in auto exhaust. It is different from nitrous
oxide, better known as laughing gas. The researchers discovered
that the body's own nitric oxide acts as a signal, telling blood
vessels to dilate. That, in turn, lowers blood pressure.
	   The work already has inspired a treatment for dangerously high
blood pressure in the lungs of infants. Babies breathe the gas.
	   ``Now, finally this discovery can be put to use in treatment of
numerous pathologies,'' said Ignarro, who was reached in Naples,
Italy. ``The future of pharmacology is in the creation of a
superaspirin that will be fundamental in the prevention of heart
attacks, of cardiovascular disease, of arteriosclerosis.''
	   Scientists were surprised when Furchgott and Ignarro reported
the findings in 1986. Nitric oxide was the first gas to be
identified as a signal in the body.
	   ``It was a sensation that this simple common air pollutant ...
could exert important functions'' in animals and people, said the
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which awards the prize.
	   The gas makes blood vessels dilate by relaxing the vessels'
smooth muscles. It can help trigger erection of the penis the same
way, because the relaxation lets blood flow in. Viagra was designed
to work by blocking an enzyme that interferes with nitric oxide's
effect.
	   The prize-winning work contributed ``a small piece of
information'' to the development of Viagra, said Mariann Caprino,
spokeswoman for Viagra maker Pfizer Inc.
	   Dr. Valentin Fuster, president of the American Heart
Association, called the nitric oxide discovery ``one of the most
important in the history of cardiovascular medicine.''
	   By showing the gas played an important role in the body, the
researchers set off a cascade of studies that discovered other key
things the gas does, Fuster said.
	   The wide-ranging results may pay off in new treatments for:
	   _ Atherosclerosis, a thickening of artery walls due to fatty
deposits. Nitric oxide has turned out to be one of the body's main
weapons against atherosclerosis, said Dr. Jonathan Stamler of the
Duke University Medical Center and the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute.
	   _ Septic shock, the dangerous drop in blood pressure caused by
white cells pumping out too much nitric oxide in response to
infections. Drugs that reduce the levels of active nitric oxide are
being studied in people.
	   _ Cancer. White cells use nitric oxide to defend against tumors,
and scientists are studying whether they can harness the
substance's anti-cancer ability.
	   Murad, who worked independently of the other winners, called the
Nobel announcement ``a delightful surprise.'' Furchgott, reached at
his home on New York's Long Island, said: ``I'm very pleased. I
truly wasn't sure I'd ever get an award like this. I wasn't sure
that I deserved it.''
	   Murad discovered in 1977 that nitroglycerin and related
artery-widening compounds act by releasing nitric oxide. Furchgott
later concluded that cells in the inner lining of blood vessels
secrete some unknown substance that makes vessels dilate. Ignarro,
working with Furchgott and independently, concluded this unknown
signal is nitric oxide.
	   Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite,
endowed the Nobel Prizes in his will. In later life, Nobel's doctor
told him to take nitroglycerin _ one of the ingredients in dynamite
_ for heart trouble.
	   ``However, it would take 100 years until it was clarified that
nitroglycerin acts by releasing nitric oxide gas,'' the Karolinska
Institute said.

	   If Pete Sampras finishes a record sixth consecutive year as No.
1, he could have Boris Becker to thank. Becker, who won the
CA-Trophy tournament in Vienna, Austria, two years ago, gave his
wild card to this year's tourney to Sampras for ``sporting
reasons.'' Sampras needs as many ranking points as possible if he
is to beat the record he shares with Jimmy Connors. Seven of the
top 10 players will be competing in this week in Vienna.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SELLING THE GAME &QC; 
	   The Pilot Pen men's tournament is no more. Citing financial
losses, tournament chairman Butch Buchholz said the event has been
sold to a promoter in Kitzbuhel, Austria, for dlrs 1.7 million. For
the past eight years, the tournament has served as a warm-up to the
U.S. Open. But in addition to the financial losses, the ATP Tour
planned to shuffle the dates, making it less likely to draw
big-name players. The women's tournament remains in New Haven,
Conn., where it outdrew the men's event last year.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STEFFI RETURNING &QC; 
	   Steffi Graf will make her latest comeback from injury at the
Advanta Championships in Philadelphia next month. The 29-year-old
German underwent surgery on her hand three weeks ago,just the
latest of a string of injury setbacks this year. The wrist injury
forced her to withdraw from the Filderstadt, Germany, event last
week and the Ladies Kremlin Cup in Moscow later this month.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SURFACE WORRIES &QC; 
	   Five of the world's top 10 women tennis players are due in
Moscow for the Kremlin Cup later this month, but Russia's financial
problems could keep the court from being ready. The indoor surface
is being shipped to Moscow, but the tournament says it can't afford
the import duties. ``We simply don't have the money to pay the
duties,'' said tournament general director Yakov Shakhtin.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SCHNYDER, ANNA IN CHASE &QC; 
	   A pair of teenagers, Patty Schnyder and Anna Kournikova, are the
latest qualifiers for the season-ending Chase Championships of the
Corel WTA Tour. It marks the first time either has qualified for
the event.

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Byron Dafoe, who had a career-high six shutouts
last season, stifled New York with his first of the 1998-98 season
Monday as the Boston Bruins beat the Islanders 3-0.
	   Dmitri Khristich scored his first goal of the season at 14:00 of
the opening period and Steve Heinze made it 2-0 with his second at
15:18.
	   The Islanders lost their opener Saturday 4-3 to the Pittsburgh
Penguins, who scored three goals in a 72-second stretch, starting
with 4:50 gone in the game.
	   Dafoe, who stopped 29 shots in a 3-3 season-opening tie Saturday
night against the St. Louis Blues, made 28 saves Monday, none
better than the ones with about five minutes left in the game. He
stopped Jason Dawe's point-blank shot from the slot with his left
glove, then smothered Sergei Nemchinov's rebound attempt.
 &UR; Canucks 4, Kings 2
	   In Vancouver, British Columbia, Peter Zezel scored two goals,
including the game-winner 10:48 into the third period, as the
Canucks won their season opener over the Los Angeles Kings.
	   The Kings' Yanic Perreault scored two shorthanded goals, one
short of matching an NHL record. Perreault has had a hand in all
four goals the Kings have scored in their first two games of the
season, with three goals and an assist.
	   Zezel's go-ahead goal came on the power play after the Canucks
had squandered their first seven opportunities. Set up at the
bottom of the right circle by Brad May, Zezel rifled a rising shot
that beat Kings goaltender Jamie Storr on the short side. Earlier,
Zezel had tied the game 1-1 when he deflected Todd Bertuzzi's point
shot with 5:12 left in the second period.
	   Dave Scatchard also scored for the Canucks, tying the game 2-2
when he swept in Adrian Aucoin's rebound behind a helpless Storr
1:44 into the third period. Alexander Mogilny, set up by Zezel,
rounded out the scoring with an empty-net goal.
 &UR; Blues 4, Rangers 2
	   In New York, defenseman Al MacInnis scored three straight goals
to lead the St. Louis Blues to a victory over the struggling
Rangers.
	   The Rangers are off to an 0-3-0 start and have been outscored
12-3 in those games.
	   MacInnis scored the natural hat trick during a 12-minute span in
the first period. With St. Louis on a power play, MacInnis scored
at 4:56 on a slap shot from the right point that beat Rangers
goaltender Mike Richter cleanly. At 11:49 MacInnis scored on a shot
from outside the blue line that bounced off Richter's right pad and
trickled into the net. Then at 16:48 MacInnis beat Richter with a
slap shot from the left point after Pierre Turgeon won a faceoff in
the Rangers' end.

Malaysia says foreign countries should not interfere in trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An angry Malaysia has described as
``unacceptable'' what it describes as attempts by foreign nations
to interfere in the trial of former deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim, newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   ``This is one example of interference we cannot accept,'' said
Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi in comments to local reporters
Monday evening.
	   He was referring to a report that a man claiming to be a U.S.
senator had called Justice Augustine Paul last week, the High Court
judge conducting Anwar's trial, New Straits Times newspaper said.
	   The caller told the judge that justice must be seen to be done,
the daily said. After the phone call the judge made a police
report.
	   Such phone calls were ``tantamount to interference as though we
do not understand the law and are unable to enforce the law well,''
Abdullah said.
	   There were no other details available about the reported phone
call.
	   Malaysia has repeated assurances that Anwar, who challenged
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year reign, will be given a
fair trial.
	   Anwar, a former heir-apparent to Mahathir, was fired Sept. 2,
accused of being morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over
economic policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared the deputy was a
threat to his office.
	   The court has set Nov. 2 as the date for Anwar's trial on four
counts of corruption. He will be tried separately for one more
count of corruption and five counts of illegal homosexual acts.
	   Anwar was arrested on Sept. 20 and brought to a court nine days
later badly bruised and with a black eye. He said that the police
had beaten him until he fell unconscious on his first night of
captivity.
	   His lawyers have repeatedly complained that they were being
harassed by police and even interrogated for their role as defense
attorneys. Until last week lawyers were denied access to Anwar, who
is locked in a cell at Kuala Lumpur's police headquarters.
	   Malaysia is irritated with the international outpouring of
concern for Anwar. It has grumbled about its neighbors meddling in
its internal affairs and Mahathir has specifically reacted to
reported comments by U.S. officials.
	   ``We are not beholden to them. We run our country in our own
way,'' he has said. ``If we mind our own business, it will be
better for everybody.''

Japanese oil broker sentenced to two years in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A court sentenced an influential oil broker to two
years in prison Tuesday on bribery and tax-evasion charges in a
case that shook the upper echelons of Japan's political and
business worlds.
	   Osaka-based oil wholesaler Junichi Izui, 61, was also fined 80
million yen (dlrs 683,000) by the Tokyo District Court, a court
official said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   But the court cited a lack of evidence in finding Izui innocent
of fraud charges involving alleged dubious deals with a major
Japanese oil company.
	   Izui was convicted of giving about 2.16 million yen (dlrs
18,000) in bribes in 1995 to Tsuneharu Hattori, the former
president of Japan's newest international airport near Osaka, in
exchange for a lucrative airport maintenance contract for an
acquaintance.
	   Hattori has already been convicted of receiving the bribes and
was sentenced to an 18-month prison term.
	   In testimony before a parliamentary committee last November,
Izui named three ruling party politicians, including current Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi, as among those who accepted political
contributions from him.
	   All three politicians said the donations did not violate
political fund-raising rules and denied giving any favors to Izui
in return.
	   Izui has also claimed making payments to top bureaucrats and
business leaders.
	   Two top Mitsubishi Oil officials resigned their positions last
year to take responsibility over a string of shady deals with Izui.
	   As many as 46 officials from the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry were reprimanded after they admitted to receiving free
meals or rounds of golf from Izui.

Dollar rises against yen, Tokyo stocks lower in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen at
midday Tuesday on hopes Japan's central bank may further ease
credit. Japanese stock prices fell on profit-taking after Monday's
rally.
	   The dollar bought 118.41 yen at midday, up 1.69 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 117.63
yen overnight.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 30.44 points, or 0.22
percent, to end morning trading at 13,524.57 after losing more than
250 points earlier in the session. On Monday, the Nikkei surged
675.04 points, or 5.24 percent.
	   Japanese investors bought the dollar on growing speculation the
Bank of Japan may announce a further easing of its monetary policy
after its policy board meeting later Tuesday, traders said.
	   Last month, the BOJ lowered short-term interest rates in an
attempt to lessen a reported credit crunch among small firms
affected by the nation's recession-hit economy.
	   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.
	   But the dollar failed to climb further because of selling orders
made through U.S. banks. Some traders said the sellers were U.S.
hedge funds.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices fell on profit-taking
after a big rise Monday, when the Nikkei rallied following the
passage of legislation aimed at revitalizing Japan's debt-ridden
banking system.
	   Traders said the downside for stocks was supported by the steep
overnight rise in New York and a political breakthrough on key
Japanese banking bills.
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed Monday's
trading session at 8,001.47 points, up 101.95, or 1.3 percent.
	   Among Tuesday's early gainers were some banking issues, which
were bought following news that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
and two political allies agreed on a new framework for pumping
public funds into the ailing banking system to recapitalize
debt-plagued banks.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 4.63, or 0.45 percent, to 1,018.71. The
TOPIX closed up 40.84 points, or 4.16 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.865 percent from Monday's finish of 0.900 percent,
driving its price up to 108.34 yen from 108.01 yen.

NATO gives Milosevic four days to comply or suffer airstrikes
</HEADLINE>

with U.N. demands; EDITS to conform. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO alliance on Tuesday gave
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic four days to comply with
international demands on Kosovo or face airstrikes as early as this
weekend. The threat appeared to be working.
	   NATO Secretary-General said the 16 member nations completed the
airstrike plan against Yugoslavia to bolster the negotiating
position of U.S envoy Richard Holbrooke, who was trying to put the
finishing touches on a peace plan for Kosovo during a new round of
talks with Milosevic on Tuesday.
	   ``I still believe diplomacy can succeed and the use of military
force can be avoided,'' Solana said at NATO headquarters early
Tuesday.
	   In New York, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced that
Milosevic had agreed to comply with U.N. demands to end his
seven-month repression of Kosovo Albanians. Clinton warned that any
backtracking would bring swift NATO air strikes.
	   Clinton said that Milosevic had promised to allow the
international community to verify first-hand that he was abiding by
U.N. conditions for ending the violence in Kosovo.
	   ``Commitments are not compliance,'' Clinton said in a statement
he read Monday night after a campaign fund-raising event in New
York. ``Balkan graveyards are filled with President Milosevic's
broken promises.''
	   Clinton said Milosevic had agreed to allow a ``robust'' team of
international inspectors _ monitoring both by land and air _ to see
that Serb troops pull back, that refugees be allowed to return to
their homes, and that other conditions of the U.N. Security Council
be met.
	   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the monitoring
force would number about 2,000.
	   Holbrooke lauded NATO's resolve to attack as a necessary stick
for forcing Milosevic to relent in Kosovo, a Serbian province where
Albanians are battling for independence. A U.S. official said
Milosevic agreed to aerial monitoring of Yugoslav compliance in
addition to the stationing of monitors on the ground.
	   The allies issued an ``activation order'' formally putting
warplanes and other hardware belonging to NATO governments under
the command of the Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark. The
order is the last military move barring actual airstrikes.
	   Solana said the allies agreed to give Milosevic a breathing
space of four days to agree on a comprehensive deal on Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke talked with Milosevic in Belgrade Monday, then flew
here to brief the NATO envoys and to meet with Polish Foreign
Minister Bronislaw Geremek whose country now heads the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Holbrooke said a monitoring force from the OSCE ``could be a
very important'' part of the Kosovo plan.
	   ``We think that's a very positive, potentially positive
development and we welcome it,'' Holbrooke said of OSCE involvement
in solving the Kosovo crisis. Russia and Milosevic also back this.
	   Geremek said the 54-nation regional security organization could
send thousands of unarmed civilians to verify a Kosovo settlement.
	   Officials hailed the issuance of the ``activation orders,''
which put NATO effectively on a war footing, as showing the
alliance's resolve to end the violence in Kosovo, where hundreds of
people have been killed and an estimated 275,000 uprooted since
February's crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   After the four days expires, Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K.
Clark will no longer need any approval from the 16 NATO governments
and can proceed only in consultation with Solana, NATO officials
said.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A freight train collided head-on with a
passenger train Monday in eastern Mexico, killing at least four
people and injuring more than 100, the government news agency
Notimex reported.
	   The accident was caused by human error: either a dispatcher
incorrectly directed the passenger train onto the wrong track, or
the train operators misunderstood the directions, according to Luis
Ramiro Sosa Lugo, director of the government-owned National
Trainways.
	   The passenger train, traveling to Mexico City from the Gulf
coast port city of Veracruz, crashed into the eastbound freight
train near the community of Rio Blanco in Veracruz state about 210
kms east of Mexico City, Notimex said.
	   Four train crewmen were confirmed dead and one crewman was
missing, Transportation deputy secretary Aaron Dychter said.
	   More than 100 people were injured, he said. Eighteen people
remained hospitalized Monday night, including six people with
serious injuries and two others in critical condition, he said.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Accused child molester Phillip Harold
Bell seduced young boys with gifts, used them for sex and discarded
them when they became too old for his pleasure, a Sydney court was
told Tuesday.
	   Bell, 62, is on trial charged with 38 sexual offenses involving
five boys in their early teens committed in Sydney during the mid
1980s.
	   Bell pleaded innocent Monday to all the charges.
	   Bell was arrested last December in South Africa after fleeing
Australia. An international search lasting longer than a year found
him running a surfing school at Jeffrey's Bay, on South Africa's
southern coast.
	   Bell was extradited back to Australia after spending nearly five
months in jail near Port Elizabeth.
	   In the District Court in Sydney, prosecutor Mark Tedeschi said
Bell preyed on vulnerable youths for his own sexual gratification,
using a ``monotonously similar,'' method in each case.
	   Bell allegedly enticed the boys with offers of cash for odd
jobs, showered them with gifts and privileges in return for an
escalating sexual relationship, Tedeschi said.
	   Prosecutors allege the crimes took place at breachfront and
rural properties owned by Bell and on boats in Sydney Harbor.
	   Bell set up his farm to attract young boys with offers of horse
riding, motorbikes, beach buggies, a pool table and gave presents,
including wetsuits, surfboards, clothing, motorbikes and trips, the
court was told.
	   ``This accused set up an environment at his various houses which
was a paradise for a teenage boy, except there was a heavy price to
be paid and that was to give in to his sexual demands,'' Tedeschi
said.
	   Tedeschi said Bell would keep the boys under his control by
threatening to report them to the police if they did not give in to
his sexual demands but eventually lost interest in them as they
matured.
	   ``Mr. Bell would lose interest in a boy around 16, 17 or 18 - it
was about the time the boy was achieving a degree of emotional
independence so he could see the nature of Bell's relationship with
him,'' he said.

China's exports slide in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's exports continued to slide in September,
falling 6.7 percent from the same month last year to dlrs 15.48
billion, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   Imports in September rose just 0.6 percent to dlrs 11.54
billion, Xinhua said. Total foreign trade dropped 3.7 percent to
dlrs 27.02 billion, the report said.
	   Exports from July to September slid 2.2 percent from the
year-earlier period, while imports in the third quarter remained
unchanged from the same quarter last year, Xinhua said.
	   Overall, China's exports in the first nine months of the year
rose 3.9 percent to dlrs 134.13 billion, while imports inched up
0.4 percent to dlrs 98.82 billion.
	   Weak demand from neighboring Asian countries and declines by
regional currencies have depressed China's export growth this year.
China's exports grew 21 percent during all of 1997.

Braves 7, Padres 6
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Michael Tucker and the Atlanta Braves did what
they had to do to stay alive in the NL championship series, staging
a stunning comeback against no less than Kevin Brown.
	   With the Padres just five outs away from reaching the World
Series for the first time in 14 years, manager Bruce Bochy's
strategy to bring on Braves-killer Brown blew up when Tucker hit a
go-ahead, three-run homer that sent Atlanta to a 7-6 win Monday
night in Game 5.
	   Bochy's move looked good in the seventh, when Brown came on with
a 4-2 lead, a runner on and no outs and retired the side, but now
it will be heavily questioned.
	   Tucker's homer highlighted a five-run rally in the eighth that
made it 7-4. Tucker drove in Atlanta's first five runs.
	   Pinch-hitter Greg Myers hit a two-run homer in the ninth off
Braves reliever Kerry Ligtenberg, and then Atlanta manager Bobby
Cox made his own unusual move _ bringing in four-time Cy Young
winner Greg Maddux from the bullpen.
	   Maddux, who had not relieved since 1987, closed for the first
save of his pro career.
	   Maddux struck out pinch-hitter Greg Vaughn, playing for the
first time since straining his left quadriceps in Game 1, and
retired Quilvio Veras on a grounder. After Steve Finley drew a rare
walk from Maddux, the Atlanta ace got Tony Gwynn on a game-ending
grounder.
	   The Braves still may have to beat Brown, who pitched a shutout
in Game 2, one more time. He had been scheduled to pitch Game 6
Wednesday against Tom Glavine, but the Padres might change their
rotation after Brown threw 41 pitches.
	   Either way, Atlanta already has made history. No team that
trailed a seven-game series 3-0 had ever come back to win two
games.
	   If Game 7 is needed Thursday night, Maddux is scheduled to
start.
	   Brown didn't look nearly as sharp as he did when he won 3-0 on a
three-hitter Thursday night in Atlanta. He walked Ryan Klesko
leading off the eighth and Javy Lopez reached on an infield single.
With one out, Tucker lined a 3-2 pitch over the right-field fence
to give Atlanta a 5-4 lead.
	   With the crowd of 58,988 sitting stunned, Tucker, who finished
with five RBIs, pumped his fist as he rounded first and looked at
the spot where the ball landed, as if amazed he really did it
against Brown.
	   The Braves added two more runs off reliever Donne Wall, keyed by
Tony Graffanino's double.
	   Tucker was booed when he came to bat in the ninth.
	   The Padres were nine outs from clinching the pennant Sunday
night when Atlanta rallied for six runs, capped by Andres
Galarraga's grand slam in the seventh, to win 8-3.
	   Ken Caminiti and John Vander Wal hit clutch two-out, two-run
homers off John Smoltz, whose 11 postseason wins are the most ever.
Caminiti's homer came in the first inning for a 2-0 lead and Vander
Wal's in the sixth for a 4-2 lead.
	   Smoltz came in 3-0 with two no-decisions in five postseason
starts when Atlanta faced elimination this decade. He beat Chicago
in the division series for his 11th postseason victory, the most
ever.
	   Vander Wal, acquired late in the season mainly because he hits
Braves pitchers so well, broke a 2-all tie when he homered to left
on an 0-2 pitch with two outs in the sixth.
	   Vander Wal, hitting .438 lifetime against Smoltz, made his
second start in place of Vaughn, San Diego's 50-homer man.
	   Tucker singled in the Braves' first two runs, in the fourth and
sixth innings, both off starter Andy Ashby.
	   Ashby allowed four straight one-out singles in the fourth,
including Tucker's to cut San Diego's lead to 2-1. With runners on
first and third and Smoltz bunting, the Padres pitched out on a
squeeze play and Andruw Jones in a rundown, with Ashby tagging him
out at the plate.
	   Smoltz hit a dribbler down the third-base line that Ashby and
Caminiti let roll, hoping it would go foul, but it hit the chalk
line and rolled back fair, putting runners on the corners. Ozzie
Guillen ended the threat when he flied out to center.
	   The Braves tied it at 2 in the sixth. Jones singled with two
outs and stole second. The Padres chose to pitch to Tucker with
Smoltz coming up, and he hit a tying single to center.
	   Smoltz allowed four runs and nine hits in 6 2-3 innings, struck
out eight and walked one. Ashby gave up two runs and nine hits in
six innings.

Philippines' Estrada to consult with other Asian leaders on APEC
</HEADLINE>
attendance
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada said
Tuesday he will consult with other Asian leaders before deciding
whether to attend an Asia-Pacific summit in Malaysia because of the
arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Estrada has expressed concern several times about Anwar, whom he
said he considers a friend.
	   ``I have not made my decision yet,'' he told a group of business
and political leaders in his first major overseas speech as
president. He said it is important to attend the November meeting
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Malaysia, but
that Anwar should also receive fair treatment.
	   ``I think all of us here believe that due process and human
rights should be respected,'' he said, to loud applause from the
audience.
	   Asked afterward when he will make a decision, Estrada said he
would talk first with other Asian leaders.
	   Estrada, who has been counseled by many of his advisers to
attend the APEC summit, was to leave Singapore later Tuesday for a
hastily arranged evening meeting with Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie, who has also spoken out against Anwar's arrest.
	   Anwar was fired by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on
Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policies. Anwar then
launched a nationwide campaign against Mahathir and was arrested
Sept. 20. He has appeared for court hearings with a black eye and
neck brace, and has said he was beaten by police.
	   Estrada is making is first overseas trip since taking office in
June. In his speech to the East Asia Economic Summit he said the
region's embattled economies should forge closer ties to withstand
future shocks and that they should contribute to international
efforts to forge a new world economic structure.
	   ``East Asia must be part of the effort to create a new global
financial system for the 21st century,'' he said. ``All of us, not
just a few economies, must contribute.''
	   Participants in the economic summit, sponsored by the World
Economic Forum, a private agency based in Switzerland, have
disagreed on how the region can best recover from the financial
crisis that struck 15 months ago.
	   Estrada said the world is facing uncharted territory because of
the phenomenon of massive amounts of capital moving from country to
country at electronic speed, ``bloating economies to fragile
bubbles as they rush in, and shaking economies to their foundations
as they take flight.''
