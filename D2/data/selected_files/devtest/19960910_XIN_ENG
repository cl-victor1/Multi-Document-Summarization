<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Pharmaceutical Export Going Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's pharmaceutical
export is going up, especially to African countries, said a report
issued by Pakistani Export Promotion Bureau here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that during the fiscal year 1995-1996,
Pakistan's total export of pharmaceuticals reached one million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's pharmaceutical industry which had been catering only
to local markets developed at a fast pace in recent years, it
added.
</P>
<P>
It noted that although some African countries including Zambia,
Ethiopia, Malawi, Kenya and Uganda have strict rules regarding
drug imports, the quality standards of the products maintained by
Pakistani exporters helped establish a certain credibility in
these markets.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani pharmacists will do more to raise the volume of
drug exports in the future, it said.

<HEADLINE> Ciller: Turkey Fully Respects Iraqi Territorial Integrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said here today that Turkey is
one of the leading countries to give full respect to the
territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ciller told reporters that Turkey attaches the greatest
importance to the issue of the Iraqi territorial integrity and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is seriously considering setting up a safety belt zone,
up to 10 kilometers deep into the Iraqi side of the border, to
prevent the infiltrations of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) into the Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish plan to set up a buffer zone in northern Iraq has
caused criticism from Iraq and some other Arab states as well as
the Gulf country of Iran, who considered the plan a threat to the
Iraqi territorial integrity and a violation of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi sources here told Xinhua that Turkey's plan for setting
up the safety belt zone in northern Iraq with the support of the
United States has increased pressure on the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister also said that Turkey does not
think of making preparations for occupation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey gives no permission for the PKK to infiltrate into the
Turkish border from northern Iraq, Ciller pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said Turkey is continuing its contacts with the United
States, Arab countries and officials of northern Iraq to seek
support for the setting up of the safety belt zone in northern
Iraq, and ambassadors of the Arab countries to Turkey will be
summoned to the Turkish Foreign Ministry to be given information
about the setting up of the security belt.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a guerrilla war which has claimed
over 21,000 lives in southeastern Turkey for the past 12 years.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Has No Intention to Make Military Presence in Iraq, Demirel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today assured Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that Turkey
has no intention to have a military presence in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak called Demirel to inquire about recent press reports on
the presence of Turkish troops on the Iraqi soil, according to
Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
Over the telephone, Demirel denied that his country has
occupied Iraqi lands, saying that there is not one single Turkish
soldier on the Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
Demirel told Mubarak that Turkey's military movements are
conducted to secure its borders against terrorist acts and
infiltration.
</P>
<P>
Turkey exercises its mission on the Turkish soil, he was quoted
by MENA as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the telephone call, Mubarak affirmed Egypt's insistence on
respecting Iraq's territorial integrity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The telephone call came after Egypt expressed grave concern
over Turkey's reported intention to set up a buffer zone in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Sayed el-Misri said Sunday
that Turkey's move was unjustified and considered a flagrant
violation of Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly said it plans to enforce a security zone
as wide as 20 kilometers along the mountainous border to guard
against attacks by Kurdish rebels operating from Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia First to Qualify for Tiger Cup Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia beat Burma 6-1 to
qualify for the semi-finals of the inaugural Tiger Cup soccer
tournament here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Five first-half goals, including two from striker Peri
Sandria, saw Indonesia become the first nation to enter the top
four.
</P>
<P>
Sandria's goals, in the 21st and 27th minutes settled the tone
of winning.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia now have a maximum nine points from three games,
enough to guarantee them a place in the competition's last four.
</P>
<P>
The scoring was opened as early as the seventh minute when
captain Fachiri Husani burst through the middle to slot the ball
past the dispairing Zaw Win Naing in the Burmese goal.
</P>
<P>
Sandria added the second 14 minutes later as he slipped the
ball under the prostrate keeper.
</P>
<P>
Burma pulled one back through Maung Maung Htay to spark a three
minute goal frenzy that saw the Indonesians score twice more to
put the result beyond doubt.
</P>
<P>
Once again Sandria struck, in the 27th minute, as he thundered
the ball into the roof of the net just a minute before Ansyari
Lubis scored the fourth with a shot from the edge of the penalty
area.
</P>
<P>
Laos, meanwhile, collected their fourth point of the
competition with a 1-0 win over Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The result, thanks to a Homsonbath Khonsavanh goal in the 39th
minute, means Laos still harbour very slim hopes of a semi-final
berth. However, even a win over Burma with Vietnam losing to
Indonesia on Wednesday would not be enough without an avalanche
of goals.

<HEADLINE> IBM Designs New Mainframe Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- International Business
Machines Corp. plans to unveil new mainframe computers Tuesday
that would be cheaper to buy and to operate, the Wall Street
Journal said today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe IBM will sell more than 2 billion U.S. dollars
of them over the next six months alone.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper said, IBM's revenue from its mainframe unit
is likely to drop this year, continuing a slide that began in
1992. Its mainframe revenue now is half what it was six years ago.
</P>
<P>
The computer giant also faces a dilemma: though mainframe
shipments have increased to record levels, prices for the
multimillion dollar computers have been dropping even faster.
However, the big machines, together with associated hardware,
software and services, still account for more than half of IBM's
overall profit, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Models due out Tuesday are the third generation in a redesigned
series IBM launched in 1994, it said. They cost the company less
to make because they use PC-like chips instead of customized
circuit boards. And they cut the customers cost to operate because
they consume less power and don't require the elaborate
water-cooling systems of older models to dissipate heat, according
to the report.

MOSCOW, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Olympic swimming
champion Alexander Popov said Monday he plans to resume training
in Australia as soon as he recovers from being stabbed in the
stomach in a fight, it was reported by a local report here today.
</P>
<P>
Popov, who won two gold and two silver Olympic medals this year
in Atlanta, trains at the Australian Institute of Sport in
Canberra.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old swimmer was on his way home from a birthday
party in Moscow with a group of friends Aug. 24 when they got into
an argument with watermelon vendors.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Popov was stabbed with a knife that

rushed to hospital, from which he was discharged on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said he was going to his home city of Volgograd in southern
Russia to attend a ceremony in honor of his Olympic triumph, and
then on to visit his parents who live in the Urals.
</P>
<P>
``I am not sure I'll accept the International Olympic
Committee's invitation to go to Switzerland for rehabilitation,
perhaps my grandmother can fix me up at home with her herbal
medicines,'' Popov was quoted as saying.

reasons," said presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.

He said that France agrees to the policy of independence and

has succeeded in going through a period of transition and has
established stable relations with its neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Further Cut Foreign Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government will
further cut its foreign aid by 225 million U.S. dollars over the
next two years beginning next April.
</P>
<P>
That will bring Canada's foreign aid budget in 1998-99 to 1.42
billion dollars or 0.27 percent of the country's gross national
product -- the lowest since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
And it will be 29 percent down from just two years ago,
according to a local media report.
</P>
<P>
The government is still in the process of deciding which
countries and programs to be hit by the next fall of the axe.
</P>
<P>
According to Canada's foreign aid agency -- the Canadian
International Development Agency, the government has been advised
that reducing global poverty should be the central mission of its
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Later this month, Canadian Minister for International
Cooperation Pierre Pettigrew is expected to outline Canada's aid
strategy, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish, Egyptian FMs Exchange Views on Buffer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller today held a telephone
converation with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to exchange
views on the Turkish plan to set up a buffer zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the Turkish Foreign Ministry said that Ciller
told Moussa about Turkey's plan to set up a "temporary" safety
belt zone in northern Iraq, stressing that so far there exists no
Turkish troops in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel had a
telephone conversation with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak
on the Turkish plan.
</P>
<P>
Demirel assured Mubarak that Turkey has no intention to have a
military presence in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president affirmed Egypt's insistence on
respecting the Iraqi territorial integrity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is seriously considering setting up a safety belt
zone, up to 10 kilometers deep into the Iraqi side of the border,
to prevent infiltrations of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) into the Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish plan to set up a buffer zone in northern Iraq has
caused concern and criticism from Iraq and some other Arab state
as well as the Gulf state of Iran, who considered the plan a
threat to the Iraqi territorial integrity and sovereignty and a
violation of the U.N. Charter.

<HEADLINE> Synthetic Hormones May Reduce Male Fertility: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Synthetic hormones, mainly the
female hormone oestrogen and the male hormone androgen, may be to
blame for the near 50 percent drop in the male fertility rate in
the west in the past 50 years, a study published today claimed.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted data published by the Center for the Study
of the Conservation of Ovum and Human Sperm as saying that the
fertility rate among the male population in western countries has
been falling by one to two percent annually.
</P>
<P>
A group of Danish scientists said in 1992 that the average male
had some 66 million sperm per milliliter of semen in 1990,
compared with 113 million in 1940.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have blamed numerous factors for the fall, including
tight jeans, psychiatric stress, medical and nuclear radiation,
environmental pollution and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
However, their attention is now focused on chemical products
released by men and women into environment, especially
chemically-produced hormones.
</P>
<P>
Injecting large doses of synthetic hormones into guinea pigs in
laboratories led to a fall in their fertility rate, although not
complete sterility. But it is not known to what extent small
doses of such chemicals can cause a drop in fertility.
</P>
<P>
A group of British doctors recently carried out research on
five young couples where the husband suffered from oligospermia,
or low sperm count, and found that the husbands had all been on
anabolic steroids for months, if not years, to improve their
physical appearance and sports performance.
</P>
<P>
Once they stopped taking the steroids and other "mysterious
drinks" offered by their sports coaches, their sperm count
recovered and their wives got pregnant.
</P>
<P>
However, this theory on the danger posed by artificial hormones
has been rejected by some scientists who feared it could push
forward the global trend of blaming chemical science for
environmental and natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Laszlo, a chemical professor at the prestigious Ecole
Polytechnique in Paris, joined a study on the effects of organic
chlorination at the American National Laboratory in Brookhaven in
1992. This group of scientists says that nature itself shelters
extremely harmful substances which can cause cancer and many other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
They claim that the "balance sheet" of modern chemistry is
overall positive, and "one cannot have butter, the money from
butter and the smile of the dairy queen at the same time."

DHAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina said here today that the armed forces as a national
institution should be kept above all unwanted interference.
</P>
<P>
Addressing members of the armed forces in Bogra cantonment in
the northwest of the country, the prime minister made pledges that
her government would not allow the armed forces to be used in
party politics.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that the armed forces have to be kept aloof
from all political influences in the interest of giving an
institutional shape to all of their activities and
administration," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"My government is pledge-bound to build up modern,
well-trained, disciplined and well-equipped armed forces" so that
the armed forces can stand beside the people for national
reconstruction, Hasina said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to train up our armed forces as a national wealth and
not on party line," she said.
</P>
<P>
On May 20 this year, a group of troops of the Bogra cantonment
staged a foiled mutiny following the forced retirement of three
senior army officers, who were allegedly involved in the country's
politics.

WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today admitted that his country is helping Americans and "those
who have worked with us" to flee Iraq as fighting between warring
Kurdish factions in northern Iraq is continuing.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing everything we think we can to help anyone who
needs to be out of Iraq," Clinton told reporters after an Oval
office ceremony concerning aviation safety.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported today that the Iraqi troops'
recent takeover of the Kurdish city of Irbil had broken up a
long-standing CIA-funded covert operation to destabilize the Iraqi
government.
</P>
<P>
A handful of American CIA officers who had been covertly
stationed in a suburb of Irbil fled on August 30 before the Iraqi
capture of the city.
</P>
<P>
Clinton warned Kurdish forces fighting in the region that
"there should not be any cavalier killing of civilians and others
who are not combatants in this."

<HEADLINE> Coffee Consumption Up in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece, a country with a
population of only 10 million, drank some 6.5 billion cups of
coffee last year, spending a total of 75 billion drachmas (326
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Executives in the coffee sector estimated that the coffee
market grew 10 percent last year over 1994, while the
corresponding increase in prices amounted to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to market research, most of this money -- some 34.5
billion drachmas (150 million dollars) -- was spent on Greek
coffee.
</P>
<P>
Instant coffee was next most popular, with sales totaling 33
billion drachmas (140 million dollars), while filter coffee lagged
behind at 7.5 billion drachmas (32.6 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
About half of the Greek coffee sold was standardized, packaged
powder, while the rest was sold through the 3,500-strong network
of Greece's coffee vendors.
</P>
<P>
Some 380,000 60-kg sacks of raw coffee were imported from South
America in 1995, mainly from Brazil, Colombia and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
But Greece also exports considerable amounts of packaged
coffee, mainly to countries such as Australia, Germany and the
United States, where large numbers of ethnic Greeks live.
</P>
<P>
Advertising costs for Greek coffee sales and packaging
enterprises totaled 4.5 billion drachmas (about 20 million
dollars) in 1995, indicating a 25.87 percent increase over
spending in 1994, as competition escalated.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Steps up Privatization of Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
today urged private investment in the formerly state-run but
cash-stricken telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Minister of Information, Posts and
Telecommunications, Joyce Mujuru, when opening a three-day
telecommunications conference here today.
</P>
<P>
With a population of about 10.5 million, Zimbabwe had a
telephone density of only 1.5 telephones per 100 people, which
was far below its target of 30 telephones per 100 people, said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
In March, the Zimbabwean government commercialized the
previously state-run Posts and Telecommunications Corporation to
make it a share-holding company.
</P>
<P>
And the ongoing conference, held for the first time in
Zimbabwe, is to discuss the legislation governing
telecommunications in the country, international trends and the
introduction of cellular telephones.

The Hague, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met here today with Bert de Vries, president
of the Social and Economic Council of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Li said Sino-Dutch trade and economic cooperation has been
constantly expanded in recent years and the Netherlands and China
have become major trading partners to each other.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, huge potentials are yet to be tapped in
bilateral trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the CPPCC and the SEC of the Netherlands have
enjoyed years of friendly exchanges and the CPPCC treasures such
ties.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC hopes its friendly exchanges with the SEC of the
Netherlands will push forward the growth of bilateral cooperation
in various fields and enhance the friendship and understanding
between the people of the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said that a closer cooperation and more frequent exchanges
between the CPPCC and the SEC of the Netherlands will make a fresh
contribution to the trade and economic cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
De Vries said that his council is strongly interested in
furthering its ties with the CPPCC and believes their cooperation
is very important and has been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
A closer cooperation and more exchanges between them are in
line with both their shared interests and their common wishes.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Assist Economic Reform of Low-Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) is expected to put forward a new program aimed at
assisting the economic reforms of the low-income member
countries.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said in its latest survey released here today that
such assistance could involve channeling funds through its
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), which provides
concessionary loans to member countries implementing the
IMF-backed market reforms.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said it was exploring "a mixture of options, including
the sale of a limited amount of its gold, to keep the ESAF
continuously operational."
</P>
<P>
It said the program was expected to become self-financing in
the year 2005 but would face an interim period between 2000 and
2004 when it should raise "bridging" resources.
</P>
<P>
And together with the World Bank, the IMF would also address
the unsustainable debt-service burden of a number of heavily
indebted low-income countries.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PA Fail to Agree on Hebron Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli and Palestinian
Steering Committee for the implementation of the interim agreement
held its first session today in the West Bank town of Jericho, but
failed to reach an agreement on the Israeli army's redeployment in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported this evening that the Israeli and
Palestinian officials had agreed at today's meeting of the
committee that the redeployment in the West Bank town will take
place, but with a few modifications.
</P>
<P>
However, Saeb Erekat, head of the Palestinian team, later
denied this report, and told Xinhua that the Palestinian side
"will not even want to hear the word of modification."
</P>
<P>
Erekat stressed to Xinhua that the redeployment should be
implemented according to the interim agreement signed by the
previous Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority (PA) to
expand Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Moshe Fogel, Israeli government spokesman for the
steering committee, told Israel Radio that Israel intends to
redeploy its army from Hebron after certain modifications are
made in the interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is an understanding (between Israel and the
Palestinians) that modifications have to be made because of
necessary security authorizations," Fogel said.
</P>
<P>
Fogel stressed that "there is a realization on both sides that
these modifications are designed to move forward the peace
process, and not to hinder it."
</P>
<P>
Following today's meeting, head of the Israeli team Dan
Shomron noted that this is the first time that the two sides had
actually discussed the "procedural matters, and how to implement
the interim agreement to the satisfactions of both sides."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Erekat told reporters after the 3-hour meeting that
the two sides have a mandate to ensure the interim agreement be
implemented, adding that several sub-committees had been set up
at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed a full range of issues," said Erekat, "It is
agreed between us that we will focus on the issues of Hebron
redeployment, the closure and security related issues including
the Gaza airport."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that today's meeting will pave the way
for the implementation of the interim agreement and the
continuation of the peace process, which will "allow both the
Palestinians and Israelis see the implementations on the ground."
</P>
<P>
According to the interim agreement, also known as Oslo 2, the
Israeli army was originally supposed to pull back from
approximately 80 percent of Hebron by March 28.
</P>
<P>
However, following a series of suicide bombing attacks in
Israel in February and March which left over 60 people dead and
more than 100 wounded, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres delayed
the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In May, the former Israeli government announced that the
army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after the May
29 general elections, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu
in the elections, said afterward that he would leave the decision
of the redeployment to the new prime minister and his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a
place of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Muslims alike,
and tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and
their wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram
al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood
after the 1967 war, during which Israel took over the town from
the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 200,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts
of the city.

CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian government has called on the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other petroleum
producing countries to form a comprehensive plan to guarantee oil
price, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Mahmoud Shawkat, adviser to Minister of Oil Hamdy
al-Banbi was quoted by today's English-language newspaper The
Egyptian Gazette as saying that economic and social development
plans in many countries are linked to oil revenues and this
increases the importance of coordinating among petroleum-producing
nations.
</P>
<P>
He expected oil prices to drop during the winter months as a
result of the high demand for oil during the recent period after
the escalation of tension in the Gulf region and the U.S. missile
attacks on Iraq last week.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's credit rating has been reapproved in the
international markets A and A3 by credit rating companies Moodys
Investors Service and Standard and Poors, the Jerusalem Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The companies Sunday informed Treasury Accountant General Shai
Talmon of their rating decision. The announcement came two days
before the government issues on the Eurobonds are scheduled to be
underwritten at a ceremony in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The ratings are crucial in Israel's attempt to raise funds
abroad. The decisions by Moodys and Standard and Poors were
welcomed as "a voice of confidence" by the Finance Ministry,
which hopes to sell up to 250 million U.S. dollars worth of bonds
by the end of this year. This is the first part of a three-year
bid to raise 750 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has said that
Egypt's economic reform policy has started to reap its fruit.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published today by the weekly newspaper Mayo,
the mouthpiece of the ruling National Democratic Party, Mubarak
said that 18 new cities have been set up thanks to the economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of citizens are now working and living in these
cities, he told the paper.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 15 years, 2.2 million housing units have been
constructed compared to 750,000 units built from 1952 to 1981,
Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Egypt has built more than 39,000 kilometers of
roads connecting the farthest point in the western part of the
country to the south.
</P>
<P>
Great achievements have also been made in the sectors of
electricity, telecommunication and public transport, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has been invited to take part in the 27th
exhibition of agricultural machines, which will be held in Italy
on November 9-13, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government has stressed the importance of Egypt's
participation in the fair as Egypt is an important market for the
Italian products, according to the Italian embassy in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Italy is the third country in the world in producing
agricultural machines after the United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan and Israel today signed an agreement on tourism
to boost their cooperation and intensify efforts to solve problems
facing the tourism sector in both countries.

The agreement was signed by Jordan's Minister of Tourism and
Antiquities Saleh Irsheidat and his Israeli counterpart
Moshe Katsav, who arrived here earlier today as head of a
tourism delegation on a brief visit to the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two countries are to review
bilateral tourism cooperation since the signing of the Jordanian-
Israeli peace treaty in October 1994.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Miners to Sell Gold for Hard Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's mining industry
today welcomed the decision by the Central Bank to purchase all
locally-produced gold in foreign currency, saying this will spur
producers to increase output.
</P>
<P>
Roy Pitchford, president of the Chamber of Mines, said the
reserve ban of Zimbabwe's decision would place gold production in
its rightful position as one of country's premier exports.
</P>
<P>
"This is a positive move and for the first time, gold miners
will be treated like other exporters in the country who are
allowed to sell their products in foreign currency," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the decision was overdue considering that gold is
the country's second premier export earner after tobacco.
</P>
<P>
And the Central Bank will pay for all gold purchases in
foreign currency as part of its efforts to further liberalize the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's gold output in 1995 exceeded 23 tonnes for the
first time in five decades and is expected to produce 25 tonnes
in 1996.

The gunmen were angry at the doctors and nurses, saying that
their fellow militiamen had been mal-treated at the hospital.
Witnesses said the gunmen had earlier brought one of their

GENEVA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Federal Bureau for
Statistics said today that the average life expectancy for the
Swiss men is 74.19 years at present, and for the women, 81.05

The Bureau predicted that the increase in life expectancy of

difference will draw closer.

<P>
One hundred years ago, the average life expectancy for the men
in the country was 40.64 years, and for women, 43.24 years.

<HEADLINE> SACU Concerned About S.Africa's Deal With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's partners
in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) were concerned about
the impact of any agreement reached between South Africa and the
European Union (EU), Botswanan Vice-president Festus Mogae said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference of southern African and European
parliamentarians in Cape Town, Mogae, also Botswana's finance
minister, said EU rules did not allow other SACU countries to act
as observers during its trade negotiations with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said: "We, we, while of course wishing to be informed,
are...not asking to be part of the negotiations. We accept that
our relations with the EU are covered adequately under the Lome
convention."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mogae also highlighted the possible negative
impact on government revenues, the implications for SACU's
continued access to EU markets after the expiry of the current
Lome convention and the possible diversion of investment away
from other SACU countries to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
There were also worries about the possible deterioration of
the competitiveness of goods manufactured in Botswana, Lesotho,
Namibia and Swaziland in the southern African market as a result
of South Africa importing goods duty-free from EU countries.
</P>
<P>
SACU comprises Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South-Africa and
Swaziland.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition Opens on Japan's Wartime Use of Poison Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A seven-day exhibition on the
use of poison gas by the Japanese Imperial Army in China between
1937 and 1945 opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition's organizers say they want to tell Japanese
people the truth about the military use of poison gas in China,
since "chemical weapons left behind in China by Japan at the end
of the war are still posing problems."
</P>
<P>
The event was organized by a civic group called Shinjuku Action
Committee on Poison Gas and shows photographs, gas masks and other
objects showing the wartime use of chemical and nerve agents by
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will later be taken to Hiroshima, Kagoshima and
other cities in Japan, said Noboru Watanabe, the group's leader.
</P>
<P>
Chinese researchers estimate that Japan used chemical weapons
more than 2,000 times in China during the war of aggression
between 1937 and 1945, killing and injuring more than 94,000
Chinese, many of them civilians.
</P>
<P>
Bu Ping, a scholar from China's northern Heilongjiang province,
said at the opening ceremony of the exhibition that it is an
undeniable historical fact that Japan waged germ warfare in China
in violation of international conventions.
</P>
<P>
Japan will never achieve mutual understanding and real
reconciliation with other Asian nations unless it has a proper
view of history and tells young Japanese the truth, Bu said.
</P>
<P>
After sending teams of experts to investigate the problem,
Japan has confirmed some 700,000 unused shells were left by the
Japanese army in China's northeastern Jilin province alone.

<HEADLINE> Over Half Canadians Believe in Extraterritorial Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Nearly three-quarters of
Canadians embrace the idea of intelligent life elsewhere in the
universe, a new poll said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight percent of those surveyed said they believe there
is definitely intelligent life elsewhere, while another 42 percent
said they think it is probably true.
</P>
<P>
More than half of Canadians said it is at least somewhat likely
that Earth has been visited by intelligent life from another
planet, and 43 percent expect aliens to arrive within their
lifetime, according to the Southam News-Angus Reid survey.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 1,051 Canadian adults, done late last month, is
considered accurate to within 2.5 percentage points, today's
Ottawa Citizen newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of those convinced we have otherworldly cousins
ranged from highs of 38 percent in the province of Alberta and 33
percent in British Columbia to a low of 18 percent in Manitoba and
Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 35 percent of men, compared with 22
percent of women, definitely believes in extraterritorial life.
Younger and middle-aged people were also more likely to accept the
idea.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of those without a high-school diploma believed
it was very likely that Earth had been visited by interplanetary
travelers. Only 12 percent of university-educated people felt the
same way.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia to Cut Airline Ticket Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia is planning
to reduce its airline tickets rates to Europe and the U.S. by 30
to 40 percent starting mid-September.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in reaction to the rate cuts announced
recently by British and French airlines.
</P>
<P>
British Airlines last week slashed its ticket rate from Riyadh
and Jeddah to London and other airports in Europe by 40 percent
for the first class and 30 percent for the economy class.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Arabian English daily Arab News reported Monday that
Saudi Arabia would make the official announcement next week. The
daily arrived here today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted airline sources as saying that "it came as
operational and business strategy aimed at improving its services
and to be able to compete favorably with other companies with a
view to maximize profit."
</P>
<P>
The new decision comes only two months after Saud Airline
raised its air rates for some of its international routes by 5 to
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the new plan was a practical move in face of the
stiff competition from other airlines worldwide.

SHANGHAI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Newly affluent farmers in
rural Shanghai are spending their newly found fortunes on culture
and computers.
</P>
<P>
Many have already equipped their homes with luxuries such as
large-screen color TV sets, sound systems and LD players.
</P>
<P>
Now the rural residents in China's biggest economic and
financial center are spending more on their own self-improvement.
</P>
<P>
Computers and musical instruments are emerging as popular
purchases for villagers, to help them and their children aspire
for more knowledge and enhanced their artistic talents.
</P>
<P>
Spending on books, technical and artistic training programs,
and performances has also risen.
</P>
<P>
Rural people's expenditure on the items in the past year
increased 19 percent over the previous twelve months, according to
the local statistics bureau; and it grew 20 percent in the first
half of this year, compared with the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Bookstores and stands, as well as libraries are flourishing in
the countryside, while newspaper and magazine circulations have
risen.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 farmers have taken advanced studies in farming
techniques, and 40,000 of them have obtained certificates. And
many others are going on to higher education facilities to learn
more techniques at their own expense.
</P>
<P>
The farmers are also becoming more aware of the importance of
art, and how it can improve a person's life.
</P>
<P>
A shop on Chongming Island at the mouth of Yangtze river has
for the first time offered pianos for sale on the island, selling
12 within one month.
</P>
<P>
While in Baoshan county to the north of the downtown area,
local farmers have become very enthusiastic about attending art
training programs, and thousands of them have become members of
folk art organizations.
</P>
<P>
A collecting fever has also swept the rural areas. One survey
indicates there are more than 200,000 stamp collectors, and over
1,000 magnetic card collectors. There are also people who collect

<HEADLINE> France Urges Respect of Security of Kurds in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- France today urged the Kurdish
warring sides in northern Iraq to exercise restraint and to
respect the security of civilians.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt made the appeal
after forces of the Kurdish Democratic Party, which is supported
by the Iraqi government, took the city of Sulaymaniyah from the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the three Kurdish provinces in northern Iraq
are the main beneficiary of international humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
From March 1995 to March 1996, the United Nations has sent 165
million U.S. dollars of aid to Iraq, of which 30 percent are for
the three Kurdish provinces where 15 percent of the population of
Iraq live, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the "Echo" humanitarian program of the
European Union for Iraq, to which France has contributed 20
percent in a total of 31 million U.S. dollars, is also sending 30
percent of the aid to the Kurdish-populated provinces.
</P>
<P>
He urged a rapid application of the U.N. Oil for Food plan for
Iraq to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people, especially
those in the Kurdish-populated provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. plan, the three Kurdish-populated
provinces of Irbil, Sulaymaniyah and Dohuk should receive 150
million U.S. dollars of aid in every three-month period.

<HEADLINE> Small Village Building "Silicon Valley" in North China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Zhichu Village in Shandong
Province's Yantai city has set out ambitious plans to build the
first village-run "Silicon Valley" in China.
</P>
<P>
It has won approval from the State Science and Technology
Commission to build China's first village-run science park.
</P>
<P>
However, villagers of Zhichu, which has more than 1,300
households, knew almost nothing about modern science and
technology a decade ago, and could hardly make their ends meet.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the village's gross economic income has rocketed
over 100-fold, with the per capita annual profit reaching more
than 40,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The village's success is an embodiment of Chinese farmers
becoming affluent by ascending to the palace of science, economists
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1984 the villagers painfully sold seven old buildings, the
only valuable property they possessed, for only 700,000 yuan to
embark on its first industrial project.
</P>
<P>
They cleared the debt with 400,000 yuan and spent the remaining
300,000 yuan on building a workshop to produce wires and cables. The
only thought in their mind then was to shrug off poverty with the
help of industry, and their own enterprise.
</P>
<P>
An engineer who was born in the village and was working at the
Tianjin Cable Plant was persuaded by the villagers to become the
factory's technical instructor. Under his guidance the village
earned more than three million yuan in profits within two years.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by their unexpected success, the villagers set their
eyes on talents at higher levels.
</P>
<P>
When a world-level electron collider was completed in Beijing
in 1987, the villagers of Zhichu sensed its significance and
hurried to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, asking for the
technique to be applied to their cable production. After discreet
consideration and investigation, the scientists nodded their heads
in approval.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Link With Trans-Asia Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is preparing to rebuild
and upgrade its railways to connect with the planned trans-Asia
railway network.
</P>
<P>
The first stage will be to build a line connecting Vietnam's
largest city, Ho Chi Minh City with Phnom Penh and Bangkok,
capital cities of Cambodia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Ministry of Transport and Communications, Vietnam
Railways and the People's Committees of Ho Chi Minh City and
several southern provinces have come up with a plan to attract
investment in the building and upgrading of the railway by the
year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Railway lines in the south will be upgraded or built to
international standards permitting trains to travel at 120
kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's rail network was built between 1945 and 1954 when the
coutnry was under French control, but has been largely destroyed
by the series of wars which plagued the country since then.
</P>
<P>
The plan is part of a huge multi-nation project agreed at the
recent Euro-ASEAN summit to link southeast Asian countries by rail
and connect them with the network of the Asian continent and the
trans-European rail track.
</P>
<P>
The project will help Vietnam improve economic exchanges and
cooperation with Asian and European countries.

<HEADLINE> Small Village Building "Silicon Valley" in North China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years later, a production line designed by nuclear
scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences was completed and
put into operation in the village.
</P>
<P>
It was the first cable production line in China to use the
radiation technology.
</P>
<P>
Since then the villagers have introduced one sophisticated
technique after another. Within five or six years, they have set
up cooperative relations with 22 well-known science research
institutes, universities and major enterprises, hired more than
200 science and technology workers from around the country, spent
over 200 million yuan building some a dozen hi-tech enterprises,
and set up six science research institutes.
</P>
<P>
At present, a hi-tech industrial group has taken shape in the
village, covering mainly new materials, biological engineering,
electronics and information industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the village reported more than 470 million yuan
worth of output value for its hi-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, science and technology progress has
contributed to some 80 percent of the village's economic growth,
according to the result of an investigation by Yantai Government
officials.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the village was approved as the first village-level
hi-tech industrial zone in Shandong by the Shandong Provincial
Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
It was also given approval by the State Science and Technology
Commission (SSTC) to set up a national science park. In accordance
with the requirements of the SSTC, the village is adjusting its
science research plans, and increasing investment in the park.
</P>
<P>
To date, 28 hi-tech products at advanced world level have been
developed and gone into mass production in 17 hi-tech enterprises
in the park.
</P>
<P>
The science park will cover an area of one square kilometers by
2000, and have 30 hi-tech enterprises with an annual output worth
three billion yuan, according to Li Shixun, former village head
and now director of the science park's administration committee.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Launches New Offensive in Eastern Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban Militia today
launched a new offensive against the Afghan government troops in
eastern Afghanistan, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
A Taliban official named Jan Mohammad said in Kandahar, the
Taliban headquarters in southern Afghanistan, that the Taliban
forces had begun attacking the strategic town of Hisarak in the
Nangarhar province.
</P>
<P>
"Our forces have entered Nangarhar from their bases in the
neighboring Logar province," Mohammad said, adding that fierce
fighting was going on.
</P>
<P>
An Afghan government spokesman in Kabul confirmed the attack by
the Taliban on Hisarak today.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the government troops unleashed air raids
on the Taliban positions near Hisarak and repulsed the Taliban
offensive.
</P>
<P>
No information about the casualties on both sides is available
so far.
</P>
<P>
Hisarak is a strategic point in eastern Nangrahar province,
which controls access to the town of Sarobi on the main national
highway linking Kabul with Nangarhar's capital Jalalabad.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban had declared earlier that Sarobi would be its main
military target in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Sarobi, about 75 kilometers east of Kabul, is a major hub of
communications in the country. A major power generating plant
which provides electricity for Kabul is situated at Sarobi.
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman said that there was no worry about the
defense of Sarobi as several thousands government troops had been
sent from Kabul to Sarobi.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a Taliban jet bombed Sarobi and Afghan Prime
Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar declared war against the Taliban in
response.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Electricity Minister Leaves for Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Minister of
Communications, Electricity and Water Jassem Mohammad al-Aoun left
here today for Washington on a one-week visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to sign with U.S. companies a memorandum of
understanding for a proposed power project to be established in
northern Kuwait, the official Kuwait News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Aoun told the agency before leaving that the 2,400-megawatt
power station, which will also produce nearly 48 million gallons
of desalinated fresh water daily, would be built in accordance
with Kuwait's standards.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum would specify the conditions and standards of
the station, the agency said. However, the minister did not
reveal how much the station will cost.
</P>
<P>
American companies have reportedly significantly increased
their market share in Kuwait since the U.S.-led coalition drove
the Iraqi occupation forces out of Kuwait in 1991 although
international competition for the country's government contracts
is intense.
</P>
<P>
American businesses got 67 percent of the 568 million
U.S. dollars in emergency reconstruction contracts awarded by
the Kuwaiti government immediately after the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
A joint petrochemical complex between the U.S. company Union
Carbide and Kuwait's Petrochemical Industries Company to be
established in Kuwait would cost 2 billion dollars, with each of
them owing 45 percent of the equity obligation and the remaining
10 percent goes to Kuwait's Bubiyan Petrochemical Company.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum of understanding of the project was signed in
1993 and the project is scheduled to be completed in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Bangladeshi PM Values Ties with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina said here today that her three-month-old government
is looking forward to an early opportunity to renew the bonds of
friendship in order to further strengthen and consolidate the
relations between Bangladesh and China.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua here this evening, the
prime minister, who will visit China Thursday, said it is
important and necessary for her to meet with Chinese leaders and
to develop bilateral relations with China, a major political and
economic power.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Sino-Bangladesh relations as "excellent," Hasina
thanked China for its "very creditable" assistance.
</P>
<P>
"I can say that the three friendship bridges, which have been
so far built with Chinese assistance in Bangladesh, stand as very
strong symbols of Sino-Bangladesh friendship," she said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic and trade cooperation, the prime minister
said that the scope of further cooperation in economic, investment
and trade fields between the two countries is extensive. "We need
to explore these fields more extensively to build a new era of
Bangladesh-China cooperative relations."
</P>
<P>
She said she would like to have Chinese businessmen to set up
wholly-owned ventures in Bangladesh by making use of the new
investment climate being created in the country.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said many Chinese textile mills are being
phased out due to market constraints and the relocation of such
mills to Bangladesh would benefit both countries.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said that China's economic development since 1979 has
brought about great changes in China. "We have been greatly
impressed by the success achieved through the reforms in the
development of rural based industries."
</P>
<P>
"We have also watched with admiration the policies of
modernization that China has adopted for its huge state-owned
sector of the economy" and "we would like to replicate the Chinese
experience in having results similar to those achieved in China."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said, "The basic principles of Bangladesh's
foreign policy is our commitment to conduct our relations with
other countries based on friendship with all and malice to none."
</P>
<P>
"We support the 'One China' policy and have based our relations
with China on our belief in this policy. We consider Taiwan to be
a part of China and reject any notion such as 'two Chinas' or 'one
China, one Taiwan.' We believe that Taiwan should be integrated
with China peacefully," she said.

<HEADLINE> Juppe Policies Still Unpopular: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 60 percent of French
people disapprove of Prime Minister Alain Juppe's policies and 66
percent are disappointed with his performance, according to an
opinion poll published today.
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of French people hope Juppe, who took office 18
months ago after the election of President Jacques Chirac, will
stay "as short a time as possible," the poll, conducted by the
SOFRES polling group and provincial newspapers, showed.
</P>
<P>
Only 22 percent of those surveyed said they are "satisfied"
with the job done by the prime minister, chairman of the Gaullist
RPR party, and only a third approve of his policies.
</P>
<P>
But the results of the poll are little different from a poll
carried out in February, less than two months after a month-long
transport strike which crippled the country forced Juppe to end a
series of austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of those questioned oppose Juppe's employment
policy and 60 percent don't agree with his social and economic
policies, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
Latest unemployment figures show the jobless rate in June crept
up to a higher-than-expected 12.5 percent, matching the historic
high of March 1994.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of French people believe the government's
policies "benefits only the rich," with 22 percent saying it
benefits "all French people." Only four percent think it benefits
"the underprivileged."
</P>
<P>
The poll, carried out between August 28 and 30, polled 1,000
people above 18 and from all social groups just before Juppe
announced an income tax reduction to start in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Juppe's government has added 120 billion francs (22.6 billion
U.S. dollars) to the French tax burden since May 1995.

successive quarter of this year, official figures showed today.
</P>
<P>
Only 6,100 jobs were created in the second quarter of this
year, excluding the agriculture, public and health sectors,
figures released by the National Union for Employment in Industry

But the National Institute of Statistics and Economics Study

<P>
The Labor Ministry said the 37,000 jobs created in the tertiary

Year-on-year, jobs growth was a meager 0.1 percent, which

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will resign from the
Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) beginning October 1
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the government house, the
Thai cabinet today approved an Industry Ministry proposal to
resign from the association.
</P>
<P>
The ministry considered that the ATPC has not been able to
stabilize the price in the world tin market, while Thailand has
become the customer instead of the producer.
</P>
<P>
As Thailand no longer enjoyed the privilege from the
organization, it decided to quit it, the ministry added.

1 this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 38,000 copies of the 200-page book have been sold in

(Hong Kong) Company Limited.
</P>
<P>

In a question-and-answer form, the book explains in simple
language the Basic Law -- the constitution of the Hong Kong SAR
after 1997 by going through 167 questions closely related to local
residents. More than 100 photos inside it make it easier for
readers to understand the concept.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that besides individual buyers, there were many
institutional purchasers, such as social bodies and schools. "Hong
Kong people are trying to get a knowledge of the Basic Law when
it approaches 1997," said the manager.
</P>
<P>
The publishing house has planned to put out a de luxe edition
of the book in one month or two for the convenience of
readers.

<HEADLINE> Antarctic Ozone Continues to Deplete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The ozone layer over the
Antarctic continued to deplete during the first 10 days of
September.
</P>
<P>
Satellite measurements showed deficiencies of some 35 to 40
percent in the layer compared with averages for the same time of
year before the hole in the ozone layer appeared over the polar
region, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the southeastern coastal area, the hole in the ozone
layer now covers the entire Antarctic continent and a huge part of
the adjacent ocean areas toward South America.
</P>
<P>
The WMO said that over the past five years deficiencies on such
a level had been observed for a day or two at the observatory in
Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, but these had occurred in the first
half of October, never as early in September.
</P>
<P>
Lower stratosphere temperatures colder than minus 75 degrees
centigrade over the Antarctic continent are extending even further
south than 60 degrees south latitude in the western sector. These
cold temperatures facilitate ozone destruction and could explain
the low ozone values observed over the southern tip of Argentina,
the WMO said.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer is a protective shield which absorbs and blocks
out most of the sun's ultraviolet radiation. Its depletion could
lead to an increase in such rays which could cause cancer and
possible reduced agricultural production and affect the marine
food chain. Many scientists believe the hole in the ozone layer is
contributing to global warming.

<HEADLINE> Diaoyu Islands are China's Territory Since Ancient Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China has lodged a strong
protest and made representations again with the Japanese
government on Japanese right-wingers' repeated landing on the
Diaoyu Island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here this afternoon, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said the "Chinese side wants
hereby to express its indignation."
</P>
<P>
He said the Diaoyu Island and its adjacent islands have been
part of China's territory since ancient times.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government had time and again made solemn
representations to the Japanese government concerning some
Japanese right-wing elements' repeated landing on those Islands
and illegally building facilities there," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, on September 9, some Japanese right-wing elements went
so far as to once again land on the Chinese territory of the
Diaoyu Island, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side wants hereby to express its indignation at
this move, and it has already made representations again with the
Japanese government about it and lodged a strong protest," Shen
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government reiterates that no unilateral action by
the Japanese side shall undermine China's sacred sovereignty over
the Diaoyu Island and its adjacent islands, and that any facility
which the Japanese side built there on its own is illegal and null
and void," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government had an unshirkable responsibility
there, Shen emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He said that recently, the Japanese right-wing forces have
repeatedly taken provocative actions on the issue of the Diaoyu
Islands, in violation of China's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
They have also tried their utmost to deny Japan's history of
aggression, and these moves cannot but arouse the high vigilance
of the people of other Asian nations, including China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese government should take effective measures to
contain this countercurrent," the spokesman urged.
</P>
<P>
"Should such a trend be allowed to go unchecked, it would be
bound to cause serious damages to the Sino-Japanese relations", he
warned.

LUSAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Investment, particularly
foreign investment, has been booming in Zambia, since the
government opened up the economy to foreign investment, the
newspaper of Zambia Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
This has come about with acceleration of the privatization
process and the mines and minerals act passed in 1995 which is
generating substantial foreign interest.
</P>
<P>
Based on assessment of the investment center, the report says
that the investment value of licenses issued is 179.7 million US
Dollars in the agricultural sector in l993-95. Almost all came
from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The investment value of licenses issued in the manufacturing
sector is 295.3 million US Dollars in the same period. A large
proportion of the investment in the sector has come through the
privatization program. A number of state-owned manufacturing
enterprises have been sold.
</P>
<P>
In the mining sector, the value of license issued is 30.5
million Dollars. Such investment has originated from
international companies carrying out exploitation work for base
metals.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Manufacturing Output in July Higher than </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output in July recorded a 1.3 percent increase over July last
year, due mainly to an increase in the output of the electronics
and machinery industries, the Economic Development Board (EDB)
said today.
</P>
<P>
However, the EDB said that the output level in July was lower
than May and June of this year, mainly because of shut-downs in
petroleum refineries and lower production in pharmaceutical, as
well as the flat trend observed in the electronics and machinery
industries.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative output for January to July this year grew by 8.6
percent over the same period in 1995, it said.
</P>
<P>
Compared to last year, the electronics industry grew by 8.3
percent in July, while cumulative output of the industry in the
first seven months of this year grew by 15.7 percent over the same
period of 1995, the EDB said, but adding that for the personal
computers, consumer electronics, and telecommunications equipment
segments, cumulative output was lower than the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The production of the machinery industry increased by 4.5
percent compared to last year as fabrication of oil rigs slackened
in the final stage of construction, while the output of machine
tools increased for export. Cumulative output of the industry grew
by 13.7 percent in the first seven months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The output for chemical industries, including petroleum,
pharmaceuticals, petrochemical and other chemical industries,
decreased by 8.1 percent in July. But despite the July decrease,
the cumulative output for the first seven months expanded by nine
percent, the EDB said.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Officials in Nigeria to Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of commonwealth
officials arrived in Nigeria on Monday to make preparations for a
visit by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) to the
country, according to press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The coming of the commonwealth officials has forced the delay
of a United Nations fact-finding mission on the oil-rich Bakassi
Peninsula for a settlement of dispute between Nigeria and
Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
The commonwealth team held talks on Monday with officials of
the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the meeting will continue today.
</P>
<P>
"I am here with two of my colleagues to discuss the modalities
of a possible visit by the CMAG to the country," said the team
leader, Srina Vassan, who is the Deputy Secretary-General of the
Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
"So far, talks (with foreign ministry officials) had been very
useful. We hope it will continue so," he said.
</P>
<P>
A visit of the CMAG earlier scheduled for August 29 and 30 was
canceled because the Nigerian government and the CMAG could not
agree on the modalities of the visit.
</P>
<P>
While the CMAG wanted to extend the visit beyond two days and
visit some detained politicians and other sectors of the country,
the government insisted the visit should be restricted to two
days and the meeting should be strictly between it and the CMAG
only on the suspension of Nigerian from the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the 53-member organization last
November following the execution of Author Ken Saro-Wiwa and
eight other Ogoni activists on murder charges. CMAG was set up
immediately afterwards and decided in June to suspend further
sanctions against Nigeria.

LUSAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian export firm has urged
member states of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to

</P>
<P>
Bravetes International, the Zambian Export Company based in
Namibia, has implored SADC countries to enhance trade relationship in

</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted the company's Managing Director, Owen

SADC member states especially in the textile industry to attract
major investment.''
</P>
<P>
Kasonso said in Ndola in Copper Belt Province on monday that
SADC member states should not close markets to imports from
within the region but instead put in a systematic information
delivery mechanism to improve trade relations.
</P>
<P>
He chellanged some SADC member states to open their doors and
reduce duty rates to encourage fair competition between domestic
products and imports from member states, and put measures in place to
counter unfair competition from heavily subsidized imports from
outside the region to sustain operations of the local industries.
</P>
<P>
However, Kasonso expressed the regret that the current situation is
not very conducive for fair trade as some SADC members are still
protective and cannot allow goods from within the region. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina's forthcoming visit to China will become a
"milestone" in Sino-Bangladesh relations, and will contribute to
the consolidation of links between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Ambassador to China, Mustafizur Rahman, made the
remark in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Hasina will pay an official visit to China at the invitation of
Chinese Premier Li Peng, from September 12 to 16.
</P>
<P>
Rahman pointed out that it is Hasina's first official visit
abroad as Bangladesh Prime Minister since she took office this
June, with the purpose of strengthening Sino-Bangladesh ties.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Hasina is expected to meet Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and other senior Chinese officials,
and exchange views on issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, both sides will also sign a series of
cooperation agreements covering investment protection, avoidance
of double-taxation and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said that the two countries have a long-term friendly
relationship, and they have always trusted and supported each
other.
</P>
<P>
He said China has given Bangladesh extensive support in the
economic field, citing that with China's assistance, Bangladesh
has built a number of highways, bridges, power projects and coal
mine projects.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are still over 1000 Chinese engineers and
technicians working in Bangladesh, he added.

Bangladesh also spares no effort to support China on Taiwan,
Tibet, human rights, and many other important issues, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Bangladesh adheres to a "one China" stance,
holding that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese
territory.
</P>
<P>
As to the human rights issue, he believed that China has been
"unfairly" criticized by western media and western countries.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that people's basic rights such as clothing,
food and shelter should be guaranteed before anything else, and
China has made, and will continue to make, unremitting efforts to
meet the basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
Touching on cultural links between the two countries, he said
that exchanges date back to ancient times when Buddhists from the
two sides visited each other.
</P>
<P>
He noted that at present, the two countries have maintained the
exchange of cultural delegations, and there are many Bangladesh
students currently studying in China.
</P>
<P>
Since Bangladesh people take Chinese people as their friends,
they hope to have better understandings of Chinese history and
culture.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Fifth in World Traffic Death Rate League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea still has one of
the world's highest death rates from traffic accidents in spite of
police crackdowns and publicity campaigns, the Construction and
Transportation Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The country's traffic accident death rate last year was 23 per
100,000 people, the fifth highest in the world. South Korea also
ranks the 10th in the world league of deaths per vehicle, with
12.2 deaths for every 10,000 vehicles on the road.
</P>
<P>
Last year, on average 28 people were killed and 909 were
injured in nearly 700 crashes every day.
</P>
<P>
Between 1985 and 1995, the number of accidents rose by 5.4
percent annually, deaths by 3.2 percent and injuries by 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In spite of intensive police crackdowns on traffic violations
and repeated public awareness campaigns, the rising tide of
accidents has been blamed on an explosive rise in the number of
vehicles on the road.
</P>
<P>
Registered vehicles have jumped 7.6 fold from 1.1 million in
1985 to 8.5 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is considering launching a second four-year
campaign to crack down on drunk driving and enhance public
awareness of traffic regulations. The first campaign started in
1988.

<HEADLINE> China to Get Tough on Illegal Mining Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China is to strike harder on
illegal mining activities by changing its Mineral Resources Law.
</P>
<P>
Amendments adopted by China's top legislature in late August,
mean that the country's legal construction for the development of
the mining industry has entered a new stage, said a senior
official in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
"Unlicensed mining, and the fight for mineral resources in some
areas, are still serious. These activities have wasted or
destroyed mineral resources," said Song Ruxiang, minister of
Geology and Mineral Resources, at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Some people wrongly believe that mineral resources are owned by
the discovery, or the discoverers of the sites, Song added.
</P>
<P>
The amendment, to take effective as January 1 next year, has
stressed that all mineral resources are owned by the country, and
specified that it is the State Council, China's top governing
body, that monopolizes mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
The old law, which was implemented ten years ago, has become
unsuitable with the development of market economy, Song said.
</P>
<P>
The new law has come up with even sterner punishments to deal
with lawbreaking activities in mining, and has levied more duties
on local governments to keep mining in order.
</P>
<P>
The law will also get tough on mining in a destructive manner,
or on preventing mining officials from performing their duties.
</P>
<P>
The new law has also defined the legal status of foreign
investors in exploration and development of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Zou Fuzhao, a member of the Law Commission of the National
People's Congress, said that to standardize China's mining sector,
private individuals will be forbidden from exploiting three
mineral resources. They are resources that should be exploited by
mining enterprises; resources under state protection in
development, such as gold; and other resources the state forbids
private individuals from developing, such as salt, he explained.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with international practice, the amended law has
also set up a system to allow the transfer of exploration and
development rights. It will also punish trafficking of the rights.
</P>
<P>
China has strengthened attacks on illegal mining activities
over the past months, and has achieved notable success,
Vice-Minister Jiang Chengsong said. But he also warned that it is
still a long process for the country to maintain the normal order
in mining.

<HEADLINE> Breakthroughs Urged for Agricultural Exchanges Across Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The two sides across the
Taiwan Straits should make a breakthrough in agricultural
cooperation, and establish channels for trading in farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges and cooperation in science and technology should
also take place, according to Xu Jing, vice-chairperson of the
China Association for the Promotion of Agricultural Exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Xu said today at an investment and trade seminar in southwest
China's Fujian Province that the two sides across the Taiwan
Straits should make breakthroughs in the short run.
</P>

production and processing, and the growth, sale, processing and
export of fruit and vegetables, the cultivation and processing of
aquatic products, the protection of fishery resources, the
production of sugar cane and sugar, the production, processing and
sale of beef, and pig raising and processing, and sale of pork.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that a channel should be established for the
trading of agricultural products on either side of the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges between the agricultural circles across the straits
started in 1988. So far, more than 30 agricultural science and
technology seminars and trade talks have been held, covering
cultivation, animal husbandry, fishing, farming machinery,
agricultural economics and quarantine regulations.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people from the agricultural circles of Taiwan

KUALA LUMPUR, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Supreme Head

At a dinner there tonight given in his honor by Brunei's Sultan

industry, according to a report of the Malaysian news agency

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Stresses Importance of Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- At a China's Teacher's Day
festival in Beijing today, President Jiang Zemin congratulated the
nation's teachers and said that education should be given more
support.
</P>
<P>
"Various departments in various regions must attach extreme
importance to education," Jiang said, at a national education
meeting honoring the annual event at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the strategy of reviving the country by
promoting science and education must be implemented, because it is
vital to China's social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that teachers are the "engineers of the soul", that
their calling is a lofty one, and that they deserve people's
esteem.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are nearly 10 million teachers in China's
universities, high schools, and primary schools and that they are
the basic force in developing education. The nation must have a
good basic education that can replenish, renew, and improve its
teachers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The country has over 200 million people in primary and
secondary schools, and this would be impossible without a
sufficient teaching staff with good ideological and professional
background," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental task of education, he pointed out, is to build
a staff of teachers who have a correct world view and educational
ideas, who are familiar with the content of a modern education,
its methodology and techniques, and who are good at improving
students' quality.
</P>
<P>
He concluded by saying that Party committees and government at
various levels should support education by respecting teachers and
guide education work in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders Li Lanqing, Lei Jieqiong and Qian Weichang also
met with teachers' representatives and extended their good
wishes.

<HEADLINE> China Importing Goods That Were Made In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China imported a total of 2.3
billion US dollars' worth of goods which were originally exported
by Chinese companies in 1995, China Machinery &AMP; Electronics Daily
has reported.
</P>
<P>
This represents a 27 percent increase over the amount in
1994. The commodities include mechanical and electrical products
that cost 642 million US dollar, an increase of 22.8 percent over
1994.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that this strange phenomenon is caused by two
factors: Some Chinese goods were sold at a low price on the
international market because of export rebates, while at the same
time, some domestic companies that were exempt from import taxes
found it economical to import those goods.
</P>
<P>
A second reason is the fact that China gives a tax exemption
for goods which were finished in China using imported materials
and then exported, and increased the prices of the same goods when
imported, by only 10-15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The experts have worked out several proposals for the
authorities to deal with the situation.

<HEADLINE> Translation Of Chinese Epic Poem Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A translation of the classic
Kirgiz epic, "Manass", whose length is 15 times that of the
Homeric epic, the Iliad, into the Han language has finally been
completed.
</P>
<P>
The work appeared among the Kirgiz in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, telling the story of a Kirgiz
hero, Manass, and his descendents in a narrative poem that
contains myths, legends, ritual songs, and proverbs.
</P>
<P>
The epic was handed down in the oral tradition from one
generation to the next and was sung at important ceremonies and
festivals. Over time it grew to 230,000 lines.
</P>
<P>
The Han-language version, expected to be published next year,
is about 200,000 lines in 18 volumes.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies of the epic have placed the grassland to the
north of Tianshan, where tombs of the heros portrayed in the epic
tale have been found, as the place of origin of the story. It was
widely told in northwest China and in parts of central Asia.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts began to collect copies of the epic in 1961 but
were not able to finish the compilation of it in the Kirgiz
language until last year.
</P>
<P>
"Manass" is one of three most famous epics in China, the other
two being the Tibetan "King Gesser", and the Mongolian
"Jangariad".

<HEADLINE> Fifth World Historical Cities Conference Opens In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth World Conference of
Historical Cities opened today in Xi'an, in northwest China, with
representatives from 58 cities in 42 countries.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the opening ceremony, Chinese Vice-premier and
foreign minister Qian Qichen said, "The civilization of historical
cities reflects the development of human civilization and is a
model of it."
</P>
<P>
"These cities truly are the quintessence of human civilization
as characterized by different periods, regions and cultures, and
comprise the invaluable cultural heritage created by human wisdom,
and play a unique role in the development and progress of human
society.
</P>
<P>
"We must be fully aware that the world's historical cities have
to come to terms with many global problems that beset all other
cities," Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
China is an old country with a 5,000-year history, so its
cities that are rich in history and culture are quite numerous.
</P>
<P>
In giving prominence to protecting its historical cities, the
Chinese government has developed a series of laws and regulations
for historical relics and sites and had some good results, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the conference will increase understanding
and exchanges, promote friendly relations between Xi'an and the
world's other historical cities, and contribute to their
protection and development and to human society.
</P>
<P>
Yorikane Musumoto, mayor of Kyoto, said that Xi'an is the best
place to hold the conference because it was the starting point of
the ancient silk road, which linked the east and west.
</P>
<P>
The first conference was held in Kyoto in 1987, followed by
three more in Florence, Barcelona and Kyoto. The theme of the
current session is revitalization of historical cities.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference will adopt a charter for the world
conference of historical cities, set up a world league of
historical cities, and approve the Xi'an Declaration.

PARIS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- While Prime Minister Alain Juppe has announced a cut of 25
billion francs (5 billion U.S. dollars) of income tax in 1997,
local taxes have been raised by more than 22 billion francs (4.4
billion dollars) to compensate for the increased transfer of state
power to local governments in a decentralization drive.
</P>
<P>
-- The Kurdish city of Sulaymaniyah, which was a stronghold of
the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led by Jalal Talabani, fell
Monday night to the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) allied with
Baghdad without heavy fighting. With this clear victory, the KDP
took the essential control of the Iraqi Kurdistan and will drive
its rivals to exile to the last possible refuge -- Iran.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The increase of local taxes voted this year by the local
government bodies -- the communes, departments and regions --
could erase the 25 billion franc tax cut promised by Alain Juppe
for 1997. Local taxes will rise by 7.4 percent this year as
compared with last year, which means an increase of 20-22 billion
francs (4-4.4 U.S. dollars).

the potential to grow by six to seven percent annually over the
next few years, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in its
Country Economic Review on the Philippines released here today.
</P>
<P>
"Growth has resumed, investment and exports have picked up, the
balance of payments has improved, the external debt service ratio
has fallen, and above all, the international investors' confidence
in the Philippine economy is now stronger than perhaps at any time
in the recent past," said the ADB.
</P>
<P>
The Country Economic Review is an annual bank report which
analyzes recent economic developments and medium-term prospects
and policy issues, and provides the economic background for the
bank's lending program for a member country.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that in the past the Philippines has experienced
a series of volatile "boom-bust" economic cycles, but the current
recovery is qualitatively different and could lead the economy to
sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured goods now constitute the bulk of exports, reducing
the country's traditional reliance on volatile commodity earnings,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the Philippines' external debt and
debt-service payments are now significantly lower in real terms
than in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal imbalances have been significantly reduced and the
central bank restructuring has restored confidence in the banking
system, it added.
</P>
<P>
"All these factors have laid the foundations for strong
economic performance (in the Philippines)," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said that the conversion of the possibilities
of strong growth into reality will require concerted efforts in
many spheres of economic management by the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government said last week that the country's
gross national product grew by 7.7 percent in the second quarter
of this year, pushing the first half-year GNP growth to 7.1
percent.

<HEADLINE> Israel Faces Decline in Army Motivation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The drop in motivation
to serve in the Israeli army mirrors the attitude the youth
receive from home, indicating that the trend reflects the society
as a whole and not just the 18-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll, conducted by the Bar-Ilan University last May
and June, showed that while religious families generally instill
a greater motivation to volunteer for elite combat units than
secular parents, but there are signs that this is also dropping.
</P>
<P>
Ya'acov Katz, Director of the Institute for Community
Research at the university's School of Education, has monitored
Israeli youths for the past 10 years, and first published
a poll last April which showed a decline in motivation among
both secular and religious youths.
</P>
<P>
The poll, a follow-up for the previous one directed by
Katz, interviewed 343 parents of soon-to-be-drafted schoolers in
the state school system and 108 in the state religious school
system.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, 69 percent of the parents said they
were interested in their sons serving in the army, but only 26
percent said they wanted to see them in a combat unit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 76 percent of their sons, in the previous poll,
expressed interest in serving in the army, and only 34 percent
wanted to volunteer for a combat unit.
</P>
<P>
Due to the sharp decline in army motivation, Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has appointed a former senior
army officer to set up a special committee to hammer out
ideas on how to stop the drop.
</P>
<P>
Amos Yaron, former Israeli military attache to the United
States, has been entrusted to work with other organizations and
personnel responsible for youth education to work out actions to
spotlight national values, to increase identification with the
army, and to create a higher readiness among youths before they
are drafted.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a grass-roots group of reserve brigade
and battalion commanders is to hold its first public meeting
this evening to combat the waning image of the Israeli army,
and in particular, to look for ways of increasing motivation among
reservists.
</P>
<P>
The meeting comes amid reports of increasing shirking of
reserve duty to the point that the number of soldiers
getting out of the reservist pool is higher than those going
in.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Government Blocs to Dominate Lebanon's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's 1996 general
election is to drop its curtain after the last of the five rounds
is held in the eastern Beqaa Valley next Sunday, amid a prevailing
situation that pro-government blocs have got the upper hand in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the forth round of election in southern Lebanon Sunday, the
"Liberation and Development" bloc of incumbent House Speaker
Nabih Berri achieved a perfect victory with none of its 21
candidates crossed off.
</P>
<P>
Four deputies-elect in the bloc are members of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and they could not
expectedly be friendly cooperators of the regime in view of
the party's behaviors in the outgoing house.
</P>
<P>
They were only incorporated into the bloc last week as a
result of Syria's mediation between Berri's pro-Syrian Amal
movement and Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Other elements in the bloc, including six Amal members and
11 allies of the Shiite moderate group, make Berri the most
favored candidate for the speakership in the next
half-Christian-half-Moslem parliament.
</P>
<P>
Berri did declare an intention to win a second term of
his mandate at a press conference held several hours before
the results of the election in southern Lebanon were
officially announced on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
He described his alliance with the prime minister as
"strategic."
</P>
<P>
Of the 23 seats allocated for the south, the last two
were left for Sunni candidates in Saida city, hometown of
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
The Amal-Hezbollah agreement is most likely to also apply in
the next and last round of election in the Beqaa in
eastern Lebanon next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Syria-brokered agreement, three Hezbollah
candidates will be included in their joint list.
</P>
<P>
The biggest bloc born in the first three rounds of election,
which were respectively held in Mount Lebanon, the north and
Beirut, seems to be the "Beirut's Decision" headed by Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Hariri and other members in the bloc won 14 seats in
the third round of election in the capital.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for the prime minister, rising
from the southern Lebanese port city of Saida, to run for
the election in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen of new deputies are expected to join
Hariri's bloc following all the five rounds of election are
completed, creating a strong parliamentary bloc of up to 30
members.
</P>
<P>
The victory will make Hariri the most potential candidate
to form a new government after the general election and
enable him to steer more easily through the parliament, in which
opponents had given him a lot of problems in the past.
</P>
<P>
The other two major pro-government blocs emerging in the
previous rounds of election are one led by Deputy Prime
Minister and Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr and another led
by Druze leader and Minister of Displaced Walid Jumblatt.
</P>
<P>
Besides Hezbollah, which will probably form its own bloc,
the main opposition bloc seems to be headed by incumbent Deputy
Suleiman Franjieh.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Asked to Clarify Chang's Reported Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China has "officially asked
the Malaysian side to offer a clarification" on reports that Chang
Hsiao-yen of Taiwan had recently paid a secret visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
China, at the same time, has already stated its solemn position
to the Malaysian side concerning what was reported, said Shen
Guofang, spokesman of China's Foreign Ministry, at a press
conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"There is only one China in the world, and the government of
the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government which
represents China." he said.
</P>
<P>
"This has long been a common understanding of the international
community, and is also the political basis for developing
relations between China and the countries with which it has
diplomatic ties," Shen added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some people of the Taiwan authorities have
recently been trying to go out here or there for their activities
in a secret manner or even through using assumed names.
</P>
<P>
"This just shows their conscience of guilt and unpopularity,"
he said, adding that "such a clumsy trick of the Taiwan
authorities will absolutely get them nowhere."

<HEADLINE> South Korea Establishes Exclusive Economic Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea decided today to
establish a 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off
its coastline under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea,
Yonhap News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It will take time for South Korea to exercise full rights to
the exploitation of marine and seabed resources in the zone,
Yonhap quoted a Foreign Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has not reached agreement with Japan, which imposed
its EEZ earlier this year, on the boundaries of the zone despite a
series of talks.
</P>
<P>
The EEZs of the two countries overlap as the sea between them
is not wide enough to encompass both zones.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea obliges signatory
countries to respect 200-mile exclusive economic zones of other
nations, in which a nation has the exclusive right to exploit
natural resources and establish artificial islands.

<HEADLINE> hke091035--Ramos Orders Disarming of Vigilantes in S. Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today ordered the disarming of vigilante groups in Zamboanga
city in Mindanao and said that their presence would stall the full
economic development of southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"Organizational, persuasive and legal actions must be the first
step to diffusing and dismantling these groups," Ramos said in his
order to Arturo Enrile, chief of staff of the armed forces, and
Recaredo Sarmiento, police director general.
</P>
<P>
The vigilantes are opposing the peace agreement signed a week
ago between the government and the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF). A vigilante group known as Mindanao Christian Unified
Command, which claims to have 10,000 armed members, has reportedly
"declared war" on those who support the proposed Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD).
</P>
<P>
Ramos ordered the two officials to take "more forceful measure
as needed" to remove threats and preserve peace and order in
Mindanao. But he excluded the participation of the MNLF in the
operation to avert a Christian-Muslim confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The majority Christians in Mindanao rejected the peace
agreement because they feared that they would be put under the
Muslims' control under the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
In an interview later, Ramos said the presence of the Christian
vigilantes will discourage the Muslim investors from Southeast
Asia, the Middle East and Africa and stall the economic
development of southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
However, the Christian vigilantes are only one of the
president's headaches in Mindanao. Although the government has
signed the peace agreement with the MNLF, but it still has a long
way to see genuine and lasting peace falling there.
</P>
<P>
The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), another potent
insurgency group which opposed the Mindanao peace accord and vowed
to continue seeking for Muslim independence in Mindanao, said
recently that it would unite with other rebel groups to fight
against the government.
</P>
<P>
The MILF also announced that it was growing stronger since some
3,000 MNLF members dissatisfied with the agreement between the
MNLF and the government have defected to it.
</P>
<P>
All these have raised the concern of the Philippine Government.

<HEADLINE> Israel Insists Peace Negotiations Without Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday that
he is willing to hold peace talks with Syria, but ruled out a
pullback from the Golan Heights as a precondition for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after the one-hour meeting at the White House
that Clinton "fully understands our position" and promised to try
to get the negotiations going.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu asked Syria not to have a "fixed position" if it
wanted to see the talks that broke down last May reopened,
indicating Syria should relinquish the "land-for peace" formula,
implicitly agreed by the former Israeli Labor government.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli right-wing leader said he would like to find a
formula for the resumption of the talks with Syria, and disclosed
that Dennis Ross, the U.S. mediator for the Middle East peace
process and other American diplomats were making their efforts for
that.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with Netanyahu, Clinton said: "it's not an
easy road ahead."
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can make progress on all fronts."
</P>
<P>
He reassured Netanyahu that the United States considers peace
and security indivisible goals.
</P>
<P>
Differences over the Golan Heights between Syria and Israel is
believed to be the major obstacle blocking the reopening of the
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Golan Heights, part of Syria's territory, was snatched by
Israel in the third Middle East War in 1967, and Netanyahu, after
taking office, has proclaimed he would not return the strategic
plateau back to Syria, which finally set a brake on the otherwise
ongoing talks between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Netanyahu told reporters after talks with Secretary of
State Warren Christopher that negotiations between Israel and Arab
states should be reciprocal.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that it is a two-way street, and "everybody knows
that already." His remarks underscored that the Arabs should make
some compromise that he requires to match what he said Israel has
already done.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Christopher reminded Netanyahu that he
should meet a commitment to redeploy Israeli troops in the West
Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu was determined that the peace process would fall
apart if the Israeli troops were withdrawn from Hebron, given what
he said was the volatile situation there.
</P>
<P>
Christopher also urged the Israeli prime minister to ease the
closure in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying it is now
appropriate to do so.
</P>
<P>
Israel has recently taken some steps to ease Palestinian
economic misery in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including the
issuance of 20,000 additional work permits, faster security checks
at crossing points and more VIP passes for businessmen.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials said those moves were not enough.
</P>
<P>
"It's no great secret we've been frustrated with Netanyahu," a
senior U.S. official close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu arrived in Washington early on Monday for his second
visit to the United States since taking office.

National Unification Board, said that the DPRK, by "arbitrarily
selecting and inviting" only 25 out of 53 South Korean applicants,
has "breached an international commitment."
</P>
<P>
As a result, Kim said, the South Korean government will not
send a delegation to the forum which will be held from September
13 to 15.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman criticized the DPRK for violating a written
accord concluded last March with the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO), a co-sponsor of the forum.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK guaranteed in the accord that the investment forum is
open to all countries and all applicants would be able to attend
the forum regardless of status.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the South Korean government submitted a list of 53
applicants to the forum, made up of 24 businessmen, four from
business organizations including the Korea Federation of Small
Businesses, five from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency
and the Korea Development Institute, nine from administrative
agencies including the National Unification Board and the Finance
and Economy Ministry as well as 11 journalists.
</P>
<P>
However, among the 53 applicants, the DPRK has only extended
invitations to 23 businessmen, one official from the Korea Tobacco
and Ginseng Corporation and one official from the Korea Federation
of Small Businesses.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to South Korea this morning through the United
Nations Development Program, another forum co-sponsor, the DPRK
explained that "we were obliged to extend selective invitations
due to the excessive number of applicants for the investment
forum."
</P>
<P>
South Korea has provided 300,000 U.S. dollars to the DPRK
through an international organization for the holding of the forum.
</P>
<P>
The local media said that the latest dispute over the
investment forum issue between South Korea and the DPRK will
adversely affect the inter-Korean economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Faces Swarms of Iraqi Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran today announced that it
faces the danger of two million Iraqi refugees pouring into the
country due to the latest fighting in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Husseini, Director General in Charge of Foreign
National Affairs at the Interior Ministry, said at a press
conference that the Iraq refugees will swarm into the country
through three Iranian provinces of West Azarbaijan, Kermanshah and
Kurdestan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of refugees with immediate danger
of pouring into Iran is 200,000 in the short run, but the
final figure will reach as high as two million.
</P>
<P>
"All the refugees are now moving toward Iraq's northern
town of Sulleimaniyeh, from where they would come to Iran," he
added.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the latest development, he said, the Interior
Ministry set up an emergency headquarters with representatives
from the Foreign Ministry, the Guidance Ministry and the Law
Enforcement forces Monday to follow up the situation.
</P>
<P>
The official declared that Iran's policy is not to accept
any new refugees due to the lack of any assistance from
international organizations and other countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "we would accept people whose life are
seriously in danger."
</P>
<P>
"We will allow them reside at the border areas in cooperation
with the United Nations and other international refugee
organizations, " he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are not cruel. We are concerned about conditions for
women, children and old people. About 100 Kurdish refugees are
now hospitalized at Iranian border hospitals," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Husseini said that the situation in northern Iraq is very
dangerous and chaotic because there is no government there.
</P>
<P>
As the cold season is approaching, he said, the conditions
would be worse there with problems in distributing assistance.
</P>
<P>
The official called for more assistance such as rice,
flour, sugar, clothing, fuel and fund from the international
communities.
</P>
<P>
"The international organizations have been informed already and
 they have expressed desire to help us," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, no date has been arranged for the dispatch of such
assistance, he added.
</P>
<P>
There are 17 refugees camps in three Iranian provinces. But
not all of them are ready to accommodate refugees because
some of them are already occupied by refugees from previous
pours, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If necessary we can set up 10,000 tent camps," he said.
</P>
<P>
About two million refugees are now residing in Iran, with about
1.5 million from Afghanistan and others from Iraq.

removing corrupt customs, the New Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mukwaya made the call yesterday at the Session of African
Conference on the Empowerment of Women through Functional

</P>
<P>
The minister said these customs included early marrige, child
marrige, sexual exploitation and abuse, discrimination in health
and well-being fields.
</P>
<P>
Mukwaya emphasized the need to stop such customs to relegate
the girl child to genital mutilation and early initiation into
womanhood.
</P>
<P>
The above tendencies severely curtail educational and
employment opportunities of women, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Getrude Mongella, Advisor to the Director-General of UNESCO,
proposed yesterday at the six-day confenrence that African
governments impose a tax to collect special fund to give girl

<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China will improve
telecommunications facilities in rural areas, with all networks in
eastern China to be digitalized within two years, and those of
central China, by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
In the west, the traditional analog equipment will not be
replaced by digital equipment quite so quickly, according to
"People's Posts and Telecommunications News".
</P>
<P>
Over the next few years, the country will increase its input in
telecommunications, in satellite ground stations in areas that are
populated with ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
More SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) equipment will be
adopted for rural optical cable networks, in the country's rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
China had laid 130,000 km of optical cables and more than
30,000 km of microwave lines in the countryside, by the end of
1995. Telephone density in rural areas is two to ten percent in
the east, 0.44 to 1.2 percent in the central parts, and 0.08 to
0.55 percent in the west.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen's Improved Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Xiamen City in southeast
China's Fujian Province has been trying to improve its climate for
investment with a land use system that accords with international
practices.
</P>
<P>
According to the city's land administration, it has introduced
a theory of "different land rents" for leasing land and has found
a good source of urban construction funds.
</P>
<P>
The city has collected more than three billion yuan (353
million U.S. dollars) in land rental fees that has played an
important role in construction of basic facilities in this coastal
city, which is one of the country's earliest special economic
zones with greater autonomy in economic decision-making.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city has made an effort to get foreign
investors to develop business on large tracts of land, helping
attract more overseas investors and helping the city find new
areas for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
While using their land more in line with international
practices, city authorities have also tried to develop a
scientific land pricing system, developing policies that stabilize
land prices, make the land pricing clearer, and reduce investment
risks feared by land developers.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the city has used land pricing as an
effective economic lever and made an effort to guide foreign
investors, in some cases giving them preferential treatment in
land prices in high-tech agriculture and industrial projects,
thereby helping adjust the industrial policies of the special
economic zone.

<HEADLINE> Copper Prices Slump in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Copper prices have been
falling in Indian markets in a sharp contrast to those in London
market where they seem to be stabilizing, official sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Merchant Wirebar price in the Mumbai (Bombay) market has
consistently fallen from 135.50 rupees (4.07 U.S. dollars) per
kilogram since the beginning of August this year and reached a low
of 121 rupees (3.63 U.S. dollars) per kilogram last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the fall to steady arrivals of imported
copper following the reduction in import duty on virgin copper to
30 percent. Large quantities of copper started to land at the
Indian ports at a rate of 300 to 350 tons per day.
</P>
<P>
Increasing competition from imported copper forced indigenous
copper producers to cut prices by 5,000 rupees (150.15 U.S.
dollars) per ton in August.
</P>
<P>
On the London Metal Exchange, however, copper appeared to be
stabilizing by ruling over 2,000 U.S. dollars a ton last week.

KUWAIT CITY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait Investment
Authority (KIA), the only state investment arm of the country,
has announced it will sell 80 million of its shares in the
Securities Group Company in a further effort to push forward
the privatization process.
</P>
<P>
Senior Director of KIA local investments Fahd Rashed
Al-Ibrahim said Monday that the auction will take place in
October at a primary price of 136 fils per share (one Kuwaiti
dinar comprises 1,000 fils).
</P>
<P>
These shares total 24 percent of the Security Group
Company's issued shares, he said.
</P>
<P>
KIA will also put 200 million shares for public
subscription after the auction at a price in line with its
target to give priority to small investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
KIA owns nearly 95 percent of the total issued shares of
the company on behalf of the government.
</P>
<P>
The Securities Investment Company, established in 1981, is one
of the most important investment companies in Kuwait with a
capital of 33 million Kuwait dinars (108.9 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The move is aimed at activating the role of the private
sector in promoting national economic development and enlarge
local investment opportunities," Al-Ibrahim said.
</P>

KIA had sold 20 million shares of its official stake in
the Gulf Insurance Company valued at 12.6 million dinars

NEW DELHI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Europe and the Unites

engineering goods, sources from the Industry Ministry said here

Up to 31.9 percent of the country's exports of engineering

<P>
The world's major markets now account for 62.8 percent of

BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
will allocate a total of 43 billion yuan in environmental
protection funds by the end of the century, reported the China

Even with only one percent of China's total land area, the
province is one of the country's leading economic areas and as a
result has produced 10 percent of China's pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River and Taihu Lake, two of the province's key
water resources, have become seriously polluted in recent years as
a result of the fast growing industry and a neglect of the
environment.

<HEADLINE> Old Industrial Center Boosting Ocean Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in Liaoning
Province, one of China's heavy industrial centers, are taking a
cue from the provincial government's oceanic development plan and
making a greater effort at oceanographic research.
</P>
<P>
The province in northeast China has a 2,920-km coastline,
one-seventh of the country's total, and a 68,000-sq.km. marine
area that is rich in oil, and biological and mineral
resources. Many people have said good-bye to their families in
cities to work in some of these remote coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
"The ocean is the hope of Liaoning's economy," said Ding Dewen,
a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and director of the
Institute of Marine Protection.
</P>
<P>
"For the long term, the province needs new fields for
development, and expanding the ocean economy is imperative," Wen
Shizhen, governor of the province, said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government plans to invest 15 billion yuan
including four billion yuan in foreign funds, by the end of the
century in marine fishing, transport, tourism, oil and gas, and
shipbuilding.
</P>
<P>
It also expects to produce three million tons of aquatic
products annually by the year 2000, one million tons of crude oil,
170 million cu.m. of gas, be able to handle 136 million tons of
cargo and 1.6 million standard container cases in its ports, and
to receive 18 million tourists from other parts of the country and
300,000 from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The province's ocean industry output is expected to be worth 90
billion yuan by 2000, accounting for one-tenth of the provincial
total gross product, and 15 percent by 2010, and about equal to
the GDP from land-based production by the middle of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The governor noted that Liaoning began to develop its ocean
economy somewhat later than other coastal provinces, but that
output in that sector had risen 22.6 percent annually to 30
billion yuan in 1995 over the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province produced two million tons of aquatic
products, about five times the 1990 figure, handled 26.61 million
tons of cargo, twice the 1985 figure, and exported 680 million US
dollars worth of goods, 3.5 times the 1985 amount.
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, "The Ocean and Liaoning's Social and
Economic Development", Ding Dewen said that the province has 44
possible sites for ports and docks, less than one-third of which
have been developed, while only 10 percent of the 6.4 million
hectares of its sea area has been used.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Halt to displacement of Kurds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran today called on the
international community to take immediate measures to stop the
displacement of Kurds and help contribute to relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by the Foreign Ministry and carried
by the official news agency IRNA this morning.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahamoud Mohammadi said Iran will
host Iraq's Kurdish refugees, but it "expects the international
community to share the burden."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said "the renewed fighting between the two
rival Kurdish factions has intensified in northern Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"As a result, thousands of Kurds are heading towards our
border," he noted. But Iran lacks sufficient facilities to cope
with another refugee influx, he added.
</P>
<P>
In response to the reported request for help by Iraq's
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) which is fighting a losing
battle against its Baghdad-backed rival the Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP), Mohammad said "we have not yet received any official
request for help from Jalal Talabani."
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is against interference in the internal problems
of Iraq, and our aid to the Kurds was purely humanitarian without
any other implications," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iran was ready to mediate between the Iraqi
Kurdish factions in order to restore peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
English daily "Iran News" reported that wave after wave of
Kurdish refugees streamed out of their homes in northern Iraq and
headed towards the Iranian border in the wake of an offensive by
the KDP, which is allied with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report from northern Iraq, supporters
of the PUK had lost their control over the towns of Degala and
Kouyesanjaq, leaving both towns to the hands of the KDP Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the KDP has its eyes on another
key target, the Dokan Dam, which controls power in the region
after the fall of the city of Sulaymaniyah, the last major
PUK stronghold.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Petroleum and
Geophysics Prospecting Administration has sent crews as far away
as the United States, Peru, and Pakistan to conduct seismic
studies and for technology services as part of its effort to
expand its business abroad.
</P>
<P>
The bureau was established in 1973, and now has 68 professional
teams which have worked in most parts of China.
</P>
<P>
It is headquartered in Zhuozhou City, in north China's Hebei
Province, and has a workforce of 26,000 and fixed assets of 3.6
billion yuan. It has a good reputation both at home and abroad as
a force to be reckoned with in oil exploration under hard and
complicated geological, surface, and climate conditions.
</P>
<P>
It has done a lot of exploration for new oil and gas reserves,
and helped stabilize oil production in eastern and western China.
It is best remembered for finding several oil and gas fields in
the Tarim Basin, dubbed the "sea of death" by locals, in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
It has also helped sink 3,555 oil wells across the country and
find 10.5 billion barrels of proven petroleum reserves.
</P>
<P>
This year it has sent several teams to the sparsely populated
area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with the hope of finding new
oil reserves in an area of severe cold and low oxygen levels,
according to a spokesperson for the administration.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Okinawa Governor Ota to Discuss U.S. Bases with PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Okinawa Governor
Masahide Ota will discuss the issue of U.S. military bases in the
southernmost prefecture with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in
Tokyo later today.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss the possibility of Ota reversing his
opposition to cooperating with the central government in renewing
lease contacts for privately owned plots of land used by the
U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate Okinawa's economy is another theme which they will
discuss. The prefecture now has the highest unemployment rate and
lowest per capital income in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting follows an unprecedented prefectural referendum on
Sunday, in which 89 percent of voters in Okinawa said "yes" to a
reduction in the huge U.S. military presence there.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ota expressed hope that his meeting with Hashimoto
will pave the way toward resolving the Futenma Air Station issue.
</P>
<P>
If the problems concerning the relocation of Futenma Air
Station are resolved, great progress on the base issue could be
achieved, Ota said at a news conference in the prefectural capital.
</P>
<P>
The return of the station and 10 other U.S. base sites was
agreed upon in an April interim report prepared by the
Japan-U.S. Special Action Committee, a governmental panel jointly
established by Tokyo and Washington for work on the Okinawa
question.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hashimoto has said the government will weigh the
outcome of Sunday's plebiscite and reiterated his determination to
strive for a cut in U.S. military bases in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
He said it was "natural" for Okinawans to vote against the
bases in their hometown and that "the government accepts the
result of the referendum."
</P>
<P>
Sunday's voting outcome reflected the Okinawa people's
long-held frustration over the disproportionately large presence
of U.S. military bases in their small island prefecture, about
1,600 kilometers southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
About 28,000, or 60 percent, of the 45,300 U.S. soldiers in
Japan are stationed in Okinawa. In addition, 75 percent of
U.S. military facilities in the country are based in Okinawa,
which accounts for only 0.6 percent of Japan's land area.

</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has promised to extend official loans
for approximately 30 billion yen for the project.
</P>
<P>
Two power stations at the plant, with an output capacity of
300,000 kilowatts, are scheduled to start operating in 1999.

<P>
SEOUL, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Lee Yong-hee, vice president of
the country's main opposition National Congress for New Politics
(NCNP) was busted last night on bribery charge, a prosecution
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Lee was charged with taking bribes equivalent to 62,500
U.S. dollars from Chin In-kwon, former chairman of the Inkwon
School Foundation, last June when Chin was running for the Seoul
Board of Education Superintendent.
</P>
<P>
Chin allegedly gave the money to Lee with the request that the
NCNP vice president asked two education board members, Ahn
Jang-kang and Park Jun-sik, to vote for Chin. He also gave 62,500
dollars each to the pair in return for their support for him.
</P>
<P>
Lee, 65, admitted taking the bribes while being questioned by
the prosecution authorities prior to the arrest, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Lee is also accused of taking another 62,500 dollars that Park
asked him to return to Chin.

<HEADLINE> More Investments in Petroleum Production Required: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The increased energy demand
worldwide will require more investments in petroleum production of
the Latin American region, the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean predicted today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. commission said that a big part of several billion
U.S. dollars foreign investment will reach the region soon in view
of the changing conditions in industry and the new economic
policies there.
</P>
<P>
The estimating of primary energy need is based on the Gross
Domestic Product growth rate, which will reach 2.3 to 2.5 percent
a year across the world between now and the year 2010, according
to the commission.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the quest for efficiency and lower rates of
pollution will also push up the demand for energy.
</P>
<P>
Eastern and southern Asia is the region with the biggest
increases of energy consumption between 1991 and 2010, with 149
and 143 percent respectively, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The rebellious
Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) will launch a
nationwide offensive to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the
death of Jacobo Arenas, the founder of the FARC, government army
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The army intercepted a radio message in which FARC leader Jorge
Suarez Briceno ordered his forces to maintain a general offensive
until September to disseminate its new strategy to seize power.
</P>
<P>
In a 16-point statement in memory of Arenas, Suarez order FARC
members to harass and occupy towns and set up a cordon around
several cities.
</P>
<P>
The commemoration of the death of Arenas should be carried out
"with lead, not a minute of silence," said Suarez.
</P>
<P>
Priority should be given in the fronts in the eastern part of
the country for mobile operations, total territorial coverage,
roadblocks and cordons around major cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Newsweek magazine, a FARC commander,
who asked not to be identified, said that this organization will
continue fighting to force the Colombian government to adopt
political and economic changes that will improve people's living
standard.
</P>
<P>
As for the possibilities of negotiations with the government,
the guerrilla leader said, "You will have to ask (Colombian
President) Samper and his government; we have always been willing
to talk and negotiate."
</P>
<P>
He added that his group has grown into a small army strong
enough to force changes through dialogue or confrontation.

<HEADLINE> Panamanian Human Rights Group Condemns U.S. Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Peoples' Coordinator
of the Panamanian Human Rights group (COPODEHUPA) today condemned
a U.S. resolution on extending the U.S. presence in the country.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved by the U.S. Senate recently, requested
President Bill Clinton to re-negotiate with the Panamanian
government on the extension of the leasing of U.S. military bases
in Panama beyond the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The COPODEHUPA said in a statement that the resolution
constituted a flagrant encroachment on the sovereignty of Panama.
</P>
<P>
Together with other organizations, the COPODEHUPA denounced
the U.S. move as an attempt to maintain the U.S. hegemony over the
region.
</P>
<P>
It also rapped the Panamanian government, headed by President
Ernesto Perez Balladares, for kow-towing to the United States.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the U.S. claim of controlling drug
trafficking was just a pretext for it to continue its military
presence in Panama, saying the existence of the Southern Command
"has not impeded" the expansion of drug smuggling, which has its
biggest market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The COPODEHUPA described as lies the U.S. arguments that Panama
could be destabilized without the U.S. military bases and that the
canal would remain unprotected.
</P>
<P>
It said that U.S. military bases should definitely leave the
country and will never be installed again in the country's
territory, stressing that the Panamanian people reject military
presence of any foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The COPODEHUPA urged the Panamanian government to hold
negotiations on the neutrality treaty that grants the United
States the authority to control Panamanian resource again.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian Vice-President Tomas Altamirando Duque declared that
a plebiscite would have to be held on the U.S. request to
renegotiate the stay of military bases in Panama after the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the Carter-Torrijos Canal Treaty signed between
Panama and the United States in 1977, the latter must terminate
its entire military presence on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Now the United States maintains 8 military bases on the banks of
the Panama Canal with a contingent of 7,800 soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urged to Revise Gypsum Mining Quota System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Thai gypsum producers and
exporters have urged the Industry Ministry to revise the quota
system on gypsum mining to meet rising demand.
</P>
<P>
The quota policy hurt local ore miners and producers and made
them unable to fulfill the supply contracts that they usually
concluded for a long period with their customers, said the
Producers and Exporters of Gypsum Association.
</P>
<P>
The government recently confined gypsum mining to 4.8 million
tons per year on the ground that total exhaustible gypsum supply
in Thailand is merely 200 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Preecha Attavipat, director-general of the
Industry Ministry's Mineral Resources Department, said the policy
is aimed at encouraging the production of processed gypsum
products with more added value and discourage exports of raw
gypsum.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that Thailand last year produced 8
million tons of gypsum, three-fourths of which was exported to
Japan and other countries in Southeast Asia as raw materials.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Right-Wingers Re-build Lighthouse on Chinese Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese right-wing group has
once again set foot on China's Diaoyu Islands to re-build a
lighthouse, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Six members of the group, known as "Japan Youth Federation,"
set out early Monday morning from the Okinawa prefecture to
re-build on the islands the lighthouse, which was erected on July
14 but tilted over in a typhoon, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The right-wingers put up the lighthouse in an attempt to
include the islands in the sea charts and to pave the way for the
international recognition of Japan's claim over this part of
Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
In August, they erected posts bearing the Japanese flag and
words reading "remember the dead" on the islands.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the July incident, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary
Seiroku Kajiyama said the Japanese government would not intervene
in the matter, thus fueling the swelling arrogance of the
right-wing forces.
</P>
<P>
The Diaoyu Islands, situated between China's Taiwan Province
and southern Japan in the East China Sea, have been part of China
since ancient times.

COLOMBO, September 10 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka has emerged as the
best tea producer in the world fetching the highest price for its
teas on the world market, Trade Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that today Sri Lankan tea is sold at RS 120 (2
US dollars) per kilogram on the world market.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Sri Lankan teas fetched only RS 40 (0.72
US dollars) per kilogram on the international market and that had
caused hardship to the local producers resulting in the closure of
several factories which could not meet the production costs.
</P>
<P>
Now with new market strategies, Sri Lankan teas were doing well
on the international market, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bank, tea production last year in the
country surpassed the peak output of the previous year by 2
percent to 246 million kilograms.

<P>
BELGRADE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugolavia wanted the NATO-led
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) to continue its stay in Bosnia,
according to the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug here today.
</P>
<P>
"The IFOR would continue its fruitful work for a globally
successful application of the Dayton peace accord," said Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic while meeting with the new IFOR
commander in Bosnia Admiral Joseph Lopez on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR had "until now achieved its goals successfully and
contributed considerably to a marked improvement in the safety of
the citizens and the stability of the former war zones," Milosevic
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace accord, which was signed last December
ending the three-and-half-year war in Bosnia, NATO sent 50,000
soldiers to the former Yugoslav republic to monitor the
implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Talks had begun on replacing the IFOR with a smaller force, as
the mandate of the IFOR will run out on December 20.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Javier Solana said here today
that he would do everything he could to support Spain to join in
the NATO Military Intergration.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day visit to Spain, Solana held talks separately
with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Aznar, Foreign Minister Abel
Matutes Juan and Defense Minister Eduardo Serra. Both
parties agreed that Spain should become a full NATO member as
NATO's political and military institutions have been readjusted.
</P>
<P>
Spain joined NATO in 1982, but like France, it didn't join the
bloc's military wing.
</P>
<P>
After the Popular Party of Spain took office in May, it decided
to seek Spain's full membership to facilitate its participation in
NATO's military policy-making and commanding institutions, since
Spain, as the south wing of NATO, is vital to the European
alliance's security.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, Defense Minister Serra visited the
United States at the beginning of the month. Washington also
expressed approval for Spain's full membership of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Solana reiterated NATO's aims of enlargement and fundamental
reforms, one of which was to accept France and Spain as full
members.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Decides to Ratify Treaty With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition party
in Nepal, the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML), has decided to conditionally ratify a Nepal-India border
river development treaty signed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued late Monday by the party said the
CPN-UML acknowledged the importance of the Mahakali treaty to the
interest of Nepal but demanded written assurances from the
governments of Nepal and India on the resolution of a few
bilateral issues including those related to the treaty before
ratifying it.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML decision on the treaty on the integrated
development of Mahakali river, which lies on Nepal's western
border with India, came after six consecutive days of extensive
discussions in the party's central committee.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed last February by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba and his then Indian counterpart Narashimha Rao in New Delhi,
is considered to have laid down principles of cost-benefit sharing
between the two countries on future hydroprojects on the border
river.
</P>
<P>
The issues raised Monday by the Nepali opposition party include
the controversial border issue in eastern Nepal, removal of the
Indian troops from a far-western Nepali district, irrigation for
Nepal's southern plain region and India's power purchase from
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
A CPN-UML senior leader, on condition of anonymity, said Monday
that the Mahakali treaty would not be supported by his party if
the preconditions for its ratification are not met.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CPN-UML President Man Mohan Adhikari said in a
statement, issued Monday before the party's decision was worked
out, that the Mahakali treaty would prove to be against the
interest of Nepal without the correction of the shortcomings in
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML party has formed a five-member team to raise the
issues to the governments of Nepal and India, party sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the coalition government here is going to
present the Mahakali treaty to the parliament for ratification on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the three ruling parties have approved the treaty but
the CPN-UML, the main opposition and the single largest party in
the parliament, holds the key to the ratification of the treaty as
any treaty on water resources needs at least two-thirds majority
support in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Exports to ASEAN Countries Grow Slowly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's exports to other
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have
been growing at a relatively low rate because its business
community is still more oriented to the domestic market, the
Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to data compiled by the ASEAN secretariat,
Indonesia's exports to other ASAEN countries grew by 9.4 percent
in 1994-1995, compared with 65.7 percent for the Philippines, 22.8
percent for Malaysia, and 11.3 percent for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting on developments in ASEAN Growth Areas here
Monday, Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Production and
Distribution Hartarto said the country's industry and trade
sectors were justified to prioritize the domestic market, which
grew by 10 to 24 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia was generally enjoying surpluses in its trade
with other ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports to other ASEAN countries totaled 5.7
billion U.S. dollars in 1994, more than double its imports from
those countries, which stood at 2.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Aburizal Bakrie, chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (KADIN), suggested at the meeting that the government
call on private businessmen to continue to expand their shares in
the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Fadel Muhammad, another KADIN official, said that without a
strong domestic market, Indonesian products would have difficulty
entering the international market.

JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are prepared to
enter into economic cooperation with their Chinese counterparts,
Chairman of the ASEAN Chamber of Commerce and Industry Aburizal
Bakrie said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We can develop cooperation in food, agricultural and
horticulture products, capital goods, banking services,
transportation and telecommunications," said Bakrie, also chairman
of the Indonesian chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
He said this at a meeting here with a group of Chinese
businessmen led by Wang Guangying, vice chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said that ASEAN countries need to import capital goods and
China could meet this demand, an official from the Chinese
delegation told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
At its 25th meeting in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam, last year,
the ASEAN Chamber of Commerce and Industry Council agreed that
ASEAN businessmen would hold periodical meetings with their
partners from China.
</P>
<P>
Bakrie stressed the importance of establishing the ASEAN-China
Business Council to enable businessmen from the two sides to hold
a formal dialogue at the upcoming meeting of the ASEAN Chamber
Council in Jakarta in March next year.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that China would send a large delegation
of businessmen to the ASEAN business summit in Jakarta in 1997 and
would enhance cooperation with Indonesian businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"We, Indonesian businessmen, will be ready to have negotiations
in various fields of business with our Chinese colleagues," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, comprising members of the All-China
Industry and Commerce Federation, arrived here Sunday for a

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian parliament
unanimously backs NATO's proposed eastward expansion and EU
enlargement, and supports Hungary's entry into the two
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons Gilbert Parent made
the remarks while meeting President of Hungary's National Assembly
Gal Zoltan here today.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority in Romania, Parent
said the two states should seek a reasonable and mutually
acceptable way to settle it.
</P>
<P>
On July 17, Romania's ruling Party of Social Democracy accused
Hungary of undermining Romania's territorial integrity by
endorsing the autonomy demands of ethnic Hungarians.
</P>
<P>
It was Romania's reaction to a conference in Budapest on July
15 this year, which called for autonomy for ethnic Hungarian
minorities as a basic condition for retaining the identity of
Hungarians living abroad and for their survival.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Gal said Hungary has maintained its
political stability though it has economic difficulties to resolve.
</P>
<P>
The president also briefed Parent on the major objects of
Hungary's foreign policy -- joining NATO and EU, establishing good
relations with neighboring countries and safeguarding the interest
of Hungarians living abroad.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Common Time Zone Aborts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from
Southeast Asian nations failed to reach consensus on the
establishment of a common time zone for the region, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Senior economic officials from the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) were unable to come to an agreement on a
single time zone for the region at a meeting last weekend in
Jakarta, capital of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
A time change would have adverse effects on ASEAN people's way
of life, a Thai official who attended the meeting was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Krirk-Krai Jirapaet, director-general of the Commerce
Ministry's Business Economic Department, also disagreed with the
time adjustment, indicating that substantial cooperation among
ASEAN nations is more important than a common time zone, which is
merely a symbol.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN common time was proposed by Singaporean Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong during the fifth ASEAN summit in Bangkok
last December, who stressed it would facilitate business and
strengthen solidarity in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporean team attending the senior official meeting in
Jakarta last weekend said that adjusting time to the same in
Beijing, Taiwan and Hong Kong will facilitate business with East
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a major securities market for ASEAN, said the
Singaporean team attending the meeting to make preparations for
the ASEAN ministerial meeting on Wednesday in Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Mulls Japan's Proposal for Telecom Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A Thai official said that
Japan is lobbying for Thailand's support for its draft regulations
to control and supervise international satellite
telecommunications services, local daily the Bangkok Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Minister of Transport and Communications Sombat
Uthaisang said that Japan had approached Thailand on the issue
during an APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) meeting in
Australia last week.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese officials asked their Thai counterparts to support
Japan's plan to issue regulations governing global mobile personal
communications by satellite, Sombat said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that these services have not been regulated before.
</P>
<P>
Sombat said Japan would submit its draft to the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) Policy Forum scheduled for October
in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has not yet decided whether it will support the draft
policy but it will send a delegation led by Director-General of
the Post and Telegraph Department Kitti Yupho to attend the
upcoming ITU meeting, said Sombat.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Free-Trade Agenda Faces Stumbling Block </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Free trade goals of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) suffered a blow
Monday when Indonesia and the Philippines insisted on postponing
the timetable for the reduction of tariffs on sensitive farm
products, officials said.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of a two-day meeting of ASEAN senior
officials, the two countries refused to accept the 2010 deadline
adopted last year by the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) Council for
including such products as rice and sugar in the tariff
liberalization agenda under the Common Effective Preferential
Tariff (CEPT) scheme.
</P>
<P>
"In principle, as we all know, we agreed to phase in the
unprocessed agricultural products into the CEPT, now the question
is: when will the phase-in process be started and when will it be
ended?" Rahardjo Jamtomo, director general of the ASEAN Department
at the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told the local
press last evening.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN senior officials began the closed-door meeting Monday to
pave the way for the AFTA Council's meeting on Wednesday and the
ASEAN economic ministers' meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rahardjo explained that Indonesia proposed to begin the
phase-in process of its highly sensitive agricultural products,
notably rice and sugar, into the CEPT on January 1, 2010, and end
the process 10 years later.
</P>
<P>
"This is the level of development which will allow us to set
(the process in motion) in 2010...," Rahardjo contended, adding
that Indonesia had not come to an agreement with other ASEAN
members on when the process should begin and end.
</P>
<P>
Every country in ASEAN has its own position in regard to the
highly sensitive products, he noted.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- have agreed to extend the AFTA
to cover unprocessed agricultural products and to liberalize their
trade by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The members have been given the option to extend the tariff
reduction deadline on certain sensitive items until 2010.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia backtracked on AFTA last year by withdrawing 15 farm
products from the inclusion list and, instead, placing them on the
sensitive list. Other ASEAN members agreed to give Indonesia some
leeway by allowing the establishment of a special temporary
exclusion list for the 15 products.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 20 people have died in
the meningitis outbreak in Romania over the past three weeks,
health officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The dead were from the 380 patients who had contracted the
disease, said the Health Ministry, adding that most of the victims
were old or poor.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic broke out in early August and was thought to have
been caused by a virus transmitted through infected food or water.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak is believed to have been caused by virus carriers
from Cyprus, where more than 300 people have been hospitalized
with the disease over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
About 50 children have been affected by the disease, and
authorities said they might postpone the scheduled opening on
September 16 of some schools which did not meet hygiene standards
to prevent the disease from spreading.
</P>
<P>
Meningitis, an acute inflammation of the membranes covering the
brain, can be caused by bacteria or viruses and often leads to
brain damage, paralysis and death. Its symptoms include fever,
delirium and convulsion.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia Urged to Watch Re-emerging Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian nations have
been cautioned against the threat of re-emerging diseases in the
region, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
A common approach is needed to tackle the situation
effectively, said Unton Muchtar Rafei, Southeast Asia regional
director of the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Cooperation with countries in other regions also should be
promoted to prevent epidemics from moving across countries and
continents with flows of goods and people, Rafei said.
</P>
<P>
The recent occurrence of diphtheria in Laos and the possibility
of the disease spreading into Thailand is a reminder, Rafei told
the WHO's 49th Southeast Asia regional meeting which opened on
Monday in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Although Southeast Asian countries have achieved significant
success in their immunization programs against diseases like
polio, leprosy, guineaworn and neo-natal tetanus, there should be
no room for complacency, Rafei noted.
</P>
<P>
The region still has high rates of maternal mortality and
infant mortality, and diseases thought to have been under control
are re-emerging, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, the diseases of concern to the region are
yellow fever, cholera and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Health Minister Sora-at Klingpratoom said
re-emerging diseases of most concern to Thailand are elephantiasis
and tuberculosis which are returning as important health problems
from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
A number of immigrants from Myanmar living in Tak province
reportedly carried elephantiasis, Sora-at said.
</P>
<P>
One way to prevent further spread of these re-emerging diseases
is to make health checks compulsory for them, Sora-at added.

<HEADLINE> Fujian's Arable Land Shrinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Per capita cultivated land in
east China's Fujian Province dropped from 0.0413 to 0.038 hectares
in the last five years, making it one of the provinces that are
suffering from an acute shortage of cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
Governor Chen Mingyi says that it will find a way to halt the
continuing loss of its limited amount of farmland to keep its
grain output stable, and that per capita grain share will not
decrease even if the population continues to increase over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
The provincial food supply clashes sharply with construction,
with the area of cultivated land decreasing by 33,200 hectares in
the last five years while the population increased 1.64 million.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, the amount of grain imported by the
province from other parts of China went from 1.5 million to four
million tons annually, accounting for one-third of the province's
grain supplies.
</P>
<P>
"Grain and land have become the major bottlenecks in the
province's economic development," the governor said, noting that
the quicker the economy develops, the more attention should be
paid to protecting cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
He said that planted land must be held to two million hectares
over the next five years, and grain production increased by
120,000 tons annually. By 2000, Fujian must have 1.2 million
hectares of cultivated land, one million of which are to be given
top protection.
</P>
<P>
Projects using cultivated land must pay a high price and
provide other tracts of land that are similarly fertile to replace
the land they use, Chen said, warning that the province will deal
with land cases in a very serious way.
</P>
<P>
Fujian will also open or reclaim waste land to recoup the loss
of cultivated land to non-agricultural development projects, he
said, and it will plan industrial zones in towns in a more
scientific way, encouraging projects to use barren beaches, and
forbid the random planting of fruit trees or the digging of fish
ponds in cultivated land. It has also suggested that farmers use
mountainsides for fruit trees and barren beaches for aquatic
breeding.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that the province will develop favorable
policies for barren land development.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Issues New Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia issued a new set of
bank notes today, according to information arriving here from
Skoblje, the country's capital.
</P>
<P>
The new currency, of 10 denars, 50 denars, 100 denars, 1,000
denars and 5,000 denars in denomination, is about 39 against one
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia had spent 1.2 million denars on the production of new
notes, said Borko Stanoevski, Governor of the National Bank of
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The old denars, issued in September 1991 after Macedonia gained
independence from the former Yugoslavia, would remain in
circulation at the same value for an another half year before
being changed into the new ones, Stanoevski said.
</P>
<P>
The new notes under 100 denars were printed in Prilep, a
southern city of Macedonia, and the others in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia's move is a part of the agreement signed with its
neighbour Greece last September to end their four-year feud in the
old money emblem, which represented the ancient Macedonia empire
covering part of what is now Greece as well as the former
Yugoslavia.

GUANGZHOU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A 300,000-head pig farm
that opened recently in the northeastern part of Guangdong
Province has become part of the largest agricultural experimental
zone in south China.
</P>
<P>
The zone is located in the Dengta Basin in a 19-town,
1,900-sq.-km. area that was formerly the poorest area in
Guangdong, mainly because of a lack of transport facilities.
</P>
<P>
As part of an overall development program, the zone will take
advantage of its closeness to Hong Kong and Macao to develop
cultivation, aquatic breeding, fruit preservation and township
industries.
</P>
<P>
So far, high-quality, high-yield corn, paddy rice, bamboo
shoots, fruit and fast-growing trees have been planted on 660 ha
of land, and 100 large and small hydro-electric power stations
around the basin provide more power for irrigation for the zone.
</P>
<P>
The new Beijing-Kowloon Railway cuts through the basin,
creating new opportunities for its rapid development.

<HEADLINE> Rapid Economic Development Urged for Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (xinhua) -- Liu Fuhe, of the Leading
Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development of the State
Council, says that the central and the western parts of China have
a majority of the country's poor, but are economically backward,
and should be helped to bring their economic growth above average.
</P>
<P>
"The key of the current poverty alleviation task is how to help
poor areas have a more rapid growth rate," Liu said, noting that
an average economic growth rate is not sufficient for helping
those areas eliminate poverty by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 80 percent of China's 65 million poor
people live in the middle and the western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Liu counseled the west to take advantage of its abundant
resources to establish backbone industries as a means of helping
overall economic development.
</P>
<P>
A group of labor-intensive industries are being moved from the
east to the west because of uneven economic development, Liu said,
pointing out that this will provide an opportunity as well as a
challenge for the west.
</P>
<P>
Liu added that, ignoring technological advancement and
development of basic infrastructure has impaired the west's
economic development, and he urged the poorer regions in the west
to accelerate the scientific and technological process by
introducing both Chinese and overseas technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice President Al Gore today discussed on
telephone a series of issues concerning economic and technological
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, who are co-chairmen of the Russia-U.S.
Economic and Technological Cooperation Commission, focused their
discussions on the procedures to implement the resolution passed
by the 7th session of the commission in July this year, the
Itar-TASS news agency quoted Chernomyrdin's aide Mikhail Tarasov
as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement between the two sides, they did not
discuss any political issues, particularly Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's health or the situation related to U.S. missile attacks
against Iraq, Tarasov said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin announced last week that he would undergo a heart
surgery later this month, arousing fears about his ability to
govern the country.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin and Gore also discussed the issue of converting
Russian military technology into civilian use with the help of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. vice president promised to receive a Russia's Tatar
delegation in Washington, which will visit the United States on
September 12-14.
</P>
<P>
Tatarstan, a Russian republic, expects that the Export-Import
Bank of the United States would loan 300 million U.S. dollars for
a joint venture with General Motors to make automobiles in
Elabuga.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T Qingdao, a joint venture
of Lucent Technologies, the former AT&AMP;T network and system
business, has become a leading supplier of advanced switching
machines in China.
</P>
<P>
Founded by the US company and four Chinese partners in May,
1993, the joint venture focuses on applications of the 5ESS-2000
digital program-controlled switching system, one of the world's

The venture provides Chinese customers with some of the latest
telecommunications technology, such as ISDN (integrated service
digital network), the DEBS (digital exchange business service)
system, and CDMA (code division multiple accesses).
</P>
<P>
This is Lucent Technologies' largest production base for
program-controlled switching machines outside the US, with a
single-shift manufacturing capacity of one million lines annually.

<P>
Industrial analysts attribute the venture's rapid growth to its
good technical support from Bell Labs, the research and
development center of the global telecom industry, and a good
customer-oriented business policy.

<P>
To keep up with technical developments in the US, the venture
gas set up a high-speed special line to connect its research and
development disvisions with the headquarters of Bell Labs, and
invested two million US dollars in an information network to
provide customers with the latest technology information.
</P>
<P>
The venture's unique marketing strategy includes a rigorous
quality inspection system and a round-the-clock technical support
available for customers across the country.

<HEADLINE> 12 Percent Shanghai Residents Suffer From Obesity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A survey in Shanghai has
revealed that one in eight people in the city suffer from
overweight.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that the 12 percent obesity is close to the
standard in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The survey was carried out among nearly 14,000 people,
including 4,895 adults and over 9,093 young people from nine
districts in the city. It was conducted by Shanghai Medical
Sciences University and Shanghai Xiangshan Traditional Chinese
Medicine Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The research showed that the ratio of adults suffering from
obesity has reached 12.6 percent, and that of youngsters is 11.35
percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that differences in age, gender, and
education levels can influence the ratio of obesity.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen percent of female adults suffer from obesity, while the
level among male adults 10.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, more boys suffer from obesity than girls. The ratio of
boys is 14.7 percent, almost double that of girls.
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that children aged from seven to 12, and
people between aged 60 and 70, are easiest to fall victim to
obesity.
</P>
<P>
They also found that the higher education levels people have,
the less they are likely to suffer from obesity, especially among
women.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts suggested that citizens, especially people
suffering from obesity, should follow advice to change their life
styles and diets.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The board of the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) on September 9 decided to formally
invite the People's Bank of China to join its ranks, the bank's
first expansion in 25 years, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, BIS also invited central banks and monetary
autorities of Brazil, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi
Arabia, Singapore and the Republic of Korea to subscribe to BIS
shares and become members.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, said China's membership would significantly improve
his bank's cooperation with BIS and other shareholder banks.
</P>
<P>
BIS's decision was an international financial acknowledgement
of the Chinese economy's increasing strength and the success of
China's reform policies, said People's Bank of China authorities.
</P>
<P>
As BIS is an important power center for central bank officials,
membership in BIS will enable the People's Bank of China to
closely follow the major international financial developments.
</P>
<P>
It will also broaden Chinese regulators' contacts with their
financial counterparts throughout the world. That will
significantly help improve the Chinese financial industry's
regulatory and supervisory system.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1930, BIS has 32 members. It is known in the
international financial community for management and international
finance research.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, BIS was European-Oriented in membership and
operations. But as financial markets developed, especially the
fast growing economies in Asia and Latin America, BIS broadened
its focus.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China and BIS began business contacts in
1984, and cooperation rapidly developed in recent years.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
lifted its red tide ban in the eastern and northern parts of
Manila bay, Manila Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the government made the decision on Monday
following results of the water analysis conducted by the Bureau of
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the red tide task force, a special force formed
by President Ramos to supervise the development of red tide in the
country, claimed that waters in the two areas are already safe
from red tide contaminants.
</P>
<P>
But it warned that the red tide ban remains in force in the
western part of Manila bay.
</P>
<P>
The Health Department of the Philippines has recorded 126 cases
of red tide poisoning from June to August and a total of at least
30 red tide intoxication-related deaths this year. Most cases
resulted from the fishermen's contempt for the red tide ban.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni President Meets Arab League Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh met here today with visiting Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed developments concerning the Arab world
and the activation of the Arab League's role in strengthening Arab
solidarity and common Arab action, as well as new developments in
the Red Sea area and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, President Saleh praised the Arab League's
stances in activating the league's role and developing its
institutions to cope with regional and international changes.
</P>
<P>
Such efforts, the Yemeni president said, promote the Arab
League's role in defending Arab rights and the independence and
sovereignty of the member states.
</P>
<P>
Saleh emphasized the importance of the Arab League's role in
promoting Arab solidarity and implementing the decisions of the
Cairo Arab summit held in late June.
</P>
<P>
In response, Abdul-Meguid hailed Yemen's stances in supporting
Arab solidarity and consolidating the Arab League, expressing his
appreciation of Yemen's policy in handling its crisis with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Yemen and Eritrea have a long-standing dispute over three
islands that sit between them in the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
The dispute flared last December when Eritrea captured the
largest of the three islands, Greater Hanish, in a brief
battle. It occupied Lesser Hanish on August 10 and declared troop
withdrawal later in the month. Zuqar, the third island, remains
under Yemeni control.

<HEADLINE> Former Israeli FM Proclaims Candidacy for Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Labor Party Knesset
(parliament) member Ehud Barak has announced that he will contest
for chairmanship of the Labor party and premiership of the
country, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Barak, foreign minister of the former Labor government and
chief of the general staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, made
the announcement at a press conference in Tel Aviv this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Elections for the party leadership is reportedly scheduled for
the middle of next year and the country's next general elections
will take place in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Barak presented himself as the best choice for
the party and the country. He launched a stern attack on Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his rightwing Likud government,
saying that during its three months in power, the government has
already shown a negligence of the country's needs.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he added, Israel's economy and relations with
foreign countries and international community have drastically
deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
Barak praised the current 73-year-old Labor Party leader
Shimon Peres as an outstanding premier and one of the country's
great figures, and described himself as Peres' student.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that it is time for a change and he is the
man of the time.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Haim Ramon, his chief rival for successor to
Peres, Barak was careful not to attack him today. He called
Ramon, interior minister of the former Labor government, one of
the important people in the party.
</P>
<P>
In his reaction, Peres, who is now in New York, said that
Barak, like anyone else, has the right to vie for the party
leadership. He declared that he would find an appropriate time
to announce his own plan.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Barak was born in 1942 in Kibbutz Mishmar Hasharon and is
married with three children. He received B.S. in physics and
mathematics in Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and M.S. in
economic-engineering systems in Stanford University, California in
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Incumbent Speaker Announces His Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 9 (Xinhua) -- As a victory of his pro-Syrian
Amal movement in Sunday's parliamentary election in southern
Lebanon has become certain, incumbent Speaker Nabih Berri
today announced his candidacy for the speakership in Lebanon's
unicameral house.
</P>
<P>
Candidates on the joint list of Lebanon's two major Shiite
groups, Berri's Amal movement and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, are leading in an incomplete statistics in the
fourth of a five-phase general election Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Amal and Hezbollah, which have been engaged in uninterrupted
rivalries in the past two decades, only agreed to form the joint
ticket after Syria intensified its brokering efforts last week.
</P>
<P>
Partly due to a commitment of the two groups to the coalition,
the Sunday election was held without serious incidents taking
place in the area where both have strong militants.
</P>
<P>
With 65 percent of votes being counted until the sunset, 21
candidates on the joint list, including four Hezbollah members
and six Amal members, were emerging as certain winners, election
officials in southern Lebanon disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question at a press conference in his southern
Lebanese residence at Museileh today, the Shiite incumbent
house speaker confirmed his candidacy for the speakership in the
next parliament.
</P>
<P>
"If the question is whether I'm a candidate for the
speakership? The answer is yes," Berri said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the coalition between Amal and Hezbollah would
continue in the fifth round of election in the Beqaa, which is
to be held next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The coalition with Hezbollah includes the Beqaa and the
joint list of candidates will be announced after completing the
counting of vote in the south," the house speaker said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Amal and Hezbollah had reached an agreement in
principle on the name of the candidates, asserting that "the
election in the Beqaa is not only limited to Hezbollah and Amal,
there are also other forces which we respect and with which we
should consult."
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr has said that he will
announce the results of the election in south Lebanon tonight or
Tuesday morning, as soon as the counting is finished.
</P>
<P>
Besides Berri himself, there are five Amal candidates and four
Hezbollah candidates in the Amal-Hezbollah joint ticket in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 11 candidates in the coalition are
unexceptionally allies of Berri's Amal movement.
</P>
<P>
Some 130 candidates were competing for 23 parliamentary seats
allocated for south Lebanon, where Israel established a
1,100-square-kilometer "security zone" in 1985 as a buffer
against cross-border guerrilla attacks on its northern Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Two seats for Sunni Moslems were tentatively left vacant by
the Amal-Hezbollah coalition and they are reserved for Saida,
hometown of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's sister Bahia and another pro-government candidate,
Abdel Rahman Al-Bizri were contesting with two Hezbollah-backed
candidates, Mustafa Saad and Ali Sheikh Ammar, for the two
seats.
</P>
<P>
When Bahia is in the lead, the votes obtained by Al-Bizri and
Saad were very close and the last winner will emerge among them,
according to election officials.
</P>
<P>
Most of 82 out of the total 128 seats in the parliament were
won by pro-government candidates in the first three rounds of
election in Mount Lebanon, the north and Beirut.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The government of South
Mogadishu led by Hussein Mohamed Aidid today accused a Swedish
non-governmental organization and the European Union of employing
local press men "for their own interests."
</P>
<P>
"They are intermingling in Somalia's internal affairs," said
Radio South Mogadishu, quoting a spokesman for the Aidid's
Information Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The Swedish Institute of Peace and Life and the European
Union's Mogadishu Office should bear all consequencies for
establishing news agency and recruiting local press men to work
for their own particular interests," said the report.
</P>
<P>
This accusation came at a time when a new round of dialogues
are going on aimed at normalizing the ties between the
international community and the faction led by Hussein, who is
the son of Somalia's most powerful warlord, the late General
Mohamed Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
It was also the first time that Hussein's administration
accused the west for "intermingling in Somalia's internal
affairs."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Life and Peace and the EU are sponsoring "a
meaningless training for a few Somali journalists" of these
institutions," accusing these institutions of collaboration with
"less nationalistic elements".
</P>
<P>
"They are spending a lot of money donated by the international
community to Somalia's rehabilitation efforts on their own
particular interests," he added.

LUSAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Unionized workers of the
Zambia News Broadcasting Company (ZNBC) went on a wildcat strike
today to press for the removal of ZNBC Director General Duncan
Mbazima.
</P>
<P>
As the strike progressed, anti-Mbazima placards were seen
displayed in front of the main entrance to the mass media complex
in Lusaka, calling for the dissolution of the ZNBC board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
There is only one announcer in the news program of the ZNBC
television while there were usually two.

<P>
The workers accused the director general of insensitive to the
welfare of the workers.

<P>
Mbazima is on forced leave together with director of programs
Frank Mutubila.
</P>
<P>
Laurah Harrison, chairperson of the ZNBC board of directors
and permanent secretary of the Ministry of Information and
Broadcasting, said that the wildcat strike by the unionized
members of the national union of communication workers was
uncalled for as the board was investigating their grievances.
</P>
<P>
She termed the strike as illegal and urged the workers to return
to work by not later than 8:00 hours on Wednesday; otherwise they
should be considered to terminate their employment with ZNBC.

PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The French humanitarian group
Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) has distributed 4,000 rations of
food to Liberian children in the town of Tubmanburg, who are
suffering from malnutrition after a half-year siege by armed
bandits.
</P>
<P>
Nicolas de Torrente, an MSF doctor who works in Liberia, told
Agence France Presse that in Tubmanburg, 70 kilometers northwest
of Monrovia, 82 percent of children under five years old are
suffering from severe malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 45 percent among them have attained "kwashiorkor"
disease with edema all over their bodies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 75 percent of children aged between five and 12 are
suffering from malnutrition in that region, said de Torrente.
</P>
<P>
"The children's bellies are bloated, their skins are cracked,
and in certain cases, the flesh of their feet is split," he said.

Tubmanburg had been cut from the outside world for six months
and only lately was it accessible to United Nations aid groups and

<HEADLINE> Turkey Loses 27 Billion Dollars due to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Omer Akbel said here today that Turkey's cumulative
economic losses had amounted to 27 billion U.S. dollars since the
United Nations imposed economic sanctions against Iraq in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Akbel told reporters that Turkey had submitted the details and
figures to the U.N. Sanctions Committee with the application for
compensation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the implementation of the 986 Resolution of the
U.N. Security Council had raised the hope that Turkey's losses
involving the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipelines linking Turkey and Iraq
and other related economic developments might be compensated.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. air strikes against the selected air defense targets
in southern Iraq have reportedly led to the postponement of the
implementation of the reopening of the pipelines.
</P>
<P>
Akbel said: "We hope this postponement does not last
long. Turkey is paying the highest cost because of the
U.N. embargo in the region."
</P>
<P>
He added that the economic losses should be compensated by the
international community and that initiatives regarding this would
continue to be developed and put forward.
</P>
<P>
Akbel pointed out that the losses could be compensated in
concrete ways, such as "financial regulations, supplying energy,
or financial and economic privileges."

<HEADLINE> Canadians Want Queen Out of Citizenship Oath </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A new study has found that
Canadians support dropping royal references from the national oath
of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"People in various regions of the country said they would
rather swear allegiance to Canada than to Queen Elizabeth," the
Ottawa Citizen newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
A new Canadian citizen currently swears allegiance to the
British queen, her heirs and successors, and affirms that he or
she will obey the law and fulfill duties as a Canadian.
</P>
<P>
Yet, people who took part in June focus-group discussions had
strong negative reactions to the present wording.
</P>
<P>
"The principal source of irritation is the reference to Her
Majesty the Queen," said the study, which was prepared for the
Citizenship Department of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12 sessions were Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and
other Canadian cities. The groups were made up of equal numbers of
men and women aged between 25 and 59.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the discussions said the queen, whose family
has suffered a string of broken marriages and tabloid scandals,
evokes a monarchy in decline -- contrary to democratic Canadian
values.
</P>
<P>
They also felt references to the queen were out of step with
contemporary life and created a confusing image of Canada for
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
"The results will likely fuel speculation that Citizenship
Minister Lucienne Robillard, who has expressed a desire to
modernize the oath, will remove all mention of the monarchy," the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Any changes to the oath would require parliamentary approval,
and could be ready in time for the 50th anniversary of the first
Canadian Citizenship Act next year, it added.

<HEADLINE> 40 Percent Frenchmen Want to Have Own Companies: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 percent of
Frenchmen and Frenchwomen want to have their own companies, but
one in nine of them says they are discouraged by the barriers
existing in France which block the creation of companies, said a
poll published today.
</P>
<P>
Forty-one percent of the people reached by the poll said they
already had the desire to create their own companies, according to
the poll conducted on 942 people on August 30-31 by the National
Council of French Bosses, which will celebrate next Monday the
50th anniversary of its founding with the theme of "the spirit of
enterprise."
</P>
<P>
Among the 41 percent, 18 percent say they have set up their own
companies, while 23 percent say they are thinking about that but
have not put their projects into action.
</P>
<P>
Among those questioned below 35, 36 percent say they cannot
resist the temptation of having their own companies.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of Frenchmen and Frenchwomen think it is
"difficult" or "very difficult" to establish a company in
France today, while only 9 percent hold the opposite view.
</P>
<P>
Half of those questioned have named "heavy taxes charged on
enterprises by the government" as the primary reason for the
difficulty for individuals to run their companies, followed by
"nervousness of banks which don't dare to take risks," "lack of
confidence in young people," "labyrinth of bureaucratic processes"
and "lack of dynamism of the French economy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 71 percent of people criticize the French education
system for not teaching enough about "the spirit of enterprise,"
and 78 percent of them say France does not possess a good spirit
of enterprise as Japan, Germany and the United States do.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Takes Over SADC Chairmanship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano today formally took
over as the new chairman and vice-chairman of the 12-member
Southern African Development Community (SADC) in Gaborone.
</P>
<P>
The South African Press Association reported that Mandela was
unanimously elected new SADC Chairman at the organization's
recent heads of state summit last month in Lesotho capital
Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Mandela succeeded Botswana President Ketumile Masire, while
Chissano replaced King Mswati of Swaziland, who was not at the
handing-over ceremony in Gaborone.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Mandela's spokesman
Parks Mankahlana said the president had asked Chissano to join
him at the meeting at Masire's office because he wanted his
vice-chairman to play a more active role.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that this is the first time a SADC chairman
has asked his vice-chairman to play a role of any significance in
the regional body.
</P>
<P>
However, Mankahlana said Mandela's move was not aimed at
abrogating his responsibilities, but was a feature of his more
accommodating style of collective leadership.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende said Mandela
would be expected to take the initiative and play a leading role
in collective policy formation in SADC.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende drew a clear distinction between South Africa's
individual contribution as a nation to SADC and Mandela's role as
chairman.
</P>
<P>
Mandela would soon meet Mbuende and his deputy to acquaint
himself with SADC's daily workings before chairing his first
formal meeting of SADC in January next year in Namibia capital
Windhoek, said Mankahlana.
</P>
<P>
The SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks for More Funds to Fight Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today called on Congress to provide more than 1 billion dollars to
employ more Federal Bureau of Investigation agents to fight
terrorism and to improve U.S. airline security in general.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorists don't wait and neither should we," Clinton told
reporters at a White House ceremony at which he received a report
on airport security and urged Congress to act before it adjourns
in October.
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked for the report after the July 17 crash of TWA
Flight 800, which exploded over the Atlantic Ocean off New York,
killing all 230 people on board.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore, who chaired the White House Commission
on Aviation Safety and Security that wrote the report, announced
the major points of its report last week. The panel's
recommendations included a call for better bomb detection
equipment, profiling of passengers, matching passengers to their
baggage, increased use of bomb-sniffing dogs and running
background checks on employees with access to secure airport
areas.
</P>
<P>
Endorsing all these measures, Clinton said he wanted Congress
to provide money to go beyond the narrow issue of airline security
and fight terrorism more broadly at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Shortly I will submit to Congress a budget request for more
than 1 billion dollars to expand our FBI anti-terrorism forces and
to put the most sophisticated bomb detection machines in America's
airports," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would direct that all airport and airline
employees with access to secure areas be subjected to criminal
background checks. He also said he would require matching all
passengers to their bags and increased use of bomb-sniffing dogs
at certain airports.

<HEADLINE> Arms Surrendered by Factional Fighters Sent to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 pieces of arms
and over 5,000 rounds of ammunition put down by one of Liberia's
warring factions have been airlifted to the capital of Monrovia
by the West African Peacekeeping Force, known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said that the heavy weapons,
assorted rifles and ammunition were at the weekend loaded on two
of ECOMOG's military helicopters and flown to Monrovia from rural
Voinjama, 260 km north of the city.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the U.N. Observer Mission in Liberia
(UNOMIL) were present to monitor the loading of the arms and
ammunition, surrendered by the Mandingo wing of the United
Liberation Movement led by Alhaji Kromah, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to a peace agreement signed by Liberia's warring
factions last month in Nigeria, disarmament of some 60,000
factional fighters should be completed this year or on January 31
next year.
</P>
<P>
However, factional leaders agreed to begin voluntary
disarmament of their fighters to speed up the peace process in
the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> S.Leonean President Escapes Coup Attempt, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's first elected
civilian president today escaped a military coup attempt plotted
by some military officers, intelligent sources announced.
</P>
<P>
They said the military officers had planned to attack
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah on his way today to the state house.
But the president was unhurt thanks to preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
"The plot has already been detected by us, and preventive
steps were taken against the plot," said an intelligent officer
who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
More details are not available at the moment. But defense
sources said three military officers, believed to be leaders of
the coup, have been arrested and under questioning.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah, who took office in March this year after a
multi-party elections to end military rule for the first time in
the West African country, linked the plot to soldiers close to
the former military leaders and vowed not to be intimidated.
</P>
<P>
The state radio this evening urged the public to "remain calm
and go about their normal business."
</P>
<P>
"The situation is under control. This incident is not a
serious threat to the government or to the nation," said the
radio report.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said there was no obvious sign of extra security in
the streets of the capital Freetown. But officials said security
would be stepped up, particularly at sensitive sites like the
radio station, although the move would remain discreet.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone is one of the world's poorest countries despite
the fact that some of the world's finest diamonds are being mined
in its territory. It won independence from Britain in 1961.
</P>
<P>
Military leader Julius Maada Bio, who took over power in a
successful palace coup in January from former military Head of
State Valentine Strasser, handed power to Kabbah after March's
multi-party elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Investigators on Monday
were searching for evidence that an arsonist might have set the
fire that burned a predominantly black church down in the predawn
hours in Sacremento, California.
</P>
<P>
City Fire Marshal Gordon Duncan said the alarm rang a few
minutes before midnight Sunday, only a few hours after members of
the New Home Missionary Baptist Church celebrated its 35th
anniversary, the United Press International reported.
</P>
<P>
An hour after the first alarm, all that remained of the
3,750-square-foot building was one large standing wall, a section
of a smaller wall, and a white cross.
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure what's happened yet," the fire marshal said.
"What we know is that we had a very fast-moving fire that always
causes firefighters to be suspicious. It was unusual because it
went up in flames so fast."
</P>
<P>
Agents of the FBI and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms converged at the scene in hopes of determining the fire's
cause, and if it was related to a rash of recent arson church
fires across the United States.
</P>
<P>
Pastor John Rogers said he suspected foul play and racism.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Urges Expanded Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa today urged expanded economic ties with Iran amid
threatening of the United States to sanction countries doing
Business with the middle east power.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state banquet in honor of visiting Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani at the State House this
evening, Mkapa invited his guest to work with him to eliminate
impediments to the bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"For historical reasons, our main trading partners have
always been the economic north and to some extent our
countries. However, with clearly-set targets and firm
determination, economic cooperation between more countries of
the economic south can be increased significantly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian president called on Iranian enterprises to
invest in his country under the on-going divestiture program for
mutual benefits of the two countries, saying the Tanzanian is
creating better environment to encourage foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He told the Iranian leader that since the establishment of the
Investment Promotion Center in 1992, over 600 projects worth
1.5 billion U.S. Dollars had been approved in various sectors
in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also asked Iran to invest in East African countries of
Kenya and Uganda in an effort to help step up the East African
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian president noted that developing countries,
including Tanzania, remained victims of adverse terms of the
international trade system which affected Tanzania farmers.
</P>
<P>
"This year the terms of trade for Africa will worsen by five
percent compared to last year, and our farmers are already
feeling this pinch," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of external debts, Mkapa said Tanzania was
currently devoting almost 40 percent of its national budget to
pay back its foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania spent five U.S. Dollars per capita to
service part of an enormous debt but can only afford 1.3 U.S.
Dollars on health and another one U.S. Dollar on education.
</P>
<P>
"With a capita income of about 125 U.S. Dollars per year, we
have a per capita debt of almost 280 U.S. Dollars," said the
Tanzanian president.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also said Tanzania was dismayed by the persistent
conflict in Africa and called on United Nations and the
international community to support the peace process in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the international community and United Nations
to uphold sanctions imposed by Tanzania and other countries of
Great Lakes region to the conflict-stricken Burundi.
</P>
<P>
President Rafsanjani is scheduled go to Kibaha in Tanzania's
Coast Region where he will inspect the Soga Secondary School,
built with Iran's financial assistance, before visiting Zanzibar
later.

</P>
<P>
An WPF assessment team, which visited the town on Saturday,

</P>
<P>
Elguindi, who projected the population of the town at between

LAGOS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations fact-finding
mission on the disputed Bakassi peninsula has delayed its visit
to Nigeria and Cameroun, said a report from the News Agency of
Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a U.N. spokeswoman as saying that the

countries, which have clashed repeatedly over the oil-rich
peninsula since 1994, from September 6 to September 18.
</P>
<P>
The mission' mandate includes gathering information and
formulating suggestions to help the parties to adopt
confidence-building measures and establish an atmosphere of
mutual trust and confidence between them.

<P>
It is also expected to examine concrete and specific measures
designed to reduce tension between the two countries and prevent

won a narrow victory in the May election, indicating that the
Clinton Administration is putting a further brake on the faltering
peace process because of his hard-line policy with the
Palestinians and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the right-wing Israeli leader held a
breakthrough meeting with Palestinian leader yasser Arafat, the
result of the American hard pressure as a way of giving momentum
to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
After the Israeli-Palestinian summit, Christopher urged Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy in London on Sunday that Israel should
now take some concrete and tangible steps.
</P>
<P>
Yet Netanyahu shows staunch resistance toward so-called
"American impatience" over the slow pace of the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Christopher was said to remind Netanyahu during their meeting
that he has still not met a commitment to withdraw most Israeli
troops from the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu was determined that the peace process would fall
apart if Israeli troops are withdrawn from Hebron, given the
volatile situations there.
</P>
<P>
Christopher also said a "substantial easing of the closure" in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip would now be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
Israel has recently taken some steps to ease Palestinian
economic misery in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where
unemployment surpasses 50 percent. Netanyahu agreed last week on
several measures toward that end, including the issuance of 20,000
additional work permits for Palestinians, faster security checks
at crossing points and more VIP passes for businessmen.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials said those moves were "not enough".
</P>
<P>
"It's no great secret we've been frustrated with Netanyahu," a
senior U.S. official close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Brokering of a resumption in negotiations between
Israel and Syria appears even less likely than pressuring
Netanyahu into lifting the closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he "hoped there would be a resumption of talks
with Syria", but not with any preconditions such as complete
withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights, which is in total
contrast with "land-for-peace" formula agreed by the former
Israeli labour government.

<HEADLINE> More EU Energy Goes to Transport: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Transport's share of EU's
(European Union) total final energy consumption has now overtaken
that of industry, rising from 16.7 percent in 1960 to 30.8 percent
in 1994, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
Road transport, a major contributor to the rise, consumed 83.3
percent of the share in 1994, compared with 57.5 percent in 1960,
according to a report Monday from Eurostat, the statistical office
of the European Communities.
</P>
<P>
The share of rail transport fell from 30.7 percent to 20.7
percent; that of inland waterways and the sea was down significantly
to under half the 1960 level. But aviation's share rose from 6.4
percent to 11.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was also learned that transport consumed 64 percent of
petroleum products in 1994, of which 85 percent was used on the
roads.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that for road transport, "there is little
possibility at present of fuel substitution. Aviation...suffers the
same constraints..."
</P>
<P>
The report was adopted aiming for a better understanding of the
relationship between transport, energy, fiscal structures and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Pursuit of "sustainable mobility" is an objective of the EU's
common transport policy. But the report says that "the increasing
and unsustainable demands for energy and for land" are two main
obstacles to the attainment of this objective.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Teens Now Twice as Interested in Drugs in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of American
teenagers who expect to try illegal drugs has increased, possibly
even doubled, since 1995, according to a survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The National Center of Addiction and Substance Abuse at
Columbia University in New York reported that in 1996, 22 percent
of teenagers said they were very likely, or somewhat likely, to
try illegal drugs, compared to only 11 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 86 percent of teenagers told an interviewer that
they would "never" try illegal drugs. By 1996, only 51 percent
said so.
</P>
<P>
The center worked with Luntz Research Companies on interviewing
of 1,200 youths between the ages of 12 and 17, as well as 1,166
parents with children in that age group.
</P>
<P>
The new survey revealed that 46 percent of parents anticipate
their kids to use illegal drugs. Forty percent of parents think
there is not much they can do to keep their children drug-free.
Society-at-large is to blame for the prevalence of drugs in
schools, said 44 percent of the parents. Only 14 percent of the
parents said they were the ones responsible for drug use in
schools.
</P>
<P>
Teens who realize their parents smoked marijuana are more
likely to experiment with the drug themselves, the survey said.

The seizure of 180kg of the drug is the largest haul this year

Unusually, the drugs were not found as the result of a targeted

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Stresses Prevention in Peace Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today stressed importance of preventive
action in peace-making and peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the International Peace
Academy's Seminar Series on Peacemaking and Peace-keeping this
morning, Boutros-Ghali noted that there was too little prevention
and too much cure though prevention was much less costly than
cure.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the lacuna in peace operations to lack of a
culture of prevention, lack of diplomats qualified for prevention
and lack of political will.
</P>
<P>
On the cultural factor, he noted that very often, international
mediation, or even action, was accepted by the protagonists after
the situation had passed a critical threshold, which led to
greater human and materials losses, and more difficulties for
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
As for the qualified diplomats, "we need a greater number of
diplomats with the training, with the experience, and with the
moral authority, to undertake preventive work on behalf of the
United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of political will, he noted an emerging pattern of
unwillingness to prevent, control or stop a wide range of
conflict, followed by a readiness to step in after the killing was
over and the carnage had subsided.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the seminars of the International Peace Academy
will promote a greater acceptance and understanding of preventive
action," he said.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Figure Still Refuses to Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Susan McDougal surrendered
to federal marshals Monday in Little Rock, Arkansas, to begin
serving jail time for contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal, President Bill Clinton's former Whitewater
business partner, spent more than four hours in a federal court
lockup awaiting transfer to an Arkansas jail, according to media
reports.
</P>
<P>
A federal judge cited her for contempt last week for refusing
to answer questions about Clinton before a federal grand jury, and
gave her until Monday to change her mind. Mrs. McDougal, 41, could
be held for up to 18 months but could be released immediately if
she relents and agrees to testify.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so angry that they hold themselves out to be so full of
integrity, so above reproach," news reports quoted Mrs. McDougal
as saying of Whitewater prosecutors outside the federal
courthouse. "They will do anything. There's nothing they won't do"
to get the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
She said last week that she wouldn't testify because she didn't
want to subject herself to perjury charges if her story conflicted
with that of other prosecution witnesses. One of her lawyers,
Jenniffer Horan, denied that Mrs. McDougal's silence was intended
to protect the president.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal also insisted that her decision to go to jail was
her own, with no prompting or assistance from the White House.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry had no comment on Mrs.
McDougal's jailing.
</P>
<P>
McDougal repeated accusations that Whitewater independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's office offered her a deal to incriminate
the Clintons. Starr's office has denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal was convicted May 28 of obtaining in 1986 a
fraudulent 300,000-dollar loan, some of which went toward the
purchase of land for the Whitewater venture. She was sentenced to
two years in prison, beginning September 30.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright found
Mrs. McDougal in contempt for refusing to answer questions from
the Whitewater grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Among the questions she refused to answer, Mrs. McDougal said,
was whether Clinton told the truth when he testified at her trial
via videotape that he knew nothing about the loan or the land
deal.
</P>
<P>
Horan said the president's attorneys "have never, ever
indicated to me in any way that they did not want Susan McDougal
to answer any question ever put to her. They have never indicated
anything like that to me or to my client."
</P>
<P>
Ms. Horan said she would file a notice of appeal and a request
for a stay of the punishment.

<P>
NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rallied again
Monday on renewed optimism that the latest signs of strong
economic growth won't send inflation and interest rates soaring.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 73.98 to 5,733.84,
moving closer to its all-time high at 5,778.00, set on May 22.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 9-to-5
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with its volume totaling
310.89 million shares, down from 348.69 million in the Friday
session.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures advanced sharply as well.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 3.61 to 356.28, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.09 to 663.77.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.33 to 1,148.72, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 1.94 to 561.96.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said stock investors were cheered to see interest
rates ease again as the bond market advanced for the second
straight session after Friday morning's robust employment report.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices rose, the yield on the 30-year Treasury fell to
about 7.07 percent, down from late Friday's 7.10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investors eased their fears that the Federal
Reserve will move aggressively to contain inflation with an
aggressive increase in the central bank's lending rates, choking
economic growth and profits.

LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
surged strongly and closed sharply higher today on the back of a
confident showing on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
British shares climbed above 3,900 on the FTSE 100 index and
closed 17.8 points higher, only 7.9 points below its closing high
set on August 28.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a solid advance on Wall Street, sentiment in London
was reinforced by the latest set of UK producer prices showing
benign inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, the Frankfurt market also closed comfortably higher
in response to Wall Street's advance on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Of all the three major European markets, Frankfurt made the

<HEADLINE> UN General Assembly Works to Ban Nuclear Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. General
Assembly (GA)convened on Monday in an effort to approve the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which failed to get
approved in the Conference on Disarmament last month.
</P>
<P>
Under consideration in the General Assembly is a draft
resolution put forward by Australia and 126 countries, seeking
approval of the Treaty and its open for signature.
</P>
<P>
After two and half years' negotiations, the 61-nation
Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament was unable to open the
Treaty for signature because India refused to give its consent.
According to the conference's rules, decisions must be made by
consensus.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the General Assembly can vote by a majority vote
to approve the treaty. For more than two weeks, Australia has been
seeking to bypass India by bringing the Treaty to the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"What is at issue is the fulfillment of a promise, a promise
made amongst ourselves to the international community for over
thirty years, a promise we are now able to keep," said Australian
Ambassador Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
"We ask for deep reflection upon the milestone in history this
action will lay down - agreement that there shall never again be
nuclear explosions," he said. "The co-sponsors urge all present in
this room to support this resolution, in favor of all humanity."
</P>
<P>
Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs Sha Zukang of China hoped
the Treaty can be opened for signature as soon as possible and be
universally acceded to and implemented.
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion of the CTBT shall, for the first time and in
the form of an international legal instrument, comprehensively ban
nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosion in
all environments and at any place," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This will surely facilitate the process of nuclear disarmament
and prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation, thereby enhancing
international peace and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, though, that a nuclear test ban by itself is not the
ultimate objective.
</P>
<P>
"It is one step forward to the complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. We hold that the
international community should continue to promote nuclear
disarmament," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the General Assembly, Indian Ambassador Prakash
Shah expressed opposition to the proposal of Australia.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that the GA should consider the CTBT in its
essential perspective, the perspective of nuclear disarmament and
progress towards the common objective of a nuclear weapon free
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned that the resumed session is being
asked to consider a text which disguises the ineluctable fact that
it is a text on which the negotiating body was unable to reach
consensus; was not even forwarded by the Ad hoc Committee on the
Nuclear test ban to the Plenary of the Conference on Disarmament,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen countries made speeches in the first day of the
meeting. The General Assembly will continue its consideration of
the item on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tries to Be Less Intrusive in Okinawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday it will seek to reduce the impact of American operations in
Okinawa, Japan, as voters in the island had sent a message to
Washington that they do not welcome the U.S. military presence.
</P>
<P>
The island's referendum came nearly one year after the rape of
an elementary school girl by three U.S. servicemen sparked
widespread outrage over the continuing American presence 24 years
after Okinawa was returned to Japan.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming 89 percent voted in the affirmative on a single
question: "do you favor or oppose a review of the Japan-U.S.
status of Forces Agreement and the consolidation and reduction of
U.S. military bases in the prefecture?"
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the outcome
was not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States hopes to use a mechanism established
by the two governments to ease the concerns of Okinawans.
</P>
<P>
"We seek to reduce the impact of the American military presence
in Okinawa, consistent with our responsibilities under the Mutual
Security Treaty that we have in place with the Japanese," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burns, however, said American troops are stationed on Okinawa
under a bilateral agreement, and he said: "We're committed to keep
American forces in Japan."

SARAJEVO, September 9 (Xinhua) - The security chiefs of
Bosnia's three ethnic factions on Monday signed an agreement to
provide security guarantees for home-coming voters on the election
day.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by the Bosnian Federation Interior
Minister Avdo Hebib for the Muslims side, his deputy Jozo Leutar

Implementation Force(IFOR).
</P>
<P>
The three sides confirmed in the accord their commitment to
secure maximum presence of police on those roads and free passage
of all passengers and to ban demonstrations or any other form of
gathering along those roads.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will permit that transport of voters be carried
out in vehicles with eight or more seats, each of which must have
a clear destination sign and that all vehicles be checked by local
police forces, who will be monitored by international police and
IFOR.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today called on protecting women in
conflict, promoting further advancement of women in various social
sectors and achieving full equality in the job market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting to mark the first anniversary of the
Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing last September,
entitled "One Year After Beijing," Boutros-Ghali said that the
conference was a crucial one for the advancement of women
everywhere and a bright episode in the long history of the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"All of us, gathered here today, owe a debt of gratitude to the
Government of China for making this conference possible, for
hosting the largest conference in the history of the United
Nations. Yet we all of us here owe an even greater debt of
gratitude to the pioneers of the advancement of women, at the
United Nations and in the non-governmental community, who have
toiled for many years to bring us to Beijing," he said.
</P>
<P>
While discussing the progress, the secretary-general raised
three issues: women in conflict, women in society and women in
work.
</P>
<P>
On women in conflict, "civil conflict and internal strife, both
on the rise, claim an ever greater proportion of women and
children," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"How should United Nations peace operations and humanitarian
efforts respond to this new trend," he asked.
