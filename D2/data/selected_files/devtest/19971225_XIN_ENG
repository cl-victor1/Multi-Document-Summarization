<HEADLINE> Pakistan Keen to Bring Peace in Afghanistan: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is keen to bring
peace and stability in war-torn Afghanistan, Pakistani Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan said Wednesday in a meeting with ousted
Afghan President Burhannuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
It was emphasized at the meeting that there is need for all
Afghans to sit together and work out a peace plan, according to
Foreign Office officials, who declined to go into details of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani, who was overthrown by the Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia in September last year, arrived in Pakistan Tuesday at the
invitation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
It was Rabbani's first visit to Pakistan since the hardline
Taliban took over Kabul, capital of Afghanistan, last year.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani is now heading the anti-Taliban northern alliance,
which is composed of forces led mainly by ethnic Uzbek warlord
Rashid Dostum and former Afghan military chief Ahmad Masood.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Rabbani Tuesday evening, Sharif said
Pakistan, which recognized the Taliban government in May, still
takes a neutral stand in the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also said Pakistan encourages the parties to sit at the
table for resolving their differences.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani officials described Rabbani's visit as part of
Pakistan's efforts to bring durable peace and stability in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In October, Sharif held a meeting with Taliban leader Mulla
Rabbani here and urged him to reach out to other ethnic groups and
factions.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia, who vow to impose strict Islamic law in
Afghanistan, control about two thirds of the country while the
northern alliance holds the remaining one third.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambia registered a 3.5
percent economic growth rate this year, two percent below the
targeted 5.5 percent due to unfavorable weather conditions,
Finance Minister Ronald Penza said today.
</P>
<P>
he told a news briefing here that annual inflation rate has

<P>
Last year the country achieved a 6.4 percent economic growth

</P>
<P>
Penza said the economic performance of the country this year
has been positive as it has managed a budget surplus of 62.5
billion Kwacha (about 47 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Despite the October 28 abortive coup, investors' confidence
has not been affected, he said, adding that over 100 million
Dollars has been pumped into the country by investors this year.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that 1998 will be a prosperous year for Zambia as
it will experience unprecedented economic growth while
unemployment will drastically be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Penza said all civil servants who are to be retrenched in the
process of implementing the public service reform program (PSRP)
will be paid their packages.
</P>
<P>
The exercise to be conducted over a two-year period will
gobble a total of 116 billion Kwacha (about 87 million Dollars),
he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will put in 20 billion Kwacha for the exercise,
which will start this month, while donors will foot the other 96
billion Kwacha, according to the minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The NATO expansion will not
lead to a breakup of the military system of the Commonwealth of
the Independent States (CIS), a high-ranking CIS official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
General Viktor Prudnikov, chief of the CIS headquarters for
coordinating military cooperation, made the remarks at a press

republics by a legacy which will not allow them to break away from
the CIS.
</P>
<P>
He noted that military cooperation is broadening among CIS
countries.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Spending Slows in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer spending
slowed slightly in November with spending increase of 0.4 percent
to 5.59 trillion U.S. dollars at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate, the Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
This was down from a 0.5 percent gain in the previous month and
also below analysts' predictions of another 0.5 percent increase
in November.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported that personal incomes increase
jumped 0.8 percent to a 7.03 trillion dollar rate, up from 6.97
trillion dollars in October, when they advanced 0.6 percent. It
was the biggest increase since a 1 percent gain in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Many retailors say that despite rising incomes and widespread
discounting, they are not experiencing the big sales they expected
during what usually is their busiest period of the year.
</P>
<P>
Spending on durable goods, which include big-ticket items such
as computers and electronic items expected to last more than three
years, rose 0.8 percent in November after falling 0.2 percent in
October. But spending on nondurable goods such as food and fuel
and on services both edged up just 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending usually represents two-thirds of the U.S.
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Private wages and salaries shot up 43.1 billion dollars after
climbing 27.6 billion dollars in October. Employment and average
weekly hours and hourly earnings all increased.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income or income after taxes picked up by 0.7
percent, a higher increase from 0.5 percent a month earlier and
the largest gain since a 0.9 percent increase in June 1996.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Says Stability Is of "Utmost Importance" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
called on the country's law enforcement departments to make
continuous efforts to maintain social stability, saying that
stability is of "utmost importance."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national law enforcement conference which ended
here today, Jiang, also general secretary of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China, analysed the international and
domestic situations.
</P>
<P>
"The domestic situation as a whole is good," he said. "We must
fully use all favourable conditions and give full play to all of
our advantages to achieve new victory in reform, development and
stability."
</P>
<P>
"The foundation for maintaining social and political stability
is concentrating on developing our economy and steadily improving
people's life," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Stability is the prerequisite for reform and development," he
noted, adding, "Without stability, we would achieve nothing and
would forfeit what we have achieved."
</P>
<P>
"The Party committees and governments at all levels,
particularly the number one man in the leadership, must shoulder
the political responsibility for maintaining stability," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"As the special force of maintaining social stability, the
country's law enforcement departments must continue to give top
priority to maintaining social stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about maintaining public security, Jiang pointed out
that public security is of immediate concern to the life and
property of the people, to the stable environment of reform,
opening up and the modernization drive and to the international
image of China.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining a good public order needs the common efforts of
the whole Party and the whole society," he said. Jiang also
stressed the necessity of seriously cracking down on grave
criminal activities, saying, "Cracking down on serious crimes is
an important link in comprehensively improving public order."
</P>
<P>
All law enforcement departments must take all kinds of
appropriate measures to crack down on grave criminal activities
which severely jeopardize public security and endanger people's
life and property, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the Chinese president also pointed out the
corruption within the country's law enforcement departments.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption such as taking bribes and bending the law or
bullying and oppressing the people has seriously tarnished the
image of our law enforcement departments and hurt the prestige of
our Party and the government," he warned.
</P>
<P>
"Those people who abuse their power or pervert justice for a
bribe must be expelled from the law enforcement departments
relentlessly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed three aspects in future work: to continue to
strengthen legislature, to ensure that government departments do
administrative work according to law and to make sure that law
enforcement departments strictly enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
Chinese premier Li Peng also gave a speech at today's
meeting. He emphasized that the political and professional quality
of people working in the law enforcement departments should be
improved continuously.
</P>
<P>
He said more efforts will be made on enterprise reform and
government restructuring next year, and hence social stability is
all the more important for the country.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Haunts France This Christmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The 12.5 percent unemployment
rate is haunting the Christmas season in France as militants and
unionists staged several protests over the past week against
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine Aubry
Thursday urged the prefectural governments to take care of the
unemployed people "in distress" and solve some "emergency cases."
</P>
<P>
French unions, including the Confederation Generale du
Travaile, joined the protests for the first time on Wednesday
organized by unemployed workers in Paris, demanding a Christmas
bonus of 3,000 to 5,000 francs (500 to 840 U.S. dollars) for each
unemployed worker.
</P>
<P>
The official unemployment insurance agency UNEDIC had to close
its door in Paris Wednesday because of protest activities.
</P>
<P>
Similar protests were staged on the same day in Havre in
northern France and in Marseille, and police forced some 40
unemployed people out of an occupied mayoral office building of a
district in Marseille.
</P>
<P>
The workers of a Mercedes d'Etoile automobile plant in Valence
in southeast France staged a strike on that day to support their
manager, who was said to have been fired by the superiors for
keeping the workers on the job.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as big shops reported better Christmas shoppings this
year than the last, the question is also centered on social
disparity in France.
</P>
<P>
The daily Liberte de l'Est said that one can cite a long list
of social conflicts from unemployment to homelessness at this
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Berry Republicain said that Christmas now remains
only as a "reserve of remote impressions of fairy-tales," and the
daily L'Humanite said that the seemingly rising prosperity as is
shown remains to be proved yet.
</P>
<P>
While preparing a law on social solidarity to be presented in
February, the government is studying a proposal by the Communist
Party to subsidize a 1,500 francs (260 U.S. dollars) social aid
for each unemployed workers who are more than 55 years old.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Calls for Security Cooperation with Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has called
for boosting security cooperation with Yemen and expressed desire
to resolve their long-standing border disputes, the Saudi Press
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a message to his Yemeni counterpart Hussain Moh'd Arab
Wednesday, Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdel-Aziz
called for "means of boosting security cooperation," the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
It is the second message on the issue sent by Nayef to Arab in
a week, according to the agency. But it gave no details of the
message.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources in Saudi capital Riyadh were quoted as saying
that the message came within the context of ongoing consultations
between the two countries after a Yemeni patrol allegedly
infiltrated into Saudi Arabia and killed two Saudis and a Yemeni
last month.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that it is in line with Saudi desire to
enhance bilateral security cooperation and resolve the border
disputes according to the memorandum of understanding signed by
the two Arab neighbors in 1995, which outlined the principles of a
solution.
</P>
<P>
Many parts of the 2,000-kilometer border between Saudi Arabia
and Yemen remain undefined, some of which are believed to be
oil-rich.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been making efforts to settle the border
disputes to eliminate the last obstacle to the development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdul-Karim
al-Aryani paid a visit to Saudi Arabia last month to discuss ways
of solving the border disputes.
</P>
<P>
He delivered a letter from Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
to Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz dealing with the efforts to seek
a solution to the territorial disputes and the shooting incident
at the border.

LONDON, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A strong gale and heavy rain
hit Britain today, leaving at least two people dead and thousands
without electricity on Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
The storm from the Atlantic Ocean downed trees, snapped power
lines and ripped tiles from roofs, reports said.
</P>
<P>
North Wales and northern England were the worst hit with dozens
of roads blocked by hundreds of fallen trees.

The two deaths occurred in separate road accidents in
northwestern England, police said. A woman was killed when a large
tree fell on her car, and a second woman died in a multiple car
pile-up that resulted from storm-related circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Police and motoring organizations across Britain were warning
people not to drive today unless the journey was absolutely
necessary. Torrential rains made driving difficult, and more high
winds were expected in the south and west of England later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said 35,000 homes lost power in the overnight storm
in northwestern England and Wales, although power crews had

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia will gradually increase
its military spending in the next decade, according to a
governmental program governing the reform and transfer of the
defense industry.
</P>
<P>
The program, which will govern the reform and transfer of the
Russian defense industry till 2005, provides that military
spending will account for 3.5 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) between 1998 and 2000 and 3.3 percent for the period
between the year 2000 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
But since the GDP is expected to increase by five percent
during this period, the net military spending will increase
gradually.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the military reform and transfer, Russian Deputy
Prime Minister Yakov Urinson said that by the year 2005, the
number of defense enterprises will be reduced to 600 from the
current 1700.
</P>
<P>
He said that the reform and transfer are designed to meet the
needs of the changed geopolitics and the country's changed demands
for the military forces.

<HEADLINE> Golden Gate Bridge Adds Cables on Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Ironworkers on Thursday
began to install a system of double cables to close a gap on
famous Golden Gate Bridge in San francisco after a tragic accident
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the accident, a two-year-old girl plunged 170 feet to
her death through a gap of 9.5 inches between the sidewalk and the
roadway. The girl's father has blamed her death on defective
bridge design and construction.
</P>
<P>
The two-tiered cables will halve the gap which allowed the
girl's body to slip through. Explaining design reasons for the
gap, an engineer said the space was included so that water and
debris can drain off the bridge and to minimize rocking during
high winds. It also was designed as a buffer in the event that a
car slams into the divider separating the sidewalk and the roadway.
</P>
<P>
The engineer said that the gap complied with the state Uniform
Building Code when the designs were completed in the late
1970s. The code, however, was changed to allow only a six-inch gap
between the time when the designs were draw and the time when the
project was completed. Until the accident, he said, nobody had
ever complained about the gap, let alone fallen into it.
</P>
<P>
A state senator has called for an investigation of all state
bridges to see whether other hazards exist.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Freedom Movement Chief Yazdi Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary General of
Iran's Freedom Movement Ebrahim Yazdi was released today after a
10-day imprisonment, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
A judge of the first branch of Tehran's Islamic Revolution
court was quoted as announcing that Yazdi was detained on December
14 on charges of desecrating religious sanctities.
</P>
<P>
"Yazdi was released today upon completion of the necessary
investigation and posting bail pending the final court verdict,"
said the judge.
</P>
<P>
A staff member from Yazdi's office, who declined to mention
name, confirmed his release in a telephone interview with
Xinhua. However, he said that his organization did not understand
why Yazdi was arrested and why he was freed.
</P>
<P>
On December 15, the Freedom Movement issued a statement saying
that Yazdi was summoned by the Islamic Revolution court for
questioning and then put into Tehran's prison of Evin without any
charges. Iran's Judiciary claimed that Yazdi was detained
according to law.
</P>
<P>
The organization was founded in 1961 by Mehdi Bazargan, late
Iranian prime minister of the interim government formed in the
wake of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim Yazdi was elected as secretary general of the
organization in January 1995 after the demise of Bazargan.
</P>
<P>
However, the organization was not granted formal permission to
carry out activities since the government asked political parties
and organizations to register in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Lamp Map Lightens Up Night Roads in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Newly installed lamp maps are
helping people find their way more easily in the labyrinth of
winding streets and roads in this north China port city,
especially at night.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 lamp maps, turned on and off along with the
street lights, have been installed beside bus stops in the busiest
parts of downtown such as the Heping Road and the Nanjing Road.
</P>
<P>
With the location of the bus stop on the street, the names and
directions of surrounding streets, and the route of the given bus
indicated, the maps are providing both locals and people from
outside the city much convenience in the city famous for its
tricky roads and streets, where one usually starts walking
eastward and yet finds oneself at the southern end of the city.
</P>
<P>
Unlike its neighbor Beijing, where the planning of several
feudal dynasties had given the ancient capital a neat chess-board
pattern with straight north-south and east-west streets, Tianjin
is marked by streets winding through different parts of the city
which used to lead to the concessions of different western powers.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin will have a total of 500 lamp maps installed on 50 main
streets and roads next year.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Ngilu, Woman Challenger for Kanya's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- One of the first two women
ever to vie for the top seat in Kenya, Charity Ngilu, as many
people believe, stands a real chance in Monday's poll mainly due
to her clarion call for changes.
</P>
<P>
If successful, she would become sub-Saharan Africa's first
elected female president.
</P>
<P>
She said she strongly believes in education and grass-roots
economic development as the main vehicles for social and economic
emancipation.
</P>
<P>
Elimination of corruption, restoration to people's sense of
self-confidence, freedom from political oppression, one president
one term and gender equality are among the high priorities Ngilu
has listed in her post-election program.
</P>
<P>
She is said to be fresh, clean and untainted by scandals and
has far less tribal color than any other opposition presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
"Ngilu is actually talking about changes and development," a
local political analyst explained to Xinhua why he supports the
woman, adding that his point is common among educated people in
urban areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
With the slogan of "A New Beginning" brandished on banners
that bear her symbol of a clock, an energetic 45-year-old Ngilu
is widely seen as a spokeswoman for the generation after that of
President Daniel arap Moi, 73 and in power for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
"I want to be very close to the people, easily accessible and
involve people in making their decisions about every facet of
their life," she said in a recent interview with local media.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking for power for the sake of it. I want to be
something of a convener, a facilitator of good governance. I want
to bring Kenyans together to harness their resources and
jump-start this stalled country once again," she claimed.
</P>
<P>
The fact that estimated 55 percent Kenyans are women may also
afford her some advantage.
</P>
<P>
"Men have ruled the country for a long time. May women prove
they are better," said a Luo girl living here who said she surely
will cast her ballot in favor of Ngilu.
</P>
<P>
Her campaign team seemed to have mastered the drills of public
appeal, presenting her as a stable family woman, with her husband
Mike Ngilu, an engineer, two of her three children and her aged
mother, all voiced their support for her run.
</P>
<P>
The concern raised by Ngilu applies to most of the vast
Eastern, Coast, North-Eastern and two-thirds of the Rife Valley
Province where Moi started his career, local observers say.
</P>
<P>
Her presence has invigorated the campaign, but many Kenyan men
and women still believe a man should lead the country. Her Kamba
tribe was solidly behind Moi in 1992 and she herself lacks any
experience in all levels of governance.
</P>
<P>
As one of rare rags-to-riches women in the country, Ngilu rose
to her rank from humble beginnings.
</P>
<P>
She came from a family with a poor Christian preacher for a
father and a hard-working mother who gave birth to a total of 13
children. She is the ninth in the line.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that after more than 30 years of independence
the children of Kenya should be living in circumstances
comparable to those I grew up in," she claimed, saying she knows
the misery of being poor from first-hand experience.
</P>
<P>
After having graduated from Alliance Girls High School, she
attended both the Government Secretarial College and the Kenya
Institute of Administration for a secretarial course.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Ngilu became the personal secretary to the former
Central Bank Governor Duncan Ndegwa for three years before moving
to America-based Chase Manhattan Bank's Nairobi branch as an
administrator.
</P>
<P>
She quit employed ranks in 1989 to start running her family
business -- a small bakery and a restaurant in Machakos town
nearby Nairobi. Later, she launched her main business -- a
plastics extrusion factory in Nairobi's industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
Ngilu first walked into politics in 1992 when she was elected
to parliament for the Democratic Party (DP), led by presidential
candidate Mwai Kibaki, in Kitui Central constituency, Eastern
Province.
</P>
<P>
She said she joined the parliamentary race because she then
was dissatisfied with the way the people were being treated by
their representatives.
</P>
<P>
At the time, she already became famous nationwide when the
Kitui administration barred her from leaving her house for a few
days during her campaign.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, she quit Kibaki's DP so as to run on the
Social Democratic Party (SDP) ticket.
</P>
<P>
Now SDP is the only party in which the chairman is not the
presidential candidate. Ngilu is just an ordinary member while
the chairman is Justus Nyang'aya.
</P>
<P>
Her brush with the riot police at the height of the violent
quest for constitutional reforms in the middle of the year will
be remembered by her supporters.

<HEADLINE> Jiangxi Aims to Bring in 800 Million US Dollars Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi province
aims to bring in 800 million US dollars in overseas investment next
year, which will be 20 percent more than that of this year.
</P>
<P>
The province will select a group of projects with high economic
returns and competitiveness to attract overseas investors, Governor
Shu Shengyou told a provincial economic work conference which ended
here today.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that Jiangxi will designate 20 to 30 major
projects to draw the participation of transnationals and consortia
in improving its state-owned enterprises, while infrastructure,
agriculture, animal husbandry and tourism will also be the main
fields for overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
By the beginning of this month, Jiangxi has approved 429
overseas-funded projects and used 569 million US dollars of
overseas investment. The amount is expected to reach 650 million
US dollars by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
A less developed province in the prosperous east China region,
Jiangxi has seen the improvement of its investment environment
thanks to the implementation of the strategy of developing the
Yangtze basin and the going into operation of the Beijing-Kowloon
railway, a north-south rail trunk running through Jiangxi.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 5,320 overseas-funded projects in operation
in Jiangxi, with the committed overseas investment at 5.277
billion US dollars and the actual amount used at 2.28 billion.

<HEADLINE> Iranians Fume over Luxor Massacre Charge by US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's embassy in Harare today
denied the U.S. charge that Tehran was involved in the massacre
of foreign tourists in Egypt about three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the embassy said Iran believed such
accusations were prompted by "passive propaganda of Zionist
circles and their anxieties over the success of the Teheran
summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference."
</P>
<P>
Dozens of foreign tourists were massacred in Luxor, Egypt,
about three weeks ago and a U.S. official in Tel Aviv recently
accused Iran of being involved in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
"The successful holding of the Teheran summit on December 9-11
and its highly positive effects on the world of Islam prompted
the Zionist propaganda apparatus to embark on a passive campaign
to overshadow the fruitful outcome of the summit," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic of Iran does not officially recognize
Israel and Iran broke off its relations with Tel Aviv after the
victory of the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"These familiar plys cannot halt the growing trend of
anti-Zionist sentiments and stances in the world of Islam," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Drop in Maize Yield Predicted in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Farmers Union
(ZFU) forecast a 45 percent decrease in the country's staple food
maize production during the 1997/98 season due to the prolonged
drought, ZFU President Silas Hungwe has said.
</P>
<P>
Hungwe today told the Zimbabwe News Agency if farmers failed
to secure any meaningful rainfall during the course of this week,
most of the maize crop would be a complete write-off.
</P>
<P>
"The crop situation is pathetic in most parts of the country
and there is poor germination in most areas while other farmers
are still replanting their crops," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hungwe said in some areas, no planting had taken place from
November to date.
</P>
<P>
Crops which had reached tussling stage would be affected in
some parts of the country because of the prolonged dry spell, the
ZFU president noted.
</P>
<P>
Hungwe said the ZFU had advised its farmers to plant in stages
because of the forecast of the El-Nino which spells disaster in
the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are advised to reduce their maize planting since the
season was not a promising one in terms of securing good
rainfall, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Cancel Credit Quota System Starting Next Year (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state-owned banks should balance the sources and uses of
their funds, it noted.
</P>
<P>
In line with the money supply target, regulations on
asset-to-liability management and credit policies published by the
PBC and with the availability of funds, the head offices of the
state-owned banks should compile their fund plans on an annual or
quarterly basis and then pass the plans down to their subsidiaries
for implementation, it said.
</P>
<P>
It added that at the same time the head offices should beef up
their efforts to conduct unified dispatch of the bank funds while
the branch and sub-branch banks should improve their management of
loan terms and fund positions.
</P>
<P>
After the abolition of the credit quota system, the central
bank will strive to regulate money supply and maintain the
stability of the national currency and thereby promote economic
growth through a combined use of indirect monetary tools, such as
interest rate, open market operations, reserves for bank deposits,
discount loans, and rediscounting, it said.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the latest reform, the PBC urged the state-owned
commercial banks to improve credit management and their financial
services.
</P>
<P>
Reasonable loan support for enterprises must not be affected
because of the reform while monitoring over the quality of loan
portfolios must not be slackened to avoid an increase in bad
loans, the central bank said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Leader Promoted to Lt.-Colonel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's military
ruler Johnny Paul Koroma has been promoted to the rank of
Lieutenant-Colonel in the Sierra Leone army.
</P>
<P>
A Defense Department spokesman said the appointment was made
by the Armed Forces Council, which is responsible for promotion
of all personnel in the military, the navy and the police.
</P>
<P>
Koroma's promotion came first from a news broadcast by the
state run radio concerning a million Dollar donation Wednesday to
an Appeal Fund for relatives of victims of bombardment and
shellings by Nigerian Air Force jets and gunners in October.
</P>
<P>
The donation was made by the Gambian Community in Sierra Leone
to Koroma in a ceremony at State House in which Koroma
disclosed his promotion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a radio and TV Christmas message to the people
of Sierra Leone, Koroma invited all Sierra Leonean refugees in
neighboring Guinea, Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire "to return home and
join their families in contributing to the salvation of the
country."
</P>
<P>
He said to facilitate their return, free transportation will
be provided as from December 27 or Saturday "to enable them to
celebrate the new Year with their respective families."
</P>
<P>
Correspondents have cast doubts on whether many refugees will
take advantage of the offer as similar offers had been ignored in
the past.
</P>
<P>
On national security, Koroma said his administration had
"minimize the activities of armed robberies by the application of
very rigid measures to curb banditry and lawlessness."
</P>
<P>
On the international aspect, Koroma said there is no need for
Nigerian soldiers in the west African peace-keeping force known
as ECOMOG to "interfere into the internal affairs of Sierra
Leone."
</P>
<P>
"The main problem for Sierra Leone remains Nigeria and its
leader General Sani Abacha, and their misapplication of the
sanction and embargo on Sierra Leone," the Sierra Leone leader
claimed.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Official Praises Coal Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice-premier Wu
Bangguo praised the country's coal sector today for its success in
making profits after 13 consecutive years of operation in the red.
</P>
<P>
Wu, also member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, said this in a letter of
greetings to the ongoing national conference on coal industry.
</P>
<P>
China's state-run coal mines are expected to turn out 200
million yuan (about 24 million US dollars) in profits this year,
reversing the money-losing situation which lasted for 13 years in
a row.
</P>
<P>
The coal mines have found a successful way to help the
state-owned enterprises in the red to rid of their difficulties
during the period of shifting from the planned economy to the
socialist market economy, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
But it is not a story of "becoming a hero overnight", Wu
pointed out. "The growth of the coal industry will still be
hindered by some long-existing problems and new challenges."
</P>
<P>
Measures, including the introduction of modern enterprise
system, co-ordinating production with market demands and
developing businesses in multiple forms will help the coal
industry to get out of difficulties as soon as possible, he said.

<HEADLINE> China, Egypt Urge Israel to Keep Peace Promises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and visiting Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
today called upon Israel to keep its peace commitments to enable
the Mideast peace process move forward.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Qian made the call at a meeting at the presidential
palace here this morning, during which Qian conveyed a message
from Chinese President Jiang Zemin to the Egyptian leader.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the peace process initiated since the Madrid peace
conference is the sole option and that all parties concerned must
strictly implement relevant U.N. resolutions and the principle of
land for peace," Qian told Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Since Madrid, the Arabs and Israel have reached agreements and
made important progress (in peace-making), and those agreements
should be implemented, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The incumbent Israeli government should also stick to the
pledges and commitments made by the previous Labor government,"
said the Chinese top diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who has visited Israel during his current multi-nation
Mideast tour, said the Israeli people have a strong desire and
most of them hope to follow the path blazed by late Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin (toward peace).
</P>
<P>
Mubarak agreed with Qian. He blamed the peace deadlock on the
Israeli government's hardline policy, and urged Israel to
"honestly materialize the commitments it has made since the Madrid
conference."
</P>
<P>
He warned that "the Israeli policy that often cites its
security concern as an excuse will lead to serious consequences to
all parties, including Israel."
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed Chinese government's deep concern over the
setbacks in Mideast peace, which he said were due to "man-made
obstacles."
</P>
<P>
"Although China does not act as a mediator in the Middle East
peace process, it feels obliged to explain its view points to
concerned parties," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister stressed that "a permanent settlement of
the Mideast problem necessitates the materialization of the
principle of land for peace and the restoration of legitimate
rights of the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of Sino-Egyptian relations, Egypt's vital role
in both international and regional affairs, as well as the Egypt's
diplomatic policy of independence and non-alignment.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Mubarak criticized the practice of interfering in
other countries' domestic affairs on the pretext of protecting
human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt, despite pressure from outside, believes that it has no
such a right to interfere in the internal affairs of other
countries. It also objects to pressuring China under the pretext
of human rights," said the president.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, it is those countries with the worst human rights
record that usually apply pressure on other countries over the
human rights issue," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Qian voiced Chinese government's appreciation of Cairo's stance
in this regard. He extended an invitation from President Jiang
Zemin for Mubarak to visit China.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the last leg of Qian's ongoing Middle East tour which
has taken him to Lebanon, Syria, Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule areas since December 18.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here Wednesday, has held talks with his
Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa.

<HEADLINE> Article Calls for Measures to Prevent Financial Risks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"China's overall financial order is good but some financial
risks have begun to crop up," the article by Wang Yu said.
</P>
<P>
China has scored world-acknowledged achievements in
reforming and opening its financial sector in recent years, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The achievements have played a significant role in
enhancing and improving macro-economic control, controlling
inflation, promoting economic growth and maintaining social
stability, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
However, some financial risks that have been accumulated over a
long period of time have begun to crop up now, it said, citing
increasing amounts of bad loans, the establishment of illegal
financial institutions, offering of illegal financial services,
excessive speculation in the stock market, and ineffective
financial supervision.
</P>
<P>
The financial risks have begun to appear now and drawn the
attention of the whole society because they have become more
apparent as China is shifting to a market economy, the article
said.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for China's mounting alertness against financial
risks is the recent financial crisis in Southeast Asia, according
to the article.
</P>
<P>
Under a planned economy that was pursued for decades,
state-owned enterprises relied too heavily on bank credits, which
eventually resulted in a large proportion of bad loans.

<TEXT>
<P>
Though there exist risks in the financial sector, China's
overall financial order is good and stable, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we should be confident in controlling and warding
off the risks," it said.
</P>
<P>
The confidence in resolving financial risks should be based,
first of all, on the sustained, rapid and sound growth of the
Chinese economy and on China's ever-increasing economic strength
and comprehensive national strength.
</P>
<P>
Since China carried out its market economic reforms in the late
1970s, its gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an average
annual rate of 9.9 percent and the GDP has quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
"This is the strength with which we can prevent and ward off
financial risks," the article said.
</P>
<P>
The effective control over inflation is vital to the success of
China's efforts to prevent financial risks and maintain financial
stability, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Since the second half of 1993, China has brought inflation
under control, bringing the retail price index down to 6.1 percent in
1996 from 13.2 percent in 1993. This year the inflation rate has
dropped significantly.
</P>
<P>
In the years to come, China will continue to follow a moderately
tight monetary and fiscal policy to control inflation.
</P>
<P>
China's good balance of international payments is another
factor favorable to the prevention of financial risks, the article
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 China reported a current-account surplus of 7.24
billion US dollars, with trade surplus standing at 19.5 billion US
dollars. Its surplus under the capital account was 39.97 billion
US dollars last year.

<P>
China's foreign exchange reserves had reached 135 billion US
dollars by the end of November. At the same time both the amount
and structure of China's foreign investment and foreign debts are
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has utilized 320 billion US dollars in foreign
funds, including more than 200 billion US dollars in direct foreign
investment. Long-term debts account for more than 80
percent of China's foreign debts of 118 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"All this has provided a powerful support for a stable exchange
rate of the Chinese yuan and increased China's ability to resist
international speculation and counter the effects of international
financial turmoils," the article said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that in recent years China has formulated a series
of rules and regulations designed to standardize the financial
order, while the People's Bank of China, the central bank, has
accumulated a great deal of successful experiences in financial
supervision and preventing and warding off financial risks.
</P>
<P>
To prevent and minimize financial risks, financial institutions
should tighten self-control and the central bank should tighten
supervision over the country's financial sector, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China should quicken its pace to restructure its
economy and increase the public's awareness of financial
risks, it added.

<HEADLINE> Mysterious Disease Breaks Out in S. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A mysterious disease has
reportedly broken out in Somalia's southern region of Lower
Shabelle, taking the toll of scores of people in the past week.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Somali Red Crescent Society (SRCS) said the
disease is seen this week in Torotorow village, 115 km south of
the capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The SRCS officials said the symptoms of the disease are high
fever, liver and stomach ache accompanied by blood spitting.
Victims of the disease die within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, 42 people have died of the disease
since the SRCS team visited Torotorow last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"When we reached the village on December 18, the community
elders told us that 330 people have died of the mysterious
disease," said one of the local SRCS workers. However, he said,
"The number seems to be a little bit exaggerated."
</P>
<P>
A health investigating team from the SRCS, the International
Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) and the World Health Organization
have left Mogadishu this morning for Torotorow village. The team
is expected to take stool and blood samples from the victims for
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
The SRCS officials couldn't confirm whether this disease
resembles or is identical to the enigmatic sickness that recently
broke out in northern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"We can't declare anything before laboratory tests prove us
anything," said the officials.
</P>
<P>
This fresh alarm of the mysterious disease coincides with a
deadly cholera situation in the capital and its surrounding areas
since heavy rains laid pools of water in the unhygienic city.
</P>
<P>
Local doctors announced this morning a serious shortage of the
sodium infusions for rehydrating the cholera victims in the
capital. At present, a bag of 0.5 liter of the sodium infusion
now costs nearly 14 U.S. Dollars in Mogadishu, which is 30 times
more expensive than its original price.
</P>
<P>
Dr Abdurahman Ali Awale (Dr Habeb) of Benadir Medical Center
in Mogadishu said nine children died of cholera Wednesday in his
clinic in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Dr Habeb announced that the cholera situation is now out of
hand when there's no single international aid agency dealing with
the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what to do, people are just dying before us and
we can't do anything about it," he said, adding "Each child is
discharging two liters of his body liquid each time of vomiting
and loosing bowel."
</P>
<P>
The main SOS hospital in Mogadishu has stopped receiving
cholera patients unless it's very critical. SOS also stopped
giving out sodium infusions earlier offered to the patients for
rehydration.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the suspension is said to be related to an
incapability of the hospital to deal with the innumerable number
of cholera cases arriving at the hospital. All hospital wards and
outside gardens are now filled with patients.
</P>
<P>
A group of Somali doctors Wednesday voluntarily opened a
quarantine center in the former Maternity Hospital of Benadir
where more than 20 people had been registered since this morning.
Doctors said the only thing they have is to give out the Oral
Rehydration Solution.
</P>
<P>
Two international aid agencies, MSF-Spain and Action Contra la
Faim (French) are expected to return to the capital tomorrow to
open the first cholera quarantine center in the former Forlanini
Hospital of North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Rough statistics from the mother and child heath care posts in
Mogadishu indicate that since November 17, more than 254 people
have so far died of cholera in Mogadishu and its surrounding
areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to have a
nine percent increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) this year,
a senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national TV and telephone conference on commodity
circulation today, Chen Bangzhu, minister of the Internal Trade,
said that the country's total retail sales are estimated to go up
11 percent while the rise of retail prices will be under two
percent.
</P>
<P>
Marked progress has been made in chain-store business, the
minister noted, adding that at present, China has over 1,000
chain-store companies with 15,000 sales outlets nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Business lines of these chain stores have been expanded from
consumer goods to machinery products and farm machines, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
In large and medium-sized cities, chain store sales have
accounted for more than five percent of the retail sales.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, among 151 large shopping centers and malls
surveyed, 45,7 percent reported a slumping business in the first
ten months, compared with the same period of last year, according
to an investigation conducted by the Commercial Information Center
under the ministry.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, initial headway has been made in the agent
system as is illustrated by this year's sales of steel products
and automobiles which have climbed 4.1 percent and 15.6 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the number of pilot steel makers which have
introduced the agent system have increased to 371.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanqing, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee
and vice-premier of the State Council, made a written speech at
the conference, hoping that there would be new measures and
breakthroughs in the commodity circulation system next year.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Former President Detained by Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 25 (xinhua) -- Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's
former president and leader of the country's biggest opposition
party -- the United National Independence Party (UNIP), was
detained by police in Lusaka early this morning.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed by P.S. Chitambala, deputy Secretary for
Publicity and Information of UNIP, during an interview with
Xinhua at the Freedom House, the party's headquarters in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Chitambala, also a member of the UNIP central committee, said
Kaunda was arrested at his residence of Kalundu House in the Roma
district at about 6:00 hours local time this morning and put into
Kamwala Remand prison in Lusaka serving a detention order for
28 days.
</P>
<P>
The detention was made four days after Kaunda returned home
from a world tour following an abortive military coup in Zambia
on October 28 to overthrow the government. And in another
development, the police also arrested Kaunda's head of physical
security Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda is alleged to have been involved in the coup and his
arrest is believed to come sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
Chitambala claimed that soon after the detention, he tried to
enter the prison to find out what has happened to the "old man",
but was stopped by the police.
</P>
<P>
He accused President Frederick Chiluba of ill-treating Kaunda,
father of the nation who led Zambia to independence from the
British colonial rule in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the detention of Kaunda will
jeopardize the proposed inter-party talks between leaders of the
ruling Movement for Muti-Party Democracy (MMD) and the country's
about 30 opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory talks were held early this month to pave the way
for further official talks among presidents of all the political
parties scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
The inter-party talks are designed to break the country's
political impasse over the constitutional provisions on the
election system since last year's general elections and to
promote national harmony.

<HEADLINE> Forum Held on Reform of State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned
enterprises, especially loss-making ones, can learn from the
experience of ten model enterprises to their own benefit, agreed
the attenders to a forum on reform of state-owned enterprises held
here today.
</P>
<P>
The forum was jointly organized by the Publicity Department of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State
Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials of departments of central authorities and
some enterprises, economists, and leading officials from major
media organizations based in the Chinese capital, attended the
forum.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the model enterprises' experience show that to
change from loss-making to profit-making, enterprises should
deepen the reform by resorting to the market, reorganizing the
work of their own personnel, readjusting organization and capital
structures, and enhancing management to bring out the potentials.
</P>
<P>
Low economic efficiency plaguing the state-owned sector has
become one of the biggest obstacles to China's further economic
development. To spread the experience of enterprises that have
successfully wriggled out of operational difficulties, the Chinese
media have widely carried reports on ten model enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The attenders believed that China will achieve its goal for the
reform and development of state-owned enterprises if the whole
Party and the whole nation seize the favorable chance rendered by
China's present economic and social development and fully and
correctly implement the gist of the 15th CPC National Conference
held three months ago.

<HEADLINE> China Pledges Continued CITES Commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China has pledged to continue
fulfilling its commitment to the Convention on International Trade
in Endandered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and make
greater efforts in wildlife protection and trade management.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made here today by Wang Zhibao, director of the
Chinese CITES Management Authority under the State Council, at a
national conference on wildlife export and import management.
</P>
<P>
China has been actively involved in CITES activities and has
taken various measures to protect its wildlife resource since it
became a CITES contracting party in 1981, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
To meet its commitment to CITES, China ceased exporting tusks
of Asian elephant and African elephant and ivories in 1986 and
1990. In 1993, it banned trading of rhinoceros horns and tiger
bones and stopped the production and sale of some traditional
Chinese medicines that used the horns and bones as ingredients.
</P>
<P>
It has concentrated on protecting its wildlife
resources. Wildlife traders must be licensed by the Chinese CITES
Authority, Wang said, adding that the country has prohibited using
wild rhesus monkey for experiments, vaccine production or for
export. Export of musks, snakes and snake products must get state
permission.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has limited the export of ready-made
traditional Chinese medicines that use wild plants and parts of
wild animals as ingredients, and the export of some wild animals
for meat and exhibition.
</P>
<P>
"China's effort to fulfill CITES commitment is also demonstrated
in its endeavors to save rare and endangered species," Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 16 years, the country has established research
and breeding centers for such rare animals like wild horse, David's
deer, giant panda, Chinese alligator and Siberian Tiger. In
addition, it has set up a great many nature reserves for both
endangered animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese CITES Management Authority has joined hands with
police and customs in cracking down on wildlife smuggling and
illicit poaching and trading.
</P>
<P>
From 1995 to the first half of this year, forest police alone
crushed some 46,000 cases which involved about 430,000 wild
animals. More than 12,000 law violators were punished according to
law during the first six months of this year, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
China boasts rich wildlife resources. It has over 4,800 kinds
of vertebra, or 10 percent of the world's total. With a pool of
30,000 kinds of higher plants on its vast territory, the country
ranks third in the world in this regard, after Brazil and
Malaysia.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government has
planned to set up 17 more soil-testing laboratories at a cost of
800 million taka (about 17.78 million U.S. dollars), a press
report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The soil-testing labs, which are to be located in 17 districts'
headquarters, will help farmers of different localities test their
soil samples and apply required doses of organic and chemical
fertilizers in the fields.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are only five such labs in the country with
the central lab in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Planning Commission has already recommended
setting up of 10 soil-testing labs and asked the Soil Resources
Development Institute (SRDI) to prepare a revised project
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bangladesh has also set up two new research stations
-- watershed and soil conservation station, and soil and water
salinity management research center -- in two districts to check
soil erosion.

<HEADLINE> China to Cancel Credit Quota System Starting Next Year (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China will abolish the credit
quota system starting next year, a significant move to the way
by which its central bank conducts financial macro control.
</P>
<P>
Beginning January 1, 1998, the credit quota ceiling system
governing the state-owned commercial banks will be phased out and
a new system of indirect control on the basis of
asset-to-liability management and risk management will be
implemented, the People's Bank of China (PBC), the central bank,
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The PBC next year will not issue mandatory loan plans to the
state-owned commercial banks and will instead issue "guiding"
plans on a yearly or quarterly basis, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The guiding plan, as a monitoring target for macro-economic
control by the central bank, will be used as a reference by the
state-owned commercial banks in compiling their respective funding
plans, it said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the state-owned commercial banks may decide for
their own the use of their funds in accordance with law and they
may extend loans in line with credit principles and relevant state
policies.
</P>
<P>
The banks may arrange their own loans for circulating
funds. Loans for investment in fixed assets promised before the
end of 1997 will continue to be honored, while new fixed-asset
loans will be decided and issued by respective banks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China is aiming high in the
ethic and cultural progress next year, the first year for carrying
out the guidelines of the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), said a senior Chinese official today.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau and of the
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks at a
plenary session of the Central Commission for Guiding the Ethic
and Cultural Progress, which opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the ethic and cultural progress should help
provide a good social environment in 1998 for reform and
development and for the fulfillment of the tasks set by the Party
congress.
</P>
<P>
To improve the ethic and cultural education on young people
will be the key for the ethic and cultural progress of the Chinese
nation as a whole, said Ding, who is also director of the Central
Commission for Guiding the Ethic and Cultural Progress.
</P>
<P>
More people should be encouraged to involve themselves in the
work to promote ethic and cultural progress, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
We should unite more closely around the CPC Central Committee
with Jiang Zemin at the core and hold high the great banner of
Deng Xiaoping Theory, while striving to promote ethic and
cultural progress next year, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces seized
1.5 tonnes of morphine and opium extract from a truck loaded with
bricks in the central Isfahan province, Iran's official news
agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the provincial security forces Brigadier General
Mohammad Tayefi said six smugglers were arrested in the
operation. He did not give the date for the drug seizure.
</P>
<P>
Tayefi said that his forces seized 6.5 tonnes of various types
of narcotics during the first three quarters of the current
Iranian year (started March 21) and smashed 11 drug bands.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking poses a serious problem for the Iranian
government. Iran is one of the major transit routes for smugglers
to ship narcotics produced in the "Golden Crescent" in the border
areas of Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian anti-drug official earlier announced that the
country captured an average of 160 tonnes of various drugs
annually since it passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989 slapping
capital punishment on drug smugglers.

HK dollars in 1992 to fund education in China. It awards annually,
with this year being the fifth awarding-year.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the foundation is aimed to award the

throughout China since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-odd prize-winners, from 31 provinces, municipalities

<HEADLINE> Zambian Former President Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 25 (xinhua) -- Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's
former president and leader of the country's biggest opposition
party -- the United National Independence Party (UNIP), was
arrested by police in Lusaka early this morning.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed by P.S. Chitambala, deputy Secretary for
Publicity and Information of UNIP, during an interview with
Xinhua at the Freedom House, the party's headquarters in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Chitambala, also a member of the UNIP central committee, said
Kaunda was arrested at his residence of Kalundu House in the Roma
district at about 6:00 hours local time this morning and put into
Kamwala Remand prison in Lusaka serving with a detention order
lasting 28 days.
</P>
<P>
The detention was made four days after Kaunda returned home
from a world tour following an abortive military coup in Zambia
on October 28 to overthrow the government. And in another
development, the police also arrested Kaunda's head of physical
security Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda is alleged to have been involved in the coup and his
arrest is believed to come sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
Chitambala claimed that soon after the detention, he tried to
enter the prison to find out what has happened to the "old man",
but was stopped by the police.
</P>
<P>
He accused President Frederick Chiluba of ill-treating Kaunda,
father of the nation who led Zambia to independence from the
British colonial rule in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the detention of Kaunda will
jeopardize the proposed inter-party talks between leaders of the
ruling Movement for Muti-Party Democracy (MMD) and the country's
about 30 opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory talks were held early this month to pave the way
for further official talks among presidents of all the political
parties scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
The inter-party talks are designed to break the country's
political impasse over the constitutional provisions on the
election system since last year's general elections and to
promote national harmony.

CHANGSHA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Central-south China's Hunan
Province has increased by more than 1.5 billion kilograms of rice
in the past seven years by adopting rice seedling dry-nursing
technique.
</P>

<P>
In 1991, Hunan Province, one of China's major agricultural

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Zimbabwe Steps up Land Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Zhu Shixiang)
</P>
<P>
HARARE, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
released a list of 1,480 commercial farms for compulsory
acquisition and decided to redistribute these farms to landless
families in its efforts to accelerate the land resettlement
program.
</P>
<P>
At least 62,000 families have been resettled since
independence in 1980 but another 100,000 are still waiting for
the land which the government has been promising for the past 17
years.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1997 should be the final year for acquiring land.
The government has decided to compulsorily acquire over 1,500
farms or five million hectares of land to resettle about 100,000
landless families in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has vowed to fairly distribute the
land to the landless Zimbabweans who did not have enough land to
fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that only about 4,000 white farmers in the
country owned three-quarters of the best land at the expense of
the majority of Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe noted that the land apportionment
exercise is not meant to drive the white farmers out, but to
create an atmosphere which is conducive to the majority and the
white farmers still have a farm to live.
</P>
<P>
The list comprises farms belonging to individuals both white
and black, private companies and some government parastatals,
covering 45 of the total 54 districts. But most of the land will
come from white farmers.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said that the farmers will not be compensated for the
land but for the improvements they have made on the farms,
because ''land is the people's sovereign asset.''
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's land resettlement program hit a snag in 1989 when
Britain, which solely funded the program since 1980, withdrew its
assistance describing the initial program as a " failure".
</P>
<P>
However, the government went ahead and passed the Land
Acquisition Act of 1992, under which the state can compulsorily
acquire land, a step which has been slashed by western donors.
</P>
<P>
Since then negotiations between Zimbabwe and Britain to resume
the British funding for the resettlement program have not made
much progress as Zimbabwe refuses to meet the given conditions
including the willing-seller and willing-buyer scheme in
exercising the land resettlement program.

PARIS, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The works of the modern French
writer and playwright Marcel Pagnol have been translated into Arabic

</P>
<P>
Pagnol, who was born in 1895 and died in 1974, was also the

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Zimbabwe Steps up Land Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Zhu Shixiang)
</P>
<P>
HARARE, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Upon learning the list, the
landless Zimbabweans hailed the government's decision on the
resettlement program, saying their long-waited dream will become
true.
</P>
<P>
Over 5,000 delegates attending the annual national party
congress of the ruling ZANU (PF) this month unanimously adopted a
resolution supporting the program, saying it's a significant
decision for the country's economic development and poverty
eradication.
</P>
<P>
"Without such resettlement, it is unlikely that it can achieve
either long-term economic growth that will be satisfactory for
the majority of Zimbabweans, or long-term political stability,"
the daily The Herald said in a comment.
</P>
<P>
But the British press labelled the Zimbabwe government's
efforts to resolve the land imbalance as a "land grabbing
exercise".
</P>
<P>
"So, we are grabbing the land, but who started grabbing land
from the other? " asked Mugabe. "If you grab my property and I
follow you up and demand my property back, could that be termed
`grabbing'? "
</P>
<P>
At home, Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union criticised the
designated farms, saying that most of the commercial farms listed
by the government for acquisition are not in the categories of
farms that were previously said to be acquired.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial Farmers Union predicted that if the land
acquisition program is implemented, production value from
large-scale farming would drop from one billion U.S. dollars to
630 million dollars annually, with value of exports dropping 470
million U.S. Dollars from 700 million U.S.Dollars. The number of
workers on commercial farms would drop from 327,000 to 180,000.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial Farmers Union has called on the government to
review the thorny issue of land designation, and consider
suspension of acquisition of about 240 of black-owned commercial
farms which appeared on the list.
</P>
<P>
Opposition National Democratic Union said it will take the
government to court over the designation of commercial farms
whose owners have only one farm.
</P>
<P>
"If the government continues to grab these farms, then we
shall have no alternative but to take the whole matter to court
so that justice must be seen to be done. Our lawyers were already
preparing heads of arguments."
</P>
<P>
But Land and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai has declared
that the government would not compromise on the land acquisition
program.
</P>
<P>
"By July or August next year, we will have finished the legal
processes and after August we will start the allocation," the
minister promised.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's newly sworn in
cabinet members have been warned not to leave the capital Abuja
without proper clearance of the Head of State General Sani
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are also barred from employing personal
assistants, according to a circular dated December 22 which was
signed by Alhaji Gidado Idris, secretary to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
The circular was issued one day after the uncovered coup plot
which involved the country's number two person, Chief of General
Staff Lieutenant-General Oladipo Diya, as well as 10 other
military officers and one civilian.
</P>
<P>
"I am directed to inform you that no minister should absent
himself from Abuja without first seeking and obtaining the
permission of the head of state, commander-in-chief," the circular
said.
</P>
<P>
No reason for the directive has been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, the head of state has stopped, with
immediate effect, the appointment and designation of special or
personal assistants to ministers and other government
functionaries.
</P>
<P>
"All such staff, wherever they are, must be relieved of their
appointments," it said, adding "ministers must learn to use the
services of the permanent secretaries and other government staff
who are already there to assist them."
</P>
<P>
To enforce the directive, Idris told the accountant-general
and auditor-general to stop paying the special assistants from
government funds.
</P>
<P>
The circular was addressed to the principal secretary of the
head of state, the inspector-general of police, ministers, heads
of permanent departments, permanent secretaries and
directors-general.

BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng has signed a
decree to grant the title of honor to seven model police units
and called on public security departments across the country
to follow their example in serving the people wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
The units include the Donglai Police Station in Harbin City,
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, the Niujie Police Station
in Beijing, and the Huale Police Station in Guangzhou, south
China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting to commend the police units today, Luo
Gan, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee, said, "The seven grassroot model units
are outstanding representatives of China's public security
departments."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that public security departments nationwide
should be fully aware of the necessity and difficulty of building
an efficient public security force, noting that a competent and
qualified police force is needed for the 21th century.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Public Security said that over
the next two years, one million Chinese police officers will take
examinations and undergo assessment of their professional and
physical capabilities. Those who fail twice in the exams will be
dismissed from the police force.
</P>
<P>
By organizing regular training courses, the new exam system is
designed to improve the basic quality of the police
officers all over the country, the official said.

<HEADLINE> 812 Raids on Israeli Forces in S. Lebanon in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese resistance forces
have launched some 812 attacks against Israeli forces and their
ally - the South Lebanese Army (SLA), this year, Lebanese
newspaper the Beirut Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an annual report of the United Nations
Interim Forces in south Lebanon (UNIFIL) on military activities in
south Lebanon as saying that some 765 attacks were carried out by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah since the beginning of this year to
December 23.
</P>
<P>
The Amal Movement led by Lebanon's House Speaker Nabih Berri
was responsible for 44 attacks, the Syrian National Social Party
for two, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad for one, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 39 Israeli and 22 SLA soldiers were
killed, and 95 Israeli and 70 SLA soldiers wounded this year in
fighting with Lebanese resistance guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, the Islamic resistance suffered 66 deaths
and 27 injuries. The Lebanese Army had six fatalities and 10
casualties in skirmishes with Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Israeli attacks on residential areas killed 48 Lebanese
civilians and injured 130 others in 1997, the report added.
</P>
<P>
In an analysis of its own losses this year, UNIFIL said that
the crash of a helicopter near Tyre, the country's southern port
city near the Israeli occupied zone, in August of this year,
claimed four Italian and one Irish soldiers. Six Irish soldiers
were also killed by a roadside mine in south Lebanon last June.
</P>
<P>
The 5,400-strong UNIFIL was established in south Lebanon in
March 1978 after Israel's invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But it could not prevent the nearly everyday conflict between
Israeli troops and Lebanese resistance groups fighting to oust an
estimated 2,000 Israeli occupation troops.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli soldiers and the 2,500-strong SLA are jointly
patrolling the 1,200-square-kilometer security zone carved by
Israel in 1985 to protect its northern towns from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.

BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China's key coal mines have
succeeded in turning loss into profit in general this year,
expecting to produce 200 million yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Senhao, minister of coal industry, the
country's key coal mines have reversed in general the money-losing
situation which troubled the coal industry for 13 consecutive
years since 1984.
</P>
<P>
To date, some 70 percent of the country's 93 key coal mines
have become profitable, a sharp contrast to merely 9.7 percent in
1992.
</P>
<P>
The minister expects the country's coal mines to produce 1.33
billion tons of coal and export 31 million tons of coal this year.
</P>
<P>
More noteworthy, China's coal mines have become more intensive
in the economic growth mode, with their staff cut by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to 1997, some 870,000 workers and staff in the key
coal mines have been laid off or transferred to other jobs.
</P>
<P>
And the diversified economic operation has contributed a lot to
the sound development of coal mines this year, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, the country's coal-related diversified
economic enterprises have grown to 17,000, employing over 1.8
million personnel in total.
</P>
<P>
The minister expect these diversified economic enterprises to
produce output value and economic returns totalling 44.5 billion
yuan, or 57 percent of the total output value produced by all the
coal.

<HEADLINE> Law-makers Examine Draft of Price Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Participants to the ongoing
29th session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, China's top legislature, agree that the
revised draft of Price Law is roughly ripe to be passed at the
current session.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time that the draft of Price Law is submitted
to NPC Standing Committee session for examination. The law is
aimed at regulating pricing and improve China's socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Law-makers Lai Jinlie and Sun Tingfang shared the view that
such a law is badly needed in China to regulate pricing and
stabilizing the market.
</P>
<P>
There are some gap between domestic and international prices,
and domestic prices should go in line with international prices
when necessary, so as to protect the initiative of both producers
and marketing people and prevent the loss of funds, they said.
</P>
<P>
Law-makers Wang Bingqian and Xia Jiajun said that the law
should enhance supervision over the pricing in service trades.
</P>
<P>
The prices of some free-trading commodities should not go
beyond control, and tips in some service trades should be given in
accordance with certain standards, law-maker Ye Zhengda said.
</P>
<P>
Law-maker Qin Zhongda noted that the law should add detailed
regulations on seeking staggering profits, dumping and monoply.
</P>
<P>
Another law-maker Dong Fureng suggested that the law have
articles restraining the abuse of power by government
functionaries at the time of conducting price inspections.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Rulers in Nigeria Briefed About Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's influential
traditional rulers said Wednesday that they believed there was a
coup attempt in the country after they were shown video clippings
and audio recordings of preliminary investigations into it.
</P>
<P>
The documentary evidence was shown to a group of traditional
rulers across the country during a four-hour meeting with Head of
State General Sani Abacha at the presidential villa on Wednesday
in Abuja, the capital.
</P>
<P>
The clip seemed to have taken effect as the Ewi of Ado-Ekiti,
Oba Rufus Adejugbe Adeyemo condemned the coup attempt on behalf
of the royal fathers at the end of the meeting last night.
</P>
<P>
"From what we have heard from audio recordings and video
images of the preliminary investigations, we wish to condemn the
dastardly acts conceived and attempted by the plotters already
arrested," he said, quoted by local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Describing what would have been the result of the coup plot as
"the calamity that would have befallen the nation", he said:
"Nigeria would continue to survive and has indeed survived this
one, once again".
</P>
<P>
After reading a prepared text, the royal father did not
entertain reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the electronic images and recordings were
also played to members of the Provisional Ruling Council, the
country's highest policy making body, at Tuesday night's
emergency meeting which lasted till the early hours of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Chief David Attah, Chief Press Secretary to the
head of state, the briefing session with traditional rulers and
leaders of thought was one in the series of consultations by the
federal government to establish credibility for the alleged coup
plot.
</P>
<P>
Such consultations with representatives of the media are
expected to take place soon.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the National Council of State made up
of chief executives of the 36 states across the country began a
meeting in Abuja last night.
</P>
<P>
In his reaction to claims that the coup attempt was a frame
up, Attah said it was very disturbing that people had jumped to
conclusions even when such conclusions were at variance with
evidence "which some people were already privy to".
</P>
<P>
In his goodwill message to Nigerians on the Christmas eve,
Abacha called on the people to show brotherly love, humility,
tolerance, selflessness and dedication to their duty.
</P>
<P>
He also promised the people that the new year will witness
momentous events in the socio-economic and political spheres.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time, the trade unions joined the groups of
unemployed workers in launching a spectacular action on Christmas
Eve Wednesday by seizing the National Agency of Employment ANPE in
Paris, which followed several similar actions across France. The
anti-unemployment groups call for the payment of a premium for the
end of the year to the unemployed workers through a social fund
frozen by the government.
</P>
<P>
-- The Mexican authorities were blamed for the massacre of 46
Tzotzile Indians, including 21 women and 15 children in a small
school and a poor church on a hill in Atenal in the remote region
of Chiapas on Tuesday. Paramilitary men associated with the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party attacked the Indians with
automatic weapons and axes when they were praying for peace on the
eve of Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The death of two youths who were killed by police last week
in the suburbs of Lyon and Fontainbleau has put into question the
government policy on development of city suburbs, where the
trilogy of youths, violence and suburbs are always linked
together. Jean-Pierre Sueur, former state secretary in charge of
local communities, said that he suggested to the government the
reduction of the number of new economic development zones in city
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
-- The international financial community made another effort on
Wednesday to save South Korea from collapse by providing another
package of eight billion U.S. dollars contributed by the Group of

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China collected more than
707.1 billion yuan (about 85.2 billion US dollars) in industrial
and commercial taxes by 20 this month, fulfilling its tax revenue
budget this year 11 days ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The total amount, which was 17.8 percent more than a year ago,
represented 101.7 percent of this year's target, the State
Administration of Taxation (SAT) said.
</P>
<P>
However, collection of the value-added tax and the consumption
tax, two major tax items under China's new tax regime introduced
in 1994, was not satisfactory, the SAT said.
</P>
<P>
The revenue of the two major taxes totaled 377.6 billion yuan
by December 20, up 11.2 percent year-on-year or 92.3 percent of
the targeted figure for this year.
</P>
<P>
An analysis shows that Hebei Province, the special economic
zone of Shenzhen, and the Tibet and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions
have overfulfilled their yearly targets.
</P>
<P>
The SAT urged tax agencies at all levels to make greater
efforts to collect delayed taxes in the last few days of the
year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Willing to Improve Ties With Iran: Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said that he has longed for turning over a new leaf in relations
with Tehran, local newspaper Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the London-based Lebanese weekly
al-Hawadeth Wednesday, Mubarak said he has wanted to improve ties
with Iran since he assumed office 16 years ago,
</P>
<P>
The two countries severed diplomatic ties in 1979 after the
Islamic revolution topple shah's regime in Tehran and Egypt signed
peace with Israel in the U.S.-brokered Camp David peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The victorious clergymen in Iran have been adamant in opposing
any peace efforts with Israel, which they denounce as "the Zionist
usurper" and refuse to give official recognition.
</P>
<P>
"So far some people are still reluctant to understand what Camp
David is," Mubarak said. "It was a mere general framework of
principles with two papers, the first on the Egyptian issue, and
the second on the Palestinian issue," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Had the Palestinians accepted to start negotiations on the Camp
David principles, the situation in the region would have been
completely different, Mubarak added.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David framework, he explained, imposed an Israeli
troop withdrawal to certain points outside the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. "The Israelis accepted this item. Today there is a great
argument on the redeployment of the Israeli troops on 8-10
percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Egypt have been improving. Mubarak
said that he sent his Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to Tehran
earlier this month to attend the eighth Islamic summit, "is a
clear signal."
</P>
<P>
Tehran had expected Mubarak's presence at the gathering of
world Islamic leaders and hoped it would lead to a breakthrough in
bilateral relations, now at the level of interest sections.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the Tehran Islamic summit is "successful to
a great extent" and hoped "all the resolutions the summit issued
be implemented."
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi had said Iran is working
towards restoring full diplomatic relations with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Iran and Egypt are getting closer to each other
and ... we found Egypt to be much closer to Iran," he said, when
speaking to reporters late Tuesday at the Athens airport winding
up his visit to Greece.
</P>
<P>
When asked if there was any timetable set for restoring
relations, he said "we are trying to take steps in that direction
and I am very hopeful that we can arrive at some conclusion in the
near future."

<HEADLINE> Israel's Diamond Exports to SE Asia Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's diamond exports to
Southeast Asia fell by 30-40 percent this year, which caused a
loss of more than 600 million U.S. dollars in revenues, a local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post quoted Israel's industry sources as saying
that the tumbling currencies, higher interest rates and slower
economic growth in Southeast Asia led to the decline of Israel's
diamond exports to the region.
</P>
<P>
The sources also predicted the situation will worsen next year
with higher losses due to diamond exports falling further.
</P>
<P>
Tzafrir Anbar, the diamond controller in the Ministry of
Industry and Trade, stressed that "we don't predict that the
situation will improve in the near term or next year."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the decrease in sales to Southeast Asia have had a
negative impact on the cash flow of the whole Israeli diamond
industry because the Asian customers usually pay in cash.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the cash flows (to Israel) have slowed makes the
banks nervous, which in turn hurts the whole industry," said an
Israeli trader.
</P>
<P>
Israel's exports volume of polished diamonds in 1996 stood at
5.3 billion dollars, accounting for about 25 percent of the total
exports volume.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Public Hospitals Launch General Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's public hospitals
today began an open-ended strike to protest against planned
changes in the National Health Insurance law, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of doctors, nurses and administrative workers of the
hospitals left their jobs this morning, and only emergency
services and vital neonatal, dialysis and obstetrics departments
are still functioning normally.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an attempt to prevent the Knesset (parliament)
from approving the changes in the law, directors of all the
country's public hospitals and senior health system administrators
will demonstrate today outside the Knesset building.
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes, as part of the Treasury-sponsored
arrangements bill for the state budget of 1998, would allow each
health fund to set its own basket of services, allow insurers to
charge extra for a wide variety of services and eliminate
long-term geriatric nursing care from health fund responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Peterburg, director-general of the country's public
hospitals, said Wednesday that the changes will bring about the
establishment of two separate health systems - one for the
well-off and another for lower income groups.
</P>
<P>
He noted that under the new law the average family will have to
pay over 1,000 shekels (about 280 dollars) extra annually for
visits to doctors, hospital emergency rooms, outpatient clinics
and other services.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Health Ministry Director-General Gabi Barabash also
expressed hope that the Knesset members will vote against the
proposals in the plenary session scheduled at the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
He noted that transferring responsibility for preventive
health services to the health funds would be disastrous.

CHANGSHA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- An afforestation project
funded jointly by China and Germany around the Dongting Lake, the
second largest freshwater lake in China, is now under way in
central-south China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
With an aim to improve the ecological environment around the
lake and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the project is
expected to cover eight cities and counties including Yueyang,
Linxiang, Yunxi, Huarong, Nanxian, Anhua, Lixian and Jinshi.

</P>
<P>
According to the Hunan Provincial Government, the total
investment to the project is 94.33 million yuan (11.37 million US

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Cooperation With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran has denied Israeli press
reports about its cooperation with Israel and involvement in
terrorist acts, calling them ploys of the "Zionist regime."
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio said today Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi Wednesday night refuted the reports on
Iranian-Israeli cooperation and Iran's sponsoring of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He said such moves were designed by the "negative propaganda of
Israeli Zionist circles" and their anxieties over the success of
Tehran summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)
on December 9-11.
</P>
<P>
The successful holding of the OIC summit and its highly
positive effects on the Islamic world prompted the Zionist
propaganda apparatus (press) to embark on negative propaganda to
overshadow the fruitful outcome of the summit, Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
"The unity and concurrence among Islamic countries and the
presence of high-ranking Islamic leaders in Tehran have made the
Zionist regime to resort to these futile efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that "the Islamic Republic of Iran does not
officially recognize Israel." The late shah of Iran had been on
good terms with Israel but Tehran broke off all ties with what it
called "Zionist usurper" after the victory of Islamic Revolution
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also dismissed reported statements by U.S.
ambassador to Israel about Iran's involvement in the massacre of
tourists in Luxor, Egypt, saying the remarks were in line with
Israel's concern over Tehran-Cairo rapprochement during the OIC
summit.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador, however, said he would neither confirm the
report, nor deny it.
</P>
<P>
In last month's Luxor terrorist attack, 58 foreign tourists and
four Egyptians were killed, dealing a severe blow to Egypt's
lucrative tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Such familiar ploys can not halt the growing trend of
anti-Zionist sentiments in the Islamic world, the spokesman
added.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah's Agent Faces Trial in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A German citizen sent by
Hezbollah to launch a suicide attack in Israel was put on trial
today in the Tel Aviv Magistrates Court.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security officials revealed that Stefan Josef Smirak, a
convert to Islam, was arrested on November 28 upon his arrival at
the Ben-Gurion Airport.
</P>
<P>
Smirak, 26, was allegedly recruited by Hezbollah, which has
been waging a guerrilla war against Israeli occupation of south
Lebanon, in a visit to Lebanon between August and November this
year.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Smirak was sent to a training camp in the
Bekka Valley in Lebanon, where he was taught to use light weapons
and operate explosive devices, the Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
It said Smirak was provided with video cameras and electronic
communication devices and sent to Israel to collect information
and to film densely populated areas in Tel Aviv and Haifa in order
to target a site for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah handlers in Lebanon also demanded Smirak change his
passport in order to erase any traces of his Lebanese visit
before travelling to Israel. Once he finished the fact-finding
mission, he planned to fly to Turkey and contact his handlers to
finalize the plan for carrying out the suicide attack, police
added.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that Hezbollah has attempted to send
agents into Israel to launch attacks. In May 1996, Israeli
security forces arrested a Lebanese citizen carrying a forged
British passport in a Jerusalem hotel, where he seriously injured
himself when the bomb he was preparing exploded in his room.

<HEADLINE> Nearly Half of China's Provincial Boundaries Demarcated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Almost half of the provincial
boundaries in China have been demarcated, according to a national
demarcation conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
China now has 31 provinces and autonomous regions (excluding
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan Province).
Between them are 68 boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Sources attending the conference said 33 provincial boundaries
with a combined length of more than 20,000 kilometers, or 43.5
percent of the total, have been demarcated.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 136,000 kilometers of inter-county boundaries were
marked in the last two years. The length accounts for 34
percent of the entire inter-county boundaries.
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years in the Chinese history, the central
governments had not carried out such a national boundary
demarcation, resulting in a lot of boundary disputes, said
Jin Ergang, who works with a leading group on demarcation under
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
As population grows and demands for natural resources increase,
the boundary problems are becoming more obvious, he said.
</P>
<P>
The State Council decided in November of 1995 that land
boundaries between provinces and counties would be marked within
five years, beginning from 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The demarcation is aimed at settling the current boundary disputes
and preventing new ones, and providing legal evidence
for resolving future disputes," said Li Guixian, state councillor
and director of the leading demarcation group.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes smoothly, 70 percent of the boundaries
between provinces will have been marked by the end of 1998, said
Li Baoku, vice-minister of civil affairs.

The implant, which is inserted into the skin, was developed by
Professor Irving Spitz of Jerusalem's Shaare Zedek Hospital with
scientists from the Population Council in New York.
</P>
<P>
Implanting the 2.6-centimeter long capsule under the skin on
the inner part of the arm is a simple procedure.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the metastasizing prostate cancer has been treated
by castration or quarterly injections of testosterone suppressors,
which are painful and inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
Spitz, who heads the hospital's hormone research institute,
said this type of prostate cancer is the first type of tumor
proven to be connected with hormone production.
</P>
<P>
Such new treatment has been used in clinical studies on 34
patients, and it is also being tested at the Cornell University
and the University of Salzburg in the U.S.. But it could take two
years for it to gain approval from the United States Food and Drug
Administration, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: S. African Tourism Developing Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Tourism in South Africa
has been developing in leaps and bounds since the abolition of
apartheid in 1994 that makes it possible for Pretoria to return
to the world community, paving the way for the promotion of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
According to Tourism Minister Pallo Jordan, the number of
overseas visitors to the country increased by 1.26 million in
1995 compared with 1994, recording a 34.8 percent increase. And
in 1996, almost five million tourists visited South Africa and
the projected figure for 2000 is about 7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
The higher number of tourists brought in an estimated increase
of 7.5 billion Rands (1.7 billion Dollars) in 1995, a 107 percent
growth in foreign exchange as against 1994, Jordan noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South African tourism has earned 5.7 billion U.S.
Dollars, with 37,000 direct and 74,000 indirect job opportunities
having been created, he said, adding that one direct and two
indirect job opportunities would be created by each 33 additional
visitors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the minister said, in accordance with the current
growth rate, tourism contribution to the country's GDP could rise
from the present 4.5 percent to 10 percent, generating 40 billion
Rand (8.5 billion U.S. Dollars) annually and creating two million
jobs.
</P>
<P>
"No other industry has such potential," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is a powerful engine for job-creation, economic
revival and will generate much-needed foreign currency," said
President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is well known for its exceptional tourism
advantages: the magnificent panorama of Cape of Good Hope, the
world-renowned Kruger National Park which stretches about 20,000
square kilometers, and diverse folk cultures...
</P>
<P>
What is more, well accommodated and good serviced hotels,
well-netted air and road traffic, which are not at all inferior
to their European counterparts, have turned South Africa into the
most favored tourist resort in African continent.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, also famous for its gold and diamond production,
could not give a full play to its tourism advantages due to the
implementation of inhumane apartheid before 1994. During that
period, South Africa was even below the average world level in
terms of tourism income against population ratio, let alone to be
a tourism giant.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town, the legislative capital of South Africa, is the
most important tourist destination in the country. It is also
listed as one of 10 famous resorts in the world.
</P>
<P>
Although it failed to win the bid to host the 2004 Olympic
Games, Cape Town, known as the Mother City, has after all made a
very successful advertisement for itself both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Upon the eve of Christmas and the annual festive season, all
the hotels and scenic spots in the city have been filled with
travelers pouring in from all directions.
</P>
<P>
Facing the increasing tourists, the Cape Town municipal
government pledged that they would do their best to improve
travel services in line with the latest international standard.
</P>
<P>
In addition, city officials have also expressed determination
to maintain good relations and cooperation between the black and
the white so as to create better environment for tourism.
</P>
<P>
Following the example of Capetonian counterparts, many travel
agencies and groups in other parts of South Africa are extending
and polishing travel facilities.
</P>
<P>
The development of tourism in South Africa has played an
active part in promoting tourism in the whole African continent.
So far hotel chain groups in more than 13 African countries have
made investments in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the industry said tourism, which can be one of the
most powerful engines of an African renaissance, is becoming a
major driving force behind economic growth in Africa, and is
expected to create another three million jobs by 2000.
</P>
<P>
As China and South Africa establish comprehensive diplomatic
relations at the end of this year, some South African travel
agencies and hotel groups have also started seeking ways to
extend cooperation with their Chinese counterparts.

<HEADLINE> IMF Warns Tanzania on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The International
Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged the Tanzanian government to reduce
inflation and speed up the pace of privatization, and warned that
the economy is vulnerable to external shocks.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the country's economy, the IMF said it expected
economic growth in Tanzania to rise to 4.7 percent in 1997/98
from 3.9 percent in 1996/97, and inflation to decline to 13
percent from 17.1 percent, Daily News said today.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said the Tanzanian authorities should aim for "further
strong declines" in inflation in the coming year, and should
accelerate the government's privatization program. It regretted
that the privatization program has not moved as fast as
planned over the last year.
</P>
<P>
The government should also eliminate its arrears and carry out
proposed tax reforms, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming steps taken in the government's 1997/98
budget, the IMF said authorities must be "vigilant" and should
be prepared to take further action if needed to meet their fiscal
targets.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania's economy remains vulnerable to external shocks,"
such as a drop in demand for exports, a rise in the price of
imports, or a shift in investor sentiment, the IMF said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Takes More Active Part in Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Following its integration into
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in July this year,
Myanmar Monday also joined another new regional grouping, the
BIMST-EC, signifying the country's increasingly active and
positive participation in the regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The BIMST-EC (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and
Thailand -- Economic Cooperation) is a sub-regional economic
grouping along the rim of Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
The originally-formed four-member grouping, initiated by
Thailand and founded in June this year, decided to expand its
membership to Myanmar in August.
</P>
<P>
A special ministerial meeting of the grouping held Monday in
Bangkok, agreed to strengthen cooperation in the fields of trade,
investment, transport and communications, energy, tourism and
fishery among the member countries.
</P>
<P>
On the issue, an Asian diplomat here said that as a country
straddling South and Southeast Asia, Myanmar is destined to play
the key role of a bridge in the regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Today's Myanmar, after standing alone for several decades,
comes to realize that the regional economic cooperation has become
an acknowledged vehicle for promoting economic development.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, together with Thailand, is not only a member of the
ASEAN but also an associate of the BIMST-EC, thus becoming a
gateway for the two groupings to link South and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's successive entry into the two groupings is also seen
as a major event for the country in the outgoing year of 1997 and
has opened a new chapter in its foreign relations with the nations
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar opened its door to the outside world in late
1988, adopting a market-oriented economic system, investment from
countries in the region increased year by year.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, foreign investment, coming
from other ASEAN countries, had increased to over 3 billion U.S.
dollars, accounting for about 45 percent of the
6.5-billion-dollar total foreign investment by the end of
November this year.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Myanmar's foreign trade, Singapore, Thailand and
India are among the country's major trading partners in the region
</P>
<P>
with an annual volume of trade maintaining at a level of about
500 million, 500 million and 250 million U.S. dollars
respectively in  recent years, according to available figures.
</P>
<P>
The initiation of border trade agreements between Myanmar and
Bangladesh, India and Thailand in the last two years has also
brought about further development of Myanmar's trade with these
countries and promote the regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Myanmar's positive response to the
cooperation among member nations of the ASEAN and the BIMST-EC
would be, from a long term point of view, not only conductive to
the development of the country but also to peace, stability and
development in the region as a whole.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
has called for an intensified crackdown on economic malpractice in an
effort to create a fairer environment for market competition in
China.
</P>
<P>
He also called for intensified efforts to enact more and
improved laws and regulations guiding the operation of the market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The leader made his remarks after listening to a report
on the work of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce
(SAIC) which serves as the market watchdog.
</P>
<P>
He said the industry and commerce departments are important for
enforcing laws and regulations by administrative means under
socialist market-economy conditions. Its role in the present
period cannot be under-estimated, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure the market economy develops in a sound and orderly
way, we should have an authoritative department to maintain the
fair market order, and that role mainly goes to the industry and
commerce departments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li praised the market watchdogs for their achievements in
recent years in cracking down on the production and sale of fake
and shoddy goods, smuggling, cheating through contracts and
illegal pyramid selling.
</P>
<P>
"The tens of thousands of industry and commerce personnel
working across the country are an indispensable force in
maintaining the market economic order. They should constantly
improve their political awareness, professional skills
and work style," he urged.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier's remarks were made during a three-day
national work conference on industry and commerce which closed
here today.
</P>
<P>
In a report delivered on the conference, Wang Zhongfu, SAIC's
director-general, called for intensified crackdowns on the
production and sale of fake and shoddy goods, pornographic and
illegal publications, smuggling and drugs.

<HEADLINE> Salas Remains Till Next Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's River Plate
striker Marcelo Salas, rumored to be transferred to Europe in a
multi-million dollar deal, will remain with the team until after
the World Cup, his agent said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
His agent, Gustavo Mascardi told reporters that even if the
Chilean star was sold, it would be on condition that he plays for
River next season. The next Argentine tournament ends in July.
</P>
<P>
Mascardi denied reports that River had accepted a bid of more
than 30 million U.S. dollars from Italy's Lazio. But he said
representatives from both clubs had met to discuss the player's
future.
</P>
<P>
Salas, who turned 23 on Wednesday, has become South American
soccer's hottest property since moving to River Plate last year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, he scored two goals to lead River Plate to
win South American's Super Cup against Brazil's Sao Paulo with
2-1. Four days later, he scored the goal which clinched River's
third straight league title in a 1-1 draw with Argentinos Juniors.
</P>
<P>
England's Manchester United was one of the first clubs to
express an interest in Salas, and manager Alex Ferguson traveled
to Chile to watch him on international duty. The club has recently
said they will not pursue their interest.
</P>
<P>
Mascardi said Salas prefers a move to Italy. AC Milan and Parma
are believed to be among the top clubs vying for him.

<HEADLINE> Russian Plane Allowed to Fly to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Sanctions Commission
(UNSCOM) on Iraq Wednesday issued a permission for a Russian
aircraft to continue its flight to Baghdad, Iran's official news
agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Tupolev-204, with five tonnes of medicine and 23 Russian
parliament members (MPs) and specialists on board, was stopped by
the Iranian authority from entering Iraq via Iranian airspace, for
lack of U.N. authorization.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM agreed to the plane's flight to Baghdad after it
obtained detailed information about the cargo aboard from Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
However, IRNA did not mention if the Russian plane has left for
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Russian plane was reportedly scheduled to land in Iraq
Wednesday by attempting to sidestep UNSCOM. It had asked for
approval from Azerbaijan and Iran to pass through their airspace,
instead of requesting a U.N. permit.
</P>
<P>
The plane was held up by the Iranian authority citing it would
defy the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Tehran proposed to the U.N. that it deliver the Russian
shipments of medicine to Iraq through a land route.
</P>
<P>
"Sending the cargo through air would only be possible through
special U.N. authorization," Iran's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday,
and "it is natural that Iran continues to abide by U.N. sanctions
regulations on Iraq."
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. sanctions imposed on after its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990, no plane can fly into Iraq except those of
U.N. carrying food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The flight of Russian plane was an initiative of Russia's
ultra-nationalist MP and head of the Liberal Democratic Party
Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
</P>
<P>
He has strongly criticized the crippling U.N. sanctions on
Iraq.

<P>
SEOUL, December 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will receive
emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund and the Group
of Seven industrialized nations to help it out of the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Lim Chang-yuel, the South Korean minister of finance and
economy, said the two organizations have agreed to provide 10
billion U.S. dollars to South Korea, which is sorely in need of
foreign aid to bail out the world's 11th largest economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF would provide two billion dollars and the rest of the
money would come from the Group of Seven, he added.
</P>
<P>
"I may say these are the Christmas gifts to Korean people from
our allies," he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Under agreements with Seoul, the world financial institution
will provide 57 billion dollars in rescue loans to the country,
whose crisis has been caused by the failure of conglomerates, and
bad loans by financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
In return for the loans, the IMF demands that South Korea
completely open its domestic securities market, close down ailing
commercial banks and abolish all restrictions over foreigners'
investments in its bond markets.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the country's economy could grind to a halt
without these huge loans.

<P>
LHASA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- No power stations. No
transmission cables. However, Monchunggong Village in Tibet is
ablaze with lights when night falls. The villagers say they have
sunlight at night.
</P>
<P>
Monchunggong is the first village to install solar energy since
the Tibet Autonomous Region launched its "sunlight program" in
1992. The village is located at the foot of Yungbulhakhang Palace,
the first palace ever in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Tibet invested 200,000 yuan and equipped 20 families
in the village with solar energy apparatus, which was provided by
the State Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Nyima Cering family of eight now can make blankets at home
with the aid of electric lights. "It's fantastic," they said. "The
solar energy enables us to do farm work during the day and to make
rugs at night. We earn 20,000-30,000 yuan each year because of
that."
</P>
<P>
Nyoidrub, a 72-year-old family member, now can do her
needlework under the lights powered by solar energy. "I just
cannot believe it," she said. "It happened, and is really fresh to
me."
</P>
<P>
Nyoidrub is so proud of the solar energy that she even takes
visitors to the roof to view the apparatus. And she knows how it
works.

Sixteen families in the village now are making carpets or
processing agricultural products at nights, according to Zhaxi,
head of the village.
</P>
<P>
Zhaxi said that in the past many people had to chat or just
sleep at night. Now, many study instead. Villagers often gather to
watch videos on technical information to learn about science, to
farm with new technology and to trade with information.
</P>
<P>
Villagers also can watch movies such as "Tunnel Warfare." They
used to walk 10 miles to watch a film, but now see movies seven or
eight times each month. Our life is much richer, they say.
</P>
<P>
Village life is no longer dark. In the brightly lighted village
women are busy with needlework, kids concentrate on their homework
and families are hand-weaving rugs.
</P>
<P>
Two more villages will be involved in the program in the area
next year, according to an official of the science and technology
committee in the southern part of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy is expected to spread throughout the whole
southern area of 300,000 residents. The program's goal is to
install 70,000 solar-energy stoves to help solve fuel problems and
one million square meters of solar-energy greenhouses to grow
vegetables for one-fifth of the population in Tibet.

XINING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The first performance of a
modern drama on the life of the 10th Panchen Lama was staged
Wednesday in Xining, capital of northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
Panchen Erdini Qoigyi Gyaincian (1938-1989), a native of
Qinghai, was one of the two chief lamas of the Gelupa (yellow
sect) of Tibetan Buddhism. He was officially recognized as the
10th Panchen on June 3, 1949.
</P>
<P>
The 10th Panchen, a patriotic religious leader, contributed
greatly to the unity of China's ethnic groups and to political
stability. "We want to show his brilliant life to the public
through this play," said Wang Nian, the playwright.
</P>
<P>
The actors visited the panchen's mother, relatives and friends
in a bid to have a better understanding of his life, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The play will be shown around the province from now to the
Spring Festival, and then will be staged in Beijing.

</P>
<P>
Starting Thursday (Christmas day), police will keep a close
watch on ex-convicts, gunmen, some infamous "influential figures"

<P>
Their focus will be on places of entertainment that are
unlicensed or that stay open beyond legal closing times.

For this purpose, special checkpoints have been set up and
police teams will patrol "risky" areas, such as department stores,
financial institutions, slums, low-grade hotels and construction
sites.
</P>
<P>
Agencies under the Bangkok Police Bureau have been requested to
make daily reports on their performance and important cases.

NEW DELHI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The performance of the
Indian corporate sector in the first half of 1997-98 (from April
to September) suggests diverse trends in profitability for
consumer-oriented items and the core sectors, according to a
survey available here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Investment Research and
Information Services LTD for the Associations Council of the
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), has covered 465 companies
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The sectors like consumer durables, food and food processing,
paints, cigarettes, tea and coffee have recorded a significant
increase in their net profit figure in comparison with the first
half of 1996-97, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
However, the core sectors like petrochemicals, power, steel,
information technology (hardware) and telecom equipment have
witnessed an erosion in their profitability.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the survey has revealed that the corporate sector of
India had been in reasonably good health in the first half of

<HEADLINE> Thailand Sees Minor Rise in Tourist Arrivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand recorded 5.27 million
tourist arrivals between January and September this year, up 0.95
percent compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand saw the minor growth in tourist arrivals during the
first nine months mainly due to several months of haze in
Southeast Asia and the regional economic turmoil, according to
recent reports from the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT).
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals from East Asia, one of the most significant
markets for Thailand, posted a 1.34 percent of increase and they
were mainly sources contributing to the tiny rise of tourist
arrivals in Thailand during the period.
</P>
<P>
Tourists from New Zealand and Australia also grew.
</P>
<P>
However, tourists from most other markets dropped.
</P>
<P>
Tourists from Europe, another major market for Thailand, saw a
0.07 percent decrease during the period, with less tourists from
seven of the 15 European Union members, including Germany, Italy,
and France.
</P>
<P>
The TAT said that the European market was affected mainly by
many months of news reports about the haze.
</P>
<P>
Tourists from South Asia dropped significantly by 15.2 percent
during the period and the TAT attributed this to the tight visa
conditions by Thailand as well as the economic and political
problems in the countries.
</P>
<P>
The TAT predicted that the tourist arrivals for the whole year
of 1997 would reach 7.26 million, up around one percent compared
with last year.

<HEADLINE> Moody's Move Adds to Thailand's Woes: Ex-minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Moody's downgrading of
Thailand's foreign currency credit has added to the growing
skepticism of many countries about Thailand's creditworthiness,
former Thai finance minister Thanong Bidaya said.
</P>
<P>
Moody's announcement early this week that Thailand's foreign
currency credit for bonds and notes was reduced to junk status has
made many countries hesitant about providing further assistance to
Thailand, the Bangkok Post Thursday quotes Thanong as saying.
</P>
<P>
The downgrading will frighten away potential foreign capital
inflows, resulting in lack of foreign cash to shore up liquidity
and dampening the country's economic rescue efforts, Thanong said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to prepare cushions for more severe
economic shock waves next year when many more businesses are
expected to close down.
</P>
<P>
He said the government must think of ways of sustaining the
ailing industrial and financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the government to weigh the pros and cons of
making important economic decisions, as it might have to go
against public sentiment in order to protect the national
interests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, deputy prime minister and commerce minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi said on Wednesday that the country's highest economic
growth rate for 1998 would be zero.

WARSAW, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Poland's agriculture maintained
a good yield despite three years of disaster, such as floods and a
cold climate in spring.
</P>
<P>
According to the Polish Central Statistics Bureau, Poland's
grain output reached 24.9 million tons, or 1.5 million tons more
than the average output in the 1991-1995 period and a 0.1 percent
increase over the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The rapeseed yields registered an increase of 100,000 tons over
that of 1996 to 600,000 tons, but still 34.7 percent less than the
average output in the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
The beet output reached 15.7 million tons, a 24.3 percent
increase over the 1991-1995 average, but 12.1 percent lower than
that of 1996, mainly due to the reduced sowing acreage caused by
less orders from sugar refineries.
</P>
<P>
But the potato output suffered a loss of 6.4 million tons to
20.8 million tons, a decrease of 23.7 percent compared with the
previous year as a result of the hot and humid climate in summer
and the rampant insects.

<HEADLINE> Banks to Launch SPV for Revival of Sick Indian Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 25 (Xinhua)-- Some leading Indian banks and
top European banks have come together to launch a special purpose
vehicle (SPV) aimed at buying sick Indian firms, turning them
around and selling them within three to five years, the Business
standard said today.
</P>
<P>
A Mumbai (Bombay)-based firm of chartered accountants will
advise the SPV on the tax implications of the cross-border
transactions and help identify target loss-making companies with
turnaround potential.
</P>
<P>
The firm will also act as a kind of owner-consultant to sick
companies after their management is taken over by the SPV, the
local economic newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Banks would be interested in investing in the SPV as many of
the loans advanced by them to sick companies, which have been
classified as non-performing assets, can be salvaged if the SPV
takes over the companies and turns them around, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said that discussions with leading banks and
institutions are at an advanced stage. These banks and
institutions are expected to contribute strongly to the investor
consortium of funds under the SPV.

<P>
However, Thai deputy prime minister and commerce minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi said Wednesday that Thailand has to do more

The government would provide funds to ease cash flow pressure

<HEADLINE> China Urged to Push Foreign Investment Work to New High (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper,
"People's Daily," today carried an editorial urging the country to
push its use of foreign investment work to a new high.
</P>
<P>
After a national conference on utilization of foreign
investment which opened in Beijing Monday and closed Wednesday,
China is urged to open further to the outside world and continue
to make use of foreign investment in an active, rational and
efficient manner to help promote rapid and healthy growth in the
economy and overall social progress.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stressed that the conference would have
far-reaching impact on China's utilization of foreign investment
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
According to the editorial, in less than 20 years China has
attracted more than 360 billion U.S. dollars, including 220
million U.S. dollars in direct foreign investment, to rank first
in utilizing direct foreign funding among developing nations and
second in the world.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stated that foreign-invested enterprises have
become an important part of China's socialist market
economy. Among the total assets of 240,000-plus foreign-funded
firms in operation, state-owned and collectively owned enterprises
account for 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
The editorial called on people to correctly view the nature and
role of the foreign-funded firms from the practice of China's
primary stage of socialism and from the need to develop social
productivity.

<HEADLINE> China Urged to Push Foreign Investment Work to New High (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China still has lots of potentials to be one of the world's key
destinations in foreign investment, the editorial said. The
country's socialist market-economy mechanism is being set up and
improved, the political situation is stable and the market
prospects are broad, which all constitute new opportunities for
the continued growth of foreign investment. Besides, the country's
potential for scientific and technological progress is great, the
renminbi value is stable, foreign exchange earnings are sufficient
and the comprehensive production cost is low.
</P>
<P>
However, the editorial warned that the level and quantity of
the country's utilization of foreign investment are still low and
leave much to be desired.
</P>
<P>
"It is still a demanding job and the use of foreign investment
should be greatly enhanced," it said.
</P>
<P>
As the utilization of foreign investment embodies the extend of
China's opening-up, the editorial said, it will have significant
impact on the sustainable development of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The editorial elaborated that the trend toward economic and
scientific globalization requires China to actively take part in
international competition and cooperation, and make better use of
domestic and foreign resources. The country also should
unswervingly adhere to the policy of attracting more foreign
investment, especially direct foreign funding.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also encouraged attracting foreign investment in
line with overall requirements of the national economy and
improving the framework of foreign-funding expenditures. It also
stressed the utilization work's "active, rational and efficient"
features.
</P>
<P>
It explained that the socialist market economy is an open
economy and China will, in line with the Deng Xiaoping Theory,
focus on upgrading the quality and efficiency of economic
development, increase the country's comprehensive strength and
international competitiveness, further expand the opening-up and
make a better use of foreign funds in a bid to help promote the
rapid and healthy growth of the national economy and overall
social progress.

SHANGHAI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has completed a
pollution control project on a tributary of the Suzhou River.
</P>
<P>
As one of the six tributaries of the Suzhou River in Shanghai,
the 4.9-kilometer Zhenrugang River is a pollutant source of the
Suzhou River.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the Shanghai Municipal Government decided to invest 60
million yuan in a project to clean up the Zhenrugang River.
</P>
<P>
The project was completed in a year with the construction of
4,069 meters of flood-control walls, the dredging of 54,000 cubic
meters of sludge and the planting of trees and grass on a
20,000-square-meter area along the river.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shanghai Water Resources Department, the
dredging of the river has improved the environment along the river
and will benefit the realignment of the Suzhou River in the coming
years.

students will have more options in learning foreign languages,
Chinese included.

In Bulgaria nowadays, there is a new upsurge in learning
foreign languages. The statistics of a company specializing in
foreign language training show that in the past seven months, more

<P>
Jorge Madrazo pledged the crimes would not go unpunished after

<HEADLINE> Rebels Blame Government for Chiapas Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's Zapatista rebels
Wednesday blamed President Ernesto Zedillo and his government for
the massacre of 45 people in the southern state of Chiapas two
days earlier.
</P>
<P>
In a four-page communique, the Zapatista leader, Subcommandante
Marcos, said the direct responsibility for this bloody event rests
on the president and the Interior Ministry who "two years ago gave
the green light to counterinsurgency by the army".
</P>
<P>
Paramilitaries mercilessly killed 45 men, women and children
who gathered at a church Monday in the village of Acteal, Chiapas
state.
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses said the killers were two dozen gunmen from the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). However, the PRI
leaders denounced the killings, insisting they had no connection
with them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Zedillo bitterly condemned the massacre
while Interior Minister Emilio Chuayffet denied that the
government should bear any responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Jorge Madrazo, who was ordered to take over
the investigation, said that nine people in connection with the
Acteal massacre had been detained while more would be arrested
soon.
</P>
<P>
Both Zedillo and Chuayffet called for the renewal of the peace
talks between the government and the Zapatista rebels to end the
four-year-old war in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
The Zapatista guerrillas declared war on the government on
January 1, 1994, in a bid to obtain greater indigenous rights for
the Indian community.
</P>
<P>
The Monday massacre has triggered worldwide condemnations from
senior figures like United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
United States President Bill Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Prospects Bright for Ukraine's Space Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Prospects of Ukraine's space
industry have been bright in recent years, said Valery Komarov, of
the Ukrainian National Space Agency (UNSA), on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Komarov, a deputy director of the space agency, said Ukrainian
astronaut Leonid Kadeniuk's latest flight aboard a U.S. space
shuttle was a proof of Ukraine's aerospace science.
</P>
<P>
Through international cooperation, he said, the UNSA is gaining
fame and cash.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the space industry earned 105 million U.S. dollars
from 115 foreign commercial agreements. And in the first eight
months of 1997, it earned 82.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
If talks succeed with Russia and the United States on joining
the Alpha program to build an international space station, Ukraine
will be among the world's top space nations, Komarov said.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet republic also joins Globalstar, a space-based
international communications project, and Sea Launch, a commercial
satellite launching project. Both projects look very promising.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is building a central control station in Crimea for
Globalstar, after winning, through bidding procedure, the contract
to launch 36 of the 48 satellites for the Globalstar system.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Russian Diplomacy in Face of NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the fall, Russia moved to develop relations with other big
European powers, strengthen its status as a "big power of Europe"
and reduce the U.S. influence in the European business.
</P>
<P>
Russia formed the "Big Europe" concept stressing that the
security of Europe should be protected, not by any foreign
intervenors, but the Europeans themselves.
</P>
<P>
This season also witnessed the frequent visits to Moscow by
leaders from major European countries. And most noticeable, Russia
started a special cooperative relationship with France and
Germany, and the three announced to hold regular summit every year.
</P>
<P>
Another move Russia took to create a better international
environment for itself in face of NATO expansion was to actively
develop relations with China, Japan, India, South Korea and the
Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) including Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Russia regards the development of its friendly and
good-neighborly relations with China as a "separate priority area"
in its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin held two summit
meetings in 1997 and signed two joint communiques as well as a
series of documents.
</P>
<P>
Their meetings and the documents they signed injected new
vitality and substances into the 21st century-oriented
Russia-China strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
The "breakthrough" in Russia-Japan relations was another major
achievement in Russia's diplomacy in the Asian and Pacific region
this year.
</P>
<P>
In November, Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto held a two-day informal summit in Russia's Siberian city
of Krasnoyarsk and agreed on a plan designed to strengthen trade
and economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Hashimoto also committed to conclude a bilateral
peace treaty by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Russia's entrance into the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation at
its Vancouver informal leadership meeting last month paved the way
for Russia to fully undertake the Asian and Pacific affairs.
</P>
<P>
As part of its all-round foreign policy, Moscow put forward a
12-point program for realizing a comprehensive and just peace in
the Middle East and helped ease the latest tension between Iraq
and the United States over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov also made shuttle
visits to Latin America in November, aiming to enhance cooperation
with countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Although Russia's diplomacy in 1997 has achieved some positive
results, the containment and counter-containment struggle between
Moscow and NATO will go down well into the next century.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hostage Taker Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The fired postal worker who
held seven people hostage at a regional mail center in Denver
surrendered on Christmas Eve after a nine and a half hour standoff
with police.
</P>
<P>
Davis Lee Jackson, 42, surrendered at about 5:00 p.m. local
time (19:00 EST). The hostages were released unharmed, reports
from Denver said.
</P>
<P>
Jackson allegedly got into the building shortly after 7:00
a.m. local time with a shotgun, possibly through loading docks and
held the hostages in a supervisor's office in the mail sorting
building, police said.
</P>
<P>
The 24-hour mail center is one of the nation's largest and
busiest, handling most of the mail for Colorado and Wyoming. About
3,000 people work at the center, which includes a 24-hour post
office.
</P>
<P>
About 50 police officers and 25 Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) agents surrounded the building during the standoff and
evacuated hundreds of workers.
</P>
<P>
Police negotiated with the gunman through the day and sent food
into the office.
</P>
<P>
The motivation was not immediately known, but the gunman was
fired for threatening a supervisor 18 months ago.

<HEADLINE> Minister Opposed to Selling Key Industry Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Minister of Fuel and
Power, Sergei Kiriyenko, told a press conference Wednesday that he
strongly opposed selling the stocks of key state-owned enterprises
which should be controlled by national majority shares, such as
Gas Monopoly-Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko signed a contract to manage the state stocks of the
Gas Monopoly-Gazprom on behalf of the national representative
committee of this company with its Board of Directors on December
20, so strengthening state control of this enterprise.
</P>
<P>
But it was reported that Russia's State Property Department
proposed, on December 23, that due to the large quantity and
difficult management of national assets, most state shares in
companies not dominantly state-owned, should be listed on the
market.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that state stocks in electric power,
transportation, fuel and gas and some other strategic products'
enterprises should be sold out first.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kiriyenko said Russia would make up a clear
investment method next year so as to actively attract more
overseas investors and protect their rights and interests. On the
other hand, foreign investors should obey Russian law when
operating businesses.
</P>
<P>
He said that only when the electric power become a product in
which the payments could be guaranteed could foreign capital flow
to the Russian power department.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Italy's overall
foreign reserves rose slightly to 129.4 trillion lire (about 74.3
billion U.S. dollars) by the end of November, the Italian Exchange
Office (UIC) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall surplus in the year's first 11 months was
19.1 trillion lire (10.7 billion dollars), lower than the same
period of 1996, when the figure was 25.1 trillion lire (14 billion
dollars), data released by UIC showed.
</P>
<P>
The office attributed the decrease of surplus to the outflow of
Italian capital, which amounted to 12.4 trillion lire (7 billion
dollars) in the 11-month period.
</P>
<P>
The nation's foreign debt totalled 75.6 trillion lire (43
billion dollars) by the end of November.

<HEADLINE> Large Projects in Chinese Province Attract More Overseas Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investors have
increasingly concentrated their attention on the large projects in
south China's land-locked province of Hunan.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the province had 145 overseas-funded
projects, with more than one million US dollars each, during the
first 11 months of this year. And altogether, 650 million US
dollars were actually used, accounting for 81 percent of the
province's total.
</P>
<P>
Of the 145 projects, 28 had a total investment of 423 million
US dollars, accounting for 52 percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
To date, some large transnational companies, such as Hitachi
and Kobe Steel Corporation of Japan and LG of the Republic of
Korea, have gradually made their investment in the province.
</P>
<P>
Before 1992, overseas funds in Hunan were mainly from Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan, which accounted to over 87 percent of the
province's total. And most of the investors were small and
medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
To attract more overseas investment, the provincial government
in 1993 established a department in charge of absorbing overseas
investment and offering a series of services for overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province sponsored four trade fairs during
1994-97. Now, the investment from foreign countries has almost
equaled that from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Peace at Last, Central America Seeks Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Leaving decades of civil wars
behind them, Central American countries have furthered on their
path towards peace and development in year 1997.
</P>
<P>
Of the five countries in the region, Guatemala was the last, in
1996, to see the ending of its internal armed conflict, following
the suits of Nicaragua in 1990 and of El Salvador in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, in 1997, at their leaders' four routine summit
meetings with counterparts from Honduras and Costa Rica, regional
cooperation, mainly economic, turned a new focus for discussions.
</P>
<P>
What they agreed on at the gatherings are the needs to
consolidate peace and democracy, step up reconstruction efforts,
carry out economic reforms, and accelerate the integration process.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting in May to "Bridge Toward the 21st Central," they
said Central America should take the opportunity provided by the
period of unprecedented stability and eradicate remnants of war.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, the Nicaraguan, Salvadoran and Guatemalan
governments pushed forwards their dialogues with the opposition,
and successfully persuaded most guerrilla groups to lay down arms.
</P>
<P>
In El Salvador, the government's "Gun for Food" program
proceeded well to allow civilians to hand in weapons in exchange
for food, so as to eliminate potential threat of civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
And in Honduras, the police force cut off its links with the
military and accepted the leadership of a civilian government
under a reform program.
</P>
<P>
Also through peaceful dialogues, Central American nations
resolved some of the disputes among themselves in 1997.
</P>
<P>
El Salvador and Honduras, once in war over border disputes,
improved their ties; and Nicaragua and Honduras sought diplomatic
means to decide their territorial waters available for fishing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, through consultations,
resolved the issue arising from the fact that thousands of
Nicaraguan laborers were staying and working in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Economically, years of armed conflicts have made Central
America the poorest region in Latin America, with 60 percent of
its 30 million population live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
But with the return of peace, the region's stagnant economy has
shown signs of recovery. Its economy grew by an average of 2.3
percent in 1996, and by an estimated 4.0 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Internally, by refocusing on economic development in the year,
Central American countries took a series of measures to adjust
economic structures, promote agriculture and diversify exports.
</P>
<P>
They also made efforts to boost international tourism and make
it a major foreign currency earner. As a result, tourism in the
region currently grows at an average annual rate of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
To attract more visitors, at least within the region,
Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua decided in November
to eliminate visa requirements on reciprocal basis.
</P>
<P>
On foreign trade, Central American countries are gradually
decreasing their dependence on the United States and expanding
cooperation with other countries and regions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Faced up with globalization and increasingly fierce competition
at the world market, Central American leaders have realized the
importance of joining hands, economically and politically, to
uplift the region's overall status in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In July, at a summit meeting in Panama City, they pledged to
speed up the regional integration process and give stronger
mandates to the Central American Parliament and Court.
</P>
<P>
Two months later, in Managua, Nicaragua, they agreed to
establish a regional political and economic union, and urged
Central Americans to give full support to create a "common house."
</P>
<P>
The process was substantiated in early 1997, with the erection
of a high-voltage power line to help alleviate power shortage in
the region between Guatemala in the north and Panama in the south.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed to raise 620 million U.S. dollars for
renovating the Central America section of the Pan-American
Highway. In addition, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua agreed
to build a road linking the Pacific and Atlantic coasts.
</P>
<P>
As the momentum for continued growth is there at the end of the
year, Central American countries still face problems -- political,
economic and social -- left over by years of civil wars.
</P>
<P>
It's a consensus among analysts that a lot more, often harder,
work is needed to secure Central America's long-term social
stability and initiate the region's economic takeoff.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Russian Diplomacy in Face of NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The year 1997 is a busy year
for Russian diplomacy. On the NATO east expansion issue, Russia
has conducted tough talks with the military alliance with an aim
to minimize the expansion's adverse impact.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Russia has enhanced cooperation among the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and improved its
relations with other European countries and Asian and Latin
American nations as well.
</P>
<P>
NATO's expansion to include former Warsaw Pact countries in
central and eastern Europe has been one of the major issues on
which Russia and the West had contradictory views since the end of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Russia views the move as part of the overall strategy of the
West of containing Russia and filling up the post-Cold War vacuum
in central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Russian-U.S. relations became strained because the United
States pushed ahead with the NATO expansion. However, after the
first-stage expansion plan was announced, both sides took some
steps to improve their ties.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton invited his Russian counterpart
Boris Yeltsin to "fully" participate in the summit of the G-7
industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia, on the other hand, adopted a pragmatic attitude toward
the United States in order to get more economic benefits from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the impossibility of preventing the NATO expansion,
Russia chose to minimize its effect on Russia's security interest
by striking a deal with the alliance.
</P>
<P>
After difficult bargains, President Yeltsin and the leaders of
NATO countries signed a historic document on the basic relations
between Russia and the military alliance on May 27.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed on a mechanism for future cooperation and
agreed to start a new-type cooperative relationship between them.
</P>
<P>
But the signing of the document did not lead to a solution of
the fundamental contradictions on the issue of NATO expansion
which Russia still considers a "strategic mistake" the West made
after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
To prevent NATO expansion from reaching its borders, Russia was
firmly opposed to NATO accepting Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as
its new members, and went as far as to offer security cover to the
three Baltic countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also announced that Russia will cut by 40 percent its
army and naval forces stationed in the northwestern region.
</P>
<P>
As another safeguard against NATO expansion, Russia made great
efforts to improve its relations with other CIS members and
promoted CIS integration more vigorously. Russia and Belarus
upgraded the Community of Sovereign Republics, formed by them only
in April 1, to a Union, to speed up their economic and political
integration.
</P>
<P>
In May, Yeltsin made his state visit to Ukraine, the first of
its kind since the Soviet Union's disintegration in 1991, and
achieved a breakthrough in the bilateral relations. In Kiev,
Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma signed the Treaty of
Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership and put an end to the
long-standing problem of the Black Sea fleet.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Russian Diplomacy in Face of NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the fall, Russia moved to develop relations with other big
European powers, forfeit its status as a "big power of Europe" and
reduce the U.S. influence in the European business.
</P>
<P>
Russia formed the "Big Europe" concept stressing that the
security of Europe should be protected, not by any foreign
intervenors, but the Europeans themselves.
</P>
<P>
This season also witnessed the frequent visits to Moscow by
leaders from major European countries. And most noticeable, Russia
started a special cooperative relationship with France and
Germany, and the three announced to hold regular summit every year.
</P>
<P>
Another move Russia took to create a better international
environment for itself in face of NATO expansion was to actively
develop relations with China, Japan, India, South Korea and the
Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) including Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Russia regards the development of its friendly and
good-neighborly relations with China as a "separate priority area"
in its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin held two summit
meetings in 1997 and signed two joint communiques as well as a
series of documents.
</P>
<P>
Their meetings and the documents they signed injected new
vitality and substances into the 21st century-oriented
Russia-China strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
The "breakthrough" in Russia-Japan relations was another major
achievement in Russia's diplomacy in the Asian and Pacific region
this year.
</P>
<P>
In November, Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto held a two-day informal summit in Russia's Siberian city
of Krasnoyarsk and agreed on a plan designed to strengthen trade
and economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Hashimoto also committed to conclude a bilateral
peace treaty by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Russia's entrance into the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation at
its Vancouver informal leadership meeting last month paved the way
for Russia to fully undertake the Asian and Pacific affairs.
</P>
<P>
As part of its all-round foreign policy, Moscow put forward a
12-point program for realizing a comprehensive and just peace in
the Middle East and helped ease the latest tension between Iraq
and the United States over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov also made shuttle
visits to Latin America in November, aiming to enhance coopertion
with countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Although Russia's diplomacy in 1997 has achieved some positive
results, the containment and counter-containment struggle between
Moscow and NATO will go down well into the next century.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: EU-China Ties Make Apparent Progress in 1997 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union-China ties
in politics, trade and investment have scored eye-catching
progress in 1997, according to a leading EU official in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, ambassador Endymion
Wilkinson, head of the delegation of the EU European Commission,
especially mentioned the new strategy toward China approved by the
commission in November of 1996, which stressed its "overall,
independent and long-range" features.
</P>
<P>
According to the new strategy, the EU would further promote
exchanges and cooperation in economy, trade, science, technology
and development assistance with China.
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson said that last year's EU-China high-level exchange of
visits was more frequent, while both sides cooperated very well in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to the ambassador, in the first Europe-Asia summit
held in Bangkok in March of 1996, China played a "very positive
role" and leaders of the EU nations are looking forward to meeting
Chinese leaders in the second Europe-Asia summit scheduled for
next April in London.
</P>
<P>
China has also undertaken frequent and positive dialogues with
the EU on China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
making great progress, Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
He said vice-president Leon Brittan of the EU Commission had
very fruitful talks in October with Chinese Minister Wu Yi of the
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, in which both sides
reached consensus on some issues of principle.

<P>
At present, he went on to say, the EU-China negotiations on
China's entry into the WTO have entered an important period and
both sides are undertaking positive dialogues.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador added that EU-China trade has been on rise and
EU practical investment in China has also maintained its upward
momentum.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission recently decided to propose removing the
"non-market economy" label applied to China in the EU's
anti-dumping policy, he said, adding that this indicates the EU
has recognized China's ongoing reform is moving toward a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The EU is still one of the best high-technology suppliers to
China and, in 1997, the EU assistance fund for China's cooperation
projects has amounted to 65-to-70 million ECU (about 72 to 84
million U.S. dollars), three times that of 1994, Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, the EU and China have 30 cooperation
projects and have signed agreements on many new projects.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 the EU assistance fund for cooperative projects with
China will remain at the same level as this year, the ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
Also next year, he said, many leaders of EU nations will be
visiting China. He said he expects EU-China political relations to
improve, while bilateral trade and investment will continue to
increase.
</P>
<P>
"Bilateral talks on China's entry into the WTO will gain more
progress," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The tourist city of Guilin in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has attracted 10 of
the world's top 500 companies to invest more than 100 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The city has paid more attention to quality than quantity in
attracting overseas investment, and increased efforts to interest
international giants.
</P>
<P>
Guilin has improved its urban infrastructure during the last
few years, with a number of major projects launched in the past
six years mainly in telecommunications, water supply and drainage
systems.
</P>
<P>
With an international airport and the Guilin-Liuzhou expressway
open to traffic, the city has been drawn closer to other parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
The local government has stressed good service and favorable
policies to multinational corporations. It has asked relevant
government departments to keep in close touch with overseas
investors to help them prosper in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that many of the city's large overseas-backed
companies have achieved good returns. Their success has brought
more capital, technology and management experience to the city
which has introduced 427 million U.S. dollars in this year's first
11 months, up 141 percent over last year.

<HEADLINE> Financial Crisis to Reduce Demand for Chinese Rolled Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis in
Southeast Asia will reduce China's rolled steel exports and make
China's domestic market more competitive next year, according to a
report in the latest issue of China Economic Times.
</P>
<P>
The report said that less demand from Southeast Asia, a major
overseas market for China's rolled steel, will severely affect
China's exports.
</P>
<P>
"The Asia-Pacific region will see its need for rolled steel
decrease by 20 percent," said the newspaper, sponsored by the
development and research center of the State Council. "In areas
severely affected by the crisis, such as Thailand, most
construction sites have been halted and some car manufacturers
will cease production for a few months."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's domestic market will face stiff competition
from Southeast Asian countries, whose products will become cheaper
and more competitive following the depreciation of their
currencies, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
China's tendency to further lower its tariff from its October
cut to 10 percent in 2005, a level lower than average for
developing countries, means China is likely to encounter stronger
pressure for imports, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper estimates that imports of rolled steel from other
Southeast Asian nations will be higher in 1998 because of their
currency depreciation.

<HEADLINE> No Mad Cow Disease Discovered in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of
Agriculture has announced that not a single case of Mad Cow
disease has been discovered in the country.
</P>
<P>
"This is a result of the Chinese government's implementing
strict preventive measures such as enhancing epidemic inspection
of imported meat," said an official with the Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The mad cow disease, a killer disease for cattle, has been
spread to 12 countries since first discovered in Britain in 1985,
causing serious losses to these country's animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists believe that people who have eaten beef from
cows with the disease may fall victim to the fatal
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
To keep the disease out of China, the Ministry has issued two
notices forbidding the importation of cattle, cattle embryos, beef
and beef products from the countries where Mad Cow disease has
taken place.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry has vowed to continue taking effective measures to
prevent the disease from getting into China.

<HEADLINE> Forest Sue Anderlecht Over Bribery Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 25 (Xinhua) -- English first division side
Nottingham Forest and 16 former players have started court action
against Belgian club Anderlecht over the 1984 UEFA Cup bribery
scandal.
</P>
<P>
Forest's Belgian lawyer Filip Goemans said on Wednesday that a
writ had been served against former Andrlecht chairman Constant
Vanden Stock and Raymond van Deken for their failure to respond
whithin a three month deadline.
</P>
<P>
Vanden Stock admitted in September that he paid 27,000 US
dollars as a "loan" to the Spanish referee in the second leg of
the 1984 UEFA Cup semifinal which they won 3-0 and reached the
final 3-2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Forest, who had won the first leg 2-0, controversially
disallowed a goal in the return leg.
</P>
<P>
Goemans said Forest had tried for three months to reach a
financial settlement and received no positive reaction from
Anderlecht.
</P>
<P>
Forest and their players are seeking up to seven million US
dollars in damages from Anderlecht and the two club officials.
</P>
<P>
The case is seen as an embarrasment for the Belgian soccer
union and they are under pressure to end the dispute before the
2000 European Nations Championships being jointly-hosted by
Belgium and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Goemans said a financial agreement was still possible and would
benefit the game's credibility.
</P>
<P>
In September, Anderlecht were banned by UEFA from playing in
the next European competition for which they qualify.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Seeking IMF Loan to Aid Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank is
seeking a two billion U.S. dollar short-term loan from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to aid its foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports Thursday, the new loan, which
will fall under a so-called precautionary arrangement, will last
for 12 to 18 months although it is still under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted as saying that
the IMF "will come here, assuming we complete the (existing
program) on the latter part of January to talk about the
precautionary arrangement."
</P>
<P>
The Philippines was to have exited 35 years of IMF tutelage at
the end of this month, but the IMF has deferred its final review
on ending the program to see whether the country meets two
requirements -- passage of a new oil-deregulation law and posting
a budget surplus in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On a "very, very preliminary basis", Singson said, talks are
also going on between the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank to provide "program loans" to the country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it was a step toward restoring confidence and
easing pressure on the Philippine peso, which has lost one third
of its value since July 11.
</P>
<P>
They said it is important that at least half of the two billion
dollars will be disbursed quickly so rising fears about the health
of the country's foreign reserves and the stability of the local
currency can be addressed immediately.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign reserves stood at just below 10 billion
dollars last week, less than three months' worth of imports.

<HEADLINE> More Moutai Spirits to Be Turned out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- An upgrading of technology at
the Guizhou Moutai Distillery Group is expected to increase
productivity by 50 percent when completed in 2000. The project at
the distillery in southwestern China's Guizhou Province will cost
400 million yuan (nearly 50 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The annual production capacity of the group is 4,000 tons of
moutai, a liquor made from sorghum grain. This was achieved after
the completion of two upgrades in recent years for an investment
of 530 million yuan (about 55 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The group expects to make an historic record by turning out
4,400 tons of moutai this year while earning 500 million yuan in
sales, said Ji Keliang, chairman of the group's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
The new project that will become operational in 2000 will raise
the annual production capacity to 6,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The production of moutai, one of the most popular spirits in
the world along with French cognac and Scottish whisky, is
restricted by complicated and time-consuming workmanship.

<HEADLINE> First Rotating Gamma-Ray Stereotaxic Instrument Developed in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed the world's first head-rotating gamma-ray stereotaxic
instrument and it will be China's first large advanced medical
instrument to be exported to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The XGD head-rotating instrument is jointly produced by
the Shenzhen Aowo International Science and Technology Development
Corporation and the Changzhou Machine Tool Factory.
</P>
<P>
An expert here said the newly developed instrument is superior
to the static ones in focusing gamma-ray on focus of infection
through skins and destroying the pathological tissue, as the
static ones sometimes may injure the healthy tissue.
</P>
<P>
The world's first static gamma-ray stereotaxic instrument was
invented by a Swedish scientist in 1968 and the instruments are
widely applied in "surgeries without wounds."
</P>
<P>
For instance, cerebral operations no longer need a craniotomy
and would not bleed with the help of gamma-ray instruments.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Changzhou factory has signed a 10-year agreement
with the Shenzhen company to produce the head-rotating gamma-ray
instrument in quantities.

<P>
WELLINGTON, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Air New Zealand has
announced it suspends indefinitely all its four weekly flights to
Seoul as the South Korean financial crisis has hit all sectors of
New Zealand's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The airlines said the South Korean market has "evaporated" in
the wake of the crisis, TVNZ reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It said the South Korean currency won has devaluated
drastically, and there are now few passengers flying out of South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The decision followed a report that the number of South Korean
tourists to New Zealand has fallen 90 percent following the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Board deputy chief executive Chris Ryan said he was
still optimistic about the long-term future of the South Korean
market, but it is going to take time to re-build.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 25 travel companies met in Auckland Wednesday to
discuss the serious situation they are now facing, as the number
of tourists from many other Asian countries is also down.
</P>
<P>
Some tour operators said if the situation continues, they will
have to sell their tourist buses to quit the business.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is the fasting growing market for New Zealand's
tourism industry in the past few years. Before the crisis, the
number of tourists from that country grew at over 40 percent
annually to top 110,000.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Expands Foreign Cooperation in Chain Store Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the largest port city
of north China, plans to expand cooperation with foreign
businesses in developing large-scale retail outlets and chain
stores.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Shuzu, director of the Tianjin Municipal
Commission for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the city
will take measures to encourage local foreign trade enterprises to
jointly invest in chain stores.
</P>
<P>
The city will also encourage cooperation with purchasing
departments of foreign chain stores in the supply of commodities.
</P>
<P>
The retail sector is a new sphere for opening-up in China. Up
to now, the sector in the five special economic zones and six
cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, has been allowed
to open to the overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Wang suggested that local developers can make use of the
existing office buildings, warehouses, workshops, land, equipment,
and human resources as the investment in the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Municipal Foreign Trade Corporation and the
Japanese retailing giant Daiei Corporation has jointly launched
chain supermarkets in the city, which generated sales of over 60
million yuan (7.23 million US dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Foreign Trade Foodstuff Corporation cooperated with
China Resources Co. registered in Hongkong in establishing 11
chain stores in the city.
</P>
<P>
Local foreign trade companies are also cooperating with Daiei
in constructing large-scale food processing centers.
</P>
<P>
The city has also introduced advanced international management
modes such as those of the HOME and DEPOT of US to run local chain
supermarkets.

<P>
SHANGHAI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The non-staple food market in
Shanghai, China's largest commercial center, has remained stable,
after the city lifted the control of prices for eggs and meat on
the market last July.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has also cancelled all the subsidies granted to the
production and trade of meat and eggs in a bid to push
producers and traders into the market.
</P>
<P>
Retail prices for fresh pork and eggs had been remained 15
yuan (1.8 U.S. dollars) and 5.98 yuan (0.7 U.S. dollars) per kg
during the January-October period. Even when No.11 typhoon stroke
the city in November, the prices had not fluctuated by a large
margin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as a result of a fiercer market competition, more
varieties of fresher meat and egg products are presented on stalls
to diversify people's dining table.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has a total of 722 breeding farms in the suburbs,
which supply 30 to 50 percent of the city's meat and eggs. It will
invest in large production bases outside the city.

<HEADLINE> Saved Crane Finds New Home in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A red-crowned crane, rescued
from a butcher's knife by a resident in Hebei Province, has been
given a new home, safe and comfortable, at the Tianjin Zoo.
</P>
<P>
Chen Baobin, a member of the Huanghua City Committee of Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference of Hebei Province,
happened to find the rare animal on sale at a free market for
butcher's meat and poultry early last month, said today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Seeing that the "big bird" was quite different from other local
poultry, Chen suspected it might be a rare animal under State
protection.
</P>
<P>
He bought the "big bird" at a cost of 500 yuan (US 60.2
dollars) and took it home.
</P>
<P>
The bird has a big appetite -- it eats more than three
kilograms of live fish each day. Chen fed the bird at his own cost.
</P>
<P>
After ten days of talking via telephone with various
authorities, he finally got in touch with Tianjin Zoo.
</P>
<P>
The zoo immediately sent an expert to Chen's home to help
assess the value of the bird.
</P>
<P>
According to the expert, Lu Baoquan, the bird is a re-crowned
crane, a rare animal under first-class State protection.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Boosting Biological pharmaceutical Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Municipality has
decided to promote its modern biological pharmaceutical industry
in the coming three years.
</P>
<P>
The local government recently listed modern biological
pharmaceutical industry as one of the three high-technology
industries, which will be developed in an accelerated way.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, the output value of the
industry reached 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars),
increasing 12 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The city is planning to raise the sale value of the industry to
37 billion yuan (4.5 billion US dollars) in 2000 from 12.7 billion
yuan (1.5 billion US dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
To this objective, the city will enhance the development of 86
pharmaceutical products of the industry which take up about 30
percent on China's domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shanghai Municipality will invest more than one
billion yuan into the industry to study and manufacture new
products whose profit rate will exceed 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's modern biological pharmaceutical industry will
continue to seek cooperation with overseas counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, there are about 50 joint ventures in the industry
with 20 of them involving an investment of 10 million U.S. dollars
each.

international sports stories of 1997 selected by the Sports News
Service of the Xinhua News Agency:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 1997: Bumper Harvest for Chinese Badminton (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Manifested by the successes
at the key events, the year of 1997 saw a renaissance of China in
the sport of badminton.
</P>
<P>
After hitting nadir in the past years, the Chinese shuttlers
staged a dramatic comeback masterminded by headcoach Li Yongbo.
</P>
<P>
Just as the former world champion put it, "It is the overall
strength and supriority of our players that bring us many
victories."
</P>
<P>
The strength is formidable and the supriority obvious.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese started by pocketing four of the five golds at
stake in March's All England Open and celebrated a bountiful Year
of Ox by repeating the feat at the year-ending World Grand Prix
Finals in Jakarta in December, with only the men's doubles
eluding them in both.
</P>
<P>
They made a big bag of trophies at the World Championships in
Scotland in May, where the mixed team Sudirman Cup is retained in
the Chinese hands and three individual crowns were captured.
</P>
<P>
Had Sun Jun not been forced to withdraw by injuries in the
final, he might have taken the fourth in the men's singles, where
the Danish doctor Peter Rasmussen triumphed eventually.
</P>
<P>
Sun, however, was consoled by winning his first ever world
title at the World Cup and routing his fellow countryman and All
England champion Dong Jiong in the Grand Prix finals.
</P>
<P>
Former world number one Dong hit jinx this year. He saw his
form scratching bottom after a high fever forced him to retire
from the third round at the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Dong even failed to grab a finals berth at the National Games
last October and was stopped by Indonesia's Alan Budi Kusuma in
the third round of the U.S. Open in September.
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, who won his only other international title in
January in Japan, produced far less impressive performances after
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
He was dumped in the second round of the Danish Open, bowed
out of the third round in the U.S. Open and was eliminated in the
group competition in the World Grand Prix finals.
</P>
<P>
Although the Chinese men took almost all the larger events,
another Dane Peter-Gade Christensen soared to the top slot on the
world rankings with victories in Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He was also the finalist at the Malaysian Open and the
U.S. Open, and the semi-finalist at Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
An awesome squad of Chinese women's singles players, led by
world number two Ye Zhaoying and teenager Gong Zhichao, flexed
their muscles as the Indonesians waned.
</P>
<P>
Their power was highlighted at the World Championships with
unprecedented all-Chinese semi-finals after Gong forced
Indonesian legend Susi Susanti to sign off what could be her last
championships in a losing note.
</P>
<P>
Ye almost took a clean sweep of all the major events this
year, beating Gong to win the All England Open and the World
Championships and Susanti for Grand Prix overall title.
</P>
<P>
Susanti added just another World Cup to her trophy room by
defeating Gong and Ye on her way to the top of the podium.
</P>
<P>
Mia Audina, hailed as her heir-apparent, managed to win her
only title at the Konica Open in Singapore, predicting a much
weakened Indonesia camp after the imminent retirement of Susanti.
</P>
<P>
Possibly the best all-round doubles player ever in the world,
the reticent 21-year-old Ge Fei is the key to half of the Chinese
triumph.
</P>
<P>
She teamed up with Gu Jun to set the standard for any shuttler
when they completed an enviable "Grand Slam" of the Olympic,
World Championships, All England, World Grand Prix Finals and the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
After the retirement of Gil Young Ah, half of South Korea's
former world champion pair, the level of Ge and Gu is so beyond
the reach of any other pairs that they won every event entered.
</P>
<P>
Ge's mixed doubles partnership with Liu Yong, which began in
November 1996, also produced stunning fruit of victories.
</P>
<P>
The men's doubles is still the Indonesian territory. Claiming
two star duos of Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky, and Candra
Wijaya and Budiarto Sigit, the Indonesians won almost all the
major trophies.
</P>
<P>
Wijaya and Sigit triumphed at World Grand Prix Finals and the
World Championships while Subagja and Mainaky took the World Cup,
which was the last edition.
</P>
<P>
But they have to watch out for the rising South Korean pair
Lee Dong Soo and Yoo Yong Sung, runners-up to either Indonesian
duo in many events.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesians pulled their biggest haul at home, where they
had a clean sweep of the titles with the Chinese absent in the
Indonesian Open.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese squad, which originally planned to compete in the
event, evoked controversy by pulling out en mass citing the late
issuing of some players' visas as the main reason.
</P>
<P>
In a move to better promote the world's fastest racket sport,
the International Badminton Confederation (IBF) decided in May to
scrap the World Cup and replace it with so-called "spectaculars".
</P>
<P>
Their focus will on areas out of Asia and the Nordic nations,
such as the American continents and the Oceania.
</P>
<P>
The IBF also disclosed in December that a "SuperSeries"
tournaments, which include the upgraded key Grand Prix events, is
to kick off in 1999 to provide a "distinctive presentational
approach".

<HEADLINE> Computer Making Northeastern Chinese City's Traffic More Orderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Drivers roll on the main
streets of Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning Province may now
encounter fewer red lights if they keep their speed above 30 kmph.
</P>
<P>
The city's traffic lights at 110 intersections are now
controlled by a traffic computer system that has proven effective
in regulating traffic flow on major thoroughfares. It has saved at
least 50 million yuan (six million U.S. dollars) in fewer traffic
jams, accidents, and energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
Dalian is northeastern China's largest port and is known as one
of the country's fastest growing economies. It has a population of
2.6 million, and 240,000 automobiles and is growing at 20 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
However, because of the city government's placing importance on
urban planning and traffic controls, traffic snarls haven't been
the problem they have in most large cities.
</P>
<P>
The city's 31 one-way streets have an average speed-limit of 40
kmph and most two-way streets have speeds above 30 kmph, as
opposed to 15 kmph in other large cities.
</P>
<P>
The 44 million-yuan computer system has 10 sub-systems, and
uses state-of-the-art technology from Britain and Canada.
</P>
<P>
On a 40-sq.m. lighted signal board in the Public Security
Bureau's traffic control center, traffic police can monitor
traffic conditions on an approximately 100-sq.km. urban area
provided by sixty video monitors installed on major
thoroughfares.

WASHINGTON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government said
today that adult smokers represented nearly 25 percent of their
same age group in the United States in 1995 and it would be hard
to meet its goal of 15 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) said 24.7 percent of the nation's adults, or 47 million
people, were smokers in 1995, down only slightly from 24.8 percent
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Among the smokers, 24.5 million were men and 22.4 million were
women. Those who had not graduated from high school and those
living below the poverty level were the heaviest smokers, CDC
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency said 70 percent of the smokers promised to
give up the habit.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Firms Agree to Pay Investors Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Thirty of Wall Street's
biggest firms agreed to pay investors 910 million U.S. dollars to
settle a lawsuit alleging that they overcharged clients in the
Nasdaq Stock Market, lawyers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal is the largest civil antitrust settlement in history,
according to the lawyers involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
The settlement follows government action to discipline the big
trading firms for keeping stock prices artificially high, a
practice that investigators said increased company profits and
raised costs for investors.
</P>
<P>
Investors said that between 1989 and 1994 the company's
securities dealers purposely kept the gap between prices for
buying and selling a stock artificially wide. That made trades
more expensive for investors.
</P>
<P>
The biggest names in securities trading -- J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Smith Barney Inc. and
PaineWebber Inc., among others -- will share in the cost of paying
several million investors, who include major market players and
huge mutual fund companies.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for investors had reached six earlier settlements
totaling 100 million U.S. dollars, bringing to 1 billion U.S.
dollars the amount of cash that will be distributed to investors
who overpaid for trades as a result of the dealers' pricing
practices.
</P>
<P>
The agreements must be approved by U.S. District Judge Robert
Sweet in Washington. A hearing has been set for December 29.
</P>
<P>
The settlement comes 18 months after the Justice Department
settled its own antitrust suit against 24 companies. The
department said that Nasdaq dealers engaged in a widespread
practice of quoting stock prices by rounding off prices to the
nearest quarter of a dollar.
</P>
<P>
The settlement didn't involve any criminal charges or fines.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Government Spends 1.38 Billion US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEWA)said today that it spent more than 1.38
billion U.S. dollars this year to aid communities hit by violent
storms, tornadoes and floods.
</P>
<P>
FEMA Director James Lee Witt said in a statement that the Red
River Valley floods that hit Minnesota and the Dakotas in early
April, severe winter storms that hit western states in January and
flooding in the Ohio River Valley in March were the most costly
disasters on which the agency spent more than one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The agency said, disasters were declared in 27 states and three
western Pacific island territories in 1997. It provided housing
assistance worth 319.4 million dollars to 127,064 disaster victims,
100 million dollars in grants for transportation, medical and
other needs for nearly 50,000 victims.
</P>
<P>
Minnesota and Washington state led the nation in need for
disaster assistance in the year, and U.S. President Bill Clinton
declared four disasters in each state in response to severe winter
storms and Spring and Summer floods.
</P>
<P>
The president declared more than one disaster in other six
states, three for South Dakota and two each for Arkansas, Idaho,
Illinois, North Dakota and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
The agency said it spent 1.7 billion dollars on disasters aid
in 1996.

NEW YORK, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street edged

July.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped out to a 48-point gain

<HEADLINE> Israel to Decide Second Redeployment Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today announced that if there is no terror
attacks against Israel during the period, his government can
decide on the further redeployment in the West Bank next month.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee of
the Knesset (parliament) that the government was now on the
process of working out the country's vital security interests
over the second pullback from the West bank and the decision
could be taken in January, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
But he added that a five-month waiting period would be
required before implementation of the decision in order to test
if the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) can fulfill its
commitment to fighting terrorism effectively.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the announcement after he and most of his
cabinet ministers Tuesday made a helicopter tour of the West Bank
areas that may be included in the next pullback in an effort to
consolidate a position on the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
And if the decision is taken on schedule, Netanyahu will
be able to show U.S. President Bill Clinton the precise scope
of the next withdrawal when they meet in Washington in
January.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also stressed that so far he has not given any
U.S. representatives the percentage about the pending pullback in
the West Bank. He contended that it was impossible because only
the cabinet could make such a decision.
</P>
<P>
However, opposition Labor leader Ehud Barak charged today that
Netanyahu bowed to U.S. pressures and made a secret deal with
Washington and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the deal, Netanyahu agreed to
give 10.5 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in
the second withdrawal, while the U.S. agreed that the Likud
government delayed its decision on the redeployment until
January.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today expressed
welcome to a United Nations resolution to extend the mandate of
the U.N. Peace Keeping Force in Cyprus to June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said the U.N. Security Council has considered European
Union's decision to start accession talks with Cyprus next March
as an important development in the efforts to solve the protracted
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that the resolution has mentioned the agreement on
missing people in Cyprus reached by Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash last July, which
he said is the first time that a relevant resolution touches
humanitarian issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council resolution adopted Tuesday stressed
the U.N. support for the efforts made by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to help solve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed support for Annan's decision to resume
negotiations between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots
next March aimed at ending the division of the island.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peace-keeping force in Cyprus was established in 1964
to help stop violence that erupted after the breakup of a
government represented by both the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 peacekeepers are patroling the 180-kilometer
dividing line across the country between the rival Greek Cypriots
and Turkish Cypriots. Their current mandate expires at the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an eastern Mediterranean island, has been divided since
1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern
third after a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been making efforts to help Cyprus reunite in a
formula of bizonal and bicommunal federation, but no tangible
results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Trade Gap Widens Owing to Strong Pound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- British exports are finally
showing signs of suffering from the strength of sterling.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit widened from 1.25 billion pounds (2 billion
US dollars) to 1.32 billion pounds (2.11 billion US dollars) in
October, the biggest monthly gap recorded for two years, according
to the latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
Analysts blamed the strength of the pound for the fall in
exports and surge in imports in October, saying the figures
provided fresh evidence that the strength of sterling was slowly
eating into exports.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-1996, sterling has appreciated by about 20 percent
against other currencies, making imports to the UK cheaper and
goods sold abroad more expensive.
</P>
<P>
Details provided by the Office for National Statistics (ONS)
reveal that export volumes are still rising but the increase of
0.6 percent recorded over the past three months has been swamped
by news of a 2.5 percent leap in the volume of goods imported over
the same period.
</P>
<P>
However, the ONS said the trend was for the deficit to worsen
in coming months. It said that provisional estimates of trade
volumes outside the European Union showed exports down by 3
percent in November, and import volumes continuing to reach record
levels.

TEHRAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami today reiterated Iran's readiness to develop relations
with other states based on mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with outgoing Swedish ambassador to Tehran Hans
Anderson, Khatami said that "the Islamic Republic of Iran is
determined to have constructive relations with all states which
honor the principles of mutual respect."
</P>
<P>
He expressed pleasure with the growing trend of understanding
between Iran and the countries in the Gulf region, Iran's official
news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Since Khatami assumed office in August, Iran has taken a series
of initiatives to improve ties with its Gulf Arab neighbors and
members of the European Union. The efforts have gained positive
response.
</P>
<P>
Khatami contended that clashes, wars and inequality of this
century have emanated from misunderstandings between nations,
stressing the necessity to step up efforts on the threshold of a
new century to end misunderstandings through dialogues.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president hailed the smooth development of the ties
between Iran and Sweden in economic, technical and cultural areas.
</P>
<P>
He added a considerable number of Iranians are living in the
northern European state and that most of them are highly educated
and considered good assets for bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish envoy said that Sweden attaches special importance
to the relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Terming the bilateral ties as excellent, Anderson said that the
two sides should make more efforts to boost their political and
economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Army Still Cohesive Despite Coup Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian army still
remained a "cohesive" force despite the aborted coup plot
uncovered three days ago, a military spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Although some officers were arrested involving in the botched
coup plot, it did not indicate a division in the army, said Col.
Godwin Ugbo, acting director of defense information.
</P>
<P>
On the charge by the chief of army staff, Major-General
Ishaiya Bamaiyi to officers and men during the just-concluded
army conference in Enugu state, southeast Nigeria, on the need
for cohesion, Ugbo said the general only gave a fatherly advice
and not an indication of a division.
</P>
<P>
The defense spokesman also dismissed rumours that a key
officer in the presidency, Major Ali Mustapha, was killed in the
plot.
</P>
<P>
"Such a thing never happened. The officer is still alive," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As for any incident of more arrests or even the alleged
shooting during Sunday's arrest operation, Ugbo said he was yet
to clarify, noting that civilians could find it difficult to
differentiate a gun shot from any other sound.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government announced on Sunday the uncovering of
a coup plot, involving the country's number two person Lt.-Gen
Oladipo Diya, and 11 others who were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Investigations were still continuing, said Ugbo, who appealed
to journalists to "report only what you know".

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Angola in southern Africa will
suffer a grain deficit of 541,000 tons in 1997, its Agricultural
Minister Carlos Fernandes said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said on the state radio that Angola expected a
grain production of 441,000 tons in 1997, but the actual output
is only 431,000 tons, while the demand stands at 972,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes attributed the poor production to political turmoils
following the country's many years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
According to the estimate of the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, Angola has a total arable
land of three million hectares, producing mainly yam, beans, corn
and sorghum.
</P>
<P>
Years of civil war, however, has turned the former grain
exporter country into a pure importer, with tens of thousands of

<HEADLINE> Over 50,000 Nigerians Die at Child Birth in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 24 (xinhua) -- More than 50,000 women have
died during child birth in Nigeria so far this year, with most of
deaths caused by the abandonment of them by their male
counterparts or family members.
</P>
<P>
The figure can be translated to 140 deaths daily or one death
every 10 minutes, the project directress of Mental Health
Rehabilitation Foundation, Bridget Juwah, said today in the
capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Other factors which facilitated the deaths were financial,
social and sometimes psychological, she said, quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to her, maternal death could be reduced through the
redressing of the social inequalities confronting women and
ensuring that couples have access to family planning facilities.
</P>
<P>
She called for maternity care, back-up and support facilities
at the referral level, as well as offer of financial and
emotional support for abandoned pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
The project director also urged both the public and private
sectors to assist her foundation to stop "this endemic problem
that poses a threat to mankind".

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rejects Cypriot Meeting Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today turned down a
Cypriot proposal for a foreign ministerial meeting between the two
countries on the solution of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular press briefing here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said that Turkey would not
accept such a suggestion, according to the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioanuis Kasoulides has reportedly
proposed a meeting with his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem to
exchange views over the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that such a meeting was aimed at exchanging views
instead of negotiating a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
"If he has this idea, his interlocutor should be the
foreign minister of the Turkish Cypriots," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when the Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus", which is only recognized by
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been a political, economic and military supporter
of the Turkish Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Third Dar es Salaam Trade Fair under Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Board of External
Trade (BET) of Tanzania plans to organize the third Dar es Salaam
Consumer Fair (DCF) during the third week of next January.
</P>
<P>
Director of Export Promotion Emmanuel Buliki said today that
his office has started looking for participants including those
who have taken part in the second DCF which ended on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 companies have taken part in the second DCF, compared
with 70 which participated in the first one in December last
year.
</P>
<P>
Buliki said decorations, garments, plastic household utensils,
bicycles, electric cookers, cooking oil and soap are most welcome
by customers.
</P>
<P>
Items available were mostly Chinese-made products, said one
Asian who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Sales volume of this year's fair is not known because many
businessmen didn't respond to the questionnaire distributed by
the BET. However, Buliki estimated that the figure exceeds last
year's 35.6 million Shillings (about 56,500 US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The week-long fair starting from last Wednesday has attracted
some 8,000 visitors, far less than last year's figure of 187,000.
</P>
<P>
Buliki said some of the participants have shown interest in
taking part in the next fair. "We'll also advertise the event to
attract other interested businessmen."
</P>
<P>
If things would go as planned, the forthcoming DCF will take
place from January 19 to 24, Buliki said.

<HEADLINE> State Duma Fails to Approve 1998 Budget in Second </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma, lower
house of Parliament, on Wednesday failed to approve in second
reading the federal budget bill for 1998, according to the
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
After three rounds of voting the document was short of just one
one vote to be passed. A total of 225 lawmakers voted for, while
226 voted against.
</P>
<P>
Numerous amendments were made to the draft in the course of
debate on the second reading. Speaker of the State Duma Gennady
Seleznyov said that the outcome was not politically motivated,
simply "a lot of amendments were turned down during the debate."
</P>
<P>
Acting chairman of the Budget Committee Alexander Zhukov said
the trilateral commission of the government and both houses of
parliament redistributed 27.9 billion redenominated rubles within
the budget, in particular by reducing subsidies to the social
insurance fund, appropriations for foreign activities and state
and local government administration costs.
</P>
<P>
Deputy chairman of the Duma's Communist Party faction Valentin
Kuptsov on Tuesday stated that the faction would vote against the
draft 1998 federal budget at the second-reading debate.
</P>
<P>
He said communists oppose the budget because it did nothing to
resolve the problem of disbursements to economic sectors. Besides,
regional members of the communist faction are dismayed by "problem
of a lack of protection of the social sphere and appropriation of
funds for science and education, and uncertainty with issues
related to the development budget".
</P>
<P>
The State Duma will vote again on Thursday. It is hard to
predict the results of the upcoming voting, Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 federal budget bill was approved in the first reading
by the State Duma on December 5.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Poll Shows Moi's Bigger Chance to Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The latest poll issued by a
non-governmental group here today said that Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi can get enough votes for his final five-year term
in Monday's general elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey of the Institute for Education in
Democracy (IED), although the number of his supporters appears to
be decreasing, Moi can still command a minimum 25 percent of the
vote in five of the country's eight provinces to assure his
victory.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted among 1,500 households across the
country, showed that Moi's popularity fell slightly from 40.8
percent in the first poll at the end of November to 40.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
"What it (the poll) tells you is that Moi is leading, but
there has been a change as a result of the two weeks of
campaigning," local sources quoted IED chief Grace Githu as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of Democratic Party's presidential candidate
Mwai Kibaki has risen from 13.7 percent to the 20.8 percent this

<HEADLINE> Turkey Concerned About Greece-PKK Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today voiced its
concern over Greece's links with Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said at a news
briefing that Turkey hopes the Greek government halts its support
for the PKK.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports today, a PKK member, Esref Kilic,
who has surrendered to the Turkish general consulate in Iranian
city of Urumiye, confessed that he has been trained in Greece.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reports, the Turkish spokesman said that "if
he was really trained in Greece, it would once more prove the
Greek support for the PKK."
</P>
<P>
He added that this incident will be considered with other
similar cases.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Greece of supporting the PKK, a charge
denied by Greece.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a war since 1984 against the Turkish
government for the establishment of an independent Kurdish state
in eastern and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Turkey and Greece have worsened due to
each other's expulsion of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has announced to expel a Greek diplomat on charges of
spying for the PKK this week, and Greece kicked out a Turkish
diplomat in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over limits of air space and
the Aegean Sea, territorial disputes over some islands in the
Aegean Sea, rights to sea-bed minerals and the Cyprus
problem.

<HEADLINE> China Supports Mideast Peace Process, Says FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said today that China is willing to propel,
together with other members of the international community, the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during his talks with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa at the Foreign Ministry premises after his
arrival here this morning.
</P>
<P>
"China supports the relevant United Nations resolutions and
fully agrees to the land-for-peace principle forged in the Madrid
peace conference (1991), and pointed up these view points to the
Israeli government on several occasions," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Peace shall be the sole option for the Middle East" and a
deadlock in the peace process "will not do any good to any party,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian briefed Moussa on his Mideast tour that has taken him to
Lebanon, Syria, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas, during
which he held profound discussions with various parties of the
region on means to promote the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"During the tour, I have a strong impression that the Mideast
peace process is blocked by artificial obstacles that must be
overcome," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said "the international community has the duty of working
with the various parties in the Mideast to realize a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
Moussa blamed the serious peace crisis in the Middle East on
the fact that the incumbent Israeli Likud government has "reversed
the policy and pledges of the former Israeli government," which
prompted deep concerns among countries in the Middle East and
world-wide.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the land-for-peace principle has been widely
accepted by the international community, Moussa said "the crux is
to restart the Palestinian-Israeli talks and make progress in the
regional cooperation and economic development."
</P>
<P>
He said that it is important for China in its capacity as a
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to play a role in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Qian spoke highly of the initiator's role of Egypt in the
Mideast peace process, saying China appreciates Cairo's active
efforts and special role in boosting the peace process and Arab
unity.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he discussed with Moussa bilateral relations, the
Mideast peace process and other issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
He said it is a good opportunity to exchange views with Moussa
on the Mideast peace at a time when the peace process is going
through a vital moment.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he was pleased to discuss with his Chinese
counterpart the issues of mutual interest, expressing conviction
that Qian's visit will give a new boost to the Sino-Egyptian ties.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also praised the Sino-Egyptian cooperation in the United
Nations Security Council on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister stressed that the Iraq-UN crisis
regarding U.N. arms inspection should be solved "through peaceful
means instead of the threat of force," referring to the
U.S. warning of war.
</P>
<P>
Qian, in his turn, said that China upholds the implementation
of the relevant U.N. resolutions on the Gulf problem and arms
inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"However, the inspection, which has been going on for a long
time, should not continue indefinitely," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian also expressed his support to the UN-Iraq oil-for-food
deal which he said will contribute to relieving the sufferings of
the Iraqi people. He voiced the hope that the seven-year-old
sanctions imposed on Iraq will be gradually removed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the last leg of Qian's Mideast tour that started on
December 19. He is scheduled to meet with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and Arab League
Secretary General Abdel Esmat Meguid Thursday.
