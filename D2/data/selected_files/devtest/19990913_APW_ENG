<HEADLINE> Old Farmer's Almanac Looks to Y2K / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The Old Farmer's Almanac is 208 years old,  
but it's up to date on advice for the next millennium, including 
how to perform the Heimlich maneuver on your choking cat and how to 
program your old VCR for Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, there are the old standbys: planting, fishing  
and tide tables, astrological calculations and weather predictions 
that caution Dec. 31 revelers in New York's Times Square to bring 
umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a folksy mix of fun and factual reading in the nation's  
oldest continuously published periodical, which hits the newsstands 
today. (It's not to be confused with a newer Farmer's Almanac 
published in Maine.) 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to think of it that 100 years from now people would  
read the 2000 edition and get a pretty good idea of what American 
culture was like at the turn of the century,'' editor Judson Hale 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For believers, the Almanac predicts generally favorable weather  
across the country for 2000. But there will be record heat and 
cold, drought, floods, tornadoes and a couple of major hurricanes. 
Summer will have below-average rain, while winter will have 
below-average snowfall in most regions of the country except New 
England, the Great Lakes, the Appalachians, the Rockies and the 
Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Millennium partygoers can look for light snow across much of New  
England and light rain from New York City to Washington and 
westward to St. Louis. The rest of the East can expect dry, 
relatively mild temperatures, and much of the West will be cold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Almanac boasts 80 percent accuracy, Hale said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who claims anything in terms of a percent (in weather)  
claims 80 percent,'' he said. ``You never hear 81 percent or 79 
percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he backs it up. There was little rain for the five months  
from April through August, and ``we predicted less precipitation 
than normal for four of them; that's 80 percent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the weather predictions probably get the most attention,  
this special millennium edition also features many important facts 
to keep a reader's attention throughout the 272 pages, including a 
few about the book itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 edition is the first since 1888 without a ``9'' in the  
title, and the 21st century is the fourth century the Almanac has 
existed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale points out that in the 1800 and 1801 editions, editor and  
founder Robert Thomas concentrated on such things as ridding one's 
property of barberry bushes and suggesting the safest place during 
a thunderstorm is ``within a few feet of your horse, which, being 
more elevated, will receive the shock in preference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas also listed the vacation dates for the four existing U.S.  
colleges -- Harvard, Dartmouth, Providence and Williamstown. 
</P>
<P>
	For this issue, the editors have compiled predictions for  
millennium trends in fashion (casual luxury for women, rural 
hardiness for men) and food (spicy, exotic). Celestial blue will be 
the color of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	For those putting together time capsules for the millennium, the  
book cautions ``Don't bury it!'' More than 80 percent of time 
capsules are lost underground, it says. 
</P>
<P>
	More advice:  
</P>
<P>
	-- For choking pets, ``lift a small pet, or reach over the back  
of a large one and raise the back legs so that the rear end is 
elevated over the head. Place the hands around the lowest part of 
the chest and give a quick, gentle thrust inward and upward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Don't throw out that old VCR that can't be programmed due to  
the Y2K problem. Simply set the machine back to 1972 when the days 
of the week had the same dates as in 2000.

	Hurricane Floyd continued to push toward Florida on Monday,  
prompting evacuation orders for coastal residents. Meanwhile 
showers dampened much of the East, while the West was clear and 
dry. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was expected to hit Florida within the next few days.  
Swells from the storm began to affect the state's east coast during 
the afternoon. Hurricane watches extended up to the Georgia coast. 
</P>
<P>
	A cold front continued to push into eastern parts of the  
country. This front is produced scattered showers from far western 
New York state south through eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, 
into Kentucky and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Fair and pleasantly cool weather was seen over much of the Great  
Lakes, northern Mississippi Valley and Plains as high pressure 
dominates the region. 
</P>
<P>
	A stationary front stretched from New Mexico north and west into  
southern Idaho brought a few clouds to these areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder of the western United States was clear and dry.  
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures across the Lower 48 ranged from a low of 18 in  
Sanford, Maine, to an early-afternoon high of 95 in Gila Bend, 
Ariz. With the heat index, it felt like 100 in Key West, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Yen Increase Spurs Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese finance officials expressed concern  
Tuesday as the yen rose in early trading to its highest level 
against the dollar in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency, buoyed by hopes that Japan's economy is finally  
turning around, briefly hit 106 yen to the dollar in early trading 
Tuesday. That was the highest level for the yen since May 15, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the strength of the yen was due to comments Monday in  
Auckland, New Zealand by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who said in a 
speech that the currency's strength was a reflection of improving 
sentiment toward Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic Planning Agency Chief Taichi Sakaiya tried to clarify  
that Tuesday, telling reporters that the prime minister ``won't 
accept a stronger yen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice Finance Minister Nobuaki Usui was even more emphatic,  
telling reporters Tuesday morning that the ``sudden yen 
strengthening is undesirable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Usui added that the ministry is ``watching markets cautiously  
and will take appropriate steps as needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, the Bank of Japan stepped into currency markets to  
halt the yen's appreciation by buying dollars, but that appears to 
have had little effect on the longer-term upward trend. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials are concerned that a strong yen makes  
Japanese exports more expensive abroad and thus less competitive, 
reducing earnings of export-oriented Japanese exporters.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Comeback Spurs Cliches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Other than preferring a baseball cap to a  
fedora, Chan Gailey's sideline demeanor is pretty similar to the 
stone-faced stoicism of Tom Landry. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the Dallas Cowboys erased a 21-point deficit to beat the  
Washington Redskins 41-35 in overtime Sunday, Gailey turned Jimmy 
Johnson-like -- whooping, hollering, backslapping and even jumping 
with joy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey was still riding that emotional wave Monday as he  
discussed how the season-opening victory, and the way it happened, 
will help the team over the next 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk about don't quit, you can come back, if they can score  
20 in the third quarter you can score 21 in the fourth quarter, but 
until you do it and see it and feel it and it happens, you're not 
sure,'' Gailey said. ``Now, they realize they can. I'm not sure you 
can put a value on that. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the rest of the rest of the year, we can say, `We're not  
out of it.' We have proof. It gives you that extra sense of 
confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys coaches had to pull out all their comeback cliches after  
Dallas gave up 32 straight points, turning a 14-3 lead into a 35-14 
deficit going into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the stuff coaches preach can happen but hardly ever  
does: a 70-yard touchdown drive, a recovered onside kick, a 66-yard 
touchdown march, a 90-yard touchdown drive without any timeouts 
that was helped by four defensive penalties, the game-tying extra 
point ricocheting in off the left upright, a botched field goal by 
Washington and, finally, a 76-yard bomb from Troy Aikman to a 
wide-open Raghib Ismail for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The touchdown triggered a wild celebration that didn't include  
Gailey. Amazed by what he had seen, Gailey stood bent at the waist, 
clutching his knees until he regained his composure. 
</P>
<P>
	He maintained it until halfway through his news conference  
Monday, when he was explaining what the comeback showed him about 
his players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned I'm excited about going to war with the guys we've  
got on our football team. I'm excited about that. I want to say a 
lot more,'' he said, pausing, ``But I'm not going to say it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman's performance in the fourth quarter and overtime  
stiff-armed two of the biggest knocks against him: that he can't 
throw the long ball and he can't rally the Cowboys the way Roger 
Staubach did. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those critics were in the Dallas huddle. Teammates  
believed in Aikman the way the Denver Broncos knew John Elway would 
carry them. He responded by erasing a bigger deficit than Staubach 
ever did, matching Danny White's team-record recovery in 1984 
against New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a sense of panic,'' Gailey said. ``He knew  
what we were able to do and what we were trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the final play, the Redskins expected the Cowboys to run on  
third-and-2 from their 24. Gailey gambled with a bit of reverse 
psychology. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to make some of those calls sometimes,'' he said.  
``I thought our defense was starting to get back into it and we 
could still win even if we didn't make it there. I felt the reward 
was worth the risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ismail's catch was the longest of his career and the longest  
touchdown Aikman had thrown in the regular season since an 
80-yarder against Washington in the 1993 opener. It gave Aikman his 
first five-TD game since high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this says a lot for the organization, it says a lot  
for the coaches and players to have guys that keep battling and 
keep playing,'' Aikman said. ``You don't want to get 21 points down 
every week, but I think the way we were able to come back says a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey rewarded the team by giving them Monday off in addition  
to their usual Tuesday break. The Cowboys have an extra day anyway 
because their next game is Monday night at home against Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Offering Y2K Warnings Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department is preparing  
country-by-country advisories to warn Americans living or traveling 
overseas about possible failures related to the Year 2000 
technology problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The warnings, to be released Tuesday, will include details about  
194 nations where visiting Americans could be affected by power 
outages, water shortages and other potentially serious problems 
caused by the Y2K computer glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports, which were compiled by embassies worldwide,  
promised to be the best road map yet for identifying global trouble 
spots. Experts have long complained about the difficulties 
collecting adequate information from foreign governments about 
possible computer failures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the information we're getting is self-reported,'' said  
Robert Bennett, chairman of the Senate's Year 2000 Committee. ``If 
it turns out these self-reported statements are accurate, the folks 
won't feel much in the way of Y2K.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The warnings also were expected to suggest how and where  
failures overseas may affect U.S. interests in the interconnected 
global economy, where problems with the export of Venezuelan crude, 
for example, might affect the price of gasoline for motorists here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disruptions in this infrastructure and the relationships among  
suppliers and customers will negatively affect individuals, firms, 
industries, governments and national and regional economies around 
the world,'' the agency's inspector general, Jacquelyn 
Williams-Bridgers, told a Senate committee weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department previously has criticized Y2K efforts in  
Russia and former Eastern bloc countries, citing a ``relatively 
high probability of ... failures.'' It also has predicted problems 
with power grids in India and Poland, railroads in China and 
telephones and water supplies in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The task of publicly identifying countries where systems might  
fail was clearly a sensitive one for the agency, which called the 
warnings ``carefully compiled ... in an objective, non-comparative 
and non-alarmist way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bureau of Consular Affairs said comments about Y2K efforts  
will be added to each nation's updated consular information sheet -- 
available on the State Department's Internet site -- and said 
details will be updated periodically as countries improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first priority is to provide information to U.S. citizens  
to try to meet their needs,'' State Department spokesman Phil 
Reeker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the world's worst Year 2000 failures will occur  
overseas. They are predicting with increasing confidence there will 
be no national failures in the United States among key industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is a worry, Japan is a worry, Russia is a worry, Italy  
is a worry. ... But many of these countries now are moving more 
aggressively and catching up,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, 
D-Conn., vice chairman of the Senate Year 2000 Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gartner Group Inc., an analyst firm in Stamford, Conn., last  
month identified Russia as the highest risk for Y2K failures, 
followed by India and a cluster of countries that included 
Venezuela, Norway, Japan, Taiwan and Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Except for what might be a small handful of countries, things  
like air-traffic control, airlines and airports are doing pretty 
well,'' said Lou Marcoccio, a research director at Gartner. ``I 
don't think we're going to end up with a long list of countries 
that are extremely dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this summer, Cargill Inc., a worldwide grain shipper,  
told South Africa it plans to avoid trading in the country between 
mid-December and mid-January because of inadequate Y2K 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be running around Africa a lot, myself,'' said  
William Garrison, director of international communications studies 
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 
Washington. ``They tend to be as a group of countries unprepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Foreign Office also planned to publish a  
country-by-country advisory Tuesday to warn British citizens about 
nations most at risk from the Year 2000 technology problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The British list will initially cover 50 countries, with more to  
be added in the next few weeks, the government said. When complete, 
there will be information about 125 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries named as potential problem sites were China,  
Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia and Portugal. The Foreign Office 
reserved its strongest warning for Ukraine, advising against all 
holiday and nonessential travel between the New Year period and 
early January.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Cop Suing George Michael </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Beverly Hills police officer who arrested  
George Michael is suing the singer for $10 million, alleging he's 
been slandered. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Hills police officer Marcelo Rodriguez arrested Michael  
in April 1998 for allegedly committing a lewd act in a public park 
restroom. Michael later pleaded no contest to the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	In a suit filed Monday, Rodriguez claims he's since been mocked  
in one of Michael's music videos, and said the singer has claimed 
in interviews that he was the victim of entrapment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez is ``a very well-respected police officer who has had  
some very vicious things said about him,'' said his attorney, 
Richard F.G. Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Michael) has said (things) in numerous interviews in  
magazines, on television, on the Internet and all over. George 
Michael has profited greatly out of what has happened at my 
client's expense,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left for Michael's agent and manager were not  
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Hills Police Department spokesman Lt. Ed Kreins said  
Monday that the department could not comment on civil litigation 
filed by a member of the department who has filed suit as a private 
citizen.

<HEADLINE> Mistrial in Exxon Dealer Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A judge declared a mistrial Monday in a suit filed  
against Exxon Corp. by 10,000 dealers who say they were cheated out 
of gasoline refunds in a phony discount-for-cash program. 
</P>
<P>
	In a note to Judge Alan S. Gold, the jury said their  
deliberations had reached an impasse. The case went to the jury 
Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene Stearns, attorney for the dealers, said he was  
disappointed but not surprised by the outcome because the jury told 
the judge on Friday they were having trouble making an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Stewart, attorney for Exxon, said motions are pending, and  
all parties in the case agreed to get back together when the 
weather improved. The Miami-Dade Federal Courthouse was shut down 
Monday afternoon in preparation for Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt we had proven that Exxon had treated the dealers  
fairly. We had done what we said we would do, and that the dealers 
had been very successful as a result,'' Stewart said. ``... They 
did not put on the stand a single dealer that claimed they had 
suffered any losses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Station owners in 35 states were promised refunds on cash sales  
but charged the 1.7-cent-per-gallon price cut never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
	The program was in effect when discount independents were  
expanding in the retail gas market, and most of Exxon's 
dealer-owned stations closed before the program was discontinued in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Stearns charged in closing arguments that the biggest U.S. oil  
company executed a ``secret plan'' to squeeze dealers in violation 
of their pricing agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart told jurors that the conspiracy described by Stearns was  
simply intended to prejudice them against the oil giant, which is 
pursuing an $84 billion merger with Mobil Corp. to become the 
world's sixth-largest oil producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers couldn't tell whether they were getting refunds on their  
Exxon invoices but suspected they were being cheated for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The class-action suit was filed in 1991 shortly after Exxon  
marketing vice president James Carter told dealers at a meeting in 
Houston that the discount program had never been honored by the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The refunds were intended to offset a 3 percent fee on  
credit-card purchases and allowed dealers to lower gas prices by 4 
cents a gallon on cash sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Gold rejected a request for punitive damages in July,  
limiting an award to compensatory damages only.

<HEADLINE> Economic Upturn Renews France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- As unemployment drops and mergers streamline the  
corporate sector, the French economy slowly is showing signs of 
waking from a decade-long slumber. 
</P>
<P>
	In short, it's not just business as usual for the French.  
</P>
<P>
	Mergers in fields from banking to retail have infused  
once-stagnant French corporations with a jolt of excitement, 
attracting renewed attention from investors abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment continues to drop, down to 11.2 percent in July  
from a post-war high of 12.6 percent in 1997. And the finance 
ministry has predicted that the economy will grow 2.2 to 2.5 
percent in 1999; and in 2000, as much as 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past two years, French businesses have displayed new  
willingness to trade in many of the old rules for the hardball 
rules of the new global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, the heated battle that followed Banque Nationale de  
Paris's hostile bid for rival bank Societe Generale prompted the 
influential Le Monde daily to declare that ``a profound 
transformation in French capitalism'' had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of hostile takeover bids has surprised those who never  
thought French corporations would use the American-style tactics 
they once deplored, said Paul Horne, a London-based equity market 
economist with Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the French, if they had their choice, would have  
caved in, but the competitive pressures are building up very 
swiftly in the euro areas,'' Horne said. ``As a result, French 
private sector companies are having to focus on profit more than 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the BNP hostile takeover bid for rival bank Societe  
Generale ended with government regulators turning down the bid, BNP 
still ended up with Paribas, an investment bank that was in 
friendly talks with Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, French supermarket group Carrefour acquired rival  
Promodes, creating the world's second-largest retailer and a 
European counterpart to the Wal-Mart stores in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the most recent mega-merger, French oil giant Total Fina  
on Monday won a 2-month-long takeover bid to acquire rival Elf 
Aquitaine, sweetening its offer to $54.2 billion. The deal would 
create the world's fourth-largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists, including Horne, say the next step will be a  
boom of foreign marriages within the euro zone. But everything 
depends upon on whether the French state will give its OK. 
</P>
<P>
	The French government, once profoundly interventionist, has  
shown some tentative signs of loosening its stronghold on 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	And France's Socialist government is not as Socialist as it used  
to be, said Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French 
Institute for International Relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just being realistic,'' Moisi said. ``Instead of  
fighting the market, they want to humanize the market, and 
therefore they tend to be less protectionist in their behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's government is pushing ahead with  
plans to privatize the aviation and telecommunications industries. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Jospin's coalition has often sided with big business  
out of caution, it also has implemented a 35-hour work week, a plan 
designed to create more jobs -- even though the project has 
frustrated many corporations. Some top executives argue that the 
measure will cost them because extra people will have to be hired. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, business is at its highest point in years, with investors  
registering their enthusiasm through the Paris stock market, the 
Bourse. The CAC 40, the French stock market index, is up about 50 
percent since the beginning of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The reassuring indicators have led French politicians and the  
media to proclaim renewed optimism for the first time in many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsstands throughout Paris are papered with the cover of  
September's Challenges magazine, which declares simply, ``The 
crisis is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the 90s, ``the crisis'' became a catch-all term to  
refer to the issues that left France mired in doubts about its 
national identity, issues like high unemployment, a faltering 
economy and urban violence. 
</P>
<P>
	A period of layoffs in the mid-80s, central to the feeling of  
despair in the 90s, streamlined the economy and cleared the way for 
France's present rebounding, Philippe Brossard, head of research at 
ABN Amro France, said. 
</P>
<P>
	But talk of an economic boom may be overconfident, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The problems have not disappeared yet,'' Brossard said.  
</P>
<P>
	France's unemployment rate in July was still higher than the  
euro zone average, 10.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	And there is some concern that the wave of mergers could lead to  
job cuts and more unemployed people. 
</P>
<P>
	Though consumer spending grew 3.5 percent in 1998, underscoring  
a growing consumer confidence, spending has grown only an 
``unexciting'' 2 percent in the first half of 1999, Brossard said. 
</P>
<P>
	And much of France, still a stronghold of tradition and  
government regulation, continues to mobilize against big business 
and globalization. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, French farmers have dumped tons of fruits and  
vegetables onto public squares and politicians' doorsteps, hoping 
that the government will listen to their fears about dropping 
produce prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers' concern: Chain grocery stores and retail mergers  
threaten their business and their way of life.

<HEADLINE> Portrait of Candidate John McCain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The son and grandson of Navy admirals, John  
Sydney McCain was destined for a military career. His calling in 
politics seemed less obvious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think my grandfather or my father ever voted,'' McCain  
said of his namesakes. ``They were both very apolitical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both men believed that ``democracies were ruined by military  
officers getting into politics,'' said McCain's brother, Joe 
McCain. That left the two boys, who also have a sister, to feed 
their interest from the family's political junkie, their mother, a 
true-blue Republican who ``watches and reads more news than John 
and I put together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He and I and mother used to spend I-don't-know how many hours  
at the dinner table arguing about politics and history,'' said Joe 
McCain, a freelance writer. They dissected legislation. Sometimes, 
they spoke of ``what mistakes historians made'' or about the 
current economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all basically on the same side of the fence,'' the  
younger McCain said, ``but it was like Talmudic scholars arguing 
about a single word or an adjective in the Testament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now with young children of his own, John McCain is the one  
trying to distance politics from his family. But as a presidential 
candidate struggling to surface from a deep pool of Republican 
hopefuls, the task has become increasingly difficult. His wife, the 
millionaire daughter of an Arizona beer baron, had avoided the 
Washington social scene but now frequents the campaign trail with 
her husband. Eventually joining them will be their four children, 
plucked from their ranch-style Phoenix home where they have known 
very little of the nomadic lifestyle McCain experienced as a Navy 
brat. 
</P>
<P>
	The paradox is among many for this 63-year-old Arizona senator,  
a father and husband who has kept his personal life private and yet 
has centered his campaign around his outspoken personality. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubbed a maverick for his habit of butting heads with fellow  
Republicans, McCain has enjoyed a high profile existence in 
Washington as the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. 
Outside the Beltway, however, he has to introduce himself to 
Americans more familiar with names like Bush and Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spent more than 20 years in the Navy, a quarter of it in  
a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp. On Oct. 26, 1967, his jet was 
shot down over Hanoi during a bombing mission. He broke both arms 
and shattered a shoulder and a knee while ejecting from the 
aircraft and, when he landed, was pulled from a lake by a North 
Vietnamese mob who stabbed him with bayonets. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain was beaten repeatedly for the next 5 1/2 years. When his  
captors learned he was the son of a prominent Navy admiral, they 
offered to release him early. McCain refused to go along with what 
he saw as a propaganda ploy, and he insisted that soldiers captured 
before him leave first. 
</P>
<P>
	The war story is a central theme in his campaign, one featured  
prominently in ads and videotapes. But McCain insists he gets 
``bored stiff'' talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the day he returned, McCain said, ``people wanted to paint  
myself as a person who performed heroic acts, which I know not to 
be true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, McCain mocked his war hero image at  
Washington's Gridiron Club dinner, taking to the stage in a jacket 
crammed with phony ribbons and medals. The event was a chance to 
show that Vietnam does not cast on shadow on all his thoughts or 
actions, and is far from the defining moment in his life, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, it's part of my legend but it is not necessarily a  
compelling argument for me to be president,'' McCain. ``In fact, 
all it does is warrant a consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the defining factor will be when voters decide whether  
he has the vision and the principles to lead the country into the 
next century. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's vision revolves around one word: reform. Reforming the  
government, Social Security, the education system, the tax code, 
the military and, of course, the way political campaigns are 
financed. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his voting record shows him consistent with his GOP  
colleagues, McCain has a reputation for bucking the party line, 
particularly on issues like campaign finance reform and 
anti-tobacco legislation. While a freshman House member, McCain 
stood up to a political hero, Ronald Reagan, and voted against 
sending Marines to Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm fought bitterly with the Arizona senator over  
tobacco tax and campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``John McCain has been willing to stand up and fight on issues  
that he truly believes in when there's been tremendous peer group 
pressure to shut up and get out of the way,'' said Gramm, whose 
brief 1996 presidential stint was led by McCain. ``I have seen him 
do it over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of McCain's independence emerged early. A cocky,  
rebellious cadet at the U.S. Naval Academy, McCain graduated in 
1958 fifth from the bottom -- a fact he now repeats almost 
boastfully. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain felt tremendous pressure to live up to the expectations  
set by his father and grandfather throughout his Navy career. ``The 
way they shaped me was through their standards of honorable 
conduct, their devotion to country, to the Navy and to their 
profession,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain experienced the most trying time of his life when his own  
honor was questioned during the so-called Keating Five scandal. In 
1991, he and four other senators were hauled before the Senate 
Ethics Committee to answer allegations they improperly intervened 
with federal banking regulators on the behalf of Charles Keating, a 
savings and loan financier who later was convicted of securities 
fraud. McCain was friends with Keating, who occasionally loaned his 
Caribbean vacation home to the senator. 
</P>
<P>
	``That year with Keating Five was harder for him than Vietnam,''  
said Gramm, a family friend who has known McCain since their days 
in the House. ``Nobody questioned his credibility in Vietnam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel eventually criticized McCain for ``showing poor  
judgment'' but did not recommend any action be taken against him. 
McCain later returned $112,000 in campaign loans he received from 
Keating, but he fears the episode ``will probably be on my 
tombstone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The instance could be joined by other dark spots.  
</P>
<P>
	McCain has admitted post-Vietnam ``indiscretions'' led to his  
divorce from his first wife, Carol, with whom he raised three 
children. His current wife, Cindy, admitted an addiction to 
painkillers during the early 1990's that led her to steal drugs 
from a medical charity she founded. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's his temper, which once was as well known as his  
independent streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not perfect, but he's not a phony so I think that's a  
plus.,'' Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, so do his constituents in Arizona. McCain was first  
elected to the House in 1982 after telling critics who labeled him 
a carpetbagger that his longest stay in any previous home was in 
Hanoi. Last year, he won a third term to the Senate, running 
unopposed in the GOP primary and handily defeating his Democratic 
opponent in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, McCain was a regular weekend fixture in Arizona,  
where his family has remained relatively unaffected by the 
political life. He said the main interest his younger children, 
ages 8 to 14, have shown in his presidential campaign has been in 
the advantages a win could bring them -- head-of-the-line privileges 
at Disneyworld. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've approached this to them and said, 'Look. The nomination  
process is going to be over by next March. I'm going to be gone a 
lot. I'll be working hard. But we're going to have fun,''' McCain 
said. ``I'm not afraid of losing. I'm going to do everything I can, 
but at the end of the day, if we win, it'll be great. If I lose, 
we'll have a wonderful life.''

<HEADLINE> Missy's Mirage Fetches $2 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Seven yearlings sold for more than $1  
million at the Keeneland September Yearling Sale on Monday, led by 
an unbridled colt out of Missy's Mirage that fetched $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt was the third-highest priced yearling in the history of  
the sale. It was purchased by trainer Bob Hess and his son, Bob 
Hess Jr., for owner David J. Shimmon of northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a Mr. Prospector colt out of Missy's Mirage fetched a  
September sale record $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the day, Keeneland sold 218 yearlings for $51.2 million. The  
average price was $234,986 and the median was $160,000. Last year's 
opening day average price was $173,390 and the median was $115,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Other top sellers Monday included:  
</P>
<P>
	-- a chestnut filly by Deputy Minister out of the Alydar mare  
Aishah, bought by trainer John C. Kimmel for $1.45 million, 
equalling the highest price ever paid for a filly at the sale; 
</P>
<P>
	-- a Storm Cat filly out of Sky Beauty, bought for $1.2 million  
by Dell Ridge Farm owner Frank Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	-- a pair of Deputy Minister colts bought by David M. Borislow of  
Philadelphia for a total of $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety-one yearlings did not meet the reserve price and were not  
sold. Last year, 101 horses failed to reach their reserve on the 
first day. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is scheduled to resume Tuesday and run through Sept.  
23.

<HEADLINE> Bond Market Follows Dollar Down / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices fell Monday, dragged down  
by the continued decline of the dollar, which hit a new three-year 
low against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32  
point, or $1.56 1/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 6.05 percent from Friday's 6.04 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was quiet as investors awaited economic news that should  
provide further clues on the course of inflation amid worries that 
the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates for a third time 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is scheduled to report Tuesday on August retail  
sales and will release figures Wednesday on the Consumer Price 
Index for August. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury prices fell in concert with the dollar, which dropped  
as low as 106.10 yen during trading, the lowest level against the 
Japanese currency since mid-May 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A falling dollar makes imports more expensive to American  
consumers, adding to inflation jitters. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, analysts said a heavy upcoming calender of bond  
offerings put pressure on the market, as demand for Treasury bonds 
will decrease when the higher-yielding new corporate issues are 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities were unchanged to up  
1/32 point, and intermediate maturities were unchanged to down 1/32 
point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.77 percent as the  
discount rose 0.04 percentage point from Friday to 4.65 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.12 percent, as the discount rose 0.04 
percentage point to 4.92 percent. One-year yields were 5.23 percent 
as the discount rose by 0.01 percentage point to 4.97 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.25 percent from 5.12 1/2 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 5/16 point to 113 5/8. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.82 percent from 5.81 percent.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Moves Into E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is moving to grab a share  
of the growing e-commerce market by embracing an effort to allow 
nearly all forms of personal electronic devices to communicate with 
each other and exchange data. 
</P>
<P>
	The software giant on Monday unveiled details of its Windows DNA  
2000 software, new tools that will allow developers to stitch 
together an array of Web services, applications and devices 
anywhere around the world, Microsoft president Steve Ballmer told a 
gathering of Web programmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will provide the extensibility for a Web site to 'talk'  
to another Web site,'' Ballmer said. ``You will be able to program 
the Web.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy marks a significant shift away from Microsoft's  
focus on personal computers that are run by its Windows operating 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come as competitors such as Sun Microsystems are  
unveiling products that bypass Windows in favor of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves by Microsoft are also notable because they show the  
company is moving more firmly to embrace a relatively new 
technology called extensible markup language, or XML. 
</P>
<P>
	XML is a way to tag electronic information with identifying  
codes so that businesses can exchange information without worrying 
about the need to reformat data so that it can be retrieved and 
viewed by others. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a business can easily send orders to a parts  
supplier across the Web without paying big consulting fees to an 
outside company to set up an electronic network necessary to 
translate the information. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's products likely won't become available until the  
middle of next year, while smaller competitors have had similar 
offerings on the market for months, said Martin Marshall, director 
of the analytical firm Zona Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Microsoft is the 12,000-pound gorilla that realizes this  
is the way that applications will communicate with each other 
across the Internet in a very big future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft hopes to capitalize on XML by providing what it calls  
``friction-free'' software that would keep server networks from 
suffering critical failures and data loss -- a problem that vexes 
Web surfers looking to buy or sell products during busy periods. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also hopes to provide a variety of different  
services to e-commerce companies. One such program, called 
Passport, would authenticate a customer's identity and credit-card 
information to process payments.

<HEADLINE> Group Critical of School Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Poor students are not getting the same  
challenging schoolwork as other children, despite a federal law 
designed to bridge the learning gap between the haves and 
have-nots, a civil rights panel contended Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration gives states too much latitude in  
adopting standards of learning for all children, resulting in 
``disturbing echoes of the old racially dual systems of education'' 
that existed before school segregation ended, the Citizens' 
Commission on Civil Rights -- a coalition of civil rights groups -- 
concluded in its report on Title I. 
</P>
<P>
	Title I, created more than 30 years ago to narrow the gap in  
academic achievement between low-income students and their peers, 
was revised in 1994 to make sure states getting federal money 
adopted the same high standards for all children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, ``once a prime advocate of  
standards-based reform, has since had a massive failure of will and 
nerve'' in enforcing the revision, the report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department insists it is upholding the Title 1  
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Standards spell out what each state believes all children should  
know and be able to do in each subject. States can decide which 
subjects to write standards for, but they must have reading and 
math standards to comply with the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the $8 billion federal program, the department gives  
states money to raise the historically low achievement levels of 
poor and other disadvantaged children. For years, many schools 
``dumbed down'' the curriculum for poor children, believing such 
children couldn't be expected to do the same schoolwork as peers 
who didn't face the troubles they did, such as a lack of food and 
proper health care. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the law was changed to ensure that states adopted high  
standards for all children, regardless of their backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-eight states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico  
have laws or regulations on uniform standards for learning, up from 
just a few five years ago, said Marshal Smith, who heads the 
Education Department's K-12 programs. Iowa leaves standards up to 
local school districts, while Idaho is in the process of enacting 
its rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission argues that nine states that let local school  
districts decide many of their own standards have not established 
minimum levels that must be met. 
</P>
<P>
	Title I, which serves 10.5 million children in 90 percent of  
school districts, has been under attack by education researchers 
and GOP presidential hopeful George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has called for yearly tests of children at schools  
receiving federal fund. Under his proposal, the money states get 
would be tied to the test results, and schools with consistently 
poor results would be cut off. 
</P>
<P>
	In its report, the civil rights group also criticized  
Republican-backed funding cuts and increased state waivers from 
federal rules. It says these plans undermine Title I, which is up 
for congressional renewal this year.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G Launching Online Beauty Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. is opening up shop  
online, where it will sell customized beauty care products. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G is spending $35 million to set up reflect.com, its first  
major effort to sell goods directly to customers via the Internet, 
company officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G is teaming with Institutional Venture Partners, a Silicon  
Valley investment firm, to create the Web site, which is expected 
to be launched by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The site will offer everything from shampoo to eye shadow, and  
the products will be sold exclusively on reflect.com. 
</P>
<P>
	That means reflect.com's shoppers won't find most of P&AMP;G's  
well-known beauty brands, such as Oil of Olay, Cover Girl, Pantene 
Pro-V, Vidal Sassoon, Head &AMP; Shoulders and Max Factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Any product sold on reflect.com will be ``born on the Web, it's  
sold on the Web, it only exists on the Web,'' said Denis 
Beausejour, P&AMP;G's vice president of global marketing and a leader 
of the company's Internet marketing initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati-based P&AMP;G's move into the online space comes as more  
players tap the fast-growing beauty market. Estee Lauder's Clinique 
brand is now sold online, and many beauty and drugstore Web sites 
have launched in recent months -- some even selling P&AMP;G products. 
</P>
<P>
	Jupiter Communications, a New York-based Internet research firm,  
projects that the total online personal-care market will be about 
$40 million this year and that will grow to $450 million by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	That, however, still only amounts to 2 percent of the total U.S.  
personal care market, with the bulk of sales coming at drug and 
discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G will be the majority investor and shareholder of  
reflect.com. Menlo Park, Calif.-based IVP -- which has helped 
develop Internet sites like Excite, Juniper and Ask Jeeves -- is 
providing $15 million in funding. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G's name will not appear anywhere on the site, which will be  
headquartered in Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is the latest example of the company's ongoing effort  
to use the Internet to build its business and reach consumers in 
new ways, Beausejour said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say that the site will work if customers will be  
willing to pay more and wait for products customized for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customers face a trade-off,'' said Evie Black Dykema, analyst  
in consumer e-commerce for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. 
``You need to believe that customers will be able to wait a bit 
longer, that they can delay gratification and that they're willing 
to pay a little more.''

<HEADLINE> Health of CSU's RB Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- Two games into the season, the health  
of running back Kevin McDougal is again a concern of No. 23 
Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior, who was limited last season by shoulder and  
hamstring injuries last year, is hobbled by a strained muscle in 
his leg. He was injured in the fourth quarter of Saturday's 38-33 
victory over Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't the same injury as last year,'' Colorado State coach  
Sonny Lubick said of McDougal, who rushed for 547 yards in seven 
games last year and 1,111 yards as a sophomore. ``Last year it was 
a hamstring, but this time the strain was above the hamstring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDougal was not 100 percent in workouts Sunday and Monday, and  
the sight of him hobbling raised speculation about his availability 
for Thursday's game at No. 25 Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little better Sunday than when we left the stadium on  
Saturday,'' Lubick said. ``Kevin was walking and his status will go 
right down to game time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If McDougal can't go, the Rams will turn to a running  
back-by-committee situation, the same as a year ago when they used 
three or four different backs to fill the void of McDougal and 
Damon Washington. The greatest burden will fall on freshman Rahsaan 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Through two games, Sanders has averaged 5.3 yards per carry.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's playing with poise and as if he's been here a couple of  
years,'' Lubick said. ``Rahsaan has speed, has all the moves, runs 
inside well, holds onto the ball and to me is like a veteran right 
now.''

<HEADLINE> Stock End Mostly Lower / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended a lackluster session with mixed  
results Monday as investors stepped back from Friday's rally in 
technology shares. The Dow industrials struggled to a slight gain, 
but most stocks ended lower as the dollar sank to a new three-year 
low against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	After shifting in a narrow range for much of the session, the  
Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.90 points to close at 
11,030.33. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 7.53 to 1,344.13, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 42.29 to 
2,844.77. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investors, who sent the technology-dominated Nasdaq  
to a new closing record of 2,887.06 on Friday, were ready to sell 
Monday in hopes of capturing profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a time of constant rotation between sectors,'' said  
Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for the John Hancock 
Funds in Boston. ``We move to a new high, then spend another week 
or so consolidating before it's another group's turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks has the steepest declines Monday, as Yahoo! lost  
9 3/4 to 160 3/4 and eBay dropped 10 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online fell 6 3/16 to 90 1/8. Traders attributed the drop  
to an article in Barron's magazine in which a short seller -- an 
investor who bets that the price of a stock will fall -- said AOL's 
stock price could be cut in half as a result of price competition. 
</P>
<P>
	In a short sale, a trader sells borrowed stocks on the  
expectation the price will fall before the stock has to be 
repurchased on the open market to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	3Com Corp. rose 1 5/8 to 28 7/8 after saying it will spin off its Palm  
Computing unit, the maker of Palm electronic organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also pressured by the latest slip in the value of  
the dollar. Signs of economic growth in Japan have strengthened the 
yen, pushing it to more than three-year highs against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, the dollar slipped to 106.44 yen in New York from 108.81  
late Friday, and earlier it flirted with 106 yen, dropping to its 
lowest level against the Japanese currency since mid-May 1996. A 
weaker dollar can hurt stocks in several ways. For one, it can 
entice foreign investors in U.S. stocks to put their money in 
investments in their own country. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker dollar also makes imported goods more expensive. Some  
analysts believe higher prices of cars, electronics and other 
Japanese products coveted by U.S. consumers could increase the 
chances that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a 
third time this year. The Fed has boosted rates twice this summer 
in an attempt to keep inflation from resurfacing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed continues to have justification for higher rates,''  
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan 
Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif. ``If the Fed sticks to its 
historic role of being pre-emptive of inflationary trends, it has 
enough evidence to continue tightening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freedman said investors are still waiting for each new piece of  
economic data to suggest the Fed's likely course on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, we've gotten a mixed bag of economic information, so  
we're still trading from one number to the next,'' he said. The 
market's next crucial number: the Consumer Price Index, due for 
release on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Dow components, J.P. Morgan was the biggest decliner,  
shedding 3 1/4 to 124 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 1 7/16 to 101 11/16 after announcing plans  
to form an Internet-based company to sell beauty products. Other 
consumer products companies, however, held up well. DuPont rose 2 3/4 
to 68 1/2 and Eastman Kodak gained 2 7/8 to 75 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	International Paper rose 2 1/2 to 53 13/16, continuing a recent  
wave of strength in paper stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 13-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 800.85 
million shares, compared with 973.57 million Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.54 to 439.65.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.12 percent.  
European indexes were mostly lower, as Germany's DAX index fell 0.7 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 
closed down 0.6 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It may not rate up there with bowling or golf as  
a participant activity, but one of the most popular adult endeavors 
today is creating a business of one's own. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 8.4 percent of American adults, 16 million in all,  
are at any given time attempting to start such businesses, 
according to a study by two recognized institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	And, since it takes money to lay the foundations for a business,  
an additional 4 million or so, including family members, say 
they've provided personal funds for startups in the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the study by Babson College and the Kauffman  
Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership offers reassurance to aunts 
and uncles who thought they were the only ones being hit up for 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting a business is one of the defining characteristics of  
Americans, and it might become even more so, considering the 
leadership of fellows like Bill Gates, Michael Dell and as few 
other multibillion-dollar successes. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the activity could intensify. The study finds that  
among major world economies, the United States and Canada have the 
highest proportion of adults aged 25-44 years, the age range of 
people most likely to start businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The implications of a high degree of entrepreneurship are huge;  
the study's findings suggest a positive relationship between the 
level of entrepreneurial activity and Gross Domestic Product 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Small businesses, defined as those with fewer than 500 workers,  
employ 53 percent of the private work force, account for 47 percent 
of sales and make up 51 percent of private sector GDP. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, small businesses produced an estimated 64 percent, or  
1.6 million, of the 2.5 million new jobs created, according to the 
study, which said such businesses account for 55 percent of all 
innovations. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of this, the report questions whether the United States  
maximizes what most countries would consider a national asset, and 
it criticizes federal, state and local assistance programs as 
poorly publicized and marketed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most nascent entrepreneurs do not know they even exist,'' it  
comments about public assistance programs, and argues that a 
mechanism is needed to coordinate and market them. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the efforts of public programs and the investments  
of venture capitalists, it contends that seed money is relatively 
hard to obtain in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, informal financial support from friends, family and  
work associates contributes the lion's share of initial funds, an 
estimated $56 billion per year, it states. 
</P>
<P>
	While such private contributions or investments -- it sometimes  
is difficult to distinguish between them in a startup situation -- 
are in the spirit of free enterprise and initiative, the authors 
suggests a little less regulatory restraint from the government 
might help the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compliance with U.S. regulations and tax laws is labor  
intensive and costly,'' it says. ``Moreover, regulations generally 
rely on punitive remedies to achieve compliance rather than 
incentives.''

<HEADLINE>  Brewers' Stadium To Open in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A construction accident will push back the  
Milwaukee Brewers' first game in the new Miller Park to April 2001, 
a year later than its scheduled opening day, stadium board 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13-member board overseeing the stadium's construction voted  
unanimously Monday morning to delay the project's completion by a 
full year. The ballpark was originally slated to make its debut 
with the Brewers' first home game in April 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand this may disappoint many people,'' stadium board  
chairman Robert Trunzo said of the vote to delay the park's 
opening. ``Frankly, the 13 people on this board are disappointed as 
well. But we will not compromise safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to stall the opening came shortly after the  
project's lead contractor -- Huber, Hunt &AMP; Nichols -- announced that 
it also supported a full-year delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Decker, a vice president for the firm, said a 2000  
opening was immediately ruled out because the manpower and 
materials needed for the job could not be pulled together that 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening the new ballpark immediately after the All-Star break in  
2000 was also considered, Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the firm estimated it would take 1,200 workers working 58  
hours each week for 42 weeks to meet a July 2000 deadline. There 
were about 840 workers on the site the week of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Decker said the accident cost the project almost a million  
worker hours. It is estimated that finishing the project will 
require a total of 2.8 million worker hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium board's executive director Michael Duckett said  
board members could not find 1,200 workers or have them all work 
safely at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very difficult to accept,'' Duckett said. ``We tried  
exhaustive ways to change the answer, and it just couldn't be 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The delays stem from an accident on July 14, when a 567-foot  
crane collapsed while lifting a 400-ton section of the stadium's 
retractable roof. Three ironworkers were killed and stadium 
officials estimate the resulting damage could cost between $50 
million and $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewers officials resigned themselves last week to opening  
another season in County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The team expects to double its revenue in its first year in  
Miller Park with the addition of luxury seating and the attraction 
of the new ballpark, complete with retractable roof.

<HEADLINE> Slave Labor Suits Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The United States courts can do nothing for  
people who want compensation for being forced to work as slave 
labor for the Nazis, two federal judges ruled Monday as they 
dismissed lawsuits against Ford Motor Co. and two German companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit against Ford was dismissed because the claims exceed  
time limits imposed under German and U.S. law and because Germany 
has not allowed individual claims, said U.S. District Judge Joseph 
A. Greenaway Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate ruling on four cases involving the German  
companies, Degussa AG and Siemens AG, U.S. District Judge Dickinson 
R. Debevoise said postwar treaties leave the question of payments 
to victims for nations, not courts, to decide. 
</P>
<P>
	``To structure a reparations scheme would be to express the  
ultimate lack of respect'' for the U.S. government leaders who 
ratified those pacts, Debevoise said. ``This court does not have 
the power to engage in such remediation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for former slave laborers, Burt Neuborne, promised an  
appeal, asserting the judge misread the intent of the treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of the decisions appeared coincidental, Neuborne  
said, noting both came at the time that judges change their law 
clerks, who must finish up their opinions before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	The rulings appear to be the first by U.S. courts from last  
year's deluge of about 40 lawsuits against German industrial 
concerns and their use of slave labor. The Ford case was believed 
to be the only one against an American company. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's action ``throws a question mark'' over the pending  
cases, and could bolster the position of the German companies in 
ongoing negotiations to create a joint compensation fund, said 
Holocaust law authority Harry Reicher, a professor at University of 
Pennsylvania Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit against Ford charged that senior U.S. executives  
knew that up to 10,000 workers were being abused at its Ford Werke 
plant in Germany. Ford maintains the plant was seized, along with 
other American interests, after Germany declared war on the United 
States, and that Ford lost contact with the plant until the war 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Degussa, a chemical and precious metals processor, is accused of  
using slave labor and willingly helping the Nazis produce the gas 
used in death camps. The company is also accused of processing gold 
seized from Jews, including metal fillings yanked from their 
mouths. 
</P>
<P>
	Siemens, which focuses on electrical engineering, is charged  
with profiting from unpaid slave labor provided by the Nazi regime. 
The lawsuits charge the company exploited nearly 100,000 foreign 
workers, war prisoners and concentration camp inmates through 
beatings and inhumane living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Debevoise found that victims are barred from suing in the  
United States under the last treaty to mention reparations, the 
Transition Agreement of 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuborne said he would try to persuade the appeals courts that  
the international community never intended to ignore these claims, 
merely to postpone them. 
</P>
<P>
	Siemens lawyer Thomas D. Yannucci said the company has ``always  
believed that these claims, serious as they are, shouldn't be part 
of lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siemens will continue to pay claims to laborers through its  
Humanitarian Fund, which has paid millions of dollars to date, said 
Yannucci, adding the company regrets its wartime conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Degussa, which recently became Degussa-Huels AG, said the ruling  
confirmed its position and other German companies regarding 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gideon Taylor, executive vice president of the Conference on  
Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, the New York-based umbrella 
body involved in the talks, said the issue is morality. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, the process of finding a just and a fair resolution of  
these issues for slave laborers is one that will continue 
regardless of court decisions,'' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Degussa lawsuit was filed here because its U.S. subsidiary,  
Degussa Corp., is based in Ridgefield Park. Siemens has several 
subsidiaries based in New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Detective Recalls JonBenet Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The police detective who was present when the body  
of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was found by her father says she 
feared for her life. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Arndt, who was alone in the room with John Ramsey, told  
ABC's ``Good Morning America'' in an interview broadcast this 
morning that she remembers ``tucking my gun right next to me ... 
and consciously counting out the 18 bullets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged, but authorities say the child's parents  
remain under suspicion. They have denied any involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt was the first detective to arrive at the Ramsey home on  
Dec. 26, 1996, after Patsy Ramsey called 911 to report that her 
daughter was missing and she had found a 2 1/2-page ransom note. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records said that hours later, after no call came from any  
kidnappers, Arndt asked John Ramsey, the child's millionaire 
businessman father, and a friend to search the house for anything 
unusual. He went downstairs and emerged minutes later with the 
girl's body. She had been beaten and strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mind exploded. ... I saw black with thousands of lights,''  
Arndt said. ``Everything that I noted that morning that stuck out 
instantly made sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she knelt down next to the dead child, face to face  
with Ramsey. He asked if JonBenet was dead and Arndt said yes, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a nonverbal exchange that I will never forget. ... And  
as we looked at each other, I remember, and I wore a shoulder 
holster, tucking my gun right next to me and consciously counting 
out the 18 bullets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was asked why, and replied:  
</P>
<P>
	``'Cause I didn't know if we'd all be alive when people showed  
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt's interview is the first time she has spoken publicly  
about the case, and it will be aired over five days, beginning 
today. The first segment of the interview did not indicate who 
Arndt believes killed JonBenet, but ABC executive producer Shelley 
Ross said that information would be in a later segment. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder police have been harshly criticized for their handling  
of the case, including Arndt's allowing Ramsey to recover the body. 
She said in the interview that she had told him that when he 
searched the house, if he found anything unusual he should not 
touch it. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt resigned in March and is suing the Boulder police chief  
and the city, claiming her free-speech rights were violated when 
police were ordered not to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt told ABC she feels she has been ``scapegoated.'' She said  
when she called for backup, she was told everybody was in a 
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Workers Join Millennium Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Workers worldwide are being asked to contribute  
their last hour of earnings this year in hopes of giving children a 
$200 million head start in the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The global fund-raising campaign, called the ``Children's  
Hour,'' is being organized by the Baltimore-based International 
Youth Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The five founding corporate sponsors are Deutsche Bank  
Alex.Brown, Financial Times, Groupe Danone, Kellogg Co. and Nike, 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank, which has pledged $500,000, is underwriting the  
campaign. Queen Noor of Jordan and six-time Olympic medalist Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee are leading the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The American-born Queen Noor said that the campaign is a  
continuation of the work for children she did with her husband, 
King Hussein, who died in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign hopes to raise $200 million by getting  
contributions from about 400,000 employees worldwide, said Rick R. 
Little, president and chief executive officer of the International 
Youth Foundation, which works with more than 160 companies in 30 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees can contribute through payroll deductions, corporate  
matching funds, corporate net earnings and in-kind contributions. 
Individuals also can participate through the campaign's Web site at 
www.childrenshour.org.

<HEADLINE> Ralcorp To Buy Cookie-Maker Ripon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Ralcorp Holdings Inc. will purchase  
cookie-maker Ripon Foods Inc., Ralcorp officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must be approved by regulators. Terms were not  
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripon Foods, based in Ripon, Wis., makes several private-label  
and branded cookies and sugar wafers. Ripon products are sold to 
other cookie manufacturers and to grocery stores and retailers 
under the brand names of those stores as well as the ``Rippin 
Good'' and ``Golden Batch'' brands. The privately held Ripon also 
produces a fruit-filled breakfast bar. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has annual sales of about $64 million.  
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis-based Ralcorp is a leading maker of private-label  
products such as cereals, crackers, cookies and snack nuts. The 
company has annual sales of about $600 million and employs about 
2,400 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralcorp spokesman Dan Zoellner said no determination has been  
made whether there will be any job cuts at the Ripon plant, which 
employs about 600 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase is the third by Ralcorp this year. The company  
earlier bought Southern Roasted Nuts of Georgia Inc., and Martin 
Gillet &AMP; Co. Inc., a leading maker of private-label mayonnaise and 
salad dressings. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Ralcorp were down 31 1/4 cents to $16.62 1/2 in midday  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Study: Gene Therapy Restores Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Withered cells in the brains of old monkeys  
were restored to youthful health in a gene therapy experiment that 
researchers hope to test soon in Alzheimer's disease patients. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study appearing today in the Proceedings of the National  
Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of California, 
San Diego, said originally it was hoped the gene therapy experiment 
would show a way of slowing the brain's decline with age. 
</P>
<P>
	But the effort was much more successful than expected, said Dr.  
Mark H. Tuszynski, senior author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``To our surprise, this technique nearly completely reversed''  
the effects of aging on key brain cells in elderly Rhesus monkeys, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies reinforce a new understanding of how the brain ages  
and suggest that neurons in the older brain don't die, but go into 
shrunken atrophy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've all heard the dogma that we lose 10,000 neurons a day  
after the age of 20,'' said Tuszynski. ``Well, that is false. That 
doesn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An actual count of the cells in the cortex, a key area in the  
thinking part of the brain, shows that very few cells are lost with 
age, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he said, his team found that it was control neurons in  
another part of the brain, called the basal forebrain, that were 
most dramatically affected by aging. These cells, Tuszynski said, 
had shrunk in size and had stopped making some regulatory 
chemicals, a change that seriously affects the thinking cortex. 
</P>
<P>
	``These cells are like the air traffic controllers of the  
brain,'' said the researcher. ``They are on the ground, deeper in 
the brain, controlling the activities of cells up there in the 
cortex. They control the flow of information in the cortex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found that about 40 percent of the basal  
forebrain cells could not be detected in old monkeys, and the other 
60 percent had shrunk in size by 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the cells were not dead, Tuszynski said. By inserting genes  
for nerve growth factor, or NGF, into the brain, he said, the cells 
were revived and restored to nearly full vigor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We restored the number of cells we could detect to about 92  
percent of normal for a young monkey and size of the cells was 
restored to within 3 percent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't known yet if the restored cells also reinvigorated the  
old monkeys' thinking and memory, but that is now being tested in 
another group of old monkeys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The therapy is so promising that the researchers applied in June  
to the Food and Drug Administration to test the gene therapy 
technique in humans with Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	If the FDA gives its approval, NGF genes will be injected into  
the brains of Alzheimer's patients to see if they will restore some 
cognitive powers gradually destroyed by the disease, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alzheimer's disease does not occur in animals exactly as it does  
in humans, said Tuszynski, so the only way to test the gene therapy 
technique is in human patients. The early trials, called Phase I, 
would involve only a small number to determine safety. It could be 
years before the technique's full value is proven, said Tuszynski. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Bradley Wise of the National Institute of Aging said the  
study is important because it suggests that ``the decline in the 
numbers and size of neurons with aging may be reversible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of studies have been done in rats in this area, but this  
is a step forward because it used primates (Rhesus monkeys),'' said 
Wise. However, he cautioned that ``a lot of work will have to be 
done,'' including determining how long the gene treatment lasts, 
before the technique could be used routinely in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	In their experiment, the California researchers used eight  
monkeys with an average age of 23, the monkey equivalent of the 
late 60s to 70s in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Skin cells were taken from each of the monkeys. Into these  
cells, the researchers inserted a gene that makes human nerve 
growth factor, an essential chemical found in the brain. The 
modified cells were then injected into the forebrain of four of the 
monkeys. Four others, acting as controls, got injections of skin 
cells without the NGF gene. 
</P>
<P>
	Once in the brain, the modified cells began making NGF.  
</P>
<P>
	After three months, the researchers examined the brains of the  
eight monkeys. The control monkeys showed a brain cell loss 
expected for animals their age. But the brains of the monkeys with 
the NGF genes injections had an almost youthful appearance, said 
Tuszynski.

<HEADLINE> Company Town Marks Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT GAMBLE, Wash. (AP) -- When the nation's longest continuously  
running sawmill shut down here in 1995, some imagined the death 
rattle of this quaint, waterfront town couldn't be far behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The lifeblood of Puget Sound's last company town had flowed  
directly from the Pope &AMP; Talbot Co. mill. Every detail of the town 
-- from its New England-style picket fences to its Victorian homes 
and steeple-topped churches -- was built by Pope &AMP; Talbot for its 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place was just like a second home,'' said Fran Johnson,  
63, who worked his way up to sawfiler in 41 years with the company. 
When the mill closed, Port Gamble's days appeared numbered, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Johnson and about 750 other former and current Pope &AMP;  
Talbot workers gathered Saturday for the company's 150th 
anniversary, they toasted the old mill town's brightening future. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the mill closed in 1995, Pope &AMP; Talbot spinoff Olympic  
Resource Management has paid the bills to keep the lights on in 
Port Gamble. The town's 100 residents and smattering of shops can't 
sustain it alone, but ORM sees potential. 
</P>
<P>
	It envisions Port Gamble as a thriving tourist destination with  
retail shops, small hotels and perhaps a marina along the 
waterfront where the mill once stood -- something like Virginia's 
Colonial Williamsburg, or Mystic Seaport, Connecticut's town-sized 
maritime museum. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the Kitsap County Board of Commissioners gave its  
unanimous approval to reclassifying Port Gamble as a rural historic 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	Port Gamble ``is practically a national treasure, but there's no  
support for it,'' said Peter Talbot Pope of Portland, Ore., the 
recently retired CEO of Pope &AMP; Talbot. Pope, 65, is a descendant of 
both the company's founders. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic Resource Management has been losing $200,000 to $300,000  
a year on Port Gamble. An expansion and tourist traffic could 
reduce the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be an awesome thing for the town,'' said  
Shana Smith, curator of the town's museum. ``We need additional 
businesses to offset the costs of running the town and to bring 
more people in. ... I think it's the only way the town can 
survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Jackson Pope and Frederic Talbot moved west from Maine in  
1859 to start a lumber business to feed the demand of the Gold 
Rush. Four years later, they established the mill at Port Gamble. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to attract skilled mill workers from New England, they  
built Port Gamble as a replica of their hometown of East Machias, 
Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	The look and feel have remained through Pope &AMP; Talbot's boom  
years when Port Gamble's population reached 300 after World War II, 
as well as its near demise during the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``Port Gamble will look and feel as it always has, but with some  
20th century uses,'' said Roberta Farris, vice president of 
corporate affairs for ORM. 
</P>
<P>
	The rural historic town designation would ensure that Port  
Gamble retains the same mix of residential, commercial and 
industrial uses, but it could expand, Farris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents fear any expansion will ruin Port Gamble. Some say the  
tourist season in the area is too short and its roads too few to 
support a major attraction. While Port Gamble is only about 21 
miles northeast of Seattle, it typically takes more than two hours 
to reach by ferry. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, former Pope &AMP; Talbot employees felt they had  
stepped back in time to their former days at the mill. Some 
competed in chain saw carving competitions while others tried log 
rolling or simply spent time catching up with old colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys came up this hill with tears in their eyes,''  
Johnson said. ``I know I did.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Readies Anti-Doping Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- International Olympic Committee vice  
president Dick Pound said Tuesday that the International 
Anti-Doping Agency would be operational by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the IOC remains committed to spending $25 million to  
set up the agency as promised at the worldwide sports drugs 
conference in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had six or seven meetings of our working group that  
involves the Olympic movement and public authorities,'' Pound said. 
``I think we have a very high degree of agreement on establishing 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm virtually certain it will be up well before the end of the  
year and very much operational in time for Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Olympic Committee boss John Coates said in a letter  
last week to IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch that the fight 
against doping at the Sydney Games would be seriously compromised 
if the international agency wasn't in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who heads the IOC's marketing commission, made the  
comments at an Olympics sponsors meeting in Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures declined Monday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade amid jockeying by investors as final harvest 
time nears. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn prices drooped to their lowest level in two weeks on  
favorable harvesting weather and expectations that the crop will 
come in on time. Ahead of the official crop report by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, due out later Monday, the market 
responded to word that yields in some central corn belt states have 
been better than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were pressured by concerns that last week's runup in  
prices may result in a slowdown of exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures dipped slightly lower. Traders said any frosts in  
the northern Plains states are not likely to have a significant 
impact on spring wheat yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 1/2 cent to $2.88 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 3/4 cents to $2.16 a bushel; December oats fell 1/4 
cent to $1.15 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 5 1/2 cents to $5.10 1/4 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle fell .70 cent to 67.37 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle fell .73 cent to 79.62 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs fell .25 cent to 42.97 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies fell .30 cent to 54.12 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Targets Drug Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Coast Guard sharpshooters fire from  
helicopters to knock out the engines of cocaine-laden boats in the 
Caribbean in a tactic unused since the Prohibition era, officials 
disclosed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The previously secret assaults have been employed in recent  
weeks using an array of nonlethal force to stop smugglers who now 
use open-hull, low-profile boats called ``Super Smugglers'' or 
``Go-Fasts'' that carry barrels of fuel and about a ton of cocaine 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	The sea encounters have led to capture of 13 crew members from  
four boats and netted more than three tons of cocaine destined 
ultimately for the illicit U.S. market, said Barry McCaffrey, White 
House drug control director. He said those and other operations in 
the past year brought cocaine confiscation to a record 53 tons, 
with a street value of $3.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made the drug smugglers afraid. We will now make them  
disappear,'' McCaffrey said at a news conference with other 
officials alongside one of the specially equipped MH90 Enforcer 
helicopters leased by the Coast Guard for the operation. The 
helicopter and a sleek Coast Guard chase craft were brought to the 
Transportation Department aboard flatbed trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the four ``Super Smugglers'' stopped so far were  
disabled in the last month. None of the four crews fired back, 
Coast Guard officials said, but rules of engagement allow lethal 
return fire if they do. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpshooter Charlie Hopkins, nicknamed ``El Diablo'' because  
his .50-caliber Robar rifle bears the packing number 999, fired 
three shots Aug. 16 that disabled a vessel. ``Depending on which 
way you hold it, it carries the sign of the devil (666,)'' Hopkins, 
32, of Winslow, Maine, said in an interview. But he said he aims 
his laser targeting sight only at the speeding crafts' engines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still humanitarian. We just want to stop the flow,'' he  
said, noting that the each helicopter carries a life raft in case a 
boat is accidentally blown up or sunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Adm. James E. Loy, Coast Guard commandant, ruled out any chance  
that commercial fishermen or pleasure boaters will be targeted by 
the sharpshooters. Rules require identification and extensive 
warnings before aggressive tactics are employed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This special show is not going to be coming to a theater near  
you,'' he said as an assurance to private boaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who oversees the Coast  
Guard, said the interdiction dubbed Operation New Frontier will 
lead to other high-tech operations to counter drug smuggling. The 
Clinton administration is asking for $17.8 billion to fight illegal 
drugs next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials declined to detail the new tactics. But a Coast  
Guard background briefing provided descriptions of the dramatic 
encounters, and released videotape of two incidents showed 
helicopters as they stopped speeding vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard is not believed to have authorized firing from  
the air to disable vessels since fixed-wing aircraft were used to 
chase down and stop shipments of illegal alcohol in the 1920s, 
according to the Coast Guard historian's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest use of nonlethal force included machine-gun fire  
across boats' bows, use of a ``stingball'' that exploded into a 
shower of rubber pellets and deployment of a special net to 
entangle a boat's engines. Use of the sharpshooter is a last resort 
to stop the boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Loy happily admitted that although the new tactics are not  
intended to kill or injure, they put the smuggler at increased 
danger. ``If there's a new risk on the part of the bad guys, that's 
terrific,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Go-Fasts'' represent a change in strategy for drug  
smugglers, who have seen a halt to big cargo flights out of 
Colombia, McCaffrey said. The Coast Guard's previous tactic, firing 
warning shots from the sea at the speedy boats, was ineffective, 
considering that smugglers average more than a trip a day between 
Colombia and Puerto Rico, Haiti or the Dominican Republic en route 
to the U.S. mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of the small boats has doubled since 1996, officials say,  
and they now carry more than 85 percent of all maritime drug 
shipments.

<HEADLINE>  'Ally McBeal,' 'Practice' Top Emmys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The lawyers walked away with the Emmy Awards  
verdict, while the dysfunctional mobsters from ``The Sopranos,'' 
who had the most nominations, got little respect. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51st annual awards show was a virtual lovefest for David E.  
Kelley, who created both ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal'' and 
writes many episodes of the two legal-eagle series. He closed the 
awards Sunday with back-to-back acceptance speeches, first for 
``The Practice'' as best drama, then for ``Ally McBeal'' for best 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	No producer had ever won both comedy and drama Emmys the same  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the evening, Michael Badalucco and Holland Taylor,  
``Practice'' regulars who won awards for best supporting actor and 
actress in a drama, sang his praises, while Kelley returned the 
kind words to his casts and crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone was going to ask me the fastest or best way to win  
an Emmy, I'd say write a script and get Calista Flockhart to say 
the words,'' Kelley said of his ``Ally McBeal'' star. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley has a track record to back up the assertion: He was  
executive producer of ``L.A. Law'' and creator of ``Picket 
Fences,'' past winners of the drama series Emmy. 
</P>
<P>
	Flockhart was nominated for best actress in a comedy but lost to  
Helen Hunt, who took home her fourth-straight award for ``Mad About 
You,'' which finished its seven-year run last season. She matched a 
record held by John Larroquette, who had won four years in a row as 
best supporting actor for ``Night Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Lithgow won best actor in a comedy for ``3rd Rock From the  
Sun,'' Edie Falco, the long-suffering wife of a mobster, won best 
dramatic actress for ``The Sopranos'' and Dennis Franz won his 
fourth award for best actor in a drama for ``NYPD Blue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know why I have won this. As far as I can tell  
every actor in this town thinks what I do on '3rd Rock' is 
completely disgraceful,'' Lithgow joked. ``I'm embarrassed 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franz beat former co-star Jimmy Smits, whose character Bobby  
Simone died in a tearful farewell when Smits departed from the show 
after five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The award came as a surprise, because he'd expected co-star  
Smits to win, said Franz, who plays the surly but lovable detective 
Andy Sipowicz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accept this along with you, along with the other nominees,''  
Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanking her family watching back on Long Island, Falco flashed  
her jewelry so her relatives could ``see all this stuff. All this 
glittery stuff,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is absolutely the most surreal experience I could ever  
even have imagined,'' Falco said. ``I don't even know where I am, 
and I haven't eaten since six this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the show, Kelley said he had thought HBO's critically and  
popularly acclaimed mob series might walk away with the award for 
best drama. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really felt it was `The Sopranos'' year,'' Kelley said.  
``There seemed to be so much heat around that show and so different 
than the storytelling we'd seen before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos'' earned 16 nominations, the most of any  
contender, but walked away with just four. In addition to Falco's, 
the others were for best drama series writing and two in technical 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kelley accepted the award for best comedy, he even joked  
that he thought his previous prize for best drama might be handed 
to the HBO series instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said backstage, 'You got to go back out, you got to go  
back out,''' Kelley said. ``And I thought there had been a mistake, 
'The Sopranos' had won drama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Holland and Badalucco gushed about Kelley in accepting  
their awards for supporting actress and actor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The words of David Kelley are an inspiration to me,'' said  
Badalucco, who plays lawyer Jimmy Berluti in ``The Practice.'' 
``Thank you, David, for Jimmy and for being such a nice guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who plays a sex-obsessed judge on ``The Practice,''  
thanked Kelley ``for giving me the chariot to ride up here on: A 
woman who puts a flag on the moon for women over 40, who can think, 
who can work, who are successes, who can cook, and who can cook!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kristen Johnston of ``3rd Rock From the Sun'' was named best  
supporting actress in a comedy and David Hyde Pierce won the 
supporting actor's honor for ``Frasier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce and Jenna Elfman of ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' were hosts of the  
just-under three-hour show aired by Fox.

You,'' which finished its seven-year run last season. She matched a 
record held by John Larroquette, who had won four years in a row as 
best supporting actor for ``Night Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Lithgow won best actor in a comedy for ``3rd Rock From the  
Sun,'' Edie Falco, the long-suffering wife of a mobster, won best 
dramatic actress for ``The Sopranos'' and Dennis Franz won his 
fourth award for best actor in a drama for ``NYPD Blue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know why I have won this. As far as I can tell  
every actor in this town thinks what I do on '3rd Rock' is 
completely disgraceful,'' Lithgow joked. ``I'm embarrassed 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franz beat former co-star Jimmy Smits, whose character Bobby  
Simone died in a tearful farewell when Smits departed from the show 
after five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The award came as a surprise, because he'd expected co-star  
Smits to win, said Franz, who plays the surly but lovable detective 
Andy Sipowicz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accept this along with you, along with the other nominees,''  
Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanking her family watching back on Long Island, Falco flashed  
her jewelry so her relatives could ``see all this stuff. All this 
glittery stuff,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is absolutely the most surreal experience I could ever  
even have imagined,'' Falco said. ``I don't even know where I am, 
and I haven't eaten since six this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the show, Kelley said he had thought HBO's critically and  
popularly acclaimed mob series might walk away with the award for 
best drama. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really felt it was `The Sopranos'' year,'' Kelley said.  
``There seemed to be so much heat around that show and so different 
than the storytelling we'd seen before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos'' earned 16 nominations, the most of any  
contender, but walked away with just four. In addition to Falco's, 
the others were for best drama series writing and two in technical 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kelley accepted the award for best comedy, he even joked  
that he thought his previous prize for best drama might be handed 
to the HBO series instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said backstage, 'You got to go back out, you got to go  
back out,''' Kelley said. ``And I thought there had been a mistake, 
'The Sopranos' had won drama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Holland and Badalucco gushed about Kelley in accepting  
their awards for supporting actress and actor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The words of David Kelley are an inspiration to me,'' said  
Badalucco, who plays lawyer Jimmy Berluti in ``The Practice.'' 
``Thank you, David, for Jimmy and for being such a nice guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who plays a sex-obsessed judge on ``The Practice,''  
thanked Kelley ``for giving me the chariot to ride up here on: A 
woman who puts a flag on the moon for women over 40, who can think, 
who can work, who are successes, who can cook, and who can cook!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kristen Johnston of ``3rd Rock From the Sun'' was named best  
supporting actress in a comedy and David Hyde Pierce won the 
supporting actor's honor for ``Frasier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce and Jenna Elfman of ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' were hosts of the  
just-under three-hour show aired by Fox.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Officials Push For Lottery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Gov. Don Siegelman is asking Alabama  
voters to ignore their church leaders and get in line with other 
Southern states that are bucking the Bible Belt image and cashing 
in on gambling to help pay for schools and college scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers are condemning the Democratic governor's proposed  
state lottery, saying it would replace respect for hard work with 
get-rich-quick dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	But they aren't able to stop the cheers Siegelman gets when he  
points to neighboring Georgia, where a lottery that funds college 
scholarships and other education programs has been a huge success 
since its creation in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's helping the kids with college,'' said Ray Tarver, a  
school custodian in Montgomery. ``They can at least get something I 
didn't get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tarver said Siegelman's proposed lottery is the only way his  
three children will go to college, unless they get some kind of 
military assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't afford it,'' said Tarver, 39. ``That's the only thing  
I hope for is a lottery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman wants to use lottery proceeds to give high school  
students with at least a B average scholarships to a private or 
public college in Alabama. Lottery money would also go toward 
pre-kindergarten programs and school computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman used the lottery issue to help oust the Republican  
governor last November. His plan moved through the Legislature with 
little resistance and is on the ballot Oct. 12. Recent polls show 
the public is strongly in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	As the governor told state lawmakers, Alabama practically has a  
lottery already: ``Eighteen out of 24 Alabama daily newspapers 
carry the Georgia or Florida lottery numbers. Why? Because they 
know what you and I know: Their readers are buying lottery tickets 
and they want to know if they won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money Alabama residents now spend on the lottery in Florida  
and Georgia needs to stay in Alabama to create a better-educated 
workforce, Siegelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the people opposed to the education lottery have their way,  
things will stay just as they are,'' he said. ``They ought to be 
ashamed of themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama already allows gambling at four dog tracks, and it is  
only a short trip to riverboat casinos in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitch to keep the gambling money at home was also used  
successfully last year in South Carolina, where Democrat Jim Hodges 
was elected governor over a GOP incumbent and a proposed lottery is 
set for a statewide vote in November 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia run lotteries,  
while commercial casinos operate in 10 states and Indian tribes run 
casinos in at least 22 states. Only Hawaii and Utah bar all forms 
of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	With four weeks until the lottery vote, the Alabama Republican  
Party has decided not to take the lead in opposing the lottery. 
That has left church leaders, a few GOP officials and a few 
conservative political groups to fight it alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people are convinced by what they hear, that it's  
going to bring in such revenue, and everybody wants a better life. 
But gambling brings crime and poverty. It is a false hope,'' said 
the Rev. Al Lewis, pastor of the New Community United Methodist 
Church in Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Moody, a political analyst at Auburn University at  
Montgomery, said church leaders are having a tough time trying to 
equate the evil of a state lottery with other gambling, such as 
casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	``People seem to see a difference between the lottery and other  
kinds of gambling. They don't put that in the same category,'' 
Moody said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the opponents' only other strategy is to challenge the  
lottery revenue projections. Lottery opponents are questioning 
Siegelman's prediction that an Alabama lottery would generate $150 
million annually for the state. Siegelman contends that is a 
conservative estimate.

<HEADLINE> Alternate Practices 'Just in Case'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- It wasn't really a practice round for  
Ryder Cup alternate Bob Estes when he played at The Country Club 
for the first time on Monday. It was more like a ``practice 
practice'' round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the first alternate and Davis Love (III) is hurt,'' said  
Estes, who missed making the U.S. team by one stroke in the PGA 
Championship. ``Hopefully, he'll be OK. But if for some reason he 
can't play, I needed to come see the course just in case. ... I'll 
be preparing as if I'm going to be in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the 12 U.S. Ryder Cup team members played a practice  
round at the course on Aug. 30 in preparation for the tournament 
that will be held in this Boston suburb on Sept. 24-26. Love 
couldn't make it because he was seeing a doctor about the pinched 
nerve in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw said he has talked to Love three times  
this week and heard encouraging reports. Love's agent has also said 
he expected Love to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's fine, he's rested and relaxed,'' Crenshaw said. ``There's  
been no further complications on anything that they have been able 
to determine on any exam. The nerve problem apparently has gone 
away for now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Estes called Crenshaw and volunteered to come to Boston  
on his way back from the Canadian Open in Toronto, where he 
finished tied for 15th last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really appreciate Bob's willingness to make the effort,''  
Crenshaw said. ``I'm very happy to know that someone would put in 
that much preparation in case we might need him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top 10 golfers on the Ryder Cup points list make the team,  
and the captain gets to add two players of his own choice. If any 
of the top 10 has to drop out, he would be replaced by No. 11 
Estes, whom Crenshaw skipped in favor of Tom Lehman (No. 12) and 
Steve Pate (No. 14). 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great to be a part of that team and play in that  
tournament, but I'm not supposed to play, Davis is,'' said Estes, 
who's ranked 35th in the world to Love's No. 4. ``Davis obviously 
has a much better resume than I do. You've got to go pretty far 
down the rankings to get from where Davis is to where I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw said he scheduled the August practice round so that the  
players would grow more comfortable with the course. But he also 
knew that it wouldn't hurt to have an extra chance to get 
comfortable with The Country Club's blind tee shots and cozy 
greens. 
</P>
<P>
	Estes agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We both believe that every time you play a course you get to  
know it that much better,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So, what did he think?  
</P>
<P>
	``It's my kind of course. I was glad to see it was more about  
position than brute strength,'' Estes said. ``To tell you the 
truth, this course probably suits my game more than Davis'. But 
Davis can play any course.''

<HEADLINE> Apple Growers Struggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUTNEY, Vt. (AP) -- The long row of packing equipment is silent  
and gathering dust at Green Mountain Orchards this autumn. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen workers normally swarm around the machinery this time of  
year -- especially when an apple crop as good as this one starts 
coming in off the trees. 
</P>
<P>
	But the economics of apples has caught up here on this  
third-generation apple farm that brothers Evan and Matt Darrow run. 
Instead of packing their own and squeezing a few extra cents' 
profit out of each bushel, the Darrows faced the reality that they 
could not afford new equipment and now send their fruit up the road 
to be sorted and packed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we'd give up apple growing before we gave up apple  
packing,'' Evan Darrow said, staring off toward the back of the 
giant warehouse at the edge of the orchard that once gave his 
operation a competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, though, it's just one more symbol of a tough business that  
individual growers can do little to control. 
</P>
<P>
	Like so much of agriculture, apple farming is becoming an  
increasingly difficult way of life not just in Vermont but across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	New labeling demands by retailers and stiff new competition from  
China are combining with stagnant prices, flat domestic consumption 
and always fickle weather to endanger another way of farm life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is growing increasingly difficult for small growers who  
can't achieve the economies of scale to compete,'' said Julia Daly, 
spokeswoman for the U.S. Apple Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result we're going to lose some small farms,'' she said.  
``The challenge is going to be whether or not they can find a niche 
into which they can fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Large orchards that cater to wholesale markets and small  
orchards that rely on farm stands or pick-your-own operations seem 
to be doing well. But medium-sized orchards that try to do both are 
feeling pressure, said Judy Dimock, co-owner of North Star Orchard 
in Madison, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Those medium-sized farms have three choices: Go out of business,  
add acreage or downsize. ``Most of us have opted to downsize and 
focus on direct marketing,'' Dimock said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's partly what's happened at Green Mountain, one of  
Vermont's largest orchards. The 250-acre farm with 30,000 trees is 
a study in the challenges and changes in the American apple 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last fall we realized this was a sinking ship,'' Darrow said.  
``If this is what we want to do with our lives, what do we do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The orchard was consolidated by selling off land that's far from  
the central orchard or that hasn't been producing up to par. Some 
new varieties, such as Honey Crisp, were planted to replace 
varieties such as Red Delicious, which have not been profitable and 
were cut down. But the toughest change was to stop packing apples, 
Darrow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Mountain had greater control over its harvest by packing  
its own crop and was able to improve its profit margin slightly. 
But that changed when retailers began demanding that each 
individual fruit get a sticker with a four-digit code on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Those stickers make it easy for checkout clerks to punch in the  
price. But it's time consuming. Where once Green Mountain's packing 
line could box up to 1,100 bushels a day, the pace dropped to only 
700 bushels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Several different ways of getting the job done were tried but,  
short of investing $500,000 in new optical scanning equipment, the 
Darrows decided their best option was to send their apples to 
Vermont Apple, which has the new packing and sticker technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always felt we could get an extra 50 cents a bushel out of  
packing our own,'' Darrow said. ``Then it started costing us 75 
cents (a bushel) to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orchard operators all across the country are being forced to  
make similar changes. Part of the problem is that so many people 
are growing apples. Production has steadily increased even as 
domestic demand has remained flat. The industry has been trying, 
with mixed success, to break into overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Chinese have gotten into apple growing, also, and have  
cornered the market on so-called processing apples, those that are 
processed into cider, juice and concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry accuses the Chinese of dumping excess apple  
concentrate in the United States at a loss, depressing prices. In 
1995, processing apples sold for $153 a ton. That fell to $93 a ton 
in 1997 and just last year dropped to $55 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled this summer that  
the U.S. industry was being injured and now the Commerce Department 
is weighing whether steep tariffs are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Chinese have not made a dent in the ``fresh  
market'' sector, those sold on supermarket shelves, their inroads 
into processing have hurt that sector also. 
</P>
<P>
	``The processing apple prices set the stage or trend for prices  
throughout our industry for fresh apples,'' Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the U.S. Agriculture Department, farmers got 24  
cents a pound for fresh market apples in 1995. That has fluctuated 
to 20.8 cents in 1996, 22.1 cents in 1997 and plummeted to 17.1 
cents last year. 
</P>
<P>
	That hurts a farmer. So Darrow does what he can on his hillside  
farm, reorganizing, trimming expenses and diversifying when he can 
into such things as a 10-acre blueberry patch that provides some 
summertime business. But whether it will work for him and hundreds 
like him may not be decided in Putney. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic about the changes we have made, but there is an  
apple market out there that I have no control over.''

<HEADLINE> Foreign Park Workers Learn About US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDUSKY, Ohio (AP) -- Pavel Kotas came to America to learn the  
language. He just didn't expect most of his English lessons to 
revolve around the rules of tossing a softball into a milk can. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old from the Czech Republic was one of 700 foreign  
students recruited to work at Cedar Point amusement park this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	With workers in short supply, the park hired nearly 20 percent  
of its 4,000 seasonal employees from overseas to operate roller 
coasters, french fry stands and ticket booths. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all were college students hoping to find adventure,  
improve their English, see sights and make good money. They also 
came away with a wealth of insight into Americans at work and play. 
</P>
<P>
	Kotas spent his summer operating a booth featuring games of  
chance. It didn't take long to catch on to the carnival life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey look, I have another choice winner,'' he shouted out onto  
the midway as he handed over a giant stuffed Tweety bird. 
</P>
<P>
	What surprises him most about the United States?  
</P>
<P>
	``In our country we learn about American history and culture,''  
he said. ``Here, there are people who think Ernest Hemingway is a 
football player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and other game operators entertain themselves by counting how  
many times they hear a ``please'' or ``thank you'' during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you can count them on one hand,'' said 20-year-old  
Jude Douglas of Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	An economics student, Kotas was paid about $5 an hour.  
</P>
<P>
	He has saved most of his money for a trip to the western states.  
He and three other foreign students at the park are renting a car 
for the cross-country drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see the Beverly Hills and Mount Rushmore,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sisters Ekaterina and Anna Beloded of Belarus, spent the summer  
making hamburgers and milkshakes at a 1950s-themed diner in the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we came here, we did not know what this french fry was.  
Cheeseburger? Hamburger?'' Ekaterina said with a laugh. ``Now we 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though they have worked many 15-hour days, both said they  
love the freedom having a job brings. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this country you can get a job and make money, in our  
country it's impossible,'' said Ekaterina, 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to come back and start my own life, I can make my  
own decisions here,'' added Anna, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Olga Gontcharouk, another kitchen worker at the restaurant, said  
young Americans don't appreciate the benefits of a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young people here are more independent,'' said the 22-year-old  
from Russia. She said at home ``lots of young married people still 
stay with their parents. Fortunately, I'm not with my parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, 43,000 foreign students came to America through  
work-exchange programs, according to the U.S. Information Agency, 
which administers the program. 
</P>
<P>
	In past years, Cedar Point has worked with  
international-exchange programs and this year it sent a recruiter 
overseas to England, Slovakia, Lithuania and Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
	The amusement park, on a peninsula that stretches into Lake  
Erie, is between Cleveland and Toledo. It boasts more 67 thrill 
rides and 13 roller coasters and attracts about 3.5 million people 
each summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Spurgeon, 23, of Wales, was one of the few foreign  
students working as a ride operator. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to see the states for myself,'' he said. ``You see  
things like 'The Jerry Springer Show' and think, 'Surely it can't 
be like that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said working around children is like a roller coaster -- lots  
of ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tugging at his red sailor's style uniform, he said he'd be made  
fun of at home for wearing such an outfit. ``The kids are better 
behaved here and they give you respect,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurgeon, like the others from overseas, were still amazed at  
the amount of money they've made. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like Monopoly money to us,'' he said. ``I don't  
really have a sense of what it's worth. I think that's why I'm 
spending more than usual.''

<HEADLINE> 'Sopranos' Takes Hit at Emmy Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The critics say ``The Sopranos'' has guts, it  
has edge, and it has a buzz like no other show on TV. What it 
doesn't have is the big-time Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO's dark series on mafia murder and mayhem got whacked at the  
Emmys, winning just two during the Sunday night awards show plus 
two technical Emmys it garnered earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	This despite leading the field with 16 nominations overall.  
</P>
<P>
	But it may not have been a lack of respect.  
</P>
<P>
	The television academy's members might have been loathe to honor  
a gritty series without cuddly characters, and even more averse to 
picking the first cable show ever nominated for best drama, 
industry analysts and observers noted on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The television academy membership does tend to be reasonably  
conservative in terms of embracing new media,'' said Gerald 
Isenberg, a former producer who is a film and television professor 
at the University of Southern California. ``Especially because the 
vast bulk of them get their money from the conventional broadcast 
networks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other possible factors: a backlash against the show's raves, and  
a precedent of first-year shows not being honored. 
</P>
<P>
	The HBO series -- about a Mafioso suffering with two  
dysfunctional families, his blood relatives and his bloody mob -- 
was a newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
	It was up against four veteran network series, ``NYPD Blue,  
``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``ER'' and ``The Practice,'' which won for best 
drama Sunday night for the second straight year. The other three 
shows all previously won the drama award -- none of them in their 
first year. And like ``The Sopranos,'' both ``ER'' and ``NYPD 
Blue'' got a gaggle of nominations in their rookie seasons yet 
failed to win the best drama series award -- in what was considered 
an upset. 
</P>
<P>
	Even ``The Practice'' creator David E. Kelley, whose ``Ally  
McBeal'' also won for best comedy series, said he thought ``The 
Sopranos'' would win best drama. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's such a terrific show,'' Kelley said. ``I don't think  
it's one that approximates anything that I've seen before on 
television or anything that I've done before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While ``The Sopranos'' was a fresh show with glowing reviews and  
devoted fans, that was not enough to vault it over more 
conventional, established series, said Thomas O'Neil, author of 
``The Emmys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are bandwagons that go sailing through these Emmys all  
the time that hit brick walls when they reach the final voting 
stage,'' O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Albrecht, HBO's president of original programming, said  
there may have been some backlash against ``The Sopranos'' and its 
16 nominations because of the wide press coverage the show had 
gained. 
</P>
<P>
	``People may get tired of hearing about one network and one  
show,'' Albrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Chase, the show's creator who shared the award for best  
dramatic series writing, was disappointed about missing the best 
drama award but gratified by the number of nominations the series 
received. ``We must be doing something right,'' he said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
	``It does flaunt some pretty basic rules about television, like  
the likeability factor. I don't know that our characters are very 
huggable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series had five acting nominations, but won just one -- for  
the most upright character. Edie Falco, who plays a long-suffering, 
soul-searching mob wife, took home the award for best actress in a 
drama series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emmy voters in general want to like who they're voting for,''  
O'Neil said. ``Look who did win. Edie Falco, the woman who is the 
moral center of that series, the moral center of that immoral 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show also won for casting and editing at the untelevised  
ceremony for mainly technical awards Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	But some critics who sang high-pitched raves about ``The  
Sopranos'' still thought Monday that it was a crime that the show 
wasn't given the drama series award. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Times TV columnist Howard Rosenberg wrote: ``This  
was a year in which nothing on TV matched `The Sopranos.' 
Succeeding as both high art and popular entertainment, it 
deglamorized organized crime and reduced the operatic dignity given 
the Mafia in those `Godfather' films and a multitude of cheap 
clones. The best series on television deserved the highest award 
television can give it.''

<HEADLINE> Dilfer May Be Kept in Tampa Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Trent Dilfer probably wished he didn't have  
to show up for work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The film of his performance in Tampa Bay's season-opening loss  
to the New York Giants wasn't pretty, and the sixth-year 
quarterback hurt -- for himself and his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very painful. There's mistakes that you can live with,  
that happens. And there were a few of those. But there's a couple 
that were inexcusable,'' said Dilfer, who threw three interceptions 
and lost a fumble before being benched during Sunday's 17-13 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really hurts your pride to see yourself making inexcusable  
mistakes. The only way you handle it is to take it on the chin and 
move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the interceptions was returned for a touchdown, as was  
the first-quarter fumble that coach Tony Dungy said he should have 
challenged under the new instant replay rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Dilfer was yanked after throwing two interceptions early in the  
fourth quarter, the second after scrambling more than 20 yards in 
the wrong direction and releasing the ball off balance as he 
stepped out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the puzzling performance probably didn't cost him the  
starting job for next Sunday's game at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Dungy said he is leaning toward sticking with Dilfer, who  
completed 15 of 31 passes for 174 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup Eric Zeier entered the game with nine minutes remaining,  
but the Bucs -- trailing by just four points -- gained only 17 yards 
in the four possessions he led. 
</P>
<P>
	``My gut feeling is that we'll go in the same way we went with  
Trent,'' Dungy said, adding that he'll make his decision before 
Wednesday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that everything that happened out there was the  
quarterback's fault. But if I think Eric gives us a better chance 
to win on Sunday, then we'll go with Eric. If I think Trent gives 
us a better chance, we will do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback coach Clyde Christensen said right now the job  
belongs to Dilfer, just two years removed from leading Tampa Bay to 
its only playoff berth since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consensus is that unless something happens during this  
week, that he's our starting quarterback, and we've just got to get 
him back on track,'' Christensen said, adding that one factor that 
could change the decision is if Dilfer is unable to practice 
because of a slight right knee strain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him last night that I looked at all the alternatives,  
and most of them weren't acceptable, and all you do is keep going. 
We've got 15 games to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dilfer said whatever Dungy decides, he'll support the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously any time you feel like you've failed, you want the  
chance for redemption,'' the quarterback said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to put any extra pressure on myself to do  
anything spectacular. I think if anything showed up on film, it's 
that I was trying to do too much. It cost me, and cost us, 
unfortunately ... I very well could have won that game by making 
some key decisions and a couple of throws. That's probably the 
thing that hurts the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dungy said in hindsight he may have erred by not challenging the  
first-quarter fumble that Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead forced 
when he sacked Dilfer. The ball bounced right into the hands of 
defensive tackle Christian Peter, who ran 38 yards to give New York 
a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach said film he watched Monday showed Dilfer's arm was  
moving forward to attempt a pass. He didn't challenge the call 
during the game because replays the Bucs viewed then didn't show 
conclusive evidence that the officials made the wrong call.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Coach Urges Early Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- These last-second comebacks are  
exhilarating, but Arizona coach Vince Tobin says Jake Plummer and 
the rest of the Cardinals must learn how to take an early lead and 
hold it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next step is to not get behind, and certainly not get  
behind on a consistent basis,'' Tobin said Monday in the aftermath 
of the Cardinals' 25-24 season-opening victory at Philadelphia. 
``You're not going to be a championship-caliber football team year 
in and year out by coming back and winning seven games in the last 
minute. The percentages are against you. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of those field goals aren't going to go through. A guy  
might fumble a snap. There might be a bad hold. A lot of things can 
happen. The good football teams are the ones who start from the 
very beginning, play consistently throughout and hopefully have the 
ball game under control in the fourth quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That certainly wasn't the case Sunday, when Plummer threw three  
early interceptions and the Eagles jumped to a 21-0 lead in the 
first quarter. Plummer brilliantly brought the Cardinals back and 
Chris Jacke kicked a 31-yard field goal to win the game as time 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 10th come-from-behind victory Plummer has engineered  
in 27 games as Arizona's quarterback. Last season, when Arizona was 
9-7 and made the playoffs for the first time in 16 years, the 
Cardinals won their last three regular-season games with field 
goals by Jacke on the final play. Now the string is at four. 
</P>
<P>
	In just his third season and only 23 years old, Plummer's late  
heroics have inspired confidence throughout the team. Late in 
Sunday's game, Plummer paced the sidelines and reportedly told 
defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis, ``You stop 'em, and I'll get 
it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Plummer had a huge hand in creating the deficit that he and  
his teammates were able to overcome. Those three interceptions and 
an early fumble by fullback Joel Makovicka led to 17 Philadelphia 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	But Plummer, who has started every game since midway through his  
rookie season, is long past the point where Tobin will yank him 
from the field when he's had a bad quarter or half. He had missed 
most of the preseason with a sprained right thumb, so his early 
struggles were understandable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jake is our quarterback,'' Tobin said. ``Whether we get to  
where we need to get or don't is going to be from what Jake does. 
The only thing that would have made me consider taking him out of 
the game was if he told me his thumb was hurting him so bad that he 
couldn't perform his job. I asked him at halftime `Is your thumb 
bothering you?' and he said, `No, I can go.' and I said fine. That 
was the end of that discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Tobin said Plummer still must improve the way he  
approaches the early phases of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, he just needs to maybe take care of the ball a  
little bit more early in ball games and realize that every phase of 
the game is different,'' Tobin said. ``The first quarter is 
definitely different than the fourth quarter, as far as your 
mindset. You sometimes have to be more of a field general and less 
of a playmaker early in the game, and let your running backs and 
your receivers and your tight ends make plays for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest hair-raising triumph leaves the Cardinals 1-0 for the  
first time in eight years. The next stop is Sunday in Miami, where 
the Cardinals were wondering whether they'd have to deal with the 
wreckage of Hurricane Floyd, due to blow in from the Atlantic later 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd be glad to play the game here,'' Tobin said.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Care Home Fire Kills Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PERRYOPOLIS, Pa. (AP) -- Fire tore through a home for the elderly  
early Monday, killing two people and injuring five others. 
</P>
<P>
	About 35 people were evacuated from Dainty's Valley Elderly Care  
Inc.'s home after the one-story brick structure caught fire around 
4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman and a man were killed. Their names were not immediately  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	``They happened to be located right where the seat of the fire  
was located,'' said Capt. Gary Herre of the South Brownsville Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Three women residents who suffered smoke inhalation were in  
stable condition at Brownsville Hospital. One woman was flown to 
Pittsburgh for treatment of burns. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a firefighter suffered minor injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	In all, there were 37 residents, some who use wheelchairs and  
others who need help walking, authorities said. Two nurse's aides 
were on duty at the time of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	A retired firefighter, George Boone, 74, was in the bathroom  
when he first heard an alarm. He took his wheelchair down the hall 
to the exit, where he tried to persuade a woman in a wheelchair to 
come with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said, `I'm scared, I'm scared,'' Boone said. ``I said,  
`I'm scared, too.''' Both escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Dainty, 64, said she and her husband built the center in  
1987, and their children took over in 1995. Sobbing, she said she 
often stayed at the center and had planned to do so Sunday night, 
but she fell asleep at her house up the road. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuated residents were transferred to two nearby centers  
that are run by the same family.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Open Ratings Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The all-American final between Andre Agassi and  
Todd Martin more than doubled last year's ratings in the U.S. Open 
final. And the men didn't even fare as well as the women. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS' Sunday afternoon match in which Agassi outlasted Martin in  
five sets posted a 7.1 overnight rating and a 14 share, up 133 
percent from last year when Rafter defeated Mark Philippoussis. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the third straight year, the women posted a higher  
overnight rating than the men in the U.S. Open finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Serena Williams' upset win over Martina Hingis in the women's  
championship Saturday had a 7.2 overnight mark and a 17 share. That 
was double last year's title match between Lindsay Davenport and 
Martina Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time that the U.S. Open women's final followed  
the men's semifinal matches. Usually, it is played between the two 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament was the highest-rated since 1991, posting a 4.1  
overnight rating, up 52 percent from last year's 2.7. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of television households tuned to a  
broadcast while the share is the percentage watching a program 
among those televisions in use at the time.

<HEADLINE> Students Learn Golf Schmoozing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGDALE, Ill. (AP) -- When Professor Dan Weilbaker dons a  
golf cap and glove and grabs a putter for a lecture, he doesn't 
have to yell ``Fore!'' to get attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Business Golf 101, as he calls it, goes over like a hole-in-one  
among his sales students at Northern Illinois University. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of American education might sneer about a college class  
on the dos and don'ts of behavior on the links. But this 
once-a-year seminar is no gimmick, insists the 51-year-old 
educator, who views a day on the links as a golden opportunity for 
a four-hour sales call. 
</P>
<P>
	A duffer with an MBA and a Ph.D. in marketing, Weilbaker says  
his one-day seminar provides a slice of the real world 
undergraduates don't usually get in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Academe often gets knocked for not providing students with  
real-world training,'' he said before the seminar last week at 
Indian Lakes Conference and Resort Center in this Chicago suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, this is as 'real world' as it gets if you want to pursue  
a career in sales,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Students start off in the classroom learning such musts as:  
Replace your divots. No wheelies in the golf cart. Don't let the 
customer win. And don't talk business -- for the first six holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they grab their clubs and practice with executives who work  
with Weilbaker -- and who sometimes are looking to hire. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveys have shown business in America is conducted frequently  
on the golf course. Still, when Weilbaker -- a one-time 
pharmaceuticals salesman and admitted golf fanatic -- had the 
brainstorm three years ago to offer Business Golf 101, a few 
eyebrows shot up around the campus in DeKalb. 
</P>
<P>
	Skepticism dissipated when word leaked that some of Weilbaker's  
students had been hired by the sales execs he enlisted to play with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, what college student could resist a day of free golf,  
free food and a day in the sun -- all in the name of education? 
</P>
<P>
	``If this was listed in the syllabus, there'd be a lot more  
people here,'' grinned Sean Kenney, a 22-year-old senior, nursing a 
beer during his round with recruiters from Eli Lilly and Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Many students didn't know a wedge from a hedge when they showed  
up. But initial jitters dissolved by the time they shook hands with 
their playing partners from the business world. 
</P>
<P>
	Students at the classroom lecture learned everything from the  
difference between a ``nassau'' and a ``bingo bango bongo'' -- golf 
wagers -- to when to make their sales pitch (not before the final 
six holes). 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, though, they were advised to try to strike up  
friendships that may come in handy later. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may close a big deal on the golf course,'' Weilbaker told  
them. ``But that shouldn't be your goal. You should be trying to 
make a relationship with a person that will enable you to close the 
deal later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, one student tried too hard.  
</P>
<P>
	Heather McLindsay, 21, who returned to the seminar this fall as  
a recruiter for Eli Lilly, recalls being so nervous that she 
blurted out her personal resume and desire to be hired by her 
playing partner before they even teed off. 
</P>
<P>
	The amused recruiter, Chuck Howlett, hired her anyway. Now, as a  
pharmaceuticals saleswoman, she's sometimes asked to take 
prospective clients to the golf course -- applying lessons learned 
from Business Golf 101. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get a lot better quality time with people on the golf  
course than in the office,'' explained Howlett.

<HEADLINE> Evidence of Ancient Disaster Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHELL, Wyo. (AP) -- A scientist has found fossil evidence of a  
large pileup of dinosaur bodies that suggests a possible natural 
disaster more than 140 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby Siber, director of a commercial dinosaur museum in Aathal,  
Switzerland, said the evidence is contained in a dig he has been 
working for the past decade near Shell, in northern Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Siber believes the dinosaur fossils represent a remarkable  
Jurassic catastrophe, such as a huge hurricane, flood or similar 
natural event. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the temporary richness of one trap in one river,''  
Siber said in Monday's editions of The Billings (Mont.) Gazette. 
``If there are dozens here, and we have proven that there are, then 
there are probably hundreds or even thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm starting to have visions of a huge catastrophe -- maybe  
still local, but something that covered an entire lowland in 
dimensions you wouldn't see in a single quarry today,'' Siber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siber's hypothesis has grown out of his 10 years of digging on a  
parcel of private land originally known as the Howe Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Wyoming paleontologist Brent Breithaupt said he,  
too, is intrigued by Siber's recent finds but hesitates to embrace 
any single explanation so soon. He said the attempt to date the 
fossils is critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``A quick, catastrophic explanation sometimes looks appealing,  
but it may not always be the right answer,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Florida Braces for Hurricane Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- As Hurricane Floyd neared the strength of a  
Category 5 storm today and headed west, thousands of coastal 
residents were ordered to evacuate and NASA began moving workers 
out of the low-lying Kennedy Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need people to get ready right now, not tonight, not  
tomorrow,'' said Joan Heller, a spokeswoman for Brevard County, 
which ordered tens of thousands of people living in mobile homes 
and coastal areas to evacuate beginning at 4 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are different tracks that have been projected and we  
don't come out unscathed on any of them,'' Heller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush, whose family lived in Miami during Hurricane  
Andrew in 1992, declared a state of emergency. That gives him the 
authority to deploy the state's National Guard and allows him to 
seize property, order evacuations and suspend tolls on the 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary. It's very scary,'' Bush said. ``Andrew hit Miami  
in the middle of the night and it was haunting. This is as strong 
and ... three times bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a change in the hurricane's course, NASA planned to  
close down the Kennedy Space Center by midnight, and the center's 
approximately 12,500 workers began evacuating. The space is only 9 
feet above sea level, so a storm surge as well as wind could be 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, forecasters warned NASA of the possibility of 150  
mph wind on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to live and hope -- that's what it's going to  
take,'' NASA spokesman George Diller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents who lived through Andrew were taking no chances. Sue  
Willey had her 17-year-old son, Clayton, stay home to board up 
their home in Homestead, which survived the brunt of Andrew. The 
two stopped by a hardware store to buy caulking to keep out water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our house looks like Fort Knox,'' Clayton said.  
</P>
<P>
	The National Hurricane Center said Floyd was 470 miles  
east-southeast of Miami this afternoon, with wind around the eye 
blowing at 155 mph. A hurricane watch was extended from the Miami 
area into southeastern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the storm was expected to turn before making a  
landfall in that area, its hurricane-force wind could still rake 
the coast by the middle of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents along 35 miles of the Georgia coast also began bracing  
for Floyd, and National Park Rangers on Cumberland Island, the 
exclusive resort spot where John F. Kennedy Jr. got married, met 
today to decide whether to evacuate 89 campers and visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm. A storm  
of that strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale has top sustained wind 
of more than 156 mph and is capable of causing extreme damage. Only 
two category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States since records 
have been kept: the so-called Labor Day hurricane of 1935, which 
slammed the Florida Keys and killed 423, and Camille, which killed 
256 people along the Gulf Coast and in Virginia in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hurricane Andrew struck southern Miami-Dade County in 1992,  
it was a Category 4 storm with 150 mph sustained wind and 200 mph 
gusts. It killed 26 people, made 160,000 homeless and caused damage 
estimated at $25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew's hurricane-force wind extended out about 25 or 30 miles.  
By comparison, Floyd's hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles 
north and east of its center, said Todd Kimberlain, a forecaster at 
the hurricane center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would send hurricane-force winds over much of Florida,  
depending on its exact track,'' Kimberlain said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time NASA had to go through such drastic precautions  
was for Hurricane Erin in 1995. That came ashore with sustained 
wind of 85 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the shuttles are in the shuttle hangar, which is  
designed to withstand wind of only up to 105 mph. A fourth is in 
the 525-foot-high Vehicle Assembly Building, which is designed to 
withstand wind of up to 125 mph. Four multimillion-dollar rockets 
stood on launch pads and can't be moved. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was moving due west at nearly 14 mph today, but was  
expected to begin gradually turning by evening, initially taking a 
west-northwest course. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's path depends on a weather system over the central United  
States. A ridge of high pressure has been blocking Floyd and 
forcing it to move almost due west, but a low-pressure system 
moving east could weaken the high pressure.

<HEADLINE>  Florida Braces for Hurricane Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- As Hurricane Floyd neared the strength of a  
Category 5 storm today and headed west, thousands of coastal 
residents were ordered to evacuate and NASA began moving workers 
out of the low-lying Kennedy Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need people to get ready right now, not tonight, not  
tomorrow,'' said Joan Heller, a spokeswoman for Brevard County, 
which ordered tens of thousands of people living in mobile homes 
and coastal areas to evacuate beginning at 4 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are different tracks that have been projected and we  
don't come out unscathed on any of them,'' Heller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush, whose family lived in Miami during Hurricane  
Andrew in 1992, declared a state of emergency. That gives him the 
authority to deploy the state's National Guard and allows him to 
seize property, order evacuations and suspend tolls on the 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary. It's very scary,'' Bush said. ``Andrew hit Miami  
in the middle of the night and it was haunting. This is as strong 
and ... three times bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a change in the hurricane's course, NASA planned to  
close down the Kennedy Space Center by midnight, and the center's 
approximately 12,500 workers began evacuating. The space is only 9 
feet above sea level, so a storm surge as well as wind could be 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, forecasters warned NASA of the possibility of 150  
mph wind on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to live and hope -- that's what it's going to  
take,'' NASA spokesman George Diller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents who lived through Andrew were taking no chances. Sue  
Willey had her 17-year-old son, Clayton, stay home to board up 
their home in Homestead, which survived the brunt of Andrew. The 
two stopped by a hardware store to buy caulking to keep out water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our house looks like Fort Knox,'' Clayton said.  
</P>
<P>
	The National Hurricane Center said Floyd was 470 miles  
east-southeast of Miami this afternoon, with wind around the eye 
blowing at 155 mph. A hurricane watch was extended from the Miami 
area into southeastern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the storm was expected to turn before making a  
landfall in that area, its hurricane-force wind could still rake 
the coast by the middle of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents along 35 miles of the Georgia coast also began bracing  
for Floyd, and National Park Rangers on Cumberland Island, the 
exclusive resort spot where John F. Kennedy Jr. got married, met 
today to decide whether to evacuate 89 campers and visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm. A storm  
of that strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale has top sustained wind 
of more than 156 mph and is capable of causing extreme damage. Only 
two category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States since records 
have been kept: the so-called Labor Day hurricane of 1935, which 
slammed the Florida Keys and killed 423, and Camille, which killed 
256 people along the Gulf Coast and in Virginia in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hurricane Andrew struck southern Miami-Dade County in 1992,  
it was a Category 4 storm with 150 mph sustained wind and 200 mph 
gusts. It killed 26 people, made 160,000 homeless and caused damage 
estimated at $25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew's hurricane-force wind extended out about 25 or 30 miles.  
By comparison, Floyd's hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles 
north and east of its center, said Todd Kimberlain, a forecaster at 
the hurricane center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would send hurricane-force winds over much of Florida,  
depending on its exact track,'' Kimberlain said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time NASA had to go through such drastic precautions  
was for Hurricane Erin in 1995. That came ashore with sustained 
wind of 85 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the shuttles are in the shuttle hangar, which is  
designed to withstand wind of only up to 105 mph. A fourth is in 
the 525-foot-high Vehicle Assembly Building, which is designed to 
withstand wind of up to 125 mph. Four multimillion-dollar rockets 
stood on launch pads and can't be moved. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was moving due west at nearly 14 mph today, but was  
expected to begin gradually turning by evening, initially taking a 
west-northwest course. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's path depends on a weather system over the central United  
States. A ridge of high pressure has been blocking Floyd and 
forcing it to move almost due west, but a low-pressure system 
moving east could weaken the high pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	If this high-pressure ridge does weaken, the storm could move  
north, making it less of a threat to the Miami-Dade area -- but more 
worrisome elsewhere. Depending on its exact track, it could also 
threaten the Carolinas or even New England, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther out in the Atlantic, storm Gert reached hurricane  
strength today, with 75 mph wind at late morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Gert's center was located about 1,400 miles east of the Leeward  
Islands. It was moving west near 20 mph.

<HEADLINE>  Saints Wait For Williams' Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The New Orleans Saints have keyed everything  
from their offensive game plan to their marketing plan around Ricky 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they're waiting again to see if the running back they traded  
eight draft picks for can play or if he'll be sidelined with 
another ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Realistically, I'd love to have him and he wants to play bad,  
believe me,'' Saints coach Mike Ditka said Monday. ``But if he's 
not 100 percent, it's probably best to hold him out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' NFL regular season debut consisted of 10 carries for  
40 yards in the Saints' 19-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers. 
He had made his two biggest gains of the game, runs of 7 and 8 
yards, when a tackle by Panthers cornerback Eric Davis sent him 
hobbling to the sidelines trying not to put weight on his left 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays showed Williams sprained his left ankle, the same one  
that sidelined him for most of the preseason, but in a different 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had nine carries in the Saints' first exhibition game  
before a player landed on his left ankle inflicting the high ankle 
sprain. Sunday's sprain is lower and not as severe, team officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the examination on Sunday, Williams' ankle was retaped and  
he did not appear to limp. He returned to the sideline in the 
second half and obviously tried to convince the trainer and coaches 
to let him return to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no reason to put him back into the game,'' Ditka  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams will be listed as questionable for Sunday's game in San  
Francisco, Ditka said. If he is not healthy, Ditka would rather 
hold out Williams, since the Saints are off the following week and 
it would give Williams two weeks to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
	``One game is not a career,'' Ditka said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams' contract is laden with incentives. The major ones kick  
in if he gains 1,600 yards and scores 12 touchdowns. But that's not 
the motivation that kept the Heisman Trophy winner pacing the 
sidelines on Sunday looking to return, Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about incentives, it's about honor,'' Ditka said.  
</P>
<P>
	With a recording blaring ``Run Ricky Run,'' Williams received a  
standing ovation when he was introduced before the game and a 
second one when he tried to return after his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	With him out of the lineup, players and coaches said they sensed  
a letdown. Williams noticed it as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came out, the defense started giving up a couple of  
yards, and the offense had a little trouble,'' Williams said. 
``That was the main thing why I wanted to get back into the game, 
so I could lift up the crowd and my teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he only played into the second quarter Sunday, Williams  
said he felt at home in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd be more nervous on the first carry,'' he said.  
``But I got a good little crease and picked up 4 yards. It gave me 
a lot of confidence for my next nine carries.''

<HEADLINE> Seahawks' Brown May Play vs. Bears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Chad Brown, who left the field in an  
ambulance with a neck injury in Seattle's opener, may be able to 
play in the Seahawks' second game in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown ran with his teammates on Monday and coach Mike Holmgren  
sounded optimistic about having his Pro Bowl linebacker available 
for the Bears' game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a chance he can play this week,'' Holmgren said.  
``Fortunately, he's going to be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown tore a ligament in his neck when his helmet collided with  
teammate Phillip Daniels' hip in a pileup late in the first half of 
the 28-20 loss to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a seven-year pro, left the field with his neck  
immobilized. 
</P>
<P>
	``The encouraging thing to me all along was that his legs were  
moving and his arms were moving,'' Holmgren said. ``I've been in 
those situations, too, where nothing moves. That's the frightening 
thing. But anytime a player is prone on the ground like that you 
get nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown could not move his neck and his head as he lay on the  
Kingdome's AstroTurf. He was taken to Harborview Medical Center, 
where X-rays of his neck were negative. Then he was released. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown had a stiff neck on Monday, but otherwise felt fine.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty good,'' he said. ``I'm stiff and I'm sore. I can't  
look to my right or to my left very quickly. But considering how 
bad things could have been, I feel pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said Brown could play in Chicago if his neck was not  
stiff. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's still stiff and he can't move his neck, then he can't  
play,'' Holmgren said. ``But if can loosen that thing up during the 
week, he can play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Brown's injury, the Seahawks lost four other  
players, including backup cornerback and special teams player Fred 
Thomas, who fractured his right fibula. Thomas underwent surgery 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Weiner, who was the retired Howard Ballard's replacement as  
a starter at right tackle in the offensive line, had a high ankle 
sprain and a bone chip by the ankle joint in his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Jordan, a starting receiver on Sunday, pulled his left  
hamstring and rookie special teams player and reserve fullback 
Dustin Johnson received a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas could be lost for the season, but Holmgren said no  
decision has been made about putting him on the injured list yet. 
He initially listed Thomas' injury as one that could keep him out 
8-to-10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiner, Jordan and Johnson are expected to be sidelined about  
six weeks each.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Won't Rule on Kerouac Will </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court reversed itself  
and has decided not to get involved in the fight over the estate of 
Beat writer Jack Kerouac, paving the way for another lawsuit over 
the estate to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerouac biographer Gerald Nicosia said Monday that the court's  
decision, made Thursday, probably will stop a lawsuit by the 
author's daughter, the late Jan Kerouac, to recover a part of her 
father's estate and house his literary archives in a university 
library. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted that much of the material would be sold piecemeal  
to collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just went out the back door. It is an unbelievable act of  
cowardice,'' Nicosia said of the court. ``Jan Kerouac's dream will 
be gone of having a Kerouac museum and Kerouac archives. It's 
utterly lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Kerouac's estate includes unpublished manuscripts,  
journals, thousands of letters as well as the house in Florida 
where he lived at the time of his death. The estate could be worth 
as much as $20 million, according to Nicosia. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerouac is best known for the 1957 classic, ``On the Road.'' He  
died of liver failure in 1969, at age 47. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kerouac's daughter died in Albuquerque in 1996, she was in  
the middle of a lawsuit in Florida contesting the will of her 
grandmother, Gabrielle Kerouac. 
</P>
<P>
	The disputed will left the writer's property to his third wife,  
Stella Sampas Kerouac. When she died in 1990, the writer's estate 
was put in the hands of her brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Kerouac contended the signature of her grandmother was  
forged. If the disputed will was invalidated, then Jan Kerouac's 
estate would have received one-third of her father's estate. Her 
cousin would get one-third and the Sampas family in Massachusetts 
would retain one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court had been asked to sort out the powers of  
representatives of Jan Kerouac's estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Her ex-husband, John Lash, was made ``general executor'' of her  
estate and he wants to settle the Florida lawsuit with the Sampas 
family to avoid an expensive court fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicosia, the ``literary personal representative or executor'' of  
her estate, wanted the Supreme Court to determine that he was in 
charge of the lawsuit because it involved disputed rights to 
Kerouac's literary materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the high court heard arguments from lawyers in the  
case. It gave no explanation for its one-page order, which left in 
place a 1998 ruling by the New Mexico Court of Appeals that said 
Lash had sole authority in deciding how to handle the Florida 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Lash, who lives in Belgium, had asked a Florida court to dismiss  
the lawsuit. After Nicosia objected, a Florida judge asked the New 
Mexico courts to clarify who is representing Jan Kerouac's estate 
in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceedings in the Florida lawsuit have been on hold pending the  
outcome of the New Mexico case. 
</P>
<P>
	David Reynolds, an Albuquerque lawyer for Lash, did not return a  
telephone call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Rams Waive FB Derrick Harris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Fullback Derrick Harris, who lost his starting  
job to second-year player Robert Holcombe in training camp, was 
waived Monday by the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams also waived defensive tackle Paul Grasmanis and  
cornerback Clifton Crosby, signed defensive tackle Nate 
Hobgood-Chittick, and re-signed running back Chad Levitt and safety 
Ron Carpenter, who were among the final cuts before the season 
opener. They also released linebacker Byron Jones from the practice 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, a sixth-round draft pick in 1996 out of Miami, started  
14 games last year. He also started six games in his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holcombe, who made a few starts at running back last year,  
was more valuable in the offense. Holcombe bulked up to compete for 
the fullback job. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams also consider 270-pound James Hodgins, who made the  
team as an undrafted free agent, to be a better prospect. Hodgins 
was recommended to Vermeil by longtime friend John Ralston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a young kid who has the potential to be a very good  
player if given the opportunity, and he's 270 pounds,'' coach Dick 
Vermeil said. ``James, we think, is a young ascending player that 
will provide us excellent backup quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt's value is he can play either running back position.  
Carpenter, who made several impressive plays in the preseason, can 
play either safety position and also has value on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams might try to re-sign Crosby to the practice squad if he  
clears waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil said the Rams weren't disappointed in Grasmanis, who was  
with the team only six days. But the team was impressed this summer 
in Hobgood-Chittick during scrimmages with the Colts, who released 
him last week.

<HEADLINE>  College Player Dies From Leukemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charles Hayward, a basketball player at  
North Carolina Charlotte, died after a two-year fight with 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward, 21, who was originally diagnosed prior to the 1997-98  
season, died Sunday at UNC Hospital in Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was declared in remission in April 1998, Hayward had a  
tattoo of a wolf with the word ``Survivor'' inscribed on his right 
arm. But he suffered a relapse in December 1998, and underwent a 
bone marrow transplant in April 1999, with his brother, Eric, the 
donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Complications arose in July when Hayward's body began rejecting  
that transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all very deeply saddened by Charles' passing,'' UNC  
Charlotte men's basketball coach Bobby Lutz said. ``I'm personally 
thankful for the opportunity to have known him. He was one of the 
most courageous young men I've ever had the pleasure of being 
around and he was an inspiration to all of us for the past two 
years and even in his passing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward, the top signee in 49ers' basketball history, missed his  
freshman season in 1997-98 because of the disease and chemotherapy. 
Once in remission, he rebuilt his strength and rejoined the team 
for the beginning of the 1998-99 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 forward played in the first 10 games of the season,  
averaging 2.9 points and 3.5 rebounds in 15.9 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his mother, Janice Harrell, four brothers and  
sisters: Eric, Janell, Tony and Tiffany Hayward; and his 
grandparents, Charles and Ida Mae Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Wednesday at UNC  
Charlotte's Halton Arena.

<HEADLINE>  College Player Dies From Leukemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charles Hayward, a basketball player at  
North Carolina Charlotte, died after a two-year fight with 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward, 21, who was originally diagnosed prior to the 1997-98  
season, died Sunday at UNC Hospital in Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was declared in remission in April 1998, Hayward had a  
tattoo of a wolf with the word ``Survivor'' inscribed on his right 
arm. But he suffered a relapse in December 1998, and underwent a 
bone marrow transplant in April 1999, with his brother, Eric, the 
donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Complications arose in July when Hayward's body began rejecting  
that transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all very deeply saddened by Charles' passing,'' UNC  
Charlotte men's basketball coach Bobby Lutz said. ``I'm personally 
thankful for the opportunity to have known him. He was one of the 
most courageous young men I've ever had the pleasure of being 
around and he was an inspiration to all of us for the past two 
years and even in his passing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward, the top signee in 49ers' basketball history, missed his  
freshman season in 1997-98 because of the disease and chemotherapy. 
Once in remission, he rebuilt his strength and rejoined the team 
for the beginning of the 1998-99 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 forward played in the first 10 games of the season,  
averaging 2.9 points and 3.5 rebounds in 15.9 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his mother, Janice Harrell, four brothers and  
sisters: Eric, Janell, Tony and Tiffany Hayward; and his 
grandparents, Charles and Ida Mae Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Wednesday at UNC  
Charlotte's Halton Arena.

	Massive Hurricane Threatens Bahamas, Fla.  
</P>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd was on the verge of  
becoming a Category 5 storm -- the most powerful designation for a 
hurricane -- and was predicted to hit the Bahamas overnight, and 
possibly hit Florida by Wednesday. Bahamas residents abandoned 
beachfront homes and scrambled for emergency supplies in 
preparation for the 155 mph winds. More than 1 million Americans 
were told to evacuate the Atlantic coast Monday, and NASA all but 
abandoned Cape Canaveral. Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of 
emergency in Florida, giving him the authority to activate the 
National Guard and allowing the state to order evacuations. By 
comparison, Hurricane Andrew was a Category 4 storm when it struck 
South Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and causing an estimated 
$25 billion in damage.

	Democrat Criticizes Former Waco Probe  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The congressional Republican leading an  
inquiry into the 1993 Waco siege overlooked evidence the Justice 
Department sent his committee four years ago showing federal agents 
used potentially incendiary tear gas near the fiery end of the 
Branch Davidian standoff, a House Democrat said. ``Contrary to the 
allegations of cover-up, substantial evidence of the use of 
military tear gas rounds was, in fact, provided to Congress in 
1995,'' said Waxman, D-Calif., the committee's top Democrat.

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian rescue workers and firefighters picked  
their way through debris after an explosion -- possibly caused by a 
bomb -- pulverized an eight-story apartment building in Moscow 
Monday, killing at least 73 people. More than 200 people have died 
in explosions in Russia during the past two weeks. Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin linked the two latest blasts to fighting in 
the southern Russian region of Dagestan, where government troops 
are battling Islamic rebels who have occupied several villages.

<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- President Clinton said the  
international peacekeeping force headed for East Timor, which will 
probably include ``a few hundred'' Americans, would hopefully begin 
its work in a matter of days. Clinton urged Indonesian leaders to 
act responsibly until a force can be assembled and sent to East 
Timor under Australian leadership. Clinton also welcomed a 
tentative deal reached with North Korea in Berlin under which, ``we 
understand and expect North Korea will refrain from testing 
long-range missiles of any kind'' while a firmer accord is 
negotiated. He said he was considering easing trade sanctions 
against North Korea.

	Coast Guard Fires at Drug Boats  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Coast Guard officials today disclosed that  
sharpshooters have been firing from helicopters to knock out the 
engines of cocaine-laden boats in the Caribbean. The tactic -- one 
not used since the 1920s Prohibition era -- has already netted three 
tons of cocaine. ``We have made the drug smugglers afraid. We will 
now make them disappear,'' said Barry McCaffrey, White House drug 
control director.

	EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Israelis and Palestinians today  
opened talks on a final peace accord, intending to tackle issues 
like Palestinian statehood, the rights of refugees and the status 
of Jerusalem. The Palestinians want to establish a state in all of 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with east Jerusalem as its capital. 
Israel says it will never relinquish parts of Jerusalem, which it 
insists will remain the undivided capital of the Jewish state.

	PARIS (AP) -- A fierce, two-month takeover battle between French  
oil companies Total Fina and Elf Aquitaine ended today, as a $54.3 
billion merger agreement was reached to create the world's fourth 
largest oil group. The friendly deal caps a summer of intense

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended a lackluster session today with  
mixed results as investors stepped back from Friday's rally in 
technology shares. The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 1.90 
at 11,030.33. But broader stock indicators were lower. On the NYSE, 
losers led gainers 1,753-1,220. The Nasdaq fell 42.29 to 2,844.77.

</P>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A construction accident will push back the  
Milwaukee Brewers' first game in the new Miller Park to April 2001, 
a year later than its scheduled opening day, stadium board 
officials said today. The ballpark was originally slated to make 
its debut with the Brewers' first home game in April 2000. Robert 
Decker, a vice president for the firm, said a 2000 opening was 
immediately ruled out because the manpower and materials needed for 
the job could not be pulled together that quickly.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Strengthens, Nears Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd strengthened to a very  
dangerous Category 4 storm today with 155 mph wind, surprising 
forecasters and charging toward the Bahamas on a path that also 
threatened the Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain started falling in parts of the Bahamas today as  
residents scrambled for emergency supplies, shelters opened, 
schools closed and shop owners boarded up windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandatory evacuations were ordered in exposed coastal areas of  
both the Bahamas and Florida's Brevard County. Workers also started 
leaving NASA's Kennedy Space Center, on a barrier island standing 
only 9 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been this scared about a storm,'' said Bahamas  
resident Angel Chea, manager of a graphics shop, as she boarded up 
her windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need people to get ready right now, not tonight, not  
tomorrow,'' said Joan Heller, a spokeswoman for Brevard County. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of uncertainty about the huge storm's path, a hurricane  
watch area on the mainland was expanded today, reaching all the way 
from the Miami area northward into Georgia, the U.S. National 
Hurricane Center said in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's capable of almost catastrophic destruction,'' said Todd  
Kimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd had top sustained wind today of nearly 155 mph. That put  
it on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm, which features top 
sustained wind of more than 156 mph and is capable of causing 
extreme damage. By comparison, Hurricane Andrew had Category 4 
status when it struck south Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and 
causing an estimated $25 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the hurricane center said little additional  
strengthening was likely by midday Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two Category 5 hurricanes have struck the United States  
since record-keeping began, the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, which 
destroyed the railroad connecting the Florida Keys to the mainland 
and killed 423 people, and Camille in 1969, which killed 256 people 
along the Gulf Coast and in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	If Floyd continued on a track toward central Florida, NASA  
planned to shut down the Kennedy Space Center by midnight tonight, 
leaving none of its 12,500 workers behind to ride out the storm. 
The center is only 9 feet above sea level, so a storm surge as well 
as wind could be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	All four space shuttles were in hangars, but four  
multimillion-dollar rockets were on launch pads and couldn't be 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the northwest and central Bahamian islands were under  
hurricane warnings today. A tropical storm warning was posted for 
the southeastern Bahamas and the nearby British Turks and Caicos 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane watch on the mainland was extended from the Miami  
area northward all the way to near Brunswick, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of the watch area, Florida's Brevard County  
ordered tens of thousands of people living in mobile homes and 
coastal areas to evacuate beginning at 4 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are different tracks that have been projected and we  
don't come out unscathed on any of them,'' said Brevard County 
spokeswoman Joan Heller. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m., Floyd's center was about 90 miles east of San  
Salvador in the central Bahamas, and about 470 miles east-southeast 
of Miami. It was headed west at nearly 15 mph, and was expected to 
gradually turn to a west-northwesterly-heading by evening, with a 
further turn toward the northwest on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles from its center with  
tropical storm-force wind stretching outward up to 290 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters estimated storm surge conditions could reach 15 to  
20 feet for the northwest Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd grew unexpectedly into a monster of a storm on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect such a very fast intensification,'' said Jerry  
Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center. ``This is a 
real surprise for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Far out at sea, Gert strengthened into a hurricane today with  
sustained wind increasing to 75 mph. At 11 a.m. EDT, Gert's center 
was about 1,400 miles east of the Leeward Islands. It was moving 
toward the west at nearly 20 mph.

<HEADLINE> 'Ally McBeal,' 'Practice' Top Emmys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The verdict is in: ``The Practice'' and  
``Ally McBeal,'' two shows about the courtroom and bedroom antics 
of lawyers, were judged television's best series at the 51st annual 
Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The evening was a virtual lovefest for David E. Kelley, who  
created both series and writes many episodes. In an unprecedented 
ending, Kelley closed the awards Sunday with back-to-back 
acceptance speeches, first for ``The Practice'' as best drama, then 
for ``Ally McBeal'' for best comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	No producer had ever won both comedy and drama Emmys the same  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the evening, Michael Badalucco and Holland Taylor,  
``Practice'' regulars who won awards for best supporting actor and 
actress in a drama, sang his praises, while Kelley returned the 
kind words to his casts and crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone was going to ask me the fastest or best way to win  
an Emmy, I'd say write a script and get Calista Flockhart to say 
the words,'' Kelley said of his ``Ally McBeal'' star. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley has a track record to back up the assertion: He was  
executive producer of ``L.A. Law'' and creator of ``Picket 
Fences,'' past winners of the drama series Emmy. 
</P>
<P>
	Flockhart was nominated for best actress in a comedy but lost to  
Helen Hunt, who took home her fourth straight award for ``Mad About 
You,'' which finished its seven-year run last season. She matched a 
record held by John Larroquette, who had won four years in a row as 
best supporting actor for ``Night Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Lithgow won best actor in a comedy for ``3rd Rock From the  
Sun,'' Edie Falco won best actress in a drama for ``The Sopranos'' 
and Dennis Franz won his fourth award for best actor in a drama for 
``NYPD Blue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know why I have won this. As far as I can tell  
every actor in this town thinks what I do on '3rd Rock' is 
completely disgraceful,'' Lithgow joked. ``I'm embarrassed 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franz beat former co-star Jimmy Smits, whose character Bobby  
Simone died in a tearful farewell when Smits departed the show 
after five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The award came as a surprise, because he'd expected co-star  
Smits to win, said Franz, who plays the surly but lovable detective 
Andy Sipowicz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accept this along with you, along with the other nominees,''  
Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanking her family watching back on Long Island, Falco flashed  
her jewelry so her relatives could ``see all this stuff. All this 
glittery stuff,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is absolutely the most surreal experience I could ever  
even have imagined,'' said Falco, who won for her role as a mob 
wife. ``I don't even know where I am, and I haven't eaten since six 
this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the show, Kelley said he had thought HBO's critically and  
popularly acclaimed mob series might walk away with the award for 
best drama. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really felt it was `The Sopranos' year,'' Kelley said.  
``There seemed to be so much heat around that show and so different 
than the storytelling we'd seen before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos'' earned 16 nominations, the most of any  
contender, but walked away with just four awards. In addition to 
Falco's, the others were for best drama series writing and two in 
technical categories. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kelley accepted the award for best comedy, he even joked  
that he thought his previous prize for best drama might be handed 
to the HBO series instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said backstage, 'You got to go back out, you got to go  
back out,''' Kelley said. ``And I thought there had been a mistake, 
'The Sopranos' had won drama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Holland and Badalucco gushed about Kelly in accepting their  
awards for supporting actress and actor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The words of David Kelley are an inspiration to me,'' said  
Badalucco, who plays lawyer Jimmy Berluti in ``The Practice.'' 
``Thank you, David, for Jimmy and for being such a nice guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who plays a sex-obsessed judge on ``The Practice,''  
thanked Kelley ``for giving me the chariot to ride up here on: A 
woman who puts a flag on the moon for women over 40, who can think, 
who can work, who are successes, who can cook, and who can cook!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kristen Johnston of ``3rd Rock From the Sun'' was named best  
supporting actress in a comedy and David Hyde Pierce won the 
supporting actor's honor for ``Frasier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce and Jenna Elfman of ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' hosted the show  
aired by Fox, which came in at just under three hours.

<HEADLINE> Conductor Dies in Ark. Train Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICKES, Ark. (AP) -- The conductor of a loaded coal train was  
killed Monday when the southbound train ran into another in 
southwestern Arkansas, causing a derailment. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Ronnie Taylor, 26, was found beneath piles of coal  
five hours after the 4:30 a.m. accident. A spokesman for the Kansas 
City Railway said the man jumped out of the locomotive before it 
crashed but that derailed cars landed on top of him. 
</P>
<P>
	The train's engineer suffered a broken arm and was treated and  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said a coal train pulled by four engines slammed  
into the rear of a stopped coal train about a mile north of Wickes. 
The parked train was heading for Welsh, Texas, while the other was 
heading to a plant near Lake Charles, La. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred near the Arkansas-Oklahoma border 120  
miles west of Little Rock.

<HEADLINE> Trial Begins for Hornets Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets owner George Shinn was  
in court Monday for the start of a trial in which he is accused of 
sexually assaulting a woman at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury of nine men and three women were selected for the civil  
trial, which Circuit Judge Costa Pleicones said could take more 
than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn contends the sex with was consensual and his lawyers have  
tried to portray Leslie Price as promiscuous. Her lawyers have 
testimony from a former Hornets cheerleader who says she had a 
sexual relationship with Shinn because he threatened to fire her. 
</P>
<P>
	Price sued in February 1998, saying she met Shinn through his  
nephew. She and the nephew were at a center in Charlotte, N.C., 
that treats patients for drug and alcohol abuse and behavioral 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Price alleges Shinn took her to his lakeside house in suburban  
Tega Cay, just over the South Carolina line, on the pretext of 
meeting his lawyer, Bill Diehl, to discuss a domestic dispute with 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Price said Diehl was not there, but she alleges that while on a  
tour of the house, Shinn stopped in the bedroom, shoved her onto 
the bed and tried to rape her while she repeatedly screamed ``No!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn then forced her into oral sex, the suit said.  
</P>
<P>
	Criminal investigators at first decided not to press charges but  
now are taking another look at the case. Prosecutor Tommy Pope said 
last week he would decide on reopening the case until the trial is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn has since been divorced by his wife and has moved to  
Florida.

<HEADLINE>  Uruguayans Mourn Gonzalo Rodriguez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) -- Defying a cold rain, thousands of  
Uruguayans said goodbye Monday to compatriot Gonzalo Rodriguez, the 
promising 27-year-old race car driver killed in a weekend crash at 
California's Laguna Seca Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains of the hometown hero were flown here for burial  
Monday, two days after the crash in which Rodriguez' car hit a 
concrete wall at about 140 mph during practice for the Shell 300. A 
first-year driver, Rodriguez was the first driver fatality in the 
Cart Indy-car series since July 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The crashed stunned Uruguayans and dominated newspaper and  
television coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will never forget you,'' read one banner hoisted at a  
sports stadium after word of the crash spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Uruguayans wept as the cortege rolled through Montevideo, the  
capital. The slow-moving caravan swelled as private cars and 
motorcycles followed behind the column as it headed to a local 
cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Uruguay's president, Julio Mr. Sanguinetti, and his minister of  
education and culture were on hand for the burial ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez began gaining attention as a driver four years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	He had established himself as a regular in the European Formula  
3000 series, finishing third in the season points last year. In his 
only previous CART race, he started 16th and finished 12th in the 
Penske car at the Detroit Grand Prix in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez began racing in karts at 13 and also raced in Formula  
3 and Formula Fords. He had told local reports that he wasn't into 
racing for the money. ``It's my life, something bigger than 
myself,'' he told a local interviewer when he began racing 
professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	A private plane brought the remains to Montevideo's  
international airport early Monday. Rites included a Mass at the 
school Rodriguez attended. His coffin was cloaked in the flags of 
his school and country. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash occurred Saturday in Monterey, Calif., where Rodriguez  
died of massive head and neck injuries, authorities for the CART 
Indy-car FedEx Series said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez was approaching the famed corkscrew turn on the road  
course at Laguna Seca Raceway when his brakes locked and his car 
hurtled off the track, struck a tire barrier and slammed into a 
concrete wall behind the tires, then launched in the air before 
landing upside down. After Saturday's accident, team owner Roger 
Penske withdrew his team, including veteran driver Al Unser Jr., 
from the event.

	A private plane brought the remains to Montevideo's  
international airport early Monday. Rites included a Mass at the 
school Rodriguez attended. His coffin was cloaked in the flags of 
his school and country. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash occurred Saturday in Monterey, Calif., where Rodriguez  
died of massive head and neck injuries, authorities for the CART 
Indy-car FedEx Series said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez was approaching the famed corkscrew turn on the road  
course at Laguna Seca Raceway when his brakes locked and his car 
hurtled off the track, struck a tire barrier and slammed into a 
concrete wall behind the tires, then launched in the air before 
landing upside down. After Saturday's accident, team owner Roger 
Penske withdrew his team, including veteran driver Al Unser Jr., 
from the event.

<HEADLINE> Arbitrator Decision Delayed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As baseball prepared Monday for a big week of  
meetings, lawyers for owners and umpires again pushed back picking 
an arbitrator for their grievance. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Arbitration Association's Philadelphia office has  
given the sides a list of 15 arbitrators, and owners and umpires 
will take turns striking names until one remains. He becomes the 
arbitrator for this case. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners and umpires asked the AAA to find out how busy each of  
the 15 arbitrators is during the next 30-60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The arbitrator will decide whether owners legally accepted the  
resignations of 22 umpires earlier this month, or whether to order 
owners to rehire the 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners will try to convince the arbitrator that he has no  
authority to decide the case, claiming decisions of league 
presidents are final when it comes to hiring and firing umps. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's meetings begin Tuesday in New York, when owners and  
players hold their annual session on international play. Sandy 
Alderson, baseball's executive vice president of operations, said 
the meeting will look at plans for the 2000 and 2004 Olympics and 
for a possible World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	While professionals are being allowed in the Olympic baseball  
tournament for the first time, the 30 major league teams are 
providing only those players who are not on 40-man rosters. A World 
Cup would take place during the offseason and include major 
leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the focus shifts to Cooperstown, N.Y., for two  
days of owners meetings that will be dominated by franchise sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners are expected to approve the sale of control of the  
Cincinnati Reds from Marge Schott to Cincinnati businessman Carl 
Lindner and they may approve the proposed sale of the Oakland 
Athletics to a group headed by former team executive Andy Dolich. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposed sales of the Kansas City Royals and Montreal Expos also  
are on the agenda, but their status was unclear going into the 
two-day session. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners also will be briefed on the legal fight with umpires,  
whose strategy of mass resignations collapsed, and NL president Len 
Coleman's intention to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman concluded a proposed restructuring transferring umpires,  
player discipline and scheduling to Alderson would leave league 
presidents merely figureheads.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Charlotte Top Recruit Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charles Hayward never got a chance to  
live up to his billing as the top basketball recruit ever at North 
Carolina Charlotte. Leukemia changed those plans, and now the 
disease has taken his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward, 21, died late Sunday night at UNC Hospital in Chapel  
Hill, the school said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward was admitted to the hospital in April and underwent a  
bone marrow transplant. The donor was Eric Hayward, his older 
brother and a former basketball player at Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Complications arose in July when Hayward's body began rejecting  
the transplant, and his condition worsened considerably last 
Thursday, school officials said. Teammates, family members and 
coach Bobby Lutz spent the weekend visiting him in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all very deeply saddened by Charles' passing,'' Lutz  
said. ``I'm personally thankful for the opportunity to have known 
him. He was one of the most courageous young men I've ever had the 
pleasure of being around, and he was an inspiration to all of us 
for the past two years and even in his passing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university planned a memorial service for Wednesday  
afternoon at Halton Arena, the 49ers' homecourt. A funeral is 
scheduled for Friday in Hayward's hometown of Alexandria, La. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hayward came out of Louisiana in 1997, he was the highest  
rated recruit ever to sign with the 49ers. But North Carolina 
Charlotte's coaching staff noticed in preseason drills that the 
6-foot-8, 210-pound Hayward seemed constantly tired, so they sent 
him for a series of tests that showed the presence of acute myeloid 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward missed his freshman season while undergoing a series of  
chemotherapy treatments. The 49ers, meantime, advanced to the NCAA 
tournament, dedicating their season to Hayward and keeping a 
plastic seat cover with his name and number 45 on their bench at 
games, symbolically reserving a spot for their teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward was declared in remission in April 1998 and cleared to  
rejoin his teammates. He celebrated by getting a tattoo of a wolf 
with the word ``Survivor'' inscribed on his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
	He regained the 70 or so pounds he lost during chemotherapy and  
spent countless hours in the weight room, bulking up to 220 pounds 
and working himself back into playing shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward played 14 minutes in last year's season opener, scoring  
two points, grabbing four rebounds and blocking two shots. In the 
fourth game, Lutz increased Hayward's playing time to 24 minutes, 
and he responded with eight points, seven rebounds and a school 
freshman record six blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	But 10 games into the comeback, routine blood tests showed the  
leukemia had returned, and Hayward spent the Christmas holidays 
back in the hospital for more chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	The sleeve on the bench returned, and the 49ers won the  
Conference USA championship to again advance to the NCAA 
tournament. But unlike the previous year, when Hayward occasionally 
felt well enough to join his teammates for games while watching in 
street clothes, he spent most of his remaining days in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward's final averages were 15.9 minutes, 2.9 points and 3.5  
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The university has set up a fund to help defray the medical  
expenses Hayward's family faces. Hayward's mother, Janice Harrell, 
lost her job because she spent so much time in North Carolina with 
her son. 
</P>
<P>
	``Financially the family is not doing well,'' school spokesman  
Tom Whitestone said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his brother and mother, Hayward leaves two  
sisters, Janell and Tiffany Hayward; one brother, Tony Hayward, and 
his grandparents, Charles and Ida Mae Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	EDITORS: Contributions to the Charles Hayward Fund may be sent  
to: The Athletic Foundation, UNC Charlotte, 9201 University City 
Blvd., Charlotte, N.C., 28223.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Eyes General Instrument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Motorola Inc. is in talks to acquire General  
Instrument Corp., and Wall Street is expecting other bids to emerge 
for the leading provider of cable TV set-top boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition would be a coup for Motorola, giving the company  
a stronger position in the fast-growing ``broadband'' technology, 
which combines Internet, television, radio and telephone services. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola would pay about $10 billion in stock for General  
Instruments, according to reports Monday in The Wall Street Journal 
and the Los Angeles Times. A deal could be announced as early as 
this week, the papers reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The source familiar with the talks, who spoke with The  
Associated Press on condition of anonymity, confirmed the 
discussions Monday, but cautioned the talks could still fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
	General Instrument has long been the subject of takeover  
speculation on Wall Street and had been pursued unsuccessfully by 
Lucent Technologies Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp. A takeover of 
General Instruments may force other cable equipment makers to find 
partners, following the consolidation trend that is shrinking the 
number of cable TV operators. 
</P>
<P>
	Many General Instrument investors were disappointed by reports  
that Motorola offered between 0.5 and 0.55 of a share of its stock 
for each share of General Instrument. That would value General 
Instrument at $45.19 to $49.71 a share, based on Monday's closing 
stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be surprised if the deal gets done at the price levels  
being discussed. I would be disappointed,'' said Jeff Parker, 
assistant portfolio manager for the PIMCO Target Fund, which owns 
about 500,000 shares of General Instruments. ``I would be shocked 
if another suitor doesn't appear over the next couple of days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of General Instrument fell by more than 5 percent, or by  
$2.81 1/4, to $49.68 3/4 a share Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, 
where Motorola's stock slid more than 8 percent, or by $8.25, to 
$90.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite dissatisfaction with the reported terms of a deal, many  
shareholders said an alliance between the two companies made 
strategic sense. 
</P>
<P>
	There are more than 65 million cable TV subscribers in the  
United States, and many cable companies like AT&AMP;T Corp. are 
spending tens of billions of dollars to install new set-top boxes 
for high-speed Internet access as well as television programming 
and other features. 
</P>
<P>
	General Instrument is the largest supplier of set-top boxes to  
TeleCommunications Inc., which is owned by AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola makes cable TV modems, as well as cellular phones,  
pagers, two-way radios and computer products. 
</P>
<P>
	``With AT&AMP;T now one of the largest cable operators out there, it  
absolutely makes sense for General Instrument to be part of a 
bigger organization with broader products to offer,'' Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., and General  
Instrument, of Horsham, Pa, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	For Motorola, the acquisition could put the company back on  
track. Motorola has drawn criticism for its hefty investment in 
Iridium, the high-profile satellite-phone company that filed for 
Bankruptcy Court protection last month.

<HEADLINE> Neighbors Wary in Child Abuse Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORCO, Calif. (AP) -- For years, neighbors thought something was  
amiss at 1531 Elm Dr. But until last week, no one dared cross the 
vaguely drawn line that separates a good neighbor from a meddlesome 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	When finally summoned Tuesday, paramedics found a little girl  
chained to a bed in a darkened room so filled with trash and feces 
that her mother tried to blanket the putrid smell with baby powder. 
</P>
<P>
	So repulsive was the home in this rural Southern California  
town, officials said, that rescuers brought the girl out through a 
window to avoid walking back in the stench. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have given anything in the world to be wrong,'' said  
DeVora Antisdel, a former Elm Drive resident who finally made the 
call that led to the girl's rescue. ``Unfortunately, it's all too 
real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics estimated that the girl, Betty, is about 6 years old.  
She was in fair condition at Loma Linda University Medical Center, 
said hospital spokeswoman Julie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The child's mother, Cindi Sue Topper, and her grandfather, Loren  
Bess, remained in custody at a Riverside County jail on $250,000 
bail each. They have pleaded innocent to felony charges of torture, 
child endangerment and false imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's officials say Topper told authorities that Betty had  
been chained to the bed off and on for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the rescue, neighbors recalled strange behavior by  
Topper, and said Bess was a recluse. But they said there were no 
obvious signs of neglect -- no screams or other loud noises coming 
from the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Inaction by neighbors is common in such cases, said retired  
University of Southern California psychology professor Ward 
Edwards. When someone calls authorities based only on suspicions, 
there is a good chance that nothing is out of place -- and a high 
probability of being ostracized as a nosy neighbor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``How much do you have to lose, how much you have to gain is  
crucial to every decision,'' Edwards said. ``It's hard to be a 
whistleblower. ... It's sort of like a home alarm system. How many 
times has it gone off, and how many times should it have gone 
off?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Aaron Hawkins didn't think about calling police because  
he didn't even believe the child existed. Topper, he said, ``just 
kept rambling on, over and over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that he knows about the girl and the neglect, Hawkins, 31,  
said it makes him angry. ``If I had known about that over there, 
they probably would've had to arrest me'' for hurting Topper or 
Bess. 
</P>
<P>
	Antisdel and her former landlord, David Beck, were among those  
who didn't want to jump to conclusions. But then Beck saw the 
little girl in a parking lot about a year ago and though she was 
clean, she seemed withdrawn. Beck began questioning everyone from 
the mail carrier to the garbage man. Nobody knew much. 
</P>
<P>
	They did know that Topper was attacked in 1983 by an  
ex-boyfriend in Santa Ana. He fatally shot her husband and then 
beat her with a claw hammer, pistol whipped her and cut her throat. 
She underwent two cranial surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	An Orange County prosecutor, Richard King, has said that a  
doctor or counselor found that the attack left Topper with ``the 
mental capacity of a fifth-grader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck admits he didn't want to be the one to call authorities  
even though neighbors already branded him the nosy one. Antisdel, 
who moved out of the area 70 miles east of Los Angeles a year ago, 
called. And she doesn't care what Elm Drive residents label her. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they say something to me, it's because of the guilt they're  
carrying around inside that they were so close and did nothing,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty, meanwhile, is now a ward of the county.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to get involved,'' Antisdel said. ``But you  
know, if there's a chance that there's a life there, are you 
willing to turn your back?''

<HEADLINE> Giants' Sehorn Is Set To Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New York Giants cornerback Jason  
Sehorn, sidelined in training camp with a hamstring injury, will 
practice on a limited basis on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn, who missed last season with a knee injury, participated  
in a few walk-through plays on Friday in the Giants' final workout 
before the season opener on Sunday against Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants coach Jim Fassel said Monday that Sehorn was a lot  
better, and a team spokesman announced that Sehorn would 
participate in Wednesday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants did not suffer any major injuries in Sunday's 17-13  
win over the Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, quarterback Kent Graham had his right thumb and the  
palm of his left hand both taped. He thought he injured them in the 
first quarter, but did not know on which play. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hands are a little sore, but I'll be ready to go on  
Wednesday,'' Graham said. ``I just have to get the swelling out of 
them now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham was 12-of-23 for 91 yards, no touchdowns and no  
interceptions in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough throwing it all day, but I was able to get  
through,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Fires at Drug Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Coast Guard sharpshooters have been firing  
from helicopters to knock out the engines of cocaine-laden boats in 
the Caribbean, officials disclosed Monday. The tactic -- one not 
used since the 1920s Prohibition era -- has already netted three 
tons of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The previously secret assaults have been used in recent weeks to  
stop smugglers who now use open-hull, low-profile boats called 
``Super Smugglers'' or ``Go-Fasts'' that carry barrels of fuel and 
about a ton of cocaine each. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of such boats has doubled since 1996, officials say, and  
they now carry more than 85 percent of all maritime drug shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Operation New Frontier'' has led to the capture of 13 crew  
members from four boats and more than three tons of cocaine 
destined for the U.S. market, said Barry McCaffrey, White House 
drug control director. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it and other anti-drug operations in the past year have  
brought cocaine confiscation to a record 53 tons, with a street 
value of $3.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made the drug smugglers afraid. We will now make them  
disappear,'' McCaffrey said at a news conference alongside one of 
the specially equipped MH90 Enforcer helicopters leased by the 
Coast Guard. The helicopter and a sleek Coast Guard chase craft 
were brought to the Transportation Department aboard flatbed 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the four ``Super Smugglers'' stopped so far were  
disabled in the last month. None of the four crews fired back, 
Coast Guard officials said, but U.S. agents are allowed to return 
lethal fire if they do. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest tactics include machine-gun fire across boats' bows,  
use of a ``stingball'' that explodes into a shower of rubber 
pellets and a special net that entangles a boat's engines. Using a 
sharpshooter is the Coast Guard's last resort to stop the boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpshooter Charlie Hopkins, nicknamed ``El Diablo'' because  
his .50-caliber Robar rifle bears the packing number 999, fired 
three shots Aug. 16 that disabled a vessel. Hopkins, 32, of 
Winslow, Maine, said he aims his laser targeting sight only at the 
speeding crafts' engines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still humanitarian. We just want to stop the flow,'' he  
said in an interview, noting that the each helicopter carries a 
life raft in case a boat is accidentally blown up or sunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Adm. James E. Loy, Coast Guard commandant, said there was no  
chance that commercial fishermen or pleasure boaters would be 
targeted by the sharpshooters, saying that identification and 
extensive warnings are required before aggressive tactics are 
employed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This special show is not going to be coming to a theater near  
you,'' he said in an effort to reassure private boaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who oversees the Coast  
Guard, said ``Operation New Frontier'' will lead to other high-tech 
interventions to counter drug smuggling. The Clinton administration 
is asking for $17.8 billion to fight illegal drugs next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials declined to provide further details of the new  
tactics. But a Coast Guard background briefing described the 
dramatic encounters and released videotape of two incidents that 
showed helicopters as they stopped speeding vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard is not believed to have authorized firing from  
the air to disable vessels since fixed-wing aircraft were used to 
chase down and stop shipments of illegal alcohol in the 1920s, 
according to the service's historian's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Loy said although the new tactics were not intended to kill or  
injure, they do put smugglers in increased danger. ``If there's a 
new risk on the part of the bad guys, that's terrific,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Go-Fasts'' represent a change in strategy for drug  
smugglers, who have seen a halt to big cargo flights out of 
Colombia, McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard's previous tactic, firing warning shots from the  
sea at the speedy boats, was ineffective, considering that 
smugglers average more than a trip a day between Colombia and 
Puerto Rico, Haiti or the Dominican Republic en route to the United 
States.

<HEADLINE> Syracuse Linebacker Sidelined 1 Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Syracuse easily defeated Central Michigan  
on Saturday night, and the Orangemen did it without senior 
linebacker Keith Bulluck, who served a one-game suspension for 
violating team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulluck said Monday that the punishment stemmed from his arrest  
last February for driving drunk in Cortland, about 30 miles south 
of Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletic department put down a one-game suspension, and  
this was the game that I missed,'' said Bulluck, who watched the 
game from the sidelines. ``It was going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the leader of the defense, Bulluck said watching Syracuse  
(2-0) defeat Central Michigan 47-7 was the worst part of the whole 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough watching my teammates prepare for the game and  
going to the game knowing that there was nothing wrong with me and 
I couldn't be out there to help my teammates,'' he said. ``I'm glad 
it's all over with, and I'm putting it behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they stopped Bulluck, of New City, after they saw  
his vehicle cross the center line. He was charged with DWI, driving 
with a suspended registration, driving an uninspected vehicle and 
aggravated unlicensed operation of a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was disposed of in March. Bulluck pleaded guilty to a  
lesser charge of driving while ability impaired, paid a $375 fine, 
and had his license suspended. He attended a drinking and driving 
program offered by the state Department of Motor Vehicles, and his 
license has since been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement after the incident, head coach Paul Pasqualoni  
said he was aware of the situation, and that he and his staff would 
determine how to handle it after it was settled in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulluck, who knew the punishment was coming, said he was told at  
the beginning of last week that he would not play against the 
Chippewas. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, senior Matt Klaus and freshman Clifton Smith got some  
important game experience and performed well, combining for 10 
tackles. Bulluck said his absence seemed to have a positive effect 
on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very proud of the way they played,'' said Bulluck, who  
led Syracuse in tackles last season and had 12 against Toledo in 
the season opener. ``That shows that we are a very stable unit, 
even without me.''

<HEADLINE> Man Seeking Heir Considers a Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A 79-year-old man seeking an heir for his  
$375,000 estate said Monday he'll give the cash to a church, as 
long as he gets some answers to spiritual questions first. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton Goward is inviting clergy from all faiths -- and anyone  
else who is interested -- to a forum on the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping someone there will enlighten me and I can feel  
better about facing eternity,'' Goward said. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Goward put a personal ad in the Star Tribune asking for  
ideas on what to do with his estate. Not being on good terms with 
his three adult sons, he said he had no worthy heirs.

<HEADLINE> Buffalo's Thomas Out Six Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Thurman Thomas, Buffalo's all-time  
leading rusher and most versatile player, will be sidelined for at 
least six weeks, coach Wade Phillips said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas bruised his liver and kidneys on the first play of the  
team's season-opening loss at Indianapolis when he reached up to 
catch a high pass from Doug Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, in his 12th season, has never missed more than two games  
in an NFL season. He missed consecutive games only once, when a 
hamstring injury slowed him in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 33, was hit in the ribs by Indianapolis cornerback  
Tyrone Poole. Thomas got up slowly and walked to the sidelines. He 
did not play again and spent the second half on the sideline in a 
shirt and tie watching the Bills lose to the Colts 31-14. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me feel sick to my stomach because I put the ball up  
there and it was a bad read and I didn't see the corner closing,'' 
Flutie said. ``That really frustrates me. Out of all the plays in 
that game, even the interception return for a touchdown, that 
bothers me more than anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie said he apologized to Thomas for the bad pass, and that  
Thomas told him that he also hadn't seen Poole closing in. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought he was wide open,'' Flutie said. ``He didn't see  
the corner out there either. 
</P>
<P>
	``My attitude was I'm sorry. His attitude was, `don't think  
twice about it.' It happens out there, and it does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas is ninth on the NFL's career rushing list with 11,786  
yards and needs 334 to catch Franco Harris, in eighth place. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to be careful he doesn't try to come back too soon,''  
said Buffalo receiver Andre Reed, one of three players along with 
Thomas and Bruce Smith remaining from the Bills' four Super Bowl 
teams. ``Sometimes people try to push you back on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who rushed for 381 yards in a reduced role last season,  
will be replaced by Jonathan Linton, who had five carries for 16 
yards and caught three passes for 42 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing Thomas threw the entire offense off.  
</P>
<P>
	``It hurt us in the passing game because he's the one that picks  
up the zone blitzes for us,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intending to feature Thomas in a pass-oriented attack, the Bills  
sputtered. They stumbled on the ground, finishing with 47 yards on 
15 carries. Flutie threw for 300 yards, but the Colts sacked him 
five times and picked off two of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's offensive line caved in and allowed no room to run.  
The starting back, Antowain Smith, finished with seven yards on six 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills abandoned the run, hoping Flutie could run and throw.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we could spread 'em out and move the football and  
score, and we just didn't do that,'' Phillips said.

	NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said Pat Buchanan  
would deliver ``a serious blow to the Republican Party'' by leaving 
the GOP for the Reform Party, but Hatch does not believe his 
Republican presidential rival will do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said Sunday he is close to seeking the Reform Party's  
presidential nomination because the Republican Party has abandoned 
its conservative principles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe Pat is going to leave. He's been such a strong  
Republican all these years,'' Hatch said Monday while campaigning 
in Nashua. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't blame him for dallying with it, but if he did, it  
would be a serious blow to the Republican party,'' he said. ``I 
think it would draw Republicans away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said he doesn't agree with Buchanan and others who argue  
Republicans have lost touch with their roots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some leaders have moved away from where we should  
be,'' he said. ``There are some who have, but I don't think the 
people have.''

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Publisher Steve Forbes, in a dramatic  
shift in tactics since the last presidential campaign, released a 
list Monday of organizational leaders in each of Iowa's 99 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said the achievement ``is an organizational milestone for  
my campaign'' that he contends solidifies his standing as a serious 
contender for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The list ranges from small-town mayors to local ministers and  
bears evidence that Forbes has put in place a solid organizational 
structure. It's a far different approach than the last time he 
sought the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996 election cycle, Forbes jumped in late and relied  
almost exclusively on a self-financed campaign of television attack 
ads. He fared poorly and got out early. 
</P>
<P>
	This time Forbes started early, hired talented organizers and  
focused on building an organizational structure that could turn out 
backers for Iowa's precinct caucuses, likely to be held Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has insisted his organizational focus is paying  
dividends, and there has been some evidence of that. He finished 
second in a high-profile nonbinding straw poll last month in Ames 
and has landed some important endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who finished first in the straw poll,  
also has released a list of organizational backers in agriculture 
and other fields.

	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey  
Sen. Bill Bradley are in a close race for the Democratic 
presidential nomination among party voters in New York, a poll 
released Monday shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted for the New York Post by Zogby  
International, has Gore favored by 42 percent of the 319 likely 
Democratic voters surveyed to 36 percent for Bradley. The poll's 
margin of error for Democrats was plus or minus 6 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	A May poll from Zogby had Gore leading Bradley among New York  
Democrats, 46 percent to 31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Cuomo, a former New York governor, said in an interview  
with The Associated Press that he recommended ``weeks and weeks 
ago'' that Gore should ``get in there and start fighting'' by 
trying to get Bradley into debates. But Cuomo said if Gore tried to 
do that now, ``it would be interpreted as `Oh, boy, he's really 
worried about Bradley.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Post poll showed Texas Gov. George W. Bush as the clear  
front-runner among New York Republicans for the GOP nomination. He 
was running about even with Gore and Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	In a matchup for New York's Senate race, the Post poll found New  
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, favored by 48 
percent of voters to 44 percent for Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton 
-- a statistical dead heat given the poll's margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall error margin for the telephone poll of 710 likely  
voters conducted Sept. 7-9 was plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Neiman's Lists Land for Present </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- As Steve Magnes draped a $450,000, 181-carat  
diamond necklace over the bare shoulders and neck of model Kris 
Lezetc, the Neiman Marcus executive predicted the piece will 
practically sell itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure we're going to sell it. It's unique. In fact, if we  
had to make two of them, we probably could,'' winked Magnes, the 
vice president of precious jewelry for the luxury retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	The briolette necklace is just one of many extravagant items in  
Neiman's Christmas catalog, which was unveiled Monday at the 
company's flagship Dallas store. The 134-page book is a veritable 
Santa's list for those wealthy enough to avoid the riffraff at 
Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
	Discerning shoppers can pluck one of 50 fully equipped 2001 BMW  
X5 sport-utility vehicles for $57,995 -- the vehicles usually sell 
out -- or create a home arcade with a $96,000 Venturer S2ei road 
simulator. An 1822 manuscript of Clement C. Moore's ``The Night 
Before Christmas'' can be had for $795,000. 
</P>
<P>
	What new Internet tycoon wouldn't want a $35.25 million Boeing  
business jet? If those stock options haven't been exercised yet, it 
can be leased for 100 hours a year for $5.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The catalog dates to 1915 and has become a publicity-generating  
harbinger of the upcoming season. It also serves to raise money for 
charity -- some purchases generate donations to organizations such 
as UNICEF, Habitat for Humanity and the Susan G. Komen Breast 
Cancer Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Neiman continued its practice of suggesting the perfect his and  
hers gifts, and sought to break away from such mundane past 
offerings as airplanes, dirigibles, submarines and mummy cases. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's his and hers: a $200,000 gift to The Nature  
Conservancy and a $35 donation to save one acre of rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
	For shoppers on a budget, the catalog has a variety of offerings  
under $1,000, ranging from Manolo Blahnik ladies pumps ($815) and a 
Donna Karan New York strapless tube dress ($780) to a nylon golf 
bag ($860) and a battery-powered children's sports car ($475). 
</P>
<P>
	If even those offerings are too pricey, there's always the book  
itself for $6.50. Dreaming about the goodies is free.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Sales in Calif. Plummet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Cigarette sales have plummeted 30  
percent in California this year, and those who led a 1998 campaign 
to add 50 cents a pack in taxes think they're responsible for the 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beyond our expectations. I think it's terrific,'' said  
filmmaker Rob Reiner, who headed the drive to pass Proposition 10. 
``We clearly are reducing smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 10, approved last year, took effect Jan. 1. Since  
that date, cigarette sales for the first six months have taken a 
dramatic drop over the same period in 1998, based on tax receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tax, which goes toward educational programs, may not be  
entirely responsible for the decline, say others. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette manufacturers have hiked wholesale prices several  
times during the last few months as a way of dealing with the $206 
billion health claim settlement to 46 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales soared in December 1998, and officials think it's because  
smokers anticipated the additional cost of their favorite vice and 
laid in a supply of pre-tax cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would mean they stockpiled in November and December and  
didn't need to buy that much in January,'' said Vic Day, of the 
state Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
	Day said he doesn't think the decrease in sales necessarily  
means people are smoking less. He suspects smokers are buying from 
cheaper sources, like the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think there is a major increase in evasion,'' Day  
said.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Pushes to 21/2-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures surged Monday to their highest level since  
early 1997, topping $24 a barrel on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange amid signs once-flush U.S. inventories are still in free 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, orange juice futures rose as Hurricane Floyd  
bore down on the southeastern U.S. coastline, and platinum futures 
advanced sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices have doubled this year after plummeting to a  
12-year low in December. 
</P>
<P>
	After increasing throughout last week, crude saw a sixth  
straight price rise Monday as investors anticipated that the 
upcoming American Petroleum Institute report would show yet another 
decline in U.S. inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to that expectation were figures showing an 8 percent  
decline in monthly activity at the Louisiana offshore oil port -- 
confirmation that less oil is flowing into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The last API report put U.S. stocks at 311 million barrels.  
Inventories have averaged 3-million-barrel drops in recent weeks. 
If that pace holds steady, it would mean the total could drop below 
300 million level by early October. 
</P>
<P>
	``When that figure starts with a 2, we can consider the market  
tight,'' said Tim Evans, energy analyst for the Pegasus Econometric 
Group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a crucial level, but it does indicate that our excess  
inventory has really been worked off,'' he said. ``We had a glut a 
year ago. Well, the glut is gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects for changes any time soon were further diminished by  
comments of the oil minister of the United Arab Emirates, who said 
Sunday that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries won't 
review its oil production cuts before they run out next March. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC's steadfast adherence to the cutbacks policy has helped  
drain oil supplies worldwide and push up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for October delivery rose 66 cents to $24.21 a barrel;  
October heating oil rose .17 cent to 62.20 cents a gallon; October 
unleaded gasoline rose .36 cent to 69.68 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	October natural gas fell 2 cents to $2.781 per 1,000 cubic feet  
as it appeared Floyd would not enter the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in  
October rose 4 cents to $23.48 a gallon on the International 
Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange juice futures settled about 2 percent higher after  
leaping up nearly three times that amount early in the trading 
session on forecasts that had the hurricane coming dangerously 
close to crop regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, the price fell back as meteorologists  
predicted the storm was more likely to come ashore in the 
Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	November frozen concentrated orange juice futures rose 1.55  
cents to 97 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Platinum futures hit a six-month high before declining slightly.  
Investors cited the yen's strong jump against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Since metals are dollar-based commodities, a rise in its value  
encourages selling to lock in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	October platinum rose $7.90 to $373.50 an ounce on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange.

	LIHUE, Hawaii (AP) -- Singer Graham Nash remains hospitalized  
after breaking both legs in a boating accident off Kauai's south 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash, 57, of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, was boating off the  
island with his wife, Susan, and up to 15 friends on Sunday when 
the boat they were in hit a wave, throwing Nash into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``As he was coming down, another wave hit the boat and he landed  
very hard on the inside of the boat,'' said his manager, Gerry 
Tolman. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash was taken to Wilcox Memorial Hospital, where he underwent  
surgery to insert pins in his legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks good and is in good spirits,'' hospital spokeswoman  
Claire Morris said. ``He's probably here for a few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nash will require a wheelchair for a couple of months while  
undergoing physical therapy, said Michael Jensen, his publicist. 
``He's lucky he's alive,'' Jensen said.

<HEADLINE> Panthers QB Optimistic About Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- One day after getting sacked seven times  
and knocked down on 10 other occasions, Carolina Panthers 
quarterback Steve Beuerlein found out he has torn cartilage in his 
left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	But Beuerlein said tests Monday morning showed the cartilage was  
not completely torn off and was not floating around in the joint, 
meaning he should be able to finish the season with the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's stiff and sore,'' he said, ``but I don't think it's going  
to be any major issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beuerlein said doctors were unsure whether he could aggravate  
the injury by continuing to play on a damaged knee. Also uncertain 
is whether the 34-year-old Beuerlein could withstand another 15 
weeks of pounding like he took in Sunday's 19-10 loss to the New 
Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way for me to foretell if I could hold up under  
those circumstances. I don't know,'' he said. ``But I'm sure we're 
going to be a lot better this week even though we're playing a team 
that is regarded as one of the best in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next up for the Panthers is their home opener Sunday against  
Jacksonville, which opened its season of high expectations with a 
41-3 victory over the San Francisco 49ers. The Jaguars harassed 
Steve Young into 9-of-26 passing for 96 yards, sending San 
Francisco to its worst regular season loss since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Beuerlein was under almost constant pressure while going  
16-of-32 for 207 yards. He said his injury occurred when the knee 
was twisted awkwardly while he was being sacked either late in the 
first quarter or early in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I held up fine,'' he said. ``I feel fine today other than  
normal stiffness and soreness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina's trainers held Beuerlein out of any running-related  
aspects of Monday's practice, but he did spend a considerable 
amount of time on a stair-climbing machine after the team finished 
its workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach George Seifert said he reached an obvious conclusion after  
watching film of Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably have as courageous a quarterback as there is,''  
Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beuerlein is one of four quarterbacks on the Panthers' active  
roster, but Seifert said that number shouldn't be interpreted as 
meaning he would be comfortable with losing a quarterback to 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't want to drag one off and drag another one on,''  
Seifert said. ``We've got to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beuerlein wasn't the only player who had trouble as a result of  
the difficulties experienced by the Panthers' offensive line. 
Carolina was limited to 85 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Seifert said he had no immediate plans to make any  
personnel changes on the line, mainly because he felt the mistakes 
could be fixed with better execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to believe that they're correctable,'' Seifert said.  
``We have a very talented line coach in Tony Wise and a 
hard-working group of linemen and I think we'll get better.''

<HEADLINE> Dragging Suspect Said To Boast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- A white supremacist charged with dragging a  
black man to his death was so proud of his participation in the 
gruesome act that he bragged in a jailhouse letter that it was a 
``rush'' and ``I'm still licking my lips for more,'' a prosecutor 
said Monday as the man's murder trial began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the .... hero of the day,'' Lawrence Russell Brewer wrote  
to another inmate while being held at the Jasper County Jail in the 
June 1998 slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer is the second of three white men charged with killing  
James Byrd Jr., 49, by dragging him behind a pickup truck. One of 
the men has already been convicted and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I did it,'' Brewer wrote in the July 1998 letter, which  
was intercepted by a deputy. ``And no longer am I a virgin. It was 
a rush and I'm still licking my lips for more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Brewer referred to ``rolling a tire.'' A witness  
described ``tire'' as a derogatory jailhouse term for a black 
person. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sees himself as a hero, a star, that he's really  
accomplished,'' Jasper District Attorney Guy James Gray said in his 
opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Doug Barlow, who declined to make an opening  
statement, said Brewer was writing about sex and not a slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	A Texas Department of Criminal Justice gang intelligence  
officer, however, insisted in testimony that the message was prison 
code. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it sounds like he's stating he's physically assaulted a  
member of the black race in one form or another,'' William Kirk 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A prison inmate who shared a cellblock wing with Brewer  
testified that Brewer was not remorseful. 
</P>

	``If it was up to them, they would like to take the whole black  
population and shoot them behind the head -- men, women and children 
-- and get rid of them,'' said Jesus Moran, who is serving time for 
burglary and theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, 32, could get the death penalty if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	Brewer and John William King and Shawn Allen Berry, both 24, are  
accused of abducting Byrd, 49, chaining him and dragging him to 
pieces. Byrd's shredded torso, minus a head and right arm, was left 
on the bumpy country road between a black church and black 
cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	The crime -- one of the grisliest racial slayings since the civil  
rights era -- shocked the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	King, the first to go to trial, was sentenced to death in  
February. Berry is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's trial was moved about 150 miles west of Jasper to Bryan  
after the defense argued that the people of Jasper would want to 
convict Brewer to redeem their small town's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, convicted of cocaine possession, and King, a convicted  
burglar, had met while in prison. Gray said Brewer was the top 
officer, or what he called an ``exalted cyclops,'' in a white 
supremacist prison group known as the Confederate Knights of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll see Mr. Brewer wrote to Mr. King: `I will school  
you,''' Gray said. ``King, when he came in, this guy was the 
mentor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said Byrd's abduction and slaying were intended  
to give publicity to a new white supremacist group, the Texas Rebel 
Soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among documents entered into evidence Monday was an oath in  
which Brewer declared his allegiance to the Rebel Soldiers group 
and pledged service to the Aryan race. 
</P>
<P>
	The oath, which he signed, was marked by a bloody fingerprint  
inside a design of three interlocking K's, a symbol of the Ku Klux 
Klan.

<HEADLINE>  Bengals' CB Fisher Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Rookie cornerback Charles Fisher tore three  
ligaments in his left knee during the Cincinnati Bengals' 
season-opening loss at Tennessee and is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	His career also could be in jeopardy.  
</P>
<P>
	The second-round draft pick from West Virginia completely tore  
three ligaments when he twisted while trying to stay with a 
receiver only 14:55 into his first NFL game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI on Monday found the severity of the injury, and the  
Bengals put him on injured reserve. He'll get a second opinion from 
Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala., on Tuesday before having 
reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given his position as a cornerback, it's a major obstacle to  
overcome,'' trainer Paul Sparling said. ``To call it 
career-threatening is not exaggerating. He's got a long road ahead 
of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher was elevated to starter when the Bengals released veteran  
Corey Sawyer six days before the opener. The Titans went after 
Fisher -- he was called for interference against Yancey Thigpen on 
the game's first play. 
</P>
<P>
	He hurt the knee while trying to cover Kevin Dyson on what  
turned out to be a 13-yard touchdown pass late in the first quarter 
of the Titans' 36-35 victory. Fisher twisted, felt the knee give 
and fell to the ground, leaving Dyson uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a huge blow to the Bengals defense, which was repeatedly  
burned by the Titans. Steve McNair completed 21 of 32 for 341 yards 
and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals already were thin at the position. Starter Artrell  
Hawkins is only in his second season. First-year cornerback Rodney 
Heath, who played Arena Football in 1997-98, takes over for Fisher 
on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really takes our depth at cornerback down,'' Hawkins  
said. ``Charles had been here for all of training camp and knew the 
defense. We just have to pull together. We don't have any Pro Bowl 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bruce Coslet wanted more experience at cornerback heading  
into the season, but the front office decided to get rid of Sawyer 
after the veteran had a tough preseason. Now Coslet has to try to 
get by with a defensive secondary that's going to be learning as it 
goes along. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a whole bunch of things like that,'' Coslet said  
Monday. ``That's the way it is and you do the best you can with how 
it is.''

<HEADLINE> Andersen Tries Forgetting Kicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Fame is fleeting, especially for a kicker.  
</P>
<P>
	Just ask Atlanta's Morten Andersen: hero of the NFC championship  
game, goat of the season-opening rematch against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's either-or,'' said Andersen, who missed two kicks inside  
40 yards Sunday as the Falcons lost 17-14 to the Vikings. ``It's 
like a closer in the ninth inning or a player taking a penalty kick 
in soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Andersen was anxious to analyze the tape of his two  
botched kicks and locate the flaws that caused him to hook a 
35-yarder left of the upright in the second quarter, then push a 
39-yarder wide right with 3:38 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just something mechanical,'' he said casually, knowing  
that a kicker can't dwell on his mistakes for too long. ``I'm sure 
it won't be a big secret. It will be something simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The explanation from coach Dan Reeves, who had viewed tape of  
the game, would hardly classify as rocket science. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just pulled the first one, then he overcompensated with the  
second one,'' Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such moments of glaring failure have been rare for the  
38-year-old Andersen, whose 25-game winning kicks are the most in 
league history. His most memorable moment, of course, came eight 
months ago in the NFC championship game, when his 38-yarder in 
overtime sent the Falcons to their first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with his two misses Sunday, Andersen has made 401 of 512  
attempts (78 percent) during his 18-year career. He's virtually 
automatic from inside the 40 with a 91 percent accuracy rate 
(265-of-290). 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the same guy who got us to the Super Bowl,'' said  
cornerback Ray Buchanan, who took his share of the blame for a 
52-yard pass interference penalty that set up a Vikings touchdown. 
``He just had a bad day. We're not complaining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons seemed just as stunned as Andersen when his second  
kick fluttered wide of its target. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a situation he's been in plenty of times before,'' Tim  
Dwight said. ``He said it looked good, then all of a sudden it just 
tailed to the left. That's the way the ball flies, but I think we 
might have another crack at these guys (in the playoffs).'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Falcons could take some solace in rallying from a  
17-0 deficit and shutting out the explosive Vikings in the second 
half. Last year, Minnesota set an NFL record with 556 points and 
scored at least 24 in every game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our football team hung in there, played hard and showed some  
poise,'' Reeves said. ``We had a chance to win at the end. That's 
encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially when the Falcons failed miserably in trying to follow  
their 1998 game plan for success. They lost three fumbles and 
failed to force a turnover after leading the NFL with a plus-20 
ratio. They allowed the Vikings to hold the ball for more than 33 
minutes after topping the league in time of possession. They rushed 
for just 81 yards after ranking sixth a season ago with an average 
of 131.3. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not any moral victories,'' said running back Jamal  
Anderson, held to 50 yards on 16 carries. ``We can't get to the 
point where we're 0-2. You give up a lot when you go down two 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have an extra day of practice this week since their  
next game is Monday night at Dallas. The Cowboys rallied from a 
21-point, fourth-quarter deficit at Washington, beating the 
Redskins 41-35 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dallas has got a lot of momentum,'' Anderson said. ``And since  
we're the defending NFC champion, everybody comes at you a little 
harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen didn't plan to fret over his missed kicks for very  
long. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a little time to get over, but tonight I'm going to  
put it behind me,'' he said Monday. ``We have an off day tomorrow 
and when I come to work Wednesday, I will be looking forward.''

<HEADLINE> Ripken Moves Up in Batting Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Two days after saying he was hesitant to tinker  
with is lineup to help Cal Ripken in his chase toward 3,000 hits, 
Baltimore Orioles manager Ray Miller moved Ripken to the fifth spot 
in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who has been hitting sixth, traded places with first  
baseman Jeff Conine in the lineup Monday against Seattle. Ripken 
entered hitting .333 and was 19 hits short of 3,000 for his career 
with 19 games remaining in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``With 3,000 in reach, I don't particularly like the other team  
intentionally walking him,'' Miller said. ``With Conine back there, 
I don't think you'll see that. And he's been swinging the heck out 
of the bat -- that's another reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conine was in a 3-for-23 slump during the previous six games.

<HEADLINE> Chambers Catching Passes Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Chris Chambers, No. 9 Wisconsin's leading  
receiver last season, began catching passes again Monday after 
injuring his hand in the team's season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers broke a bone in his hand in the first half against  
Murray State and sat out last week's game against Ball State. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll probably want to see how that bone feels or how his hand  
feels after he catches the ball,'' coach Barry Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers, a junior who caught 28 passes and averaged 20.1 yards  
per reception last season, had been doing drill work and 
conditioning while waiting for the injury to heal, Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers likely could play against Cincinnati on Saturday in  
Wisconsin's first road game and final warmup before the Big Ten 
home opener against No. 6 Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers caught four passes for 34 yards against Murray State.  
Punt returner Nick Davis stepped in at split end for Chambers in 
the game against Ball State, catching four passes for 91 yards.

	Total Fina, Elf Agree To Merge  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French oil company Total Fina came out the big  
winner Monday in its 2-month-long takeover battle for rival Elf 
Aquitaine, creating the world's fourth-largest oil company with a 
sweetened $54.2 billion offer. The combined group, however, will 
still be much smaller than oil behemoths Royal Dutch Shell AG, BP 
Amoco PLC and the planned combination of Exxon Corp. and Mobil 
Corp. The two oil groups had been at a standoff since Total Fina 
initially launched an unsolicited $44 billion all-stock takeover 
bid for Elf in July. Elf resisted the hostile offer, coming back 
with its own cash-and-stock counterbid to acquire Total Fina.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian investigators are meeting with U.S.  
officials on the inquiry into a money-laundering scandal in which 
Russian gangsters are believed to have funneled as much as $10 
billion through the Bank of New York. The Russians are in 
Washington this week meeting with State and Justice Department 
officials ``to discuss the money-laundering case and other 
subjects,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters. 
The probe has extended around the globe in recent days. French 
investigators have opened a related inquiry into a French bank for 
its management of funds from Russia's Central Bank, and Austrian 
police are looking into possible links between an Austrian bank and 
alleged money-laundering by Russian organized crime.

lawsuits filed against Degussa AG and two filed against Siemens AG. 
The plaintiffs claimed Degussa AG willingly helped the Nazis

seized from Jews, including metal fillings taken from their mouths. 
Siemens, a multinational industrial giant, was accused of profiting

<HEADLINE> ABC Opens Morning Show Studio in NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC's ``Good Morning America'' opened its new  
storefront studio in Times Square on Monday with a party that was 
crashed electronically by NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC mischievously beamed the ``Today'' show from a giant screen  
overlooking ABC's studio -- a sign of how competitive morning 
television's window wars will be. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thanksgiving, ABC, CBS and NBC will all have storefront  
studios in Manhattan where viewers can peer in at the live morning 
news shows. 
</P>
<P>
	With 2.3 million lights on a facade bulging 20 feet into Times  
Square, ABC's new studio is a perfect fit for the visual 
hurly-burly of the famous crossroads. The ground floor of the 
two-story studio is built like a replica of a New York subway 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really awesome,'' said Cindy Maxwell of Carrollton, Ga.,  
one of about 200 onlookers. ``I haven't been inside, but I think it 
looks very authentic. It's just the way I would have pictured New 
York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC isn't saying how much was spent on the new studio. NBC's  
competing ``Today'' show had a street-level windowed studio in the 
1950s and opened a new one in 1994, coinciding with an 
unprecedented hot streak in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Manhattan is becoming studio city. CBS is building  
its own nearly $30 million facility for the ``Early Show'' 
overlooking Central Park. It is due to open Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A block away from ABC, squealing fans gather each weekday to  
watch MTV telecast ``Total Request Live,'' an afternoon music show. 
Fox News Channel's street-level studio hums all day on Avenue of 
the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	Although NBC controls a giant TV screen beaming out over Times  
Square, it generally showed a mix of ads and financial news in the 
morning. That was before Jeff Zucker, ``Today'' executive producer, 
made a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
	So, on Monday, ``Today'' aired in Times Square. The screen  
showed host Katie Couric batting tennis balls with U.S. Open 
champion Serena Williams, who zipped over to ``Good Morning

	Bystanders were so preoccupied by the competing morning shows  
that they didn't notice supermodel Stephanie Seymour prancing 
across the street toward them, her hair in curlers. She narrated a 
fashion show in ``GMA's'' second hour.

	Fans who awoke in the middle of the night to get there gave the  
studio a thumbs-up. The subway set -- minus the authentic grime -- 
actually conveyed a warm, homey feel, one onlooker said.

played ``On Broadway,'' showed up for a ribbon cutting.

</P>
<P>
	``We hate you!'' another bystander immediately responded, in a  
more traditional New York greeting.

<HEADLINE> Starr Wins Appeals Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a new setback in court, President  
Clinton's defenders say they won't give up their attempt to show 
that prosecutor Kenneth Starr leaked grand jury secrets to 
reporters in the Monica Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's team was dealt a blow Monday when a federal appeals  
court overturned a previously secret lower court ruling that the 
independent counsel's office be prosecuted by the Justice 
Department for illegally leaking grand jury information to the news 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyer said he would seek an appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	In a 3-0 vote, the court reversed U.S. District Judge Norma  
Holloway Johnson, who directed that the Justice Department act as 
prosecutor for civil and possibly criminal contempt proceedings 
against Starr's office as well as its former spokesman, Charles 
Bakaly, for allegedly leaking a story to The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times' story, which appeared on Jan. 31 during Clinton's  
Senate impeachment trial, said Starr had decided he had the 
authority to seek an indictment against the president while Clinton 
was still in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The disclosure that a group of ... prosecutors 'believe' that  
an indictment should be brought at the end of the impeachment 
proceedings does not on its face, or in the context of the article 
as a whole, violate'' grand jury secrecy, the appeals court ruling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling may prove helpful to Starr regarding other  
allegations of grand jury leaks leveled by Clinton lawyer David 
Kendall in the Lewinsky investigation. Johnson ruled last year that 
there were 24 instances of possible grand jury leaks by Starr's 
office. They dealt with topics other than what was taking place 
before the grand jury -- such as negotiations with Lewinsky's 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also suggested that Starr's office, as a  
government entity, may be entitled to sovereign immunity, making it 
immune from being prosecuted for criminal contempt. However, the 
court did not rule on that issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said he will ask the entire court of appeals to review  
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the decision of the panel is inconsistent with  
the precedents of the court of appeals,'' Kendall said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office said that ``today's decision rejects defense  
tactics of seeking to distract an investigation through accusations 
of illegal leaks.'' Starr praised the appeals court for ``noting 
the important role of prosecutors providing public information 
regarding criminal investigations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly left the independent counsel's office when Starr asked  
the Justice Department to investigate him about the leak to The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who as chief judge oversaw the grand jury that  
investigated the Lewinsky sex and cover-up scandal, issued an order 
July 14 directing the Justice Department to serve as prosecutor of 
contempt charges against Starr's office as well as Bakaly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department sided with Starr in immediately asking  
Johnson to withdraw her referral for prosecuting Starr's office, 
the appeals court disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Laying out previously secret details, the appeals court stated  
that shortly after the Times' story ran, Bakaly submitted a 
declaration saying that he refused to confirm for a Times' reporter 
``what Judge Starr ... was thinking or doing'' regarding whether 
Clinton could be indicted while in office. 
</P>
<P>
	After a leak probe of Starr's office by the FBI, Starr  
``referred the matter to the Department of Justice for a criminal 
investigation and ... withdrew Bakaly's declaration,'' the appeals 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, said the appeals court, Starr's office also  
``abandoned its argument that'' the prosecutor's office ``was not 
the source of the information disclosed in The New York Times 
article.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Troubled by these developments,'' Johnson ``ordered Bakaly''  
and Starr's office ``to show cause why they should not be held in'' 
contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left for Bakaly's lawyer, Howard Shapiro, were not  
returned Monday.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Expansion Bidders Meet NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NFL's deadline for Los Angeles expansion  
bidders to come up with a suitable stadium proposal is Wednesday, 
but don't expect a decision from the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Three groups from Los Angeles and one from Houston met  
separately with NFL officials Monday at the league's New York 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston businessman Bob McNair represents the only group with a  
solid stadium proposal in place. He was also the only one to 
comment after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a real, real steep hill to climb with the stadium  
issues,'' McNair said of the Los Angeles groups. ``But I don't want 
people to think this is a done deal with us. It's far from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL awarded Los Angeles the 32nd franchise in March,  
contingent on coming up with an acceptable stadium and financing 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The three groups represent the Coliseum, Hollywood Park and  
Carson. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said that Hollywood Park would be 
the most logical site in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	They are a late entrant into the field, headed by billionaire  
Marvin Davis. He was represented at the meeting by his son, Gregg 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're serious and probably the most doable of the three  
sites in Los Angeles,'' Aiello said. ``They have parking and land. 
It could be done more easily than the other two sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aiello said a decision may be made Oct. 5 when the NFL expansion  
committee meets in Atlanta, a day before the league's 31 team 
owners convene. 
</P>
<P>
	But the announcement could be delayed until Nov. 2, when the  
owners meet in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still wide open,'' Aiello said. ``They are all still  
under consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The groups met Monday with NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue and  
expansion committee co-chairman Bob Kraft and Jerry Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL had picked the Los Angeles Coliseum as its preferred  
site for a team, but talks stalled when the league asked for more 
public funding. The Los Angeles City Council recently passed a 
resolution opposing spending any present tax dollars for the 
project, but left open the possibility that tax revenue generated 
by a new team could be used. 
</P>
<P>
	The league recently decided to take a closer look at Hollywood  
Park and Carson. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's proposal includes a $310 million stadium deal,  
including $195 million in public funds. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair said the meeting was ``very constructive,'' but would not  
comment on the price of the franchise, which has been reported in 
the $600 million range. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair appeared more confident after the meeting than in the  
past, now that the league's deadline to deal with Los Angeles is so 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully in the next week or two we'll come up with something  
that works for both of us,'' McNair said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Houston is awarded the expansion franchise, NFL  
officials have said they still will work to put a team in the Los 
Angeles area, which has been without a team since the Raiders left 
the Coliseum and the Rams left Anaheim, both after the 1994 season.

<HEADLINE> Investor Accused of $1B Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Criminal and civil charges were filed against a  
New Jersey man accused of bilking Japanese investors out of up to 
$1 billion as he tried to make up for losing hundreds of millions 
of dollars on risky investments, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin A. Armstrong, 50, of Maple Shade, N.J., was arrested  
Monday and released on $5 million bail after an appearance in 
federal court in Trenton, N.J. A message left at a telephone listed 
in his name was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong allegedly carried out his criminal scheme as the  
founder and chairman of a Princeton, N.J.-based investment firm, 
Princeton Economics International Limited. 
</P>
<P>
	Since at least 1996, Armstrong managed to sell about $3 billion  
of so-called ``Princeton Notes'' to foreign investors through 
Princeton Global Management Limited, a Princeton, N.J., investment 
fund he controlled that is popular with some large institutional 
investors in Japan, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The promissory notes were supposed to be conservative  
investments but instead were used as fuel for Armstrong's failing 
investment prowess, according to a portrait provided by court 
documents and releases. 
</P>
<P>
	He was accused of securities fraud by federal prosecutors and  
the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly swindling 
investors through the corporations he controlled. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan outlined the  
scheme through which Armstrong allegedly tried to cover up hundreds 
of millions of dollars in losses he piled up through his risky 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to conservatively invest the proceeds from the note  
sales in segregated accounts at Republic New York Securities Corp., 
a registered broker-dealer headquartered in New York, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of protecting the money, Armstrong co-mingled the money  
in a Princeton Global account at Republic, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing hundreds of millions of dollars, Armstrong then  
tried to cover up the financial disaster by misrepresenting 
investment results and concealing trading losses, according to 
court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble began in earnest for Armstrong when he racked up  
about a half billion dollars worth of trading losses from November 
1997 through August 1999, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	He then allegedly had an officer at Republic Securities issue  
false confirmation letters, some of which were given to Japanese 
investors, overstating the net asset values of the funds created by 
their investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities said the amount of the money from investors  
that has not been paid back stood between $700 million and $1 
billion while the remaining cash and trading positions at Republic 
Securities was only about $46 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In a release, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White noted that Armstrong  
used offshore entities to sell $3 billion in securities to Japanese 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case should send a clear and concise message that those  
who commit securities fraud in the United States, even if they use 
offshore entities and victimize foreign investors, cannot escape 
responsibility for their actions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the criminal and SEC civil charges, the U.S. Commodities  
and Futures Trading Commission filed civil charges against 
Armstrong, Princeton Economics International and various 
affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Armstrong faces up to 10 years in prison and a  
fine up to twice the loss resulting from the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also filed civil charges against Princeton Economics  
International and Princeton Global Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Republic recently suspended James E. Sweeney, its chief  
executive, and replaced the management of its futures trading 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Republic New York is in the process of being acquired by HSBC  
Holdings PLC of London for $10.3 billion, although the deal's 
closing could be slowed by the continuing investigation, executives 
have said.

<HEADLINE> Russians, U.S. Discuss Bank Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The inquiry into an alleged money-laundering  
scheme using a major American bank now stretches from this country 
to Moscow, and Russian investigators are meeting with U.S. 
officials on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian gangsters are believed to have illegally channeled as  
much as $10 billion through the Bank of New York. The Russian 
investigators are in Washington this week meeting with State and 
Justice Department officials ``to discuss the money-laundering case 
and other subjects,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin told 
reporters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we would expect to do is talk to those (Russian)  
officials ... about what kind of forensic and other support we 
could provide on an urgent basis,'' Rubin said. ``There are certain 
areas where we may have some expertise that the Russians may want 
to avail themselves of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged yet, but the inquiry has widened in  
recent days: 
</P>
<P>
	--French investigators have opened a related inquiry into a  
French bank for its management of funds from Russia's Central Bank, 
including money loaned by the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	--Austrian police reportedly are looking into possible links  
between an Austrian bank and alleged money laundering by Russian 
organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	--Swiss prosecutors, already aiding a separate Russian  
investigation into allegations of Kremlin corruption, said they're 
ready to help the U.S. inquiry into suspected money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton warned Sunday that corruption and money  
laundering ``could eat the heart out of Russian society'' unless 
the government forcefully combats the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton raised the warning in a meeting with Russian Prime  
Minister Vladimir Putin in Auckland, New Zealand, before the two 
attended the opening of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin ``acknowledged that money laundering problems exist in  
Russia, as in other countries, and that we must develop a 
cooperative approach of dealing with the problem,'' Clinton's 
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Yevgeny Yasin, a former Russian economy minister on a visit to  
Washington, on Monday denied recent allegations that IMF loans to 
Russia may have been involved in the suspected money laundering 
through the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a lie,'' Yasin said in a speech at the Nixon Center.  
``No money has been stolen from (the IMF). It's impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yasin has previously suggested that news reports of the Bank of  
New York debacle may have been spurred by next year's elections in 
the United States, saying, ``I believe that the U.S. Republicans 
could have inspired it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leading Russian newspapers have taken the same line, seeing an  
anti-Russia plot and warning that the West is looking to revive the 
Cold War.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Pushes Education Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENTWOOD, Mich. (AP) -- Steve Forbes, pushing his education  
proposals to students in his quest to win the votes of their 
affluent, suburban parents, said Monday that school reform can best 
be accomplished by putting ``the power in the hands of people ... 
of parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his third visit to Michigan since March, the Republican  
presidential hopeful told freshmen at East Kent High School that 
education is the key to their futures. 
</P>
<P>
	He reiterated his support for school vouchers, which would allow  
parents to use public funds to send their children to schools of 
their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``While here in East Kentwood you have one of the finest schools  
in the Midwest, too many of the schools in America are not doing 
the job they should for young people,'' he told the students. ``The 
way you get the reform we need in schools is to put the power in 
the hands of people ... of parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, making his second run for the White House, also planned  
to attend a reception hosted by the Ingham County Republican Party 
in Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
	While still financing his own campaign, Forbes this time around  
has placed more emphasis on building grass-roots support. 
</P>
<P>
	In courting conservative leaders who were skeptical of his  
candidacy in 1996, Forbes has honed his messages on abortion and a 
flat income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	He pressed those themes Monday in his remarks to students and in  
his answers to their questions. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the best way to end abortion, Forbes told the  
students ``you have to persuade people to change their minds.'' He 
added that ``much more has to be done with counseling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addressing a question about welfare reform, he stressed the  
need for limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone gets in trouble, they get a helping hand but you  
have to make it clear that it's not going to go on forever unless 
they're disabled,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On a lighter side, Forbes cracked a few jokes, winning a few  
laughs from students who later said they appreciated his comments -- 
even if they can't yet vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was informational. It was really interesting to  
hear,'' said Jamie Brege, 14.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Lawyers Chide Arndt Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Remarks by a police detective present when the  
body of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was found are the latest in a 
series of unsubstantiated attacks on the family, attorneys for John 
and Patsy Ramsey said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Boulder Detective Linda Arndt said in an interview  
broadcast on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' on Monday that she 
feared for her life as she spoke with Ramsey shortly after 
JonBenet's body was found. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged in the slaying, but authorities say the  
Ramseys remain under suspicion. They have denied any involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Linda Arndt's bizarre speculations are the latest in a  
seemingly endless series of attacks on the Ramsey family by people 
who seek to justify their own conduct at the Ramseys' expense,'' 
said a statement from the law firm headed by Hal Haddon, the 
Ramseys' lead defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys' attorneys took exception with Ms. Arndt's comments  
that she was afraid when talking to Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her psychic impressions ... are no substitute for evidence and  
do nothing to advance the search for JonBenet's killer,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Arndt was the first detective to arrive at the Ramsey home  
on Dec. 26, 1996, after Mrs. Ramsey called 911 to report that her 
daughter was missing and she had found a ransom note. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records said hours later, after no call came from any  
kidnappers, Ms. Arndt asked John Ramsey, the child's millionaire 
businessman father, and a friend to search the house for anything 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	He went downstairs and emerged minutes later with the girl's  
body. She had been beaten and strangled.

<HEADLINE>  Spring Fashion Week Underway in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Designers have once again moved up their New  
York Fashion Week shows be several weeks, tired of playing second 
fiddle to Europe's previews. 
</P>
<P>
	Top U.S. designers unveiled their spring 2000 collections this  
week -- six weeks ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second season in a row, designers jumped the gun so they  
can be judged on their own merits, not as copycats. Besides, later 
shows mean less time for production and delivery, and fewer dollars 
for the U.S. market, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	As the previews catapult New York into the international fashion  
spotlight, several designers from across the Atlantic have grabbed 
their passports. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many designers choosing to show in New York certainly gives  
a tremendous amount of validity to the American market,'' New York 
designer Oscar de la Renta said. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's participants, either first-timers or repeaters,  
include London's Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Ghost and 
Nicole Farhi; Paris' Marcel Marongiu; and Italy's Donatella 
Versace, Bottega Veneta, Moschino and Luca Luca, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, European fashion capitals customarily opened for an  
audience of retailers, editors and photographers before sending the 
weary traveling circus globetrotting to the previews in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In one year, the event has grown from around 55 to 80 shows,  
plus an additional 40 outside the aegis of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	On the catwalks Monday, there was an elegant air of well-heeled  
flair, thanks to Venezuelan-born, New York designer Carolina 
Herrera, celebrated for having dressed Jacqueline Kennedy and 
Hillary Clinton, and now Sharon Stone, Rene Russo and Celine Dion. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrera's curtain opener offered lavish and flirty, flared  
evening skirts, cascading with ruffles, sparking with semiprecious 
stones, and destined for Fifth Avenue drawing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to look young and seductive and sensational,  
no?'' asked the designer, who answered with asymmetrical-neckline 
tops hand-embroidered with orchids and skirts ready to flutter to a 
Latin beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morocco, Spain, somewhere in the Mediterranean,'' says  
Herrera. ``You always have to imagine where the women can wear 
these clothes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing's pretty certain: They won't likely run into Betsey  
Johnson's crowd. More wild than mild, the fun and funky designer 
typically stages a rollicking revue. Her Monday happening was 
intended to be intimate, though hardly quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson shoehorned an audience of 200, plus deejay, into her  
shocking-pink and red showroom, where models rocked out in the 
latest (actually, earliest) Woodstock-inspired couture, dotted with 
little mirrors and summer-of-love-styled embroideries. Her ``real 
raw, rock 'n roll chicks'' in tie-dyed T-shirts and peasant blouses 
were a throwback to Johnson's '60s roots. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep it real, Johnson bypassed supermodels and trotted out  
her daughter, store managers, even an errant yoga teacher, 
snowboarder, bass player. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Monday, the designer known as b Michael brought flowers  
and frills to Fashion Week, in his collection called ``Renewal,'' 
for the first spring of the new century. 
</P>
<P>
	Bursting with a palette of daffodil yellow, hydrangea green and  
tiger lily orange, Michael's silk evening dresses look fairly ready 
for a garden party. Accessory of note: Lucite heels, to underscore 
his fitted dresses, short and sheer. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New MLS Commissioner Eyes Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- The gleaming new sterling silver trophy  
goes to the MLS champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The new commissioner spoke hopefully of the league's future.  
</P>
<P>
	There's nothing new, though, about its problems -- a shortage of  
fan interest, frequent player movements that hurt fan loyalties and 
shootouts that end otherwise competitive games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of work to do,'' Don Garber, who became  
commissioner Aug. 4, said Monday when the re-designed Alan I. 
Rothenberg Championship Trophy, named for the league's founder, was 
unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
	The MLS, in its fourth season, has franchises in 12 cities but  
average attendance hasn't grown much. It's up to 14,491 so far this 
season from 14,312 last year. But it was 17,406 in the league's 
first year. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams in two of the league's largest markets, the New England  
Revolution and New York-New Jersey MetroStars, are among the worst 
in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``A big problem and something I think we need to address,''  
Garber said. 
</P>
<P>
	He became commissioner after spending 15 years as a senior  
marketing and management executive with the NFL, the last three as 
managing director for NFL International. He managed all NFL 
business outside the United States, including NFL Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	He succeeded Doug Logan, who said he was forced to resign after  
serving as the MLS' only commissioner since it began play in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a honeymoon in the early inception,'' Garber said.  
``Some of the interest has settled down in the last couple of years 
and we're in the process of figuring out how we can relaunch this 
league in ways that deliver for fans what they're looking for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer interest in the United States increased during the summer  
when the Americans won the Women's World Cup in their home country. 
Yet the MLS didn't capitalize on that. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so much soccer that exists in this country,'' Garber  
said. ``We're all in there trying to get our piece of the pie. The 
challenge is to figure out how, ultimately, we can connect all 
these things. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no sense of panic,'' he added. ``It needs to get to a  
different level and there's a lot of different kind of thinking 
that needs to be put in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That might include reconsidering the shootout.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that we're going to meet and discuss sooner as  
opposed to later,'' Garber said. 
</P>
<P>
	And what about players changing teams so often?  
</P>
<P>
	``Player movement is not a good thing in any sport,'' he said.  
``We need to figure out a better way to make it work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all that movement, D.C. United has dominated the league,  
winning two of the three championships and having the best record 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS Cup '99, the title game, is scheduled for Nov. 21 in Foxboro  
Stadium, site of the first championship game in 1996, won by D.C. 
United over the Los Angeles Galaxy 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	That was played in a downpour but still attracted 34,643 fans.  
</P>
<P>
	This time, Garber said, ``I hope we will be blessed with  
reasonably good weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would give him one less problem to worry about.

<HEADLINE>  Spring Fashion Week Underway in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Designers have once again moved up their New  
York Fashion Week shows be several weeks, tired of playing second 
fiddle to Europe's previews. 
</P>
<P>
	Top U.S. designers unveiled their spring 2000 collections this  
week -- six weeks ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second season in a row, designers jumped the gun so they  
can be judged on their own merits, not as copycats. Besides, later 
shows mean less time for production and delivery, and fewer dollars 
for the U.S. market, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	As the previews catapult New York into the international fashion  
spotlight, several designers from across the Atlantic have grabbed 
their passports. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many designers choosing to show in New York certainly gives  
a tremendous amount of validity to the American market,'' New York 
designer Oscar de la Renta said. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's participants, either first-timers or repeaters,  
include London's Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Ghost and 
Nicole Farhi; Paris' Marcel Marongiu; and Italy's Donatella 
Versace, Bottega Veneta, Moschino and Luca Luca, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, European fashion capitals customarily opened for an  
audience of retailers, editors and photographers before sending the 
weary traveling circus globetrotting to the previews in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In one year, the event has grown from around 55 to 80 shows,  
plus an additional 40 outside the aegis of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	On the catwalks Monday, there was an elegant air of well-heeled  
flair, thanks to Venezuelan-born, New York designer Carolina 
Herrera, celebrated for having dressed Jacqueline Kennedy and 
Hillary Clinton, and now Sharon Stone, Rene Russo and Celine Dion. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrera's curtain opener offered lavish and flirty, flared  
evening skirts, cascading with ruffles, sparking with semiprecious 
stones, and destined for Fifth Avenue drawing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to look young and seductive and sensational,  
no?'' asked the designer, who answered with asymmetrical-neckline 
tops hand-embroidered with orchids and skirts ready to flutter to a 
Latin beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morocco, Spain, somewhere in the Mediterranean,'' says  
Herrera. ``You always have to imagine where the women can wear 
these clothes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing's pretty certain: They won't likely run into Betsey  
Johnson's crowd. More wild than mild, the fun and funky designer 
typically stages a rollicking revue. Her Monday happening was 
intended to be intimate, though hardly quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson shoehorned an audience of 200, plus deejay, into her  
shocking-pink and red showroom, where models rocked out in the 
latest (actually, earliest) Woodstock-inspired couture, dotted with 
little mirrors and summer-of-love-styled embroideries. Her ``real 
raw, rock 'n roll chicks'' in tie-dyed T-shirts and peasant blouses 
were a throwback to Johnson's '60s roots. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep it real, Johnson bypassed supermodels and trotted out  
her daughter, store managers, even an errant yoga teacher, 
snowboarder, bass player. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Monday, the designer known as b Michael brought flowers  
and frills to Fashion Week, in his collection called ``Renewal,'' 
for the first spring of the new century. 
</P>
<P>
	Bursting with a palette of daffodil yellow, hydrangea green and  
tiger lily orange, Michael's silk evening dresses look fairly ready 
for a garden party. Accessory of note: Lucite heels, to underscore 
his fitted dresses, short and sheer. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Michael, ``It's a polite sex appeal.''

<HEADLINE> Floyd Endangering Space Shuttles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's four space shuttles were in  
danger as the agency braced Monday for Hurricane Floyd, a storm 
powerful enough to wipe out its launch pads and hangars. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the shuttles are in hangars. But the buildings are  
designed to withstand wind of no more than 105 mph to 125 mph. 
Floyd was packing top sustained winds of 155 mph wind as of Monday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to live and hope -- that's what it's going to  
take,'' NASA spokesman George Diller said as Kennedy Space Center's 
approximately 12,500 workers began evacuating. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the hurricane skirts the central Florida coast and  
passes 35 miles offshore, forecasters have warned Kennedy Space 
Center to expect 150 mph wind on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just hoping that it stays farther offshore to make it a  
little easier for us,'' Diller said. ``But it's not going to be a 
good situation in any event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a change in the hurricane's course, NASA planned to  
close down the Kennedy Space Center by midnight Monday, leaving 
behind a skeleton crew. On Tuesday, managers will decide whether to 
keep the crew there to ride out the storm; the workers would leave 
if the wind is as fierce as predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The center is only 9 feet above sea level, so a storm surge as  
well as wind could be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a direct hit on us, or even a skirting hit, we could  
lose a great deal, and a ride-out crew's not going to help you,'' 
said Bruce Buckingham, another NASA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	This would be the first complete evacuation ever of Kennedy  
Space Center. A skeleton crew remained behind when the place was 
evacuated for Hurricane Erin in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to be moved in a hurry like NASA's $2 billion shuttles,  
four multimillion-dollar rockets remained on launch pads at the 
adjacent Cape Canaveral Air Station. The rockets were being secured 
to their pads, with protective towers placed around them. In 
addition, loose objects such as electric generators were being 
removed to keep them from becoming projectiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force launch towers are built to withstand wind up to  
120 mph. NASA's two shuttle launch pads can take wind up to 125 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials planned to evacuate all 10,000 workers at  
Cape Canaveral Air Station and Patrick Air Force Base in Cocoa 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	At Kennedy, technicians closed the cargo-bay doors of each  
shuttle and bagged the main engines on the tail to protect against 
water damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The landing gear was also raised on the three shuttles in the  
Orbital Processing Facility, designed to withstand wind of up to 
105 mph. On Atlantis, parked in the Vehicle Assembly Building, the 
landing gear was covered with plastic bags. Its gear could not be 
raised because Atlantis was resting on its wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	The 525-foot-high Vehicle Assembly Building, where shuttles are  
attached to their booster rockets and external fuel tanks, can 
withstand wind of up to 125 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA expected the preparations -- not to mention any damage or  
destruction -- to delay upcoming shuttle flights, already postponed 
by wiring defects. Discovery is supposed to fly at the end of 
October on a repair trip to the Hubble Space Telescope, and 
Endeavour is set for lifotoff in November on an Earth-mapping 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time that Kennedy Space Center had to go through such  
drastic precautions was for Erin in 1995. In 1996, Hurricanes 
Bertha and Fran forced NASA to move Atlantis from the launch pad 
into the hangar, but no evacuation was ordered.

<HEADLINE>  Race Issue Raised at Emmy Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Minorities must create their own creative  
projects, not settle for small, unsatisfying opportunities offered 
by TV networks, says John Leguizamo, who won an Emmy for his HBO 
special ``Freak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Latin voice is something that is lacking and very missing  
in the media,'' said the comedian who won Sunday for best variety 
or music show performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunities are there but they're really small and  
unsatisfying and somewhat embarrassing,'' Leguizamo continued. 
``You do have to take things into your own hands to write and 
create. Richard Pryor did it and Woody Allen, those are my idols.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In jest and in earnest, several Emmy presenters and winners  
raised the issue of race. The lack of roles for minorities has been 
a contentious issue in recent months, with advocacy groups 
criticizing the networks for largely white casting this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Council of La Raza, a coalition of Hispanic groups,  
is coordinating a two-week boycott of ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC to 
protest ``the continued invisibility of Latinos on television.'' 
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People says 
it will monitor how network shows incorporate minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Leguizamo said things are improving but not enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``The roles are still not breakthrough. They're not the upscale  
Latin people I meet in my life,'' he said. ``They don't represent 
the lawyers and doctors and writers who are making a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Raza counts just one Hispanic -- Martin Sheen, on NBC's ``The  
West Wing'' -- among the lead characters in the 38 new series 
premiering this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others continue on returning series: Bruno Campos (NBC's  
``Jesse''), and, on CBS, Hector Elizondo (``Chicago Hope'') and 
Cheech Marin (``Nash Bridges''). 
</P>
<P>
	After advocacy groups raised the issue, ABC in July said at  
least five of their shows would add minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Rock, who won an Emmy for writing in a variety or music  
show for his self-titled HBO show, said he doesn't pay much 
attention to the number of minorities on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``White people own it. They don't want us on it. That's fine,''  
the black comedian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Paris Barclay, who is black, credited Steven Bochco,  
whose company produces ``NYPD Blue,'' for offering more minority 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without Steven Bochco and his commitment to diversity, which  
to him means get the best people, look a little harder, I wouldn't 
be here, either,'' said Barclay. He earned his second consecutive 
Emmy for directing the police drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Halle Berry, presenting the award for miniseries or movie, said  
television has made some progress portraying blacks in positive 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
	She mentioned the TV movies ``Miss Evers' Boys'' about a study  
that denied treatment to black men suffering from syphilis, ``Don 
King: Only in America,'' and her own ``Introducing Dorothy 
Dandridge,'' about the first black woman nominated for a best 
actress Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many wonderful stories are just waiting to be told,'' Berry  
said. ``Getting them made and to the screen, that is our goal.''

                     *Bishop Alfred L. Abramowicz    	
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Bishop Alfred L. Abramowicz, known as an  
international advocate for the Polish Catholic community, died 
Sunday of cancer at age 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Abramowicz led the Catholic League for Religious Assistance to  
Poland for 35 years and was known for his tireless work for the 
Church of Poland while that country was under communist rule, 
friends and relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was auxiliary bishop emeritus of the Archdiocese of Chicago.  

</P>
<P>
                          *Enrique Alferez    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Enrique Alferez, an artist who gained almost  
as much fame for his travels with Pancho Villa as for his art deco 
sculptures that decorate the city of New Orleans, died Monday at 
age 98. 
</P>
<P>
	Over 20 of his works grace New Orleans City Park, and his  
sculptures mark numerous neighborhoods throughout the city, as well 
as in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In his mid-90s, Alferez produced three major statues on display  
in New Orleans, an 18-foot bronze of a woman playing the flute, a 
lute player and David with his slingshot. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 12, Alferez began serving with the Revolutionary forces.  
He was featured in a PBS special ``American Experience: The Hunt 
for Pancho Villa,'' as one of the last survivors of Villa's army. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Revolution, Alferez came to America. He arrived in New  
Orleans in 1929 to join Tulane University's expedition to Uxmal, 
Mexico, to reproduce the Quadrangle of the Nunnery for the 1933 
World's Fair in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides City Park, his works appear in The Times-Picayune  
building, Touro Infirmary, and the New Orleans Museum of Art, among 
other locations. He executed commissions across the United States 
and in Canada, South America, Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the ``Fountain of the Four Winds'' he created for New  
Orleans' Lakefront Airport in 1937 that gained him the most 
notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the four figures on the statue was a well-endowed nude  
male. Alferez was ordered to chisel off the genitalia. He refused, 
standing guard at the fountain with a rifle until then-First Lady 
Eleanor Roosevelt intervened on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans mayor Sidney Barthelemy presented him with a  
Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993. Later that year, a street was 
named for him in City Park. 

</P>
<P>
                        *Kenneth James Evans    	
</P>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Kenneth James Evans, a writer for the Las Vegas  
Review-Journal, died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound 
Friday, the newspaper reported. He was 46. 
</P>
<P>
	The death came only a day after the death of close friend,  
Rafael Tammariello, a columnist and editorial writer for the 
newspaper. Tammariello, 48, died of an apparent heart attack at his 
home Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans joined the Review-Journal in 1987 as a reporter for  
Nevadan, the newspaper's Sunday magazine, which ceased publication 
in 1990. In 1992, he became public information officer for the 
Nevada Commission on Tourism, a position he held for five years 
before rejoining the Review-Journal last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Kathy Reardon, a son and a daughter.

<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charles Hayward, a basketball player at  
North Carolina Charlotte, died Sunday of leukemia. He was 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward was admitted to the hospital in April and underwent a  
bone marrow transplant. Complications arose in July when Hayward's 
body began rejecting the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hayward came out of Louisiana in 1997, he was the highest  
rated recruit ever to sign with the 49ers. But North Carolina 
Charlotte's coaching staff noticed in preseason drills that he 
seemed constantly tired, so they sent him for a series of tests 
that showed he had acute myeloid leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward missed his freshman season while undergoing chemotherapy  
treatments. The 49ers, meantime, advanced to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	He was declared in remission in April 1998 and cleared to rejoin  
his teammates. But 10 games into the comeback, blood tests showed 
the leukemia had returned.

<P>
	PITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- David Karp, a novelist, screen and  
television writer, died Saturday of bladder cancer. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of a group of writers such as Paddy Chayesky, Horton  
Foote, Rod Serling and others, whose careers flourished during the 
1950's ``golden age'' of television writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the 1970s, Karp was a frequent contributor to such  
dramatic series as ``The Untouchables.'' He was also the author of 
several television series and movies. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an accomplished novelist who published more than a  
half-dozen books. His most successful novel, ``One,'' was a 
political science fiction story.

<P>
	FORT SMITH, Ark. (AP) -- Robert L. Nunley, former publisher of  
the Southwest Times Record and one of the builders of Donrey Media 
Group, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunley, who began his newspaper career as a temporary employee  
in Fort Smith, had many jobs prior to publishing. 
</P>
<P>

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stanley M. Simmons, who designed sets and  
costumes for Broadway shows and ballets, died Sept. 4 of heart 
failure. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	The designer created costumes for the original production of  
Tennessee Williams' ``Garden District'' and ``Bar of a Tokyo 
Hotel'' and for such musicals as ``Show Boat,'' ``The King and I,'' 
``Brigadoon'' and ``Lena: The Lady and Her Music.'' 
</P>

	He also designed costumes and sets for ``Coppelia'' and costumed  
major American ballet companies, including the Joffrey Ballet. He 
also collaborated with the choreographers Agnes de Mille and Jerome 
Robbins and worked on sets for ballet and opera productions at the 
Vienna State Opera and Spoleto Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons was known for creating dance costumes that embodied the  
essence of ballet, such as the free-flowing dress in Eliot Feld's 
``Meadowlark.''

<HEADLINE> Automakers, UAW Talks Secretive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With contracts set to expire at midnight,  
automakers and the United Auto Workers are pressing toward new 
agreements through talks that have been more amicable -- and more 
secretive -- than in years past. 
</P>
<P>
	After working through the weekend and bargaining at  
DaimlerChrysler AG late Monday night, negotiators were expected to 
reach an agreement soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's little information about proposals, progress or what  
issues still need to be decided for contracts covering 407,000 
workers. The UAW hasn't even said which company will get first 
crack at a new contract, and may not until a deal is reached with 
either General Motors Corp. or DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	``The UAW can play almost any game it wants,'' said retired  
Michigan State University labor professor Dale Brickner. ``The 
process has just changed dramatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While lower-level talks are under way at Ford Motor Co., the UAW  
has indicated that talks with Ford are behind other automakers due 
to Ford's plan to spin off its Visteon parts unit -- a move the UAW 
opposes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the union has extended contracts past the deadline.  
No extension has been made yet, but experts said a strike seems 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison to past negotiations, there's much less  
information available from either side about the state of 
negotiations. Neither side discusses the content of the talks, and 
leaks have been sharply reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Brickner said that was likely due to lessons from last year's  
UAW strike at two GM parts plants in Flint, which lasted 54 days 
and shut down most of GM's North American production. After trading 
barbs during the strike, officials from both sides vowed to improve 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Flint shutdown reinforced the need to bargain across the  
table and not negotiate a contract in public,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW has also altered the structure of the talks. In previous  
negotiations, one company was chosen as the target, and its 
contract set the trend in wages and benefits that other automakers 
were expected to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, UAW President Stephen P. Yokich has not announced  
a lead company, saying last week GM and DaimlerChrysler offered 
good first proposals, which union newsletters say include 
guarantees of lifetime employment for some workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor expert Harley Shaiken, a University of California-Berkeley  
professor who follows the UAW, said the strategy was unusual, but 
could help the union. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does offer the advantage in that you're making faster  
progress in two areas, and possibly if something comes up in one 
set of negotiations you can transfer to another,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been some indications about what the unions and  
automakers were debating: 
</P>
<P>
	-- GM has offered to guarantee lifetime employment for workers  
with at least 10 years of experience. The average GM hourly 
employee is over 48 years old with more than 23 years of 
experience. DaimlerChrysler reportedly has offered a similar 
proposal. In return, the companies would likely seek more 
flexibility in hiring or job rules. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The UAW has also sought higher wages with better yearly  
increases. Labor leaders have said workers are entitled to a share 
of automakers' profits, which hit record totals in 1998. The union 
has also asked GM for better overtime pay with more money and 
adding time off. In recent years, automakers have held down 
employment by increasing overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	-- According to union newsletters, the UAW also asked GM to take  
several steps to protect and expand union jobs. They include 
guaranteeing investment in unionized plants, a ban on shifting work 
from GM factories to outside suppliers and adopting a ``corporate 
code of conduct'' that includes a statement backing workers' rights 
to organize and join unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW has also discussed efforts to organize DaimlerChrysler's  
nonunion plants in the United States: a Mercedes-Benz plant making 
sport utility vehicles in Alabama and three commercial truck plants 
in the Carolinas.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Greer Hit in Eye by Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Texas Rangers outfielder Rusty Greer  
will return home after being hit in the left eye by a thrown ball 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greer is not expected to play again until this weekend, the  
Rangers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury happened during warmups before the Rangers' series  
finale with the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	An examination found no damage to the retina or optic nerve.  
Greer is being treated with ice and medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Rick Helling threw the ball while playing catch in the  
outfield, where Greer was shagging fly balls during the Rangers' 
batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Greer is batting .303 with 19 home runs and 95 runs batted in.  
</P>
<P>
	He was replaced in left field by Roberto Kelly, who moved over  
from center field. Tom Goodwin started in center field.

<HEADLINE> Pollution a Result of NATO Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The 78-day NATO bombing of  
Yugoslavia has left the country with environmental ``hotspots,'' a 
United Nations team of experts concluded Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no ecological catastrophes as a result of the  
bombing, but urgent action is needed to deal with pollution at 
certain locations, said the team's chief, Pekka Haavisto. 
</P>
<P>
	The team announced some of its findings Monday after completing  
its third and final investigative mission on the effects of the 
alliance's airstrikes here. 
</P>
<P>
	``The towns of Pancevo and Kragujevac are two hotspots of  
particular concern,'' Haavisto told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Both towns were repeatedly pounded by NATO. Pancevo's  
petrochemical plant and oil refinery were leveled in the process, 
as were the industrial complex and factories in Kragujevac, in 
central Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Also urgently in need of cleaning is a one-mile stretch of a  
heavily polluted canal that feeds into the Danube River, Haavisto 
said. Water and sediment there have become heavily polluted with 
mercury, dioxin and petrochemical waste. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Danube level significantly rises in the fall, the  
waters will flow with all these pollutants into the river,'' 
Haavisto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haavisto's team is comprised of independent scientists from  
across Europe working under U.N. auspices. Its first two trips in 
July dealt with industrial sites targeted by the bombings and the 
impact on the Danube. The third trip looked at other damage in 
Serbia, Montenegro and Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The experts also looked into rumors that NATO had used bombs  
containing uranium, a radioactive agent. Samples from the targeted 
locations are now undergoing laboratory analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The team did not disclose estimates on the environmental  
damage's economic impact. But Haavisto said any cleanup actions 
would be extremely costly. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's preliminary findings will be submitted to U.N.  
Secretary General Kofi Annan in early October.

<HEADLINE> End To Proposition 187 Battle OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge on Monday approved an  
agreement between state officials and civil rights groups to drop 
their court fight over Proposition 187, the voter-approved measure 
that sought to cut off many services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's announcement by Judge Pfaelzer is the final shovel of  
dirt on the grave of Proposition 187,'' said Mark Rosenbaum, legal 
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the agreement, the Pacific Legal Foundation, which  
represents the original sponsors of Proposition 187, has asked the 
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to allow enforcement of the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 187 would have denied public education, social  
services and non-emergency health care to illegal immigrants. It 
also would have required teachers, doctors and other service 
providers to report suspected illegal immigrants to federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer issued an  
injunction blocking enforcement of the measure, and in 1997, she 
ruled that it violated the U.S. Constitution and the federal 
government's authority to regulate immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	In July the administration of Democratic Gov. Gray Davis agreed  
with civil rights groups that the state should stop defending the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the judge approved the decision.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' QB Doubtful For Next Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Chris Chandler hobbled into work Monday, not  
knowing if he would have to call in sick a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Falcons quarterback, plagued by injuries throughout  
his career, severely strained his right hamstring Sunday in the 
season-opening 17-14 loss to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves listed Chandler as doubtful for next Monday  
night's game against Dallas. The quarterback said he would withhold 
judgment for a few more days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to tell this early in the week,'' Chandler said.  
``It's a real sharp pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won't try to practice until Thursday at the earliest. In the  
meantime, his hamstring will receive constant attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a selfish standpoint, it has been 11 years since I have  
played on `Monday Night Football.' I want to play,'' Chandler said. 
``From a team standpoint, I know we have a lot better chance when 
I'm out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler has been a Pro Bowl selection the last two seasons, but  
his 12-year career has been marred by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, he sprained his left shoulder and bruised ribs against  
New Orleans, forcing him to leave that game and miss the following 
week's contest against the Jets. The Falcons lost 28-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Four weeks later against Chicago, Chandler sprained his right  
knee and ankle, leaving that game and once again forcing him to sit 
out the next contest. The Falcons managed to beat the St. Louis 
Rams 21-10 behind backup quarterback Steve DeBerg. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler injured the same hamstring during a preseason practice  
and sat out an exhibition game three days later against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, those extra three or four days (before the Dallas  
game) will be beneficial,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Chandler can't play against the Cowboys, Tony Graziani will  
make the third start of his three-year career. The 25-year-old 
left-hander, a former seventh-round draft pick from Oregon, 
surprisingly beat out free agent signee Danny Kanell for the No. 2 
job during the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, Chris can play,'' Graziani said. ``If not, I'll be  
ready. I'm going to prepare this week like I'll be the starter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has a pitiful 24.4 rating in seven career games and beat out  
Kanell despite an injury plagued preseason. Graziani left a game 
after taking a poke in the eye, then missed another game with a 
hyperextended knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready,'' he insisted. ``Everything is more consistent.  
Everything is more accurate. I'm more familiar with the offense. 
I'm more familiar with the defenses. I just think I'm better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the injury, Chandler was able to put some nice moves on  
reporters who staked him out for an update. 
</P>
<P>
	He slipped into the training room for a dice game with  
teammates, then made a break for the meeting room while a 
back-pedaling cameraman rammed into a crane used for hoisting a 
camera above the practice field.

<HEADLINE> Arizona's Kealy May Play Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona State quarterback Ryan Kealy, who  
sprained his right knee last week, may be able to play against New 
Mexico State on Saturday, Sun Devils coach Bruce Snyder said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	If Kealy gets his 22nd start in 23 games, it will be another  
amazing medical achievement. The 6-foot-2, 200-pound junior had 
arthroscopic surgery to repair cartilage Sept. 7, and five days 
later was cleared for practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took a couple of days just to get around,'' Snyder said.  
``But he reported to the team yesterday evening and suited up -- we 
were in shoulder pads and shorts -- and he threw the ball around and 
did some light running. So I believe he's right on target in terms 
of recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 22nd-ranked Sun Devils (1-0) trailed Texas Tech 7-0 in the  
first quarter of their game on Labor Day when Kealy dropped back to 
pass and fell to the ground untouched, grabbing for his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Kealy has had reconstructive surgery on both knees, and had  
another arthroscopic surgery on the right knee less than a year 
ago. But it was the first time Snyder had seen him go down in a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes your breath away a little bit whenever it happens,  
and your first thought is for the athlete,'' Snyder said. ``It 
happened twice in practice. The difference was he was able to walk 
it off and shake the leg, be mad, kick the dirt and all that stuff 
you do when you don't like what just happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backup John Leonard went in after taking 30 seconds to find his  
helmet -- time that seemed like an eternity to Snyder -- and was 
7-of-17 for 117 yards and no interceptions as the Sun Devils came 
back to win 31-13. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard fumbled while setting up to pass in the fourth quarter  
and the Red Raiders returned it for their second touchdown. That 
convinced Snyder to take a look at Griffin Goodman, a transfer, who 
went 4-for-5 in his first major college action. 
</P>
<P>
	But the job belongs to Kealy whenever he's ready.  
</P>
<P>
	``We really believe that he has greatness in him,'' said Snyder,  
who planned to work Kealy with receivers only to minimize the 
chance of another injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to put him in a team setting where somebody  
might step on him or fall into him -- that sort of thing,'' Snyder 
said. ``That may change as the week goes on.''

<HEADLINE> Nursing Home Co. Vencor Files Ch.11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Vencor Inc., struggling under a mountain  
of debt and bad publicity, filed for bankruptcy Monday, the latest 
in a string of bad news for one of the nation's largest nursing 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Vencor filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware,  
reporting $1.4 billion in debts and $1.7 billion in assets, as it 
attempts to restructure its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In an after-hours hearing, Chief Judge Peter Walsh of the U.S.  
Bankruptcy Court signed orders approving a $45 million installment 
on $100 million in financing for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Vencor, which operates 293 nursing homes and 56 long term care  
hospitals in 46 states, has had difficulty paying rent at its 
facilities in recent months. Further dampening its turnaround 
hopes, the company agreed in April to repay Medicare for $90 
million in overpayments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisville-based company is the first large long-term care  
provider to file for bankruptcy, though it may not be the last -- 
several industry rivals are also in dire fiscal straits. 
</P>
<P>
	Vencor officials said it will continue to operate its facilities  
and care to its residents will not be affected. But patient 
advocates are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients and their families should be concerned,'' said Sarah  
Green Berger, executive director of the National Citizens Coalition 
for Nursing Home Reform in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would want to see the situation stabilized before I suggest  
anyone use a Vencor facility,'' Berger said. ``You don't buy health 
care from a company that is not in sound financial condition 
because they won't give quality care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said they directed state regulators to step up  
monitoring of Vencor's facilities because of the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Vencor officials would not return calls for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, Vencor has been mired in debt and dogged by  
allegations of Medicare fraud. The U.S. Justice Department joined a 
whistle-blower lawsuit in Florida this spring alleging the company 
overbilled Medicare program over the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Vencor on Monday said it is in negotiations with the U.S.  
Justice Department concerning the government's outstanding Medicare 
claims against the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Florida fined Vencor $270,000 for trying to evict 54  
poor residents in its Tampa facility to make room for more 
profitable patients who could pay with their own money or who have 
private insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin regulators fined Vencor more than $300,000 last year  
for a host of problems found in its facilities including residents 
wandering away from the home and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
	Vencor is one of several large nursing home providers facing  
financial problems after the federal government changed its 
Medicare payment system. Medicare used to pay the facilities a 
daily rate to cover the cost of treating residents, but last year 
started paying the facilities a set rate based on the patient's 
diagnosis. Medicare also greatly curtailed its coverage of 
rehabilitation therapy to residents, which had been a major source 
of revenue for the nursing home providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the large nursing home chains are highly leveraged,  
and with falling Medicare payments, the companies have faced 
troubles repaying their loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vencor is the first chapter. There will be other  
restructurings and bankruptcies,'' said John Ransom, analyst for 
Raymond James &AMP; Associates 
</P>
<P>
	Ransom said Vencor underestimated its Medicare cuts.  
</P>
<P>
	Vencor lost $651.5 million last year and had $382.3 million in  
debt, according to bankruptcy documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported owing $300 million to Chase Manhattan Bank  
and $82.3 million to Mutual of Omaha Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Vencor split in 1998, creating real estate investment trust  
Ventas Inc, a move Vencor's top executives later acknowledged was a 
mistake. Vencor also owes Ventas $18.9 million in back rent for 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Vencor's stock was delisted from the New York Stock  
Exchange and is now quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board 
system. Vencor shares were down 16 cents, or more than 60 percent, 
at 10 cents in Monday trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the creditor agreement approved Monday, Vencor will pay  
Ventas $15.1 million a month in rent, reducing by 20 percent the 
original contract payout. Ventas will receive 15 percent of the 
equity in a reorganized Vencor. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrangements with other creditors include paying pre-petition  
bank lenders $320 million on their claim of $520 million. The banks 
will receive a 56 percent stake in the reorganized company. 
</P>
<P>
	Vencor plans to incorporate the agreement with its creditors  
into a reorganization plan that would allow the company to emerge 
from Chapter 11 protection in six months.

<HEADLINE> Hershey Projects Earnings Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Hershey Foods said it will fall short of  
earnings expectations for the quarter and its fiscal year because 
of delivery problems caused by startup of new business systems in 
customer service, warehousing and order fulfillment 
</P>
<P>
	The chocolate maker said earnings for the fiscal year that ends  
Jan. 4, 2000, could be 8 to 10 percent below previous projections 
of $2.40 per share. The firm declined to project earnings for the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershey's stock closed at $51.43 3/4, down 37 1/2 cents on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth L. Wolfe said  
deliveries would be not be back on schedule until mid-October, the 
height of the Halloween season, one of the company's biggest 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
	John M. McMillin, who follows the food industry for Prudential  
Securities Inc. said he was not surprised by the losses, but was 
surprised by their size. He said having the problems fall during a 
busy season is especially damaging. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a candy company to miss part of Halloween is not as bad as  
a toy company missing part of Christmas, but it's close,'' McMillin 
said.

Gore reached out to organized labor Monday, telling delegates to 
the Tennessee AFL-CIO convention that he will work to protect the 
rights of unions and improve education and job-training programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president did not mention his Democratic opponent,  
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, who also is courting union 
support. Instead, Gore focused his rhetoric against the 
Republican-controlled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first step we have to take, which I strongly support, is  
to get rid of this striker replacement tactic,'' Gore said as the 
audience of about 300 stood and cheered. Current law allows 
companies to hire permanent replacements for workers who strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also need to defeat the so-called paycheck deception, which  
they're trying to pass,'' Gore said as the ovation continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, including GOP presidential front-runner George W.  
Bush, want to force unions to get approval from members before 
spending any of their dues on political endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore told delegates ``the single most important investment in  
the future is bringing about revolutionary improvements in public 
schools, opening doors to colleges and technology schools, and 
making it possible to have lifelong learning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said unions have long led the fight for businesses to provide  
on-the-job training to help workers keep up with technological 
improvements, but ``the country has to face up to this trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also asked for union assistance in the fight over how to  
spend the nation's budget surplus and in reforming health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``By joining heads and hearts and working on behalf of working  
families we can create a future that's worthy of our children,'' 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore hopes to gain the endorsement of the AFL-CIO at the labor  
federation's national convention in October. Earlier this month in 
Iowa, Gore walked side-by-side with AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer 
Richard Trumka, who spoke approvingly of Gore's bid for the 
Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore flew back to Washington late Monday evening to court  
Hispanic voters at a gala for the National Hispanic Foundation for 
the Arts. The vice president told the group he shared the 
organization's mission of reaching the day when ``our American 
culture fully reflects the full diversity of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also deplored the lack of diversity in the mainstream  
media. He said Latinos made up only 3 1/2 percent of last year's movie 
and television roles -- and ``that's unacceptable to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in Tennessee, Curtis Burnett, president of the local  
stagehands' union in Memphis, said he's leaning toward Gore in the 
Democratic primary race but has yet to make up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if Mr. Bradley has got more on the ball than Mr. Gore,  
I'll have to go for him,'' Burnett said. ``I don't lock myself in 
on one person. I've got a family to look after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley and Gore angered unions by supporting the North American  
Free Trade Agreement, which lowered tariffs and eased regulatory 
hurdles to increase trade among the United States, Mexico and 
Canada. Unions feared the loss of U.S. jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Othal Smith of Nashville, vice president of the International  
Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Shipbuilders, Blacksmiths, 
Forgers and Helpers, said Gore is ``not a yes man for the unions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he votes his conscience and has always done what he  
thinks will be best for both labor and management,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has thought about voting for Bradley, who had a strong  
pro-labor voting record in the Senate, but said Gore is more 
qualified, especially with his experience in foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Bradley would make a fine president, but Al Gore would be  
better,'' Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Smith Will Report to Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The season has begun and Mark Smith still is  
holding out for a better contract from the Arizona Cardinals, 
although his agent said Monday that the defensive tackle will 
eventually join the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a certain point, he will go in,'' Gil Thompson said. ``He  
would be stupid not to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, the impasse between the third-year player and the  
Cardinals continues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're evaluating the situation week to week,'' Thompson said.  
``He's not coming in this week and he has no plans to come in next 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals at one time had increased their offer to Smith to  
$500,000, but since have retreated to their original tender offer 
of $325,000. At the lower rate, Smith is losing just over $20,000 
for each game he misses. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said he had reduced Smith's demand from just over $1  
million to $795,000 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I was willing to negotiate more to get him in before the  
season started,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, the Cardinals refused to budge.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, the agent said, Smith is so upset that he wonders if he  
really wants to play for the franchise at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other issues now,'' Thompson said, ``such as how  
committed is this team to winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got 31 teams in the NFL, and 30 of them are committed  
to winning. This is the only one that doesn't want to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith doesn't have many options. As a third-year player, he  
must be on the team for at least six games to become a restricted 
free agent after this season. Even then, if another team signs him 
after this season, Arizona would get compensation in the form of 
draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chances are, Smith is tied to the Cardinals for the next two  
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals general manager Bob Ferguson was not in his office  
Monday and was not available to comment. During the telecast of 
Arizona's season opener against Philadelphia, Ferguson said the 
club was talking with Smith and the other contract holdout, 
first-round draft pick L.J. Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	But, at least in Smith's case, that's not true, Thompson said.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no talking going on,'' Thompson said, ``and 90 percent  
of the talking that has gone on in the past was instigated by us.''

<HEADLINE> Beekeeper Dies After 50 Stings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- An 83-year-old beekeeper attacked two  
weeks ago by a swarm of Africanized ``killer'' bees has died. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgil Foster was believed to be the first person in California  
killed in an attack of ``killer'' bees, and the seventh in the 
Southwest. But a decision on the cause of his death awaits an 
autopsy by the Los Angeles County coroner. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster died Saturday at a hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	He was mowing his lawn Aug. 31 when he was stung at least 50  
times by the highly aggressive bees, which had taken over hives on 
his property. 
</P>
<P>
	``Multiple stings represent a condition of an increasing number  
of doses of bee toxins,'' city health officer Darryl Sexton said. 
``Africanized honeybees and European honeybees have the same dosage 
of toxins. The lethalness comes in the increasing number of 
stings.''

<HEADLINE> Ricky Rudd Joining Robert Yates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Ricky Rudd set in motion the end of his  
existence as an owner-driver on NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit, 
signing Monday to join Robert Yates Racing next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The multiyear deal matches the driver who has established  
himself as one of the most consistent winners on the circuit with 
the owner who already fields cars for 1999 Winston Cup points 
leader Dale Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd said his decision was based on the strength of Yates'  
two-car operation, combined with his own difficulties in trying to 
survive as an independent in a sport ruled by multi-car teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at my driving career and I probably have three to five  
good years left,'' the 43-year-old Rudd said during a news 
conference at Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte. ``I want to win a 
championship really bad before I step aside, and I've got a few 
more races I want to try to win. So it became very frustrating as 
an owner, fighting that battle and seeing the time clock starting 
to tick and knowing that I'm a couple years away even if I had all 
the people it took to do the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd figures his chances will improve considerably by going to  
work for Yates, whose cars have won 44 Winston Cup races, including 
four this year by Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd has won 20 times on NASCAR's premier series. He has at  
least one victory in each of the last 16 years, a Winston Cup 
record that he can add to by winning one of the last nine races on 
the 1999 calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has found his energy and resources drained since forming  
his own team in June 1993. Instead of focusing solely on his 
driving duties and helping the crew figure out how to get the car 
to go faster, Rudd has been diluted by also having to deal with 
personnel matters, taxes, sponsorship issues and the like. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so glad I won't have to worry about all that,'' he said.  
``I can just concentrate on driving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd has already resolved a portion of the issue of what will  
happen to his 6-year-old team. His new driving deal calls for Yates 
to take over Rudd's six acres of land and 30,000 square-foot race 
shop in the north Charlotte suburb of Mooresville. 
</P>
<P>
	Yates was interested in acquiring the land and shop because he  
is currently running the team out of leased space and is interested 
in someplace more permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	That still leaves the question of Rudd's 45 employees, but he  
doesn't anticipate they will have a problem finding work. Rudd's 
shop is located in Lakeside Park, a sprawling campus that is home 
to several dozen Winston Cup and Busch Grand National teams as well 
as numerous related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd suspects a number of his employees will land at RYR, and as  
he noted, such a development wouldn't be unusual. Rudd for years 
has lamented losing key employees to bigger, better financed 
operations, including RYR, and he made light of that matter again 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I know this is going to work,'' Rudd said with a  
smile, ``is we've been the training ground for Robert Yates Racing 
for the last few yeas. We've been their employment warehouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That so-called warehouse hasn't necessarily translated into  
victories. Rudd is replacing Kenny Irwin, who is leaving Yates 
after two seasons in which he has no victories and numerous wrecks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The performance hasn't been everything we want it to be at  
times,'' Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco, one of Yates' main sponsors, apparently agrees with the  
move to have Rudd replace Irwin. The company announced Monday that 
its sponsorship agreement, which was to expire after the 2000 
season, has been extended through 2004.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks Sign Former 49ers FS Hanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks announced Monday  
they have signed former San Francisco free safety Merton Hanks, who 
was released last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanks spent eight seasons with the 49ers and was selected to  
four Pro Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	With the 49ers, he played in 125 games, including 109 starts,  
and made 31 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seattle, where the secondary is made up of Shawn Springs and  
Willie Williams at cornerback and Darryl Williams and Jay Bellamy 
at safety, Hanks will be used in the team's nickel defense, when 
the Seahawks go to five defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have pretty good guys in the secondary and he knows that,''  
Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren said. ``But he also knows that we run 
five and six defensive backs in there a lot. I feel very fortunate 
to have him. He will help us.''

<HEADLINE> Osuna Will Have Tommy John Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Reliever Antonio Osuna, who hasn't pitched  
for the Los Angeles Dodgers since May, is scheduled to undergo 
reconstructive surgery Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old right-hander, who had been balking at the  
possibility of surgery in recent weeks, finally decided to have the 
operation after feeling pain Sunday while trying to throw a 90-mph 
fastball in a rehab assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Frank Jobe will perform the procedure at Centinela Hospital.  
During the 90-minute operation, a ligament will be taken from 
Osuna's left wrist and placed in his pitching elbow. An MRI early 
last month revealed a partial tear. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobe, who also performed this landmark operation on Orel  
Hershiser and others, estimated that it would be at least a year 
until Osuna can pitch in a major league game again. 
</P>
<P>
	Osuna, who was placed on the disabled list for the third time  
this season on May 18, pitched in just five games for the Dodgers 
in his fifth major league season.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cop Gets Prison for Bank Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former police officer who allegedly robbed  
a bank of $722,000 while he was on the force was sentenced Monday 
to 14 years and three months in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	David Anthony Mack, 38, robbed a Bank of America branch in 1997  
with the help of an assistant manager with whom he had carried on a 
seven-year affair, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack was convicted in March. His alleged accomplice, Errolyn  
Romero, 27, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and could be senteced 
to up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi ordered Mack to repay the  
stolen money, most of which has not been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack's attorney, Donald Re, said he would appeal the conviction.  
</P>
<P>
	Mack was a track star at the University of Oregon and was among  
the world's top 800-meter runners in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	During his nine-year career with the Los Angeles Police  
Department, Mack was credited with saving his partner's life by 
killing a drug dealer in 1993. The officer who was saved, Rafael A. 
Perez, 32, pleaded guilty last month to possession of cocaine taken 
from police evidence lockers.

<HEADLINE> Tests on Moore's Knee Awaited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Detroit wide receiver Herman Moore could  
miss at least four weeks after injuring his knee in the 
season-opening win at Seattle, coach Bobby Ross said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, in his ninth NFL season, underwent an MRI on Monday at  
Henry Ford Hospital. Lions officials did not immediately reveal the 
findings of the MRI or how soon they might be announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm figuring four weeks, maybe five,'' Ross said Monday as the  
Lions continued preparing to play host to Green Bay on Sunday. 
``He's certainly not going to start next week, I know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore sprained his left knee in the first quarter against the  
Seahawks when guard Tony Semple fell into Moore. Moore did not 
return in the 28-20 victory, snapping his streak of 107 consecutive 
games with a catch. 
</P>
<P>
	His reception streak is tied for the 10th longest in NFL  
history. It was the second longest active streak going into Sunday 
behind San Francisco's Jerry Rice, who has caught passes in 193 
straight games.

<HEADLINE> 24 Convicted for Chiapas Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- A former mayor accused  
of helping a pro-government squad massacre 45 Indians in the 
southern state of Chiapas in 1997 was sentenced Monday to 35 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacinto Arias Cruz, who in 1997 was the mayor of the county  
where the massacre took place, was found guilty of helping 
paramilitary groups obtain arms and vehicles to operate in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	A district court in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the Chiapas state capital,  
also sentenced 23 other men. They were convicted of homicide, 
assault and weapons charges in connection with the massacre, the 
federal Attorney General's Office said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 22, 1997, men armed with machetes, assault rifles and  
hunting guns slaughtered 45 men, women and children as they prayed 
for peace in a church. The massacre in Acteal -- a village 
supportive of the leftist Zapatista rebels -- provoked international 
outrage and demands for the government to crack down on 
paramilitary groups that back the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The Attorney General's Office said a total of 102 people have  
been arrested in connection with the massacre. Fifty-five have been 
convicted and sentenced so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for the Zapatista rebels runs high in Chiapas. In  
January 1994, the rebels staged a brief armed uprising here to 
demand greater rights and democracy for Chiapas' impoverished 
Indian communities. Peace talks with the government have been 
stalled since mid-1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions have risen in recent weeks, with rebel supporters in  
remote jungle villages complaining of increased military activity 
and saying they fear impending attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has denied it intends to take action against the  
communities and has called for resumption of negotiations with the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Zapatista supporters blocked main Chiapas highways Monday to  
demand the military withdraw from pro-Zapatista regions. Men, women 
and children sat or lay on principle roads, blocking hundreds of 
motorists for up to 16 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	A protest spokeswoman who identified herself as Juana Maria said  
the action was ``the response of the Zapatistas and the civilian 
society to the federal government's open letter to restart the 
peace process ... (which) does not include stopping the Mexican 
army's advance on indigenous communities.''

<HEADLINE> Jaeger In, Gowins Out for Bears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- The Chicago Bears re-signed veteran  
kicker Jeff Jaeger, just two days after they released him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Brian Gowins, already cut once by the Bears this season,  
was waived again. He could be re-signed to the practice squad when 
he clears waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go the same way we did a week ago,'' coach Dick  
Jauron said. ``So Jeff will be back. He's going to kick 
periodically through the week and we'll see how he goes. Brian will 
kick through the week and we'll make a decision later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears also are bringing in former Auburn kicker Jaret Holmes  
on Tuesday for a workout. Holmes was waived by Buffalo last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuffle is because of Jaeger's hip injury, which caused him  
to miss nearly all of training camp. Jaeger, one of only six 
kickers to connect on at least 80 percent of his field-goal 
attempts the past three seasons, injured his left hip the first 
full week of training camp and missed the next three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	He was supposed to return for the Bears' third preseason game  
against St. Louis, but reinjured the hip in pregame warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a situation where if something works out, we'll see what  
happens,'' said Jaeger, who made 61-of-75 field goals and led the 
Bears in scoring the past three years. ``I can't say for certain 
that in two weeks or three weeks I'll be 100 percent. Once I start 
kicking, the healing will slow down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can function and be able to kick, but I won't be 100  
percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gowins, who kicked on Northwestern's Rose Bowl team, was signed  
when Jaeger reinjured the hip. He was cut, re-signed to the 
practice squad and moved to the active roster Saturday. He kicked 
two extra points and field goals of 21 and 24 yards Sunday in the 
Bears' 20-17 victory over Kansas City.

<HEADLINE> Nets' Williams Having More Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Nets center Jayson  
Williams, who is battling to return from a career-threatening leg 
injury, will have more surgery on his right knee on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The arthroscopic surgery will be done to clean out loose  
particles, general manager John Nash said in a statement released 
by the team late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, an All-Star in 1997-98 and one of the NBA's top  
rebounders, broke his right leg and partially tore knee cartilage 
in a collision with teammate Stephon Marbury during a game against 
Atlanta on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams underwent surgery the next day to repair the displaced  
fracture as well as the cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Russell Warren, who performed the surgery, told the team at  
the time that a second surgery would be needed sometime during the 
rehabilitation, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jayson has been making good progress,'' Nash said. ``Dr.  
Warren felt the procedure was necessary at this time to allow the 
leg to continue to fully rehabilitate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warren will perform the surgery Tuesday at the Hospital for  
Special Surgery in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In 30 games last season, Williams averaged 12 points and 8.1  
rebounds. He was leading the league in offensive rebounds at the 
time he was hurt.

<HEADLINE> Best Known Rock Station Goes Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rock 'n' roll station WNEW-FM, which in 32 years  
has introduced New York-area listeners to everyone from Jimi 
Hendrix to Hootie and the Blowfish, is switching to an all-talk 
format. 
</P>
<P>
	WNEW hopes the move to ``Talk You Can't Ignore,'' as the new  
format will be called, will boost the ratings, which have been 
sagging for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``People understand there is not an FM talk station like this in  
New York, and this is in response to listener demand,'' said Dana 
McClintock, vice president for communications at the station's 
parent, CBS Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the transition was to take place at 5:30 p.m.  
Monday, there were hints on 102.7 FM of what was in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The station was still punctuating breaks between feverish Allman  
Brothers guitar bursts with the suddenly ironic slogan, ``Always, 
always, rock, rock.'' Daytime disc jockey Matt Devoti offered a 
``tribute to the '90s'' featuring acts he had showcased since 
joining the station in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had some of the most loyal listeners, and I have many  
fond memories,'' Devoti said over the opening of ``Roll the Bones'' 
by Rush. ``This is the station that introduced Pearl Jam, Nirvana, 
Hootie and the Blowfish, played them first in New York. It's been 
the ride of a lifetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the change seemed certain to upset the station's longtime  
listeners, the problem was that there weren't enough of them. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years WNEW had seen its share of the competitive New  
York radio audience cut in half, from 3 percent to 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new talk format is geared to men ages 25 to 49. It will  
offer commentators and talk show personalities whose main themes 
include relationships, money, health and other aspects of 
``everyday life of the '90s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anchor program in afternoon drive time will be the duo of  
Opie and Anthony, who have promised ``hot chicks galore'' and other 
excitement.

<HEADLINE> Medical Marijuana Issue Raised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court Monday raised the  
possibility that clubs that provide medical marijuana might be 
reopened, saying ``medical necessity'' could make some patients 
exempt from laws against pot. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rebuff to the Clinton administration, the 9th U.S. Circuit  
Court of Appeals told a judge who had issued an injunction against 
such groups to consider exempting patients and doctors who could 
show ``medical necessity.'' The injunction against six medical 
marijuana clubs had been issued at the request of the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The court did not order the exception but said there was  
evidence that would justify it. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the six Northern California clubs, the Oakland Cannabis  
Buyers' Cooperative, ``has identified a strong public interest in 
the availability of a doctor-prescribed treatment that would help 
ameliorate the condition and relieve the pain and suffering of a 
large group of persons with serious or fatal illnesses,'' the court 
said in a 3-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The court noted that the ``necessity'' defense -- showing that  
breaking the law was the only way to prevent a more serious harm -- 
would be available if federal authorities prosecuted patients or 
club officials for violating federal drug laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the government sought an injunction against future  
lawbreaking instead of prosecuting anyone, the order should be 
worded to exclude conduct that likely would be allowed if a person 
cited the necessity defense at trial, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	To be eligible for such an exemption, patients would have to  
show that they have tried legal alternatives to marijuana and found 
that they don't work or cause intolerable side effects, the court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was applauded by Robert Raich, a lawyer for the  
Oakland cooperative, which served about 2,000 patients before being 
closed by court order last year. It later reopened as a center for 
hemp products and patient support, but not for marijuana 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 9th Circuit is correctly recognizing that cannabis has  
medical efficacy to a large class of patients and that it should be 
recognized under federal law under the medical necessity defense,'' 
Raich said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ruling could lead to the reopening of the Oakland  
cooperative for the limited number of patients who could show 
medical necessity. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was immediately available at the Justice Department to  
respond to the ruling, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical marijuana clubs sprang up around California after the  
November 1996 approval of Proposition 215, which allowed patients 
with serious illnesses to obtain and use marijuana at their 
doctors' recommendation without being prosecuted under state law. 
The drug is used to relieve pain and other effects of AIDS, cancer 
and certain other diseases and their treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department responded by suing six Northern  
California clubs, saying the absolute federal ban on marijuana 
distribution overrode Proposition 215. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer agreed, issuing a contempt  
order last year that forced four of the clubs to stop distributing 
marijuana. Two of the clubs, in Fairfax and Ukiah remain open 
because the government failed to present evidence that they were 
distributing marijuana at the time. Other informal organizations 
scattered around the state also continue to supply medicinal 
marijuana.

<HEADLINE> Report: China To Ban Web Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- In a step with implications for one of China's  
fastest-growing industries, a senior official says the government 
will start enforcing its ban on foreign investment in Internet 
services, a newspaper reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several major Chinese Internet companies already are part-owned  
by foreign Internet or media firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current policy does not allow that. We will correct these  
irregularities,'' Telecommunications Minister Wu Jichuan was quoted 
as saying in an interview Monday with the British newspaper the 
Financial Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Wu did not say how the ban would affect ownership of Chinese  
Internet companies that are based overseas or have sold shares on 
foreign stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement is in line with China's resistance to a foreign  
role in telecommunications and other high-tech industries that it 
regards as strategically important. 
</P>
<P>
	The government last year barred the use of an investment  
mechanism that had let foreign telephone companies become minority 
partners in Chinese phone services, evading a ban on foreign 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Internet users in China surged past 4 million in  
June, up from 2.1 million at the end of last year, according to the 
China Internet Network Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	That explosive growth made the first overseas listing by a  
Chinese Internet company in July a huge success. Foreign investors 
snapped up shares in Hong Kong-based China.com worth $96.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Internet access provider American Online Inc. owns 8  
percent of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones and Co., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has  
a minority stake in Beijing-based Internet service Sohu.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``China's government still needs to strengthen its management  
over the information content business,'' Wu was quoted as telling 
the Financial Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, whether or not it is an ICP (Internet content provider) or  
an ISP (Internet service provider), it is about value-added 
services. In China, the service area is not open.''

<HEADLINE> Politicians Faced With Lie Detectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) -- Congressional candidates in Youngstown  
are facing the issue of whether to submit to a lie detector test 
about their ties to organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The suggestion was made Sunday by a political columnist for The  
Vindicator of Youngstown and backed Monday by one candidate, State 
Sen. Robert Hagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Traficant, who was acquitted of taking bribes from  
mobsters before being elected, refused to take the test and 
Mahoning County Auditor George Tablack said he would consider it. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thinks Traficant has some tie to organized crime,  
Hagan said, ``I don't know if there is one now, but I'm suspicious 
of the congressman's actions in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traficant was elected to Congress in 1985 after he was acquitted  
of taking bribes from mobsters in 1983 when he was Mahoning County 
sheriff. The county includes Youngstown, where Mafia families from 
Cleveland and Pittsburgh long fought for control, breeding crime 
and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	His spokesman, Paul Marcone, said the congressman does not  
intend to take a test. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took a lie detector test back in the early 1980s before his  
trial and he does not intend to take another one,'' Marcone said.

<HEADLINE> 3Com To Spin Off Palm Computer Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street investors are among the most loyal  
users of 3Com's popular Palm electronic organizer. But now they get 
to vote about how the gadget really stacks up against the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years after creating the handheld computer market, 3Com  
Corp. plans to spin off its Palm computing unit into a separate 
public company, hoping to unleash a flood of investment capital to 
fund the fight against a slew of newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	3Com hopes separating the two companies will help it focus on  
its main business of selling computer modems and networking 
equipment, such as routers that help data move between computers. 
Despite its popularity as the No. 1 handheld computer, the Palm 
never really drew investors to 3Com in part because it didn't 
complement the company's other products. 
</P>
<P>
	3Com said Monday it wants to launch an initial public offering  
early next year, selling 20 percent of Palm to investors. The deal 
could value the new company anywhere from $5 billion to $10 
billion, analysts estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Palm was creating a huge distraction for 3Com, which found  
itself caught between two mostly unrelated business models,'' said 
Rob Enderle, an industry analyst with the Giga Information 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors welcomed the IPO announcement. 3Com's stock soared 6  
percent, or $1.62 1/2, to $28.87 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4 million Palms have been sold since their introduction in  
1995, becoming a sort of mobile badge for on-the-go professionals 
seeking a convenient way to store contacts, appointments and notes. 
The product accounted for $570 million in fiscal 1999 sales at the 
Santa Clara, Calif.-based 3Com, or 10 percent of the company's 
total revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the Palm comprised 40.1 percent of worldwide sales of  
handheld computers last year, that was down from 41.2 percent in 
1997, according to the Dataquest research company. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the figures, a crop of rival machines that look just like  
the Palm -- many of which run on Microsoft's Windows CE software -- 
are vying to usurp the 3Com's crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Windows rivals tout the advantage of Microsoft's ubiquitous  
operating software over 3Com's proprietary system. With the Windows 
system running the basic functions of the new gadgets, the idea is 
to prod many of the myriad developers who write programs for 
Windows-based desktop computers to also write for the pocket-sized 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Windows-based machines, Palm faces competition  
from a new low-priced personal digital assistant created by the 
Palm's creators, who struck out on their own last year. Handspring 
Inc., based in Mountain View, Calif., is expected to announce on 
Tuesday its new Visor is targeted to everyday consumers, instead of 
the mobile professionals loyal to the Palm computer. 
</P>
<P>
	3Com's stock price has lagged that of its largest rival, Cisco  
Systems Inc., and is trading at little more than half where it was 
at the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, owning Palm may have hindered 3Com's ability to work  
together with Microsoft Corp., a Palm rival, to enable 3Com's 
networking products to work well with Windows-based desktop 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Palm is striving to expand a new strategy of licensing out its  
operating system to other gadget makers, including Handspring. 
Within two years, the company's revenue from hardware, or selling 
the Palm gadgets, is expected to be surpassed by revenue from 
licensing fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Platform OS licensing is the essential ingredient to the 'Palm  
economy' '' 3Com chief executive Eric Benhamou said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	3Com is still searching for a chief executive to lead the new  
Palm company. James L. Barksdale, the former Netscape 
Communications Corp. chief executive and a 3Com director, along 
with Gordon A. Campbell, president and chairman of Techfarm Inc. 
and a 3Com director, will join Palm's board.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two international newspapers announced Monday that  
they are teaming up to improve their distribution and boost their 
readership. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times and The Christian Science Monitor have  
entered an 18-month agreement in which the Financial Times will 
assist the Monitor in converting a majority of its subscribers from 
mail delivery to home delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Monitor will work to improve the mail delivery of  
the Financial Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we push forward to 100,000 circulation in 1999 and  
appreciably beyond that in 2000, we are delighted to have this 
mutually advantageous partnership with The Christian Science 
Monitor,'' said Stuart Arnold, managing director of the Financial 
Times, in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The home office of the Financial Times is in London, with the  
headquarters for its 80,000-circulation North American edition in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity to put the Monitor in readers' hands first  
thing in the morning is a huge gain. It will enable us to reach 
them when we can make the biggest contribution to their day,'' said 
Stephen Gray, managing publisher of Boston-based Christian Science 
Monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monitor said home delivery in New York and Boston has been  
shown to improve reader satisfaction. Current circulation for the 
Monitor is 73,000.

<HEADLINE> 3 Lead In Baltimore Mayoral Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Twenty-three candidates are vying for the  
Republican and Democratic nominations for mayor Tuesday in the 
first time in nearly three decades that an incumbent isn't on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	The packed field has yielded three clear frontrunners -- all  
Democrats -- and the winner of that primary is expected to prevail 
in the November general election. Democrats outnumber Republicans 9 
to 1 in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	The position is vacant because Kurt Schmoke, the city's first  
elected black mayor, is stepping down after three terms. Baltimore 
has a rejuvenated downtown but many of the same problems it had 
when Schmoke took office -- poor schools, a high drug-driven murder 
rate, and a fleeing populace. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the key issues are urban renewal and the police. Race is  
also likely to be a factor -- 65 percent of residents and 60 percent 
of registered voters are black. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the three frontrunners, white City Council member Martin  
O'Malley, has promoted a zero-tolerance strategy in which police 
would aggressively pursue even minor offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Another leading candidate, school board member Carl Stokes, who  
is black, has come out against zero-tolerance, calling it a 
euphemism for targeting blacks and Latinos. He has pushed school 
reform and a plan to redevelop neighborhoods outside of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been hurt by revelations that he did not graduate from  
college as his campaign literature said and that he did not pay 
taxes for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	City Council President Lawrence Bell, once the clear  
frontrunner, slipped badly in the wake of revelations about his 
personal financial troubles and an incident in which some of his 
campaign workers disrupted an O'Malley appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who also is black, has called for zero-tolerance policing  
but said he wants police recruits to mirror the city's 
demographics. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has threatened to sue banks and other financial  
institutions to ensure compliance with the Community Reinvestment 
Act, the federal law aimed at fighting discrimination by mortgage 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most recent poll, in late August, Stokes and O'Malley  
were virtually tied. Stokes had the support of 32 percent of those 
surveyed, O'Malley was picked by 30 percent and Bell 20 percent. 
The margin of error was 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The field of 17 Democrats and six Republicans also includes  
candidates with arrest and bankruptcy records, such as Phillip A. 
Brown Jr., who has been convicted of larceny, shoplifting and 
impersonating a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Another candidate, Dorothy Jennings, was arrested on burglary  
charges during her campaign after police recognized her during a TV 
appearance. She was later disqualified because she failed to file 
campaign disclosure forms.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women with embryos left over from infertility  
treatments should be allowed to donate them to taxpayer-funded 
medical research -- meaning a federal law that prohibits such 
research should be changed, President Clinton's top ethics advisers 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Bioethics Advisory Commission's report comes even  
though the White House previously indicated it disagrees with that 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are embryonic stem cells, unique ``master cells'' that  
in early embryos generate all the other tissues of the body. Stem 
cells are causing huge scientific excitement, because researchers 
hope the cells one day could regenerate body parts or create new 
therapies for Alzheimer's and other devastating diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	But their use has raised troubling ethical questions, because  
culling stem cells destroys the embryo. Federal law prohibits 
taxpayer-funded human embryo research, and about 75 members of 
Congress have opposed a move to get around that prohibition to 
enable the National Institutes of Health to study the cells' 
medical potential. 
</P>
<P>
	So Clinton ordered his ethics advisers to study how the nation  
should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the cells' great promise, the panel said embryos left  
over from infertility treatment -- which otherwise would be thrown 
away -- should be allowed to be donated to taxpayer-funded 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately funded researchers last year culled stem cells from  
donated embryos, and multiplied the cells in a laboratory. Despite 
the federal law, the NIH contends it would be legal for its 
researchers to use those lab-grown supplies because government 
scientists never touched the original embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ethics panel said that relying on those supplies ``could  
severely limit scientific and clinical progress'' because more 
embryos may be needed. The federal ban should be changed because it 
``conflicts with several of the ethical goals of medicine ... 
especially healing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Embryos could not be sold, and couples could not be pressured to  
donate, the panel stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued a statement thanking the ethicists for ``a  
thoughtful report.'' But the White House in July said it didn't 
plan to try to get the law changed, instead backing the NIH 
proposal.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Groups Push for Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hundreds of farmers lobbied lawmakers Monday  
for an overhaul of the market-oriented farm reforms of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is pressing for such short-term solutions as the  
Senate-passed $7.4 billion emergency aid package and long-term 
solutions to lessen a worldwide oversupply of grain that has driven 
down prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``These assistance packages are kind of a Band-Aid, but it's not  
even enough of a Band-Aid to stop the major bleeding that we've got 
going on,'' said Dave Carter, president of the Denver-based Rocky 
Mountain Farmers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers from California to Pennsylvania descended on lawmakers'  
offices one day before a House Agriculture Committee hearing on the 
troubled farm economy. Commodity prices are down for the second 
year because of the grain glut. 
</P>
<P>
	``What sense does it make to stay the course when the farm  
program has failed farmers two years in a row?'' said Leland 
Swenson, president of the National Farmers Union, which has 
traditionally aligned with Democrats on agricultural policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the short term, the NFU and other groups that represent  
smaller-scale farms are pushing to change the way disaster payments 
are allocated to producers. In the long term, the groups want more 
tools to help producers survive depressed prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1996, prices have dropped 42 percent for wheat, 39 percent  
for corn and 26 percent for soybeans, according to 1999 
projections, while wheat stocks have doubled, soybean stocks have 
tripled and corn stocks have grown fourfold. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law removed planting restrictions and reduced  
crop-based farm subsidies. Critics say that left them without 
adequate assistance when prices dropped. The law's defenders blame 
the problems of U.S. farmers on lagging exports and the troubled 
Asian and Russian economies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved $7.4 billion in farm aid last month to  
compensate growers for depressed prices, and the White House is 
preparing its own proposal that is likely to include additional 
assistance for weather-related losses, a plan that could add up to 
$800 million to the measure.

	Strong Hurricane Threatens Bahamas, Fla.  
</P>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Bahamas residents abandoned beachfront  
homes and scrambled for emergency supplies today as Hurricane 
Floyd's 155 mph winds headed toward the vulnerable archipelago. 
Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm -- the most 
powerful designation for a hurricane. By comparison, Hurricane 
Andrew was a Category 4 storm when it struck South Florida in 1992, 
killing 26 people and causing an estimated $25 billion in damage. 
Bahamian officials warned that storm surges of up to 20 feet could 
sweep as far as six miles inland.

	1995 Waco Inquiry Criticized  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House Democrat today said the congressional  
Republican leading an inquiry into the 1993 Waco siege overlooked 
evidence the Justice Department sent his committee in 1995 showing 
federal agents used potentially incendiary tear gas near the fiery 
end of the Branch Davidian standoff. Separately, the Texas Rangers 
issued a report today indicating a house near the Davidians' 
compound that federal agents occupied before and during the siege 
contained a dozen spent rifle cartridges preferred by sharpshooters 
-- as well as the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms. The FBI has long denied firing a single shot during the 
standoff.

	U.S. Troops To Support E. Timor Effort  
</P>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- President Clinton urged Indonesian  
leaders to act responsibly until an international peacekeeping 
force, which will include some U.S. troops, can be assembled and 
sent to East Timor. Asia's receding but still daunting economic 
troubles were to have been the focus of a regional summit in New 
Zealand, but leaders found themselves scrambling to respond to the 
violence that followed an independence referendum in the Indonesian 
province.

<P>
	EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Israelis and Palestinians today  
opened talks on a final peace accord, intending to tackle issues 
like Palestinian statehood, the rights of refugees and the status 
of Jerusalem. The Palestinians want to establish a state in all of 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with east Jerusalem as its capital. 
Israel says it will never relinquish parts of Jerusalem, which it 
insists will remain the undivided capital of the Jewish state.

	Moscow Blast Kills 73  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- At least 73 people died and dozens were believed  
buried under tons of wreckage after a suspected bomb on Monday 
pulverized an eight-story apartment building in Moscow. Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin linked the two latest blasts to fighting in 
the southern Russian region of Dagestan, where government troops 
are battling Islamic rebels who have occupied several villages. 
Authorities appealed for help finding a man who allegedly rented 
space in that building and another that was blown up four days 
earlier. More than 200 people have died in explosions in Russia 
during the past two weeks.

	French Oil Cos. Agree To $54.3B Merger

	PARIS (AP) -- French oil companies Total Fina and Elf Aquitaine

world's fourth largest oil group, ending a fierce, two-month 
takeover battle. The friendly deal caps a summer of intense merger 
activity in France, where two of the country's largest banks have 
agreed to join forces and two retail powerhouses have also said 
they would ally.

	Genetic Experiment Reverse Brain Aging

researchers say they have restored aged brains to youthful vigor in 
a gene therapy experiment with monkeys. The study, appearing 
Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 
reinforce a new understanding of how the brain ages and suggest 
that neurons in the older brain don't die at first, but go into 
shrunken atrophy.

at 11,030.33. But broader stock indicators were lower. On the NYSE,

a year later than its scheduled opening day, stadium board 
officials said today. The ballpark was originally slated to make 
its debut with the Brewers' first home game in April 2000. Robert 
Decker, a vice president for the firm, said a 2000 opening was 
immediately ruled out because the manpower and materials needed for 
the job could not be pulled together that quickly.

<HEADLINE> APEC Leaders Agree on Lofty Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Pacific Rim leaders agreed Monday  
they must help break down barriers to world trade, while at the 
same time strengthening regional markets and economies that took a 
massive hit from the Asian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they also want to see if they can devise consistent  
banking rules, shoring up an area that spun out of control in many 
countries and helped cause the economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the end of a two-day summit on Monday, the 21 members of  
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum had come up with no 
dramatic ways to achieve those lofty goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics attacked them for moving too slowly in making the  
reforms that they believe can improve economies from the United 
States and Canada to parts of Latin America and Asia, as well as 
Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	The APEC leaders hope to convince the World Trade Organization  
to cut or eliminate tariffs on numerous industrial goods and 
service businesses when talks open Nov. 30 in Seattle 
</P>
<P>
	They also will pose a challenge to the 15-member European Union  
with a proposal to wipe out all global subsidies on agricultural 
exports, which APEC members say creates an unlevel playing field 
for many of the world's farmers. It remains unclear how such 
proposals will play out in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We challenge the world to move to freer trade, and we  
challenge ourselves as leaders to bring our people with us to 
broaden support for the work of APEC,'' said the host, New Zealand 
Prime Minister Jenny Shipley. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipley vowed to ``strengthen our markets and improve the  
international framework governing trade and investment flows,'' by 
getting a new trade agreement at the WTO, which is based in Geneva 
and sets rules for commerce among its 134 members. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics in the corporate world said APEC needs to move more  
quickly to set up its own regional free-trade zone -- an area where 
the Pacific Rim nations lag far behind their western European 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU economies are drawing ever closer under common rules set  
up by the bureaucracy in Brussels, as well as the launch this year 
of a single currency for most of EU members. 
</P>
<P>
	APEC hopes to have free trade among its developed members by  
2010 and its developing members by 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate chief executives who held their own summit in Auckland  
said Monday that APEC must show ``stronger resolve and urgency to 
accelerate trade and investment liberalization, taking a robust 
APEC trade agenda forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the APEC members held their final session, early Monday  
morning they applauded Indonesia's announcement to allow 
international peacekeeping troops to enter East Timor and stop the 
bloodshed that followed a recent independence vote. Much of APEC's 
economic agenda was overshadowed by concerns over the atrocities 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	APEC met as Asian economies are recovering from the devastating  
crisis that began nearly two years ago, sweeping the region with 
currency devaluations, tumbling stock markets, business failures 
and massive job losses. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's recent recovery has been viewed as the region's  
star performance, but President Kim Dae-jung told colleagues Monday 
he was ``not satisfied with the results so far, and we are guarding 
against complacency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	APEC members are the United States, Indonesia, Japan, South  
Korea, China, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Hong 
Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, 
Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Lions' Elliss Signs Six-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Luther Elliss has signed a six-year  
contract extension which the Detroit Lions feel will keep him with 
the team for the rest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliss, who has developed into one of the NFC's better defensive  
tackles since the Lions made him a first-round draft pick out of 
Utah in 1995, signed the contract through 2005 on Sunday, before 
Detroit's 28-20 victory over Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a gift from God,'' said Elliss, who would have been an  
unrestricted free agent after the season. ``I appreciate it. I 
wanted to be here. I didn't want to test the free agent waters. I 
didn't want to be anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms of the contract weren't disclosed. That was  
probably due to the fact that the Lions are also in negotiations 
with defensive end Robert Porcher who also can become an 
unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, defensive linemen of Elliss' caliber have been getting  
contracts worth about $30 million over the length of the contract, 
with a signing bonus of between $6 million and $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Luther will be a Lion the rest of his career,'' Elliss' agent,  
Ethan Lock, said from Phoenix. ``He's very happy with his 
contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions had money for Elliss in part because the retirement of  
running back Barry Sanders freed up salary cap dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``That helped, no question,'' Lions vice president Tom Lewand  
said. ``But this is something we were going to get done anyway.''

<HEADLINE> Emmycast Closes Out the Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Couldn't some Y2K bug have kicked in prematurely  
and shaken up the Emmycast? 
</P>
<P>
	Sorry. ``The 51st Annual Primetime Emmy Awards'' -- introduced as  
``the last Emmy Awards this century'' -- was slickly produced and 
strictly by-the-numbers, like too many others this century. 
</P>
<P>
	As if on automatic pilot, the program, aired live by Fox on  
Sunday night from Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium, came in at the 
prescribed three-hour length. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, there were few surprises, gaffes or delights.  
</P>
<P>
	Co-hosts Jenna Elfman (``Dharma &AMP; Greg'') and David Hyde Pierce  
(``Frasier'') made their first appearance in matching purple 
unitards, whereupon they performed dance interpretations of several 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Not very funny. Nor were these emcees. Elfman teems with energy  
but comes up short on charm. Pierce -- well, he's as good as it gets 
as a second banana. Emphasis on ``second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the winners were announced, it was clear this was another  
year of re-Emmying -- that is, the same actors honored over and over 
for the same role. It makes the Emmycast seem like an annual rerun. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporting actor in a comedy series for the second year: Pierce.  
Supporting actress in a comedy for the second time: Kristen 
Johnston of ``3rd Rock From the Sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outstanding comedy actor for the third time: ``3rd Rock's'' John  
Lithgow. Outstanding actress in a comedy for the fourth time: Helen 
Hunt of ``Mad About You.'' Outstanding actor in a drama series for 
the fourth time: Dennis Franz of ``NYPD Blue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the Emmycast: deja view all over again.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, it seemed all the whiter after a summer when the  
NAACP, several Hispanic organizations and others have decried 
television's lack of ethnic and racial diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	African-American Paris Barclay, named best director of a drama  
series, pointedly thanked ``NYPD Blue'' executive producer Steven 
Bochco for ``his commitment to diversity, which to him means get 
the best people, look a little harder ....'' It was clear Barclay 
was hailing Bochco as an exception to the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Presenter Halle Berry declared hopefully that ``true and lasting  
progress takes time, and we are moving forward ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a viewer might have wondered why, among the many other  
presenters, was Noah Wyle of ``ER'' chosen -- not Eriq LaSalle? 
</P>
<P>
	Why Franz, Rick Schroder and Kim Delaney of ``NYPD Blue'' -- but  
not James McDaniel? 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Maher, host of the aptly named ``Politically Incorrect,''  
was midway through a comic bit looking at TV in the future when a 
gardening channel popped up on his screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the networks for you,'' he cracked -- ``even the  
gardeners are white!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The humorous moments were few and far between.  
</P>
<P>
	A very clever and shrewdly brief feature pretended to show the  
college-kids series ``Felicity'' adopting the styles of ``NYPD 
Blue,'' ``The X-Files'' and ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our writers have been experimenting with creating a distinct  
and new voice,'' explained series star Keri Russell, tough in 
cheek. ``They assure me this has nothing to do with our being 
passed over for major Emmy nominations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Presenters Ray Romano and Brad Garrett dined out on the sibling  
rivalry they've mastered playing brothers on the sitcom ``Everybody 
Loves Raymond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows you stole your act from Paul Reiser,'' sneered  
Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
	``How about you?'' sniffed Romano. ``You're just doing Bull from  
'Night Court.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But what was with the half-baked tributes, especially the  
obligatory roundup of ``shows we said goodbye to'' last season? 
Here were clips from ``Melrose Place,'' ``Home Improvement'' and 
``Mad About You.'' But where was the longrunning ``Homicide: Life 
on the Street''? For that matter, what about ``The Nanny''? 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, memo to David Spade and other wiseacres (you know who  
you are): How about a moratorium on jokes about David E. Kelley's 
productivity as a writer? 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, two of his series -- ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice'' --  
won best comedy and drama, respectively. But enough with the quips 
about how Kelley ``overslept this morning, so now `Ally McBeal' is 
four episodes behind schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hmmmm. Maybe in the new century, Kelley should also write the  
Emmycast.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Pushes to 21/2-Year High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures surged Monday to their highest level since  
early 1997, topping $24 a barrel on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange amid signs once-flush U.S. inventories are still in free 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, orange juice futures rose as Hurricane Floyd  
bore down on the southeastern U.S. coastline, and platinum futures 
advanced sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices have doubled this year after plummeting to a  
12-year low in December. 
</P>
<P>
	After increasing throughout last week, crude saw a sixth  
straight price rise Monday as investors anticipated that the 
upcoming American Petroleum Institute report would show yet another 
decline in U.S. inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to that expectation were figures showing an 8 percent  
decline in monthly activity at the Louisiana offshore oil port -- 
confirmation that less oil is flowing into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The last API report put U.S. stocks at 311 million barrels.  
Inventories have averaged 3-million-barrel drops in recent weeks. 
If that pace holds steady, it would mean the total could drop below 
300 million level by early October. 
</P>
<P>
	``When that figure starts with a 2, we can consider the market  
tight,'' said Tim Evans, energy analyst for the Pegasus Econometric 
Group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a crucial level, but it does indicate that our excess  
inventory has really been worked off,'' he said. ``We had a glut a 
year ago. Well, the glut is gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects for changes any time soon were further diminished by  
comments of the oil minister of the United Arab Emirates, who said 
Sunday that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries won't 
review its oil production cuts before they run out next March. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC's steadfast adherence to the cutbacks policy has helped  
drain oil supplies worldwide and push up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for October delivery rose 66 cents to $24.21 a barrel;  
October heating oil rose .17 cent to 62.20 cents a gallon; October 
unleaded gasoline rose .36 cent to 69.68 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	October natural gas fell 2 cents to $2.781 per 1,000 cubic feet  
as it appeared Floyd would not enter the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in  
October rose 4 cents to $23.48 a gallon on the International 
Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange juice futures settled about 2 percent higher after  
leaping up nearly three times that amount early in the trading 
session on forecasts that had the hurricane coming dangerously 
close to crop regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, the price fell back as meteorologists  
predicted the storm was more likely to come ashore in the 
Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	November frozen concentrated orange juice futures rose 1.55  
cents to 97 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Platinum futures hit a six-month high before declining slightly.  
Investors cited the yen's strong jump against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Since metals are dollar-based commodities, a rise in its value  
encourages selling to lock in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	October platinum rose $7.90 to $373.50 an ounce on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Probe Swissair Crash Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Swissair wants to know if a U.S. law on  
``high seas'' deaths bars the families of people killed in a crash 
off Nova Scotia from seeking a billion dollars in damages for pain 
and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	Swissair lawyers asked a federal judge Monday to decide whether  
the families, who are negotiating a possible legal settlement with 
the airline, are entitled to punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Families of victims have asked U.S. District Judge James T.  
Giles to reject a settlement package worth about $300 million 
because it would limit an estimated $1 billion in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	They argue such an agreement would keep the families from  
learning the full extent of any potential misconduct involved in 
the September 1998 crash that killed 229 people. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Monday, Swissair attorneys asked Giles to determine  
whether damages could be limited under the Death on the High Seas 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The law only allows for the recovery of compensatory damages, or  
real losses associated with income and medical costs, and not 
punitive damages. Both sides agreed that the act, which Congress 
passed in 1920, does not define the term ``high seas.'' 
</P>

crash occurred within the territorial waters of Canada, while 
Swissair lawyers said it applies in any waters at least one marine 
league (about three miles) from the U.S. coast.

<HEADLINE> Alaskans Vote on Oil-Revenue Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Alaskans vote Tuesday on whether to give  
up a piece of their annual oil-revenue dividend checks to help 
balance the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the plan, supporters say, lawmakers could be forced to  
take more drastic action, such as enactment of an income tax or 
sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote is strictly advisory. But if voters approve, Democratic  
Gov. Tony Knowles and the Republican-controlled Legislature have 
promised to enact a law diverting to the state some of the earnings 
of the $26 billion Alaska Permanent Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, the fund pays a dividend to every man, woman and  
child who has lived in Alaska for more than a year. The dividend 
was created in 1982, and it and the fund have grown along with the 
booming stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, however, falling oil prices have forced sharp  
cuts in the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan before voters would cut the dividend to about $1,340 in  
2001. Last year's payout was $1,540 and this year's is expected to 
exceed $1,700. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would earmark more than $800 million a year from the  
dividends to make up the state budget shortfall. Under the state 
constitution, the fund's principal can't be touched. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of the matter is that we have been spending our  
savings for eight of the last nine years,'' Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the unappealing alternatives include cutting state  
programs or imposing a steep income or sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan has drawn generous support and more than $500,000 in  
donations from businesses, particularly oil and tourism, that fear 
big tax increases if the vote fails. 
</P>
<P>
	It is opposed by both hard-line conservatives and liberal  
environmentalists. Some want deep budget cuts, others want an 
income tax, and still others want to increase taxes on the oil 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	All condemn the idea of cutting dividends as a regressive tax  
that will most heavily affect the poor, while hardly touching rich 
people and profitable corporations such as BP Amoco PLC, the 
state's biggest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over my dead body is BP going to pay nothing and my 8-year-old  
daughter has to give up $500 from her permanent fund dividend,'' 
said Eddie Burke, chairman of Save Your Dividend-Vote No. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to put the plan on the ballot began last winter, when  
oil prices dropped below $10 a barrel and the projected budget gap 
for the current fiscal year grew to more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, oil has climbed to more than $22 a barrel, shrinking  
the budget gap to a projected $632 million.

<HEADLINE> Niners Can't Go Anywhere But Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Mariucci tried to make light of  
the questions. The San Francisco 49ers coach ran his hands through 
his hair, gave a nervous giggle and joked that everyone is getting 
older, some faster than others. 
</P>
<P>
	It was harder to laugh off the source of Monday's questions  
because it's apparent the 49ers not only are showing their age but 
their offense showed practically nothing in a disastrous opener. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco began the year Sunday with a 41-3 loss at  
Jacksonville, its worst regular season defeat since a 59-14 
drubbing by Dallas in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	On a team with a powerful and proud offensive legacy, what made  
the loss even more disturbing was the total breakdown in production 
and the frazzled play of Steve Young and Jerry Rice, the team's 
best, albeit, oldest stars. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Mariucci was asked directly about the play of his  
38-year-old quarterback, he reacted defensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not 38 till October,'' Mariucci said. And he added he has  
faith that the play of Young, Rice and everyone else on the team 
will get better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to,'' Mariucci said.  
</P>
<P>
	Young had perhaps his best season last year, setting career  
highs for passing yardage (4,170) and touchdowns (36), but against 
Jacksonville he turned in his worst performance since becoming San 
Francisco's starter nine years ago. He finished 9-of-26 with no 
touchdowns, two interceptions and two sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at that film and I see there were just not many plays.  
In fact, I got myself in trouble by trying to make things that were 
not there,'' Young said. The interceptions ``were forced from a 
sense of, `Let's get something going.' Now, you want to talk about 
age, I'm too old for that. I should know better,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't get much help from the 36-year-old Rice, the NFL's  
career leader in receptions, receiving yardage and touchdowns who 
made just two catches but also was guilty of a couple drops. 
</P>
<P>
	``They played in a game where it was a little rough but the  
entire team was flat,'' Mariucci said. ``Oh yeah, we're all getting 
older, some of us faster than others. But I've been nothing but 
pleased with those guys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, this game is not what we're used, but it will get much  
better, you know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young and Rice may have been the focal point of San Francisco's  
offensive failings but the other elements of the team's attack also 
let down. J.J. Stokes and Terrell Owens failed to hold on to a 
several catchable balls and Charlie Garner and Lawrence Phillips 
failed to muster much of a rushing game to take some of the 
pressure off Young. 
</P>
<P>
	That means now more than ever, the 49ers are relying on their  
quarterback to make plays and it's getting harder for Young to pull 
it off. 
</P>
<P>
	Young insisted the debacle at Jacksonville was not a sign of the  
times or age but just one bad game, a clunker that got out of hand 
because of some key turnovers. Jacksonville didn't have a 
turnovers, while San Francisco had five, including a second-quarter 
fumble by Young that wiped out the 49ers' best chance to score a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just came out and laid an egg,'' Young said.  
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco finished just 1-for-14 in third-down conversions  
while scoring the fewest points in a game since a 10-3 loss to New 
Orleans in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, we were miscommunicating, misfiring, however you want  
to say it,'' Young said. ``We have seven days to make something 
happen and we will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco plays New Orleans on Sunday in its home opener.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody should be very critical of themselves,'' Owens said.  
``We need to clean up our own shop in order to get this team back 
on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci, who has never lost a game at home in his two previous  
seasons in San Francisco, said he's hoping for a quick turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played poorly on occasion before but I know this, this  
team has always responded the right way and played well the next 
game,'' Mariucci said. ``Now, does that mean we'll do it again? 
Only time will tell. We have to do it again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't make assumptions because of what's gone on in the  
past. Just because we led the league in rushing last year doesn't 
mean we're going rush the ball very well this year. We've got to do 
it this year. Just because we led the league in nine different 
offensive categories, doesn't mean we're going to do it this year. 
We've got to play like that. It starts over. We've got to do it 
again.''

<HEADLINE> UNLV Needed a Miracle -- And Got One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- John Robinson never promised any miracles when  
he took over a UNLV football team that had lost 16 straight. He got 
one anyway, when a rookie head coach made the mistake of trying to 
pile it on. 
</P>
<P>
	The wackiest ending of any football game in Robinson's long  
coaching career turned certain defeat into victory against Baylor 
when a bizarre decision by Bears coach Kevin Steele backfired so 
miserably that his players buried their heads in their arms and 
sank to the turf in despair. 
</P>
<P>
	It also gave UNLV an improbable 2-0 start under Robinson, and a  
chance to go into its first home game with the kind of enthusiasm 
generally reserved only for basketball in this gambling town. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen some strange finishes before, but this one was sure  
different,'' Robinson said Monday. ``I've only been in Las Vegas 
for six months but I know this is a city of luck. We certainly had 
the luck this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the luck on the Las Vegas Strip wouldn't have mattered, if  
Steele had done the prudent thing Saturday night in Waco, Texas, 
and had his quarterback take a knee to run out the clock with a 
24-21 lead in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	But a 3-point win at home over once hapless UNLV just wasn't  
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele ordered a running play to try for a final touchdown, only  
to watch in disbelief as Kevin Thomas picked up a goal-line fumble 
and ran 101 yards the other way. Baylor players pounded the turf in 
frustration and shocked fans wondered what Steele could have been 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Steele tried to explain just that, while his team  
tried to recover from a second straight last second loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids wanted to score. We had been moving the football,''  
Steele said. ``We are trying to create a mental toughness that 
gives our players the edge to finish the job. That having been 
said, it was a mistake and I regret it. I regret it for the team, 
which deserved to win the game, and I regret it for the fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was preparing to walk across the field and congratulate  
Steele when the Bears suddenly lined up in a running formation on 
UNLV's 8-yard-line with only seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we thought we had lost the game,'' UNLV wide  
receiver Nate Turner said. ``We thought it was a kneel-down. 
(Robinson) was over there going, `Hey, what are you guys doing, 
trying to rub it in?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Darrel Bush, whose 9-yard touchdown run with 6:06 to go had  
given Baylor the lead, took a handoff and ran up the middle. He was 
hit at the 2 and was struggling to get into the end zone when 
linebacker Tyler Brickell reached over his shoulder and swatted the 
ball out. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball bounced to Thomas, standing just inside the end zone,  
and he picked it up and ran untouched around the left side past a 
jubilant UNLV bench and didn't stop until he had reached the end 
zone 101 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the game was over,'' Robinson said. ``I thought they  
would take a knee. It was just a fortuitous thing that happened to 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UNLV's players also thought the game was over, until Baylor got  
into formation. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the last play, I took on a blocker and he was laughing  
during the play like, `Ha, ha, ha, we're going to score again,'' 
linebacker Jerrd Pierucci said. ``But we got the last laugh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel linebacker James Sunia called it ``greed'' that backfired.  
</P>
<P>
	``I heard (Baylor's players) going, `Oh, my God. I can't believe  
it. No! No! No!.,'' Sunia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele said Monday his team, which lost on a missed field goal  
to Boston College a week earlier and has dropped eight straight, 
had gotten over the shocking loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the players have recovered,'' Steele said. ``Just like  
a father can look into the eyes of their child and know they are 
OK, I've looked into the eyes of the players and have seen the look 
that tells me they are OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UNLV, meanwhile, is doing a lot better.  
</P>
<P>
	After snapping a 26-game road losing streak with two straight  
wins, the Rebels come home for their first home game under Robinson 
in a remodeled stadium that is expected to see far more than the 
few thousand or so who showed for last year's 0-11 team. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, though, told his team not to pray for any more  
miracles against Iowa State on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them God has already given us our share,'' Robinson  
said.

<HEADLINE> UCLA Changes Quarterback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cory Paus, who split playing time with Drew  
Bennett in UCLA's first two games this season, will be the Bruins' 
starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA coach Bob Toledo said last month he would alternate the two  
for at least two games before naming a permanent starter. 
</P>
<P>
	He was true to his word.  
</P>
<P>
	``We feel at this time that it's best for us to go with Cory  
Paus,'' Toledo said Monday. ``Cory will be the starting quarterback 
for now. He's throwing the ball the best, that's the crux of the 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping it's a decision for a long time, but you never  
really know that. He'll be given a great chance to succeed. We'll 
see what kind of decision I made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paus, a redshirt freshman who has completed 20 of 38 passes for  
225 yards and one touchdown with three interceptions, will make his 
first start Saturday night against Fresno State at the Rose Bowl in 
the 21st-ranked Bruins' final non-conference game. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA opens Pacific-10 Conference play Sept. 25 at Stanford.  
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, a junior who backed up Cade McNown the last two years,  
started UCLA's 38-7 victory over Boise State and 42-20 loss to No. 
13 Ohio State, and completed 17 of 31 passes for 258 yards and two 
touchdowns with two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that I've made the decision, I feel very good about it,''  
Toledo said. ``I believe Cory Paus will do very well. If you were 
just going by stats, you would have picked Bennett. We don't just 
go by stats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go with one quarterback. I'm not going to have a  
quick trigger, so to speak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo said Paus was a unanimous choice of the offensive  
coaches, and that Bennett took the news ``very hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But he understands, he's a team guy,'' Toledo said. ``When you  
tell a guy he's not going to be a starter anymore, it's no fun for 
the player or the coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paus won't be the only new starter against Fresno State -- the  
Bruins will welcome back 10 players suspended for the first two 
games for illegally obtaining handicapped parking permits, and six 
are listed as first-stringers on the latest depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a big chunk out of your team,'' Toledo said. ``We  
should be better. There's a reason why they were starters before 
and the other guys were backups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leadership, that's the biggest thing. The other night (at Ohio  
State), we had nine freshmen on defense on the field at one time. 
You don't think I was a little nervous? The same thing offensively. 
It's unbelievable how young we were. But it will pay dividends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four returnees who will start on defense are linebackers  
Tony White, Robert Thomas and Ryan Nece, and strong safety Ryan 
Roques. Returning as first-stringers on offense are fullback Durell 
Price and guard Oscar Cabrera. 
</P>
<P>
	Also returning are linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz, safety Eric  
Whitfield, offensive guard James Ghezzi and tailback Keith Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Marques Anderson, also suspended for the first two  
games, was suspended from school for the fall quarter as well for 
other university-related incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big sense of relief,'' Roques said concerning his  
return. ``I think there will be a bigger sense of relief when we 
actually play in a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senior said he believes he's learned his lesson.  
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I feel some regret for ever doing it, for ever  
using the placards,'' he said. ``I don't think I'll ever try to 
take a short cut in anything again. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a blessing in the storm. Maybe later in my  
life, I would have tried to take a shortcut through something, and 
gotten something worse than a two-game suspension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nece, a sophomore, admitted the last couple of months have been  
difficult for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's been a good learning experience,'' he said. ``It's  
made me stronger as a person. We made a mistake, we got punished 
for it. We deserved it, without a doubt. I'm looking forward to my 
community service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roques and Nece were two of nine defendants who pleaded no  
contest to the misdemeanor charge of illegally possessing a 
handicap placard on July 28 and was ordered each to pay $1,485 in 
fines and perform 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten more are scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday, including  
McNown, now with the Chicago Bears, and Washington Redskins running 
back Skip Hicks, who were among five additional current or former 
UCLA football players charged Monday with illegally possessing 
handicapped parking placards.

<HEADLINE> Browns May Make QB Switch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns had this wonderful game  
plan in place for educating Tim Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	They wanted to bring him along slowly, grooming the young  
quarterback as Ty Detmer's understudy until Couch was ready to take 
over as Cleveland's starter. 
</P>
<P>
	And then the Pittsburgh Steelers came to town and knocked the  
Browns into next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's humbling and humiliating 43-0 loss to Pittsburgh on  
national TV in their long-awaited NFL return was apparently enough 
to make the expansion Browns change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not disappointed, but I guess I'm realistic enough to know  
we've got to make some changes,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer said 
Monday. ``Something wasn't in sync. When you get beat 43-0. You're 
looking for answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said there will be changes on both sides of the ball for  
Sunday's game at Tennessee, and among the switches he's considering 
is replacing Detmer with Couch, who faced with a blitz, threw an 
interception with his first pro pass Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying what we're going to do as far as the  
quarterback situation,'' Palmer said. ``I think I'd like to sleep 
on it another night and have a clearer vision and clearer decision 
in my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It looked pretty clear Monday that Palmer's mind may already be  
made up. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Browns began stretching Monday afternoon, Palmer and  
Detmer spoke privately for about five minutes. Not long after, 
Palmer, his head bowed and hands behind his back, walked by himself 
up an exercise hill alongside the Browns' training fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Couch was behind center with the Browns' first-team  
offense as Detmer donned a red jersey to play cornerback with 
scout-team defense. 
</P>
<P>
	After arriving early for work Monday morning, Palmer told Dwight  
Clark, the Browns director of football operations, that he was 
considering making a change at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said the plan all along with Couch was to re-evaluate the  
situation every three weeks during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``During our meeting this morning, he said he might accelerate  
the plan,'' Clark said. ``I was a little surprised. We're a team 
that's in transition. We're growing and trying to fill holes. We're 
open for anything right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was taken by the Browns with the No. 1 overall pick in  
April's NFL draft. Cleveland signed him to a seven-year, $59.4 
million contract, which included a $12 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Kentucky standout played well in his exhibition debut  
against the Dallas Cowboys in the Hall of Fame game, going 
11-for-17 for 137 yards and rallying the Browns to a win. 
</P>
<P>
	He started Cleveland's home exhibition opener against Minnesota,  
and looked unsteady and confused. And despite getting the 
opportunity to win Detmer's job, he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Browns' anemic offensive showing with Detmer at the  
controls may have hastened Couch's ascension. Detmer was 6-for-13 
for 52 yards and threw a costly interception when the Browns 
actually had a little momentum early on. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Browns' offensive lowlights:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Cleveland managed just two first downs -- Pittsburgh had 32 --  
and got one on its first offensive play. 
</P>
<P>
	-- They had only 40 total yards, nine rushing.  
</P>
<P>
	-- And, almost unbelievably, they had the ball for just 12:11 to  
Pittsburgh's 47:20. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer figures it can't get any worse, and that seems to be why  
he's considering making Couch the starter. He doesn't think making 
a switch this early sends any kind of signal to the Browns or 
anyone else that the team is giving up on the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's not interpreted as we're putting up a white  
flag,'' he said. ``It's just a situation where we're trying to get 
better. Somewhere along the line Tim Couch has got to play, whether 
it's tomorrow or next year, he has to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland awoke in shock and a bit hung over following Sunday  
night's pummeling by Pittsburgh. Beating the Steelers would have 
been asking too much, but a competitive game would have been 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the town had waited nearly four years for the Browns'  
return.

	``It's mind boggling the way we played,'' said offensive lineman  
Lomas Brown, a 15-year veteran. ``That's the most lopsided game 
I've played in, not point wise, but statistics wise. I've never 
been a apart of anything like that. It was bad.

	``I'm embarrassed. You can't play like we did. A good college  
team probably could have kept it close with us last night.''

<HEADLINE> Airport Security Tightened in Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami airport is tightening security after two  
drug smuggling busts, requiring workers to carry see-through bags 
and to undergo inspections as they enter and leave restricted 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas said his goal is to make  
the airport a model of security. 
</P>
<P>
	``In effect, we will treat airport employees as we treat the  
flying public,'' Penelas said. ``And in some instances, we will 
treat employees even stricter than we do passengers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new measures that went into effect Monday will include  
random inspections of all vehicles leaving the airfield at 
checkpoints staffed by airport security personnel, Customs and 
Miami-Dade Police K-9 units. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven checkpoints will include X-ray machines and metal  
detectors by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport officials intend to issue the transparent bags in the  
next 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers also will be required to log in and out and will not  
have access to restricted areas when they are off duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The reforms come after two stings, on Aug. 25 and then last  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first bust, 58 employees -- many of them American Airline  
baggage handlers and other ground crew members -- were charged with 
smuggling drugs, hand grenades and guns onto passenger jets. In the 
second, 15 workers for other companies were charged with smuggling 
cocaine aboard planes. 
</P>
<P>
	In both cases, ramp workers used their security badges to gain  
access to airfields and restricted areas, carrying their goods 
inside knapsacks on work shifts and days off.
