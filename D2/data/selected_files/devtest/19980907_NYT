DODGERS LOSE TO GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many who believe the Dodgers might someday miss all
those prospects they gave up in the name of saving the season. But
Sunday night?
</P>
<P>
   The annual September call-up of future talent is so bare this
year that there wasn't much hope when regulars began calling in
sick and injured before a 6-2 loss to the San Francisco Giants in
front of 39,803 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of game that called for new faces. With just
five hits, it was clear from the start that the Dodgers weren't
going to sweep the Giants or extend their season-high four-game
winning streak to five.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just aren't here this year, I'm not going to sugar coat
it,'' manager Glenn Hoffman said. ``We traded six guys that would
have been here and given us a chance to look at. But we do have a
closer and starting shortstop and a key member of our starting
rotation in return. Those are all quality guys. You do what you
have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko and Dennis Reyes are in Cincinnati as part of the
midseason Jeff Shaw trade. There is no Wilton Guerrero or Triple-A
left-hander Ted Lilly or Double-A hot shots Peter Bergeron and Jon
Tucker, who went to Montreal for Carlos Perez and Mark
Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Dodgers did get an inning from left-hander Jeff
Kubenka, who pitched a scoreless ninth in his major-league debut.
Kubenka spent most of the season at Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   They were hoping to see a little more of their perennial
prospect Roger Cedeno in the final three weeks, but he spent the
night at a local hospital after catching the flu that forced Matt
Luke to miss his second game.
</P>
<P>
   It forced the Dodgers to put Bobby Bonilla in left field for the
first time in weeks, Trenidad Hubbard in center and Jim Eisenreich
in right. The Dodgers did call up two catchers, Angel Pena and Paul
LoDuca, giving them four on the active roster. But no outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   The game might have been a potential showcase for the Dodgers,
but it meant a lot to the Giants' season. They had dropped four
games back of Chicago in the wild-card race, but the victory helped
them pick up a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to win all three, but if you don't, winning the last
one is the most important,'' said Giants manager Dusty Baker, whose
team returns home for three games with division-leading San Diego.
``That way you carry some momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, eight back with 18 to play, move on to Arizona,
where they open a seven-game road trip tonight against the
expansion Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Brian Bohanon came in with a 1.91 ERA in his
past nine starts, but had just a 4-3 record during that stretch. He
was particularly effective in his past two starts, against
playoff-caliber Atlanta and New York, allowing three runs in 151/3,
but coming away empty after two blown saves by Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Bohanon wasn't sharp. Although he lasted seven
innings, he allowed five runs and four walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't have good command of my fastball, which set up
everything else,'' Bohanon said. ``I use my fastball to set up my
off-speed stuff. It seemed like I was in a lot of 1-0, 2-0 counts
all night. Those walks really hurt. I haven't done that for quite a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the walks came in the second and both scored when the
Giants took a 3-0 lead. Jeff Kent, who hit home runs in the first
two games of the series, drew a base on balls to open the inning
and scored when Ellis Burks hit Bohanon's first pitch for his 21st
home run.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon retired the next two batters then walked catcher Brian
Johnson and allowed a single to Giants starter Mark Gardner (12-5).
When Rey Sanchez followed with a base hit to left, the Giants had
their third run.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got two back in the bottom of the second when
Bonilla drove a 3-2 pitch into the right-field bullpen for a home
run. It was his third home run on the homestand and his sixth with
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenreich followed a triple to the gap in left-center and
scored on an infield out by Mark Grudzielanek. But that was it.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added two in the fifth and again walks hurt Bohanon.
He retired the first batter, Sanchez, then walked Shawon Dunston
and Bonds. Both scored on a double by Kent, who now has 55 RBI in
his past 40 games and 107 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers fans did get a chance to see LoDuca, one of five
catchers on the roster, who pinch hit for Bohanon in the seventh
and hit a ball to the warning track in right.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca's only other appearance this year came June 21 when he
drove in a run in his second major-league at-bat. It was just
slightly overshadowed by the firing of manager Bill Russell and GM
Fred Claire later that day.

RANGERS KEEP FADING IN WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Ssssssss.
</P>
<P>
   The sound emanated from The Ballpark in Arlington after the
American League West-contending Rangers surrendered a two-run,
eighth-inning lead to the sub-.500 Minnesota Twins for the second
consecutive evening.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's 6-5 defeat mirrored that of Saturday, and the
Rangers sank 3 1/2 games behind the first-place Angels, who last
night defeated the Royals, 3-0, in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Xavier Hernandez, perhaps as dependable as any
reliever this season, inherited a 5-3 lead from right-hander
Esteban Loaiza. Hernandez (6-5) departed without retiring a batter
and took responsibility for the three runs the Twins scored during
the decisive eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Twins catcher Terry Steinbach scored what proved to be the
game-winning run after right-hander Tim Crabtree issued a two-out,
bases-loaded walk on four pitches to designated hitter Paul
Molitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough one right there,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates
said. ``I'm sure this whole ballclub is very frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as damaging proved to be:
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-inning error by third baseman Todd Zeile that led to
the unearned, game-winning run.
</P>
<P>
   The two runners thrown out at the plate, including pinch runner
Warren Newson on the game's final play.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza provided the Rangers their fourth consecutive quality
start, but Oates removed the right-hander after his 107th pitch
concluded the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Twins third baseman Ron Coomer greeted Hernandez with a leadoff
single and scored two pitches later when second baseman Todd Walker
deposited a 1-0 fastball into the right-field seats for a
game-tying home run.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who took the loss during Saturday's 7-4 defeat, then
issued a walk to Steinbach before being replaced by Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitched a lot,'' Oates said of Hernandez. ``Maybe it's
time to give him a rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree responded by inducing a ground ball from shortstop Pat
Meares, but Zeile bobbled the ball. The extra out Zeile granted the
Twins would prove costly.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree retired center fielder Otis Nixon before allowing an
infield single to third baseman Brent Gates, and that brought
Molitor to the plate with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The bat never left Molitor's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bullpen has been great all year,'' Oates said despite the
collapses of the past two nights. ``Without the bullpen, we
wouldn't be talking about the pennant race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers almost tied the game during the bottom of the ninth
against Twins closer Rick Aguilera. First baseman Will Clark drew a
two-out walk, and Oates inserted Newson as a pinch runner. Catcher
Ivan Rodriguez then lined a pitch down the left-field line for a
double, but left fielder Alex Ochoa and second baseman Denny
Hocking combined for a perfect relay to retire Newson easily on the
game's final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm down now, but I'll be back tomorrow,'' Oates said. ``I'm
sure the players are the same way.''

GUTHRIE TO HAVE MRI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reliever Mark Guthrie, who has missed seven games with a tender
left elbow, will undergo an MRI exam Tuesday in Los Angeles. He
will not accompany the team to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   With right-handers Antonio Osuna and Darren Hall out for the
year because of elbow surgery, the timing of Guthrie's injury has
hurt the Dodgers' bullpen. Scott Radinsky, the club's other
left-hander, missed the first two games of the Giants series with a
stiff elbow but was available Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie began experiencing discomfort Aug. 29. He had not
pitched well in three of his previous outings. He gave up five runs
in 51/3 innings after not allowing a run in 11 of 12 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors don't think it is serious, but they just want to rule
out some things,'' Guthrie said. ``I definitely expect to pitch
again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie's name surfaced in trade talks with Texas around the
July 31 non-waiver deadline. Guthrie, who is making $1.6 million
this year, is a free agent at the end of the season
</P>
<P>
   Round Two: After taking Labor Day off, the Dodgers will begin
interviews Tuesday for the four finalists for the general manager
position. Florida's Dave Dombrowski, who has hinted he might like
to stay with the Marlins, remains the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Jim Bowden, Baltimore assistant Kevin Malone, the
former Montreal GM, and former Yankees GM Bob Watson are the
others. Interviews are expected to be completed by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Quick Hits: Although the Angels are in a pennant race and gave
out Beanie Babies on Sunday night, the Dodgers out-drew them 39,803
to 33,941.... The Dodgers went 8-4 on their season-longest 12-game
homestand against Montreal (3-0), New York (1-3), Philadelphia
(2-0) and San Francisco (2-1). It marked the first time since Sept.
6-15, 1996 that the Dodgers have won eight games in a homestand....
Dodgers starter Brian Bohanon pitched seven innings Sunday, the
eighth consecutive game he has gone at least that far. But Bohanon
also allowed a season-high five runs.... Dodgers starters have gone
at least seven innings in the past eight games....
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi missed his second consecutive game with lower back
stiffness and doesn't know when he will be back. Doctors say it is
not a disc problem. He came out of Friday's game in the fifth. ``It
is still really sore,'' he said. ``It's just not getting
better.''... Matt Luke missed a second day with the flu. Worse than
that, he gave it to Roger Cedeno, who spent the night at an area
hospital.... Giants right-hander Mark Gardner recorded career
strikeout 1,000 in the seventh inning against Adrian Beltre, who
was making only his second start at third since Aug. 25. Gardner
also won his 12th, tying a career high done three other times
(1992, 96, 97).... Left-hander Will Brunson, who pitched briefly
for the Dodgers in June, was claimed on waivers by Detroit after
being designated for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   DODGERS vs. ARIZONA

<P>
   Time: 6:05 p.m., at Bank One Ballpark, Phoenix. &QL; 
TV/Radio: Fox Sports West 2, 1150-AM, KWKW 1330-AM (Spanish). &QL; 
Matchups: In the first of three games with the Diamondbacks, Dave
Mlicki (8-6, 4.56) faces right-hander Andy Benes (11-13, 4.55). In
his last start, Mlicki had a complete-game victory over the New
York Mets on Monday. He is 7-2 with a 3.92 ERA since joining the
Dodgers on June 4. Matchups for the rest of the series: Tuesday

<P>
   IRVING, TEXAS - He wiped his mouth. He paced. Lost in thought,
head bowed, he shut his tired eyes and pinched the bridge of his
nose.
</P>
<P>
   What should he say? What ``could'' he say? How about, ``We can't
be ``this'' bad, can we?''
</P>
<P>
   We don't know what words Vince Tobin imparted when the doors
closed and the coach was alone with his team in the inner sanctum
of the locker room. It would be unfair of him to lay all the blame
on one person for what happened in Texas Stadium. The Cardinals
38-10 loss was a team effort, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   But if I were Tobin, I might have asked No. 98 to please step
forward.
</P>
<P>
   No. 98 would be the Cardinal not in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric,'' I would have said, as I snapped and grabbed his throat
and was pulled away, kicking, screaming, ``THANKS FOR NOTHING!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Swann is the Cardinals' best defensive lineman. He showed
how valuable he is last year, when his team beat the Cowboys, and
the goal post in Sun Devil Stadium ended up in a sports bar on Mill
Avenue, knocking back shots of Jose Cuervo with happy Cardinals
fans. Swann made six tackles in that overtime victory. He forced a
fumble. Double-teamed, he pressured Troy Aikman the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Swann lost his temper.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   He was ejected in the first quarter of the first game, which
could be a club record.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals lost their best pass rusher _ ``our presence in
the middle,'' Aeneas Williams said _ and whatever chance they had
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin didn't mention Swann by name. He didn't need to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of your best players can't control their emotions, they
can't be counted on,'' the coach said, biting off the words. ``And
we need to count on everyone on this football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Swann a hothead? Or just not very smart? Or both?
</P>
<P>
   In an eloquent understatement, his coach, Hall of Famer Joe
Greene, said of Swann's actions, ``It was not an intelligent thing
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Swann could not have picked a more inopportune time to launch a
boxing career. The defensive tackle who signed a five-year, $25
million contract in the off-season was warned two weeks ago about
the high price of retaliation after he kicked a Seattle player in a
preseason game and was ejected. Defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis
told Swann it doesn't matter what player the other team might lose
in an altercation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the big loser,'' McGinnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Swann sparred with Cowboys tackle Erik Williams. Both were
banished, but Swann for Williams was hardly an even swap. The
Cowboys haven't had a deal this good since the Herschel Walker
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The game changed once Swann left. Without a pass rush, the
Cardinals defense was left short-handed and in big trouble. Give
Aikman time to stand in the pocket and look over the field, and he
can beat anyone, and that's what he did.
</P>
<P>
   The most accurate passer in the NFL completed 22 of 32 and threw
two touchdowns and made it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals didn't sack him. Not once. If you dusted the
Cowboys quarterback for prints after the game, he would have been
clean. Aikman could have played in a tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   Swann participated in only 15 plays. He wasn't in the locker
room after the loss. He left his teammates to sit and wonder why
such a talented and valuable player allowed himself to lose his
cool and hurt his team. Swann isn't a rookie. He is an eight-year
veteran. He should know better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very frustrated at times,'' Larry Centers said.
``You always get an opportunity to get back at a guy on the next
play. Sometimes you can use your frustration and anger as a
motivation. Eric hasn't learned to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Can teams bait Swann?
</P>
<P>
   His sparring partner refused to answer directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quick-tempered guy,'' Williams said. ``He's not going
to take any mess.''
</P>
<P>
   He better learn how to. Others will test him. You can be sure of
that. &QL;

GAILEY, AIKMAN HAD TO MAKE IT BETTER; THEY DID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It's a team that still has the Irvins, the
Emmitts and the Deions, none of them exactly spotlight shy. And
then there's also Mr. Jerry, a man who'd walk a mile to mug for one
minicam shot.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been serious shrinkage for the Cowboys in
football prestige, some of the club's headline acts still can and
will prance and strut with the best of the Denvers and the Green
Bays.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, why not?
</P>
<P>
   When you get right down to who is being held most accountable,
and when you add up Cowboy butts that are truly on the line, it's a
very quick count.
</P>
<P>
   Stop at two, and those two include none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   (1) Head coach, because of the very nature of the job, plus Chan
Gailey is replacing four years of fraudulence. Gailey has to make
it better. He just has to. Period.
</P>
<P>
   (2) Quarterback, because of the very nature of the job, plus
Troy Aikman could never look the other way the past four years. He
became a whistle-blower, exposing fraud in the work place. Aikman
has to make it better. He just has to. Period.
</P>
<P>
   So, after a new era and a new season opened for the Cowboys here
yesterday, it was Aikman, sitting at his locker, who showed a rare,
for him, flash of postgame emotion. The Iceman suddenly lit up like
the Cowboys' side of the Texas Stadium scoreboard had in a 38-10
victory against the shellshocked Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``''Huge'','' he said, with about the same verbal emphasis as he
barks signals. ``This was just huge.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Aikman got down to some specifics, only to backtrack
and ask that it be off-the-record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say this was a very important game for everyone
involved with this team,'' he continued, for print. ``So much had
piled up on us because of last season and because of the winless
preseason, and then we got defensive due to the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to convince a lot of people today that things had
changed, but first and foremost, we needed to convince ourselves
that what we all believed to be true, would be true.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, the opener last season was also impressive. And then there's
the trip into Denver coming up Sunday, speaking of an expected
quick fall for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   But Denver is ahead, and last season is behind. The Cardinals
were here and now. First things first.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's new offense was working under a tiny microscope in this
opener. He was hired to correct two years of severe touchdown
drought. Basically nothing was witnessed in the preseason to
suggest he had the cure. If improvement wasn't on display
yesterday, well, you know ...
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there was no grand-opening offensive act against the
Cardinals. The first quarter looked a pub crawl at midnight in
Sundance Square. Except it was also hot and boring.
</P>
<P>
   The best offensive play early-on for Dallas was Erik Williams, a
so-so tackle, becoming involved in a tussle with Arizona's
all-world defensive lineman, Eric Swann. Both were kicked out of
the game. What a nice trade-out.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, Williams will also pick a fight in Denver with John
Elway. In addition, rookie Flozell Adams took over for Williams and
appeared to play the best right tackle seen around here in awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, did I mention the start for the Cowboys' offense was
slow, but when it started to build in the second quarter, things
changed. Actually, it started to look a bit like the Norv Turner
days.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was involved in some awful plays _ two interceptions off
the hands of receivers, a lost fumble on a pitch, stupid and costly
time management at the end of the first half _ but when he was
good, he was great.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Aikman placed the ball in many hands, as Gailey
said Aikman should, at least if the offense was working properly.
Michael Irvin (nine catches for 119 yards) was, of course, the lead
horse, but, hey, Ernie Mills lives, and so does Billy Davis.
Finally, a second and third receiver got into the flow.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Emmitt Smith, who was not always successful on the
ground, but Gailey remained persistent in calling for the ball to
stay in Smith's hands. Twenty-eight carries and 122 yards later,
and all looked right once again in Emmitt's weird little world.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of flying feet, not since 1990, or as soon as Turner
arrived in town and ordered him to stop, has Aikman been seen doing
this _ taking off upfield almost at will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would that worry me?'' Gailey asked. ``It should have
worried them \Rthe Cardinals\S.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't designed that way,'' added Aikman, who had scrambles
of 23 and 17 yards, plus scored touchdowns on two keepers. Aikman
had never scored two touchdowns in a season, much less a game.
``Working out of the shotgun kind of sets up some running lanes,''
added Aikman, and, of course, the shotgun is something Gailey
brought back to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it was the kind of day when Aikman could kick back
afterward and use a word like ``enjoyable.'' By actual count, he
twice mixed in an ``enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it has been a long while since I could say that and mean
it,'' noted Aikman, smiling. ``It's enjoyable to win, but it's more
enjoyable to see how hard work during the week pays off on Sunday
for all the right reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course of the season, winning this game won't make us
a better team. But the way we worked and concentrated all last week
certainly will.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good beginning for the work ethic and the offense that
Gailey stands for, and also for the quarterback who wanted this
kind of head coach. Therefore, it was a good day for the Cowboys.

LEAF'S REVIEW: JUST LIKE A ROOKIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It took the Chargers' Ryan Leaf only a game to learn
what every NFL quarterback needs to be a success:
</P>
<P>
   A good field-goal kicker.
</P>
<P>
   In his NFL debut, the former Washington State All-American
finished with a far less efficient and productive day as either of
Buffalo's two quarterbacks, Rob Johnson, the ex-Trojan, or Doug
Flutie, the ex-Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   But Leaf had John Carney. The 34-year-old, who missed most of
1997 with a strained medial collateral ligament in his kicking leg,
connected on field goals of 48, 47 and 54 yards, the latter with
4:30 to go in a 16-14 Chargers win Sunday before 64,037 at Qualcomm
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's Steve Christie, meanwhile, missed a 21-yard field goal
to start the fourth quarter and a 39-yarder to end it, presenting
Leaf with a gift victory. He should keep the card as a memento.
</P>
<P>
   The second pick in the 1998 draft did not need anyone to tell
him he had just been smiled upon by the football gods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it was a good performance for everyone except the
rookie,'' said Leaf, as edgy standing on a media podium as he was
at times against the Bruce Smith-less Bills. ``It was a rookie
performance. I made a lot of mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the only way to improve is to keep playing. And if I go 2
for 40 and we still win, what I do doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   At least for a week. Leaf did not get big cheers during
introductions because Chargers fans are known for their
benevolence. The handsomely wrapped gift from Christie and the
Bills will buy him some time to correct his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers had 11 offensive possessions Sunday, and they went
three and out on five of them. Twice, Leaf was intercepted, the
second a horrible across-his-body, back-foot throw which Buffalo
converted into their go-ahead touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, those across-your-body passes over the middle turn
into big plays,'' Leaf said. ``In the NFL, they get intercepted.
It's something I have to learn I can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf was intercepted on two other series, too, but both were
nullified by numbskull Buffalo penalties defensive holding on one
and a stunningly stupid roughing-the-quarterback penalty on Bills
safety Henry Jones as Leaf threw incomplete on third-and-12. The
Chargers wound up getting Carney field goals on both drives.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf's final numbers were 16 for 31 for 192 yards. He was sacked
twice, and 67 of those 192 yards passing came on one play, a bomb
to Bryan Still that led to the only Chargers touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that with a young quarterback, there would be times
when we would struggle,'' Chargers coach Kevin Gilbride said. ``We
knew the adrenaline would be flowing and that he would be nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really wants to live up to the expectations. Until he gets
the confidence to let the game come to him, he's going to make
mistakes. But I'd rather look to improve off a win than a defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Johnson and Flutie deserved a win more than Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who the Bills obtained from Jacksonville for their 1998
first-round pick, completed 8 of 14 passes for 75 yards, scrambled
for 18 more, and had another 31-yard run nullified by a holding
penalty. He moved the Bills into Chargers territory on four of six
first half possessions, but penalties stalled three of them and he
was intercepted on the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's second NFL start ended on his first play of the second
half. William Fuller and John Parrella sandwiched him on an
incomplete pass, leaving Johnson with a chin that required stitches
and a head which required an MRI. The early diagnosis was a minor
concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Flutie, the 35-year-old former Heisman winner from Boston
College who has spent the past eight years winning MVP titles (six)
and Grey Cups (three) in Canada. His first series ended with an
interception, but in general, the one-time USFL New Jersey General
quarterback gave the Bills' offense a goose.
</P>
<P>
   He hit the aged Andre Reed on a 43-yard touchdown on a
juke-and-streak, then completed three passes worth 62 yards to get
the Bills to the San Diego 3 early in the last quarter. That's
where Christie drilled a field goal attempt wide of the right post.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. After Leaf's second pick, the 5-10 Flutie, moved the
Bills 31 yards for the go-ahead touchdown. ``He has a different way
of doing things,'' said Gilbride, ``and all of the schemes we had
were designed for Rob.''
</P>
<P>
   Down 16-14 with 2:10 to go after Carney's 54-yard field goal,
Flutie moved the Bills from their own 25 to the Chargers' 21.
Hindsight being perfect, Wade Phillips would have been better
served letting Flutie shoot for the end zone rather than set up
Christie's fatal 40-yard wide left miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Flutie said, ``because you know at the end
of the season there's a big difference between teams who are 10-6
and 9-7.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team is liable to secure a 1998 playoff spot. Buffalo
crippled itself with 11 penalties worth 118 yards and gained a
meager 90 yards on 28 rushes. The Chargers ran for even less, 67
yards, and had seven penalties of their own.
</P>
<P>
   After a 4-12 season that was as luckless as it was feckless, the
Chargers will take this one regardless of aesthetics. ``Last year,
we never had the ball fall our way,'' Junior Seau said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win is a win,'' Leaf said. ``Every week, you face a good
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Call that another rookie mistake.

DEBACLE IN DALLAS  
 NEW CARDINALS TAKE LOSS THAT'S OLD-FASHIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ There were supposed to be growing pains, some
painful moments when the young but talented Cardinals struggled in
trying to become contenders.
</P>
<P>
   But getting your highest-paid starter tossed out in the first
quarter of a 28-point, season-opening loss can't be chalked up as a
learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were manhandled, 38-10, Sunday at Texas Stadium by
a Dallas Cowboys team that was 6-10 a year ago and hadn't won a
game since last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a debacle,'' cornerback J.J. McCleskey said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, 4-12 doesn't look so bad. At least, the 1997 team kept
its losses close. And after first-round pick Andre Wadsworth's
signing Saturday, you would think the Cardinals would have played
inspired.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, playing their first game under Coach Chan Gailey,
scored their most points in the regular season in four years. Their
439 yards were their best in two seasons. Their 183 rushing yards
were their most since gaining 201 against Washington in November of
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we thought we'd come in and live off all that
preseason hype, but today we got humbled,'' wide receiver Rob Moore
said. ``I hope we have a true understanding of what it takes to win
in this league. I'm very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   An offense that performed so flawlessly at times in the
preseason didn't get a first down except by penalty until the final
two minutes of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman, who never had ran for more than
one touchdown in any season, rushed for two Sunday and finished
with 40 yards, more than any Cardinals' back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call him the `White Slash,' '' Cowboys wide receiver Billy
Davis said in comparing Aikman to Steelers quarterback Kordell
`Slash'' Stewart, who ran Gailey's offense in Pittsburgh the past
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who averaged an NFL-low 78 rushing yards per game
last season, gained only 45 yards on 17 carries in losing their
seventh consecutive season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``We base so much of our offense off our running game,''
offensive tackle Lomas Brown said. ``We put too much pressure on
the other parts of our game when we can't run.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith, who had only two
100-yard games last season, ran for 122 yards on 28 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Michael Irvin, another member of the team's
``Triplets,'' had nine catches for 119 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have guys who have won (three) Super Bowls and people
were writing them off,'' Moore said. ``Today, they showed why they
consistently have been a great football team the past eight or nine
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys did little offensively until Cardinals defensive
tackle Eric Swann was ejected for fighting along with Dallas
offensive tackle Erik Williams with 1:11 remaining in the first
quarter. It came on the end of an interception return by Cardinals
middle linebacker Ronald McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had gained 50 yards on four scoreless possessions with
Swann in the game. They gained 389 and moved at will once Swann
left, his second ejection in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need that push up the middle,'' Brown said of Swann's
presence. ``When he left, you could see them exploit that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to sit next to him on the flight home and have a
long talk. He let his emotions get the best of him. We have to have
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line coach Joe Greene said teams are going to start
trying to get Swann angry and disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``If opposing teams can go at him like that and get him to lose
his cool, get him out of games . . . they'd rather have him in the
locker room watching the game on TV than kicking their butts,''
Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys led, 14-0, at halftime on Aikman's 1-yard run and a
30-yard pass from Aikman to wide receiver Ernie Mills.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had a chance to get back in the game early in the
second half after quarterback Jake Plummer hit wide receiver Rob
Moore for 41- and 27-yard completions.
</P>
<P>
   But Plummer, who hit only 14 of 33 passes for 166 yards, missed
a wide-open Frank Sanders in the back of the end zone on
third-and-goal from the 4, and the Cardinals were forced to settle
for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas then pulled away with three fourth-quarter scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you explain what we did today?'' fullback Larry Centers
said. ``We just didn't get any rhythm offensively. The defense
stayed on the field too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave the Cowboys confidence.'' &QL;

DAAL COMES BACK TO EARTH IN LOSS TO AS TROS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Omar Daal's bid to officially join the National League
earned-run average leaders was put on hold at least until his next
start. But if that turns out like Sunday's outing, the Diamondbacks
left-hander will wait even longer.
</P>
<P>
   Needing to pitch 6 innings against the Houston Astros to
register as a member of the ERA elite, Daal managed only four
innings-plus as the Astros had 17 hits and ripped the Diamondbacks,
10-1, at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been outstanding for us,'' Manager Buck Showalter said of
Daal. ``If anyone deserves an off night, certainly it's him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get spoiled by him. I look forward to seeing him pitch
every fifth day.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the game was among the season's most lopsided defeats,
there was some good news for the home team as the Diamondbacks
broke the three million mark in attendance in their first year of
existence. The announced crowd of 44,076 pushed the season total to
3,029,420 in 68 dates. Colorado, Baltimore and Cleveland _ which
also occupy sparkling stadiums built in the '90s _ also have hit
the magic ballpark figure.
</P>
<P>
   Houston plays in an outdated ballpark built in the '60s, but the
Astros are one of baseball's premier teams. They lead the Central
by 10 games over the Chicago Cubs after getting seven shutout
innings from left-hander Mike Hampton, who had just one victory in
six prior starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are gearing up for the postseason, and this was their
second straight win over the Diamondbacks. Arizona averted a
shutout when Hanley Frias tripled to lead off the ninth and scored
on Brent Brede's infield out.
</P>
<P>
   Daal, lifted after three straight hits started the Astros fifth
inning, gave up seven runs and 12 hits as his ERA jumped from 2.55
to 2.92. That still would be good enough for fifth in the NL, but
his 141 innings comes up just short to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous start, against Pittsburgh, Daal struck out a
franchise-best 12 and won, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   This was nothing like that.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was this Daal's shortest start of the season, the seven
runs were the most he has allowed in a game this year.
</P>
<P>
   Daal gave up a double, single, double and walk to start the
game. Houston scored three runs in the first inning, got two more
on Sean Berry's 13th homer of the year in the third and added two
in the fifth. Craig Biggio and Ricky Gutierrez each had three hits
for the Astros, and every starter except Hampton had at least one
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Daal, scheduled to start Saturday in Cincinnati, is fighting off
a cold and his wife, Josneil, has been going through a difficult
pregnancy. But he downplayed those factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fine, mentally and physically,'' he said. ``I just want
to take it like a bad game. A bad day. Forget about it. Tomorrow's
another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal's control, like most of the other starters, has been
impeccable lately. But he was a little off against the Astros, and
paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't control my fastball, my slider,'' he said.
``Everything was up. I never got ahead of anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Houston's hits were well-struck. But in the first,
Gutierrez bunted and slid under first baseman Travis Lee's tag to
help build the big inning. Later, the Astros pulled a double-steal
when third baseman Matt Williams failed to handle Kelly Stinnett's
throw. And Berry's infield single on a hard shot that shortstop Jay
Bell knocked down but couldn't grab drove in a run.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks were errorless, ``but that's not always
indicative of how good you play defense,'' Showalter said. &QL;

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
PHOENIX _ The Astros were not very happy with the Arizona
Diamondbacks, whose late-Sunday starting time led to an early-a.m.
arrival in Houston today. That doesn't allow for much rest, since
the Astros play the Reds at the Astrodome today at 4:05 p.m.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considering how the Astros poured it on Sunday at Bank One
Ballpark, the Diamondbacks probably couldn't wait for them to get
out of town.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took out their frustrations by cleaning the
Diamondbacks' clocks in a 10-1 thumping that moved them to within a
game of San Diego for the second-best record in the National
League. The Astros also saw two digits shaved off their magic
number for winning the NL Central. It now stands at 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you win like that, it doesn't matter what time you
get home,'' Astros shortstop Ricky Gutierrez said. ``That was a
good win, and this was a great road trip for us. Once that magic
number gets to single digits, you can start thinking about it a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the bullpen was running on fumes, Mike Hampton had
plenty of gas in his tank. After using five of his six relief
pitchers in Saturday's 12-inning victory, Astros manager Larry
Dierker needed a strong outing from Hampton, and that's exactly
what the lefthander delivered. Hampton (11-6) tossed seven shutout
innings, and Mike Magnante worked the final two as the Astros
headed home with a 4-2 record on the road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I needed to go deep into the game,'' said Hampton, who
threw 122 pitches. ``The bullpen did a hell of job for us
yesterday, and they needed a break. I had a decent sinker, and I
was able to keep the ball down for the most part. The defense
played great behind me, and with our team it's gotten to the point
where you can expect to get some good run support.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty reasonable assumption. The Astros have outscored
their opponents 108-57 over their past 18 games, winning 14.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Sunday's offensive firepower was provided by Sean
Berry, who drove in four runs, and Richard Hidalgo, who had three
RBIs. The Astros piled up 17 hits _ one shy of their season high.
Gutierrez and Craig Biggio led the way with three hits apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense can explode at any time,'' Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly didn't waste any time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who have won 10 of their last 14 games on the road,
jumped on Diamondbacks starter Omar Daal from the opening bell with
three consecutive hits, including Derek Bell's two-run double.
Berry, who is hitting .468 since the All-Star break, also drove in
a run with an infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Berry struck again in the third with a two-run homer _ his 13th
of the season and seventh in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berry is on fire,'' Dierker said. ``That's the way it's been
all season with our team. Bill Spiers is hurt, and Sean is knocking
the cover off the ball. When Sean was hurting, Spiers was knocking
the cover off the ball. That tells you what kind of depth we have
on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros made quick work of Daal, knocking him out of the game
with two more runs in the fifth. Hidalgo and Berry picked up the
RBIs with a double and groundout, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   It was the shortest outing of the season for Daal (7-10), who
allowed a season-high seven runs in his four-plus innings. It also
marked just the second time in his last six starts that Daal
allowed more than one earned run. He entered the game with an ERA
of 2.55. It went up to 2.92.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daal has been pitching well lately, and he's having a good
year,'' Dierker said. ``But we managed to get some good swings at
him this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Righthanded reliever Ben Ford pitched three innings in relief of
Daal and almost escaped the Astros' wrath. But the odds caught up
to him in the seventh when Brad Ausmus' RBI single pushed the
Astros' lead to eight. Diamondbacks reliever Frank Rodriguez didn't
fare much better, allowing two runs on Hidalgo's bases-loaded
single in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks scored their only run in the ninth when Hanley
Frias tripled and scored on a ground ball by Karim Garcia. It
spoiled the Astros' shot at their 10th team shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point in the game and with that lead, you basically
have to say, `Here. Hit it,''' Magnante said. ``It's better to do
that than to nibble and start walking people. You have to make them
earn their way around the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   After putting an exclamation point on a successful road trip,
the Astros earned every bit of what little sleep they can get
before today's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a challenge to get up and do it again,''
Dierker said. ``But I imagine we'll find a way to win, because
that's what this team is all about.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ New Cowboys coach Chan Gailey promised his team would have
a new look this season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were passes out of the shotgun, four-receiver sets,
quarterback scrambles, a reverse and even a fake reverse.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference in the Cowboys' look for Sunday's
season opener? A victory.
</P>
<P>
   After going winless in the final five games of 1997 regular
season and all five preseason games, the Cowboys finally
experienced victory, beating the Arizona Cardinals 38-10 before a
sellout crowd of 63,602 at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things came together for this football team today, but we have
not arrived,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of highlight moments for Gailey's new offense,
beginning with the two touchdowns by quarterback Troy Aikman. Not
only had Aikman never scored twice in a game in his 10-year career,
he never had scored twice in a single season.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin, who lines up on both sides and in the backfield
in this new offense, had another 100-yard receiving game, the 44th
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   And though Emmitt Smith didn't cross the goal line, the
four-time NFL rushing leader carried 28 times for 122 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get mine in the end,'' Smith said when asked about
Aikman's two touchdowns to his zero. ``Trust me, he's going to cut
it down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas defense was equally improved. After finishing 24th in
the NFL against the run last year, the Cowboys held Adrian Murrell
to 35 yards on 13 attempts, an average of 2.7 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we wanted to do _ shut down the run,'' Cowboys
linebacker Dexter Coakley said. ``And then we were able to contain
the pass. We did a good job of containing (Cardinals quarterback)
Jake Plummer. He's one of those guys who can really beat you if he
gets outside the pocket and runs. We kept him in check today.''
</P>
<P>
   They stopped the Cardinals on all 10 third downs, limiting them
to 13 first downs in all and 205 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we couldn't sustain anything,'' Cardinals coach
Vince Tobin said. ``We had plays to be made early but could not
execute. We were hyper with dropped balls. We got our first-and-10s
in the first quarter when the game was competitive, but I don't
know of any area that performed up to our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   That proved to be the only competitive quarter; it ended in a
scoreless tie. The Cowboys then got two touchdowns in the second
quarter to take a 14-0 lead by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman crossed the goal line first, darting in from one yard out
to cap an 88-yard drive. Aikman scored again in the third,
scrambling two yards to give Dallas a 21-3 edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to him on the sidelines, and he said he was
tired _ tired of running,'' Smith said. ``I don't want him to
jeopardize his body.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman carried five times for 40 yards, including a 23-yard
sprint up the middle. He was the only player to score more than one
touchdown in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to move (the pocket) any more than
we did in the past,'' Aikman said. ``But being in the shotgun in
the third downs, it lends itself a little more to the quarterback
scrambling some. You're able to see the lanes develop a little
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' scoring drives were 88, 59, 31 and 70 yards. The
final TD came when Kenny Wheaton recovered a Cardinals fumble at
the Arizona 15-yard line and ran it in.
</P>
<P>
   All the drives were highlighted by big plays. Aikman hit Irvin
with a 37-yard pass to help set up the first touchdown. Ernie Mills
caught a 30-yarder over the middle to score the second. A 16-yard
run by Smith put the Cowboys into position for the third. And on
third-and-eight, Aikman scrambled up the middle for 17 yards in the
final drive.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who was beaten out by Billy Davis for the No. 2 receiver
spot, was a surprise standout, catching four balls for 78 yards and
one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   And Irvin, the No. 1 receiver, enjoyed himself as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the offense; I like the different things I get to do,''
Irvin said. ``There are lots of things I didn't do tonight that I'm
sure we'll do later. Everybody, offensively, has confidence in what
Chan does. That's the key. Today was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Cowboys gained 439 total yards, converting
seven of 13 third downs. They were 0-for-3 on third downs in the
first quarter, 7-for-10 the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we weren't doing well in the first quarter,''
Aikman said. ``But we stayed out of some long downs in the second
half and were able to convert on the third downs.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were some opening-day snafus. The Cowboys ran out the
game clock at the Arizona one at the end of the first half, failing
to take a timeout to kick a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman threw two interceptions and the Cowboys had two fumbles
(one lost) for a total of three turnovers. They forced only two.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also had 11 penalties for 70 yards. Five of the
Cardinals' 13 first downs came via Dallas penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled early and made a lot of mistakes,'' Smith said.
``Fortunately, we didn't let the mistakes turn the game. We just
adjusted and corrected some. Normally, when you make the mistakes
like we made today, they cost you the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys learned last year that an opening-day victory, even
a blowout, doesn't ensure a successful season. They knocked off
Pittsburgh 37-7 last year only to end the season 6-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys next travel to Denver to take on the Super Bowl
champion Broncos, and are taking along some confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no comparison,'' Smith said. ``We're a different team.
We're not comparing this team to last year.''

STUDY SHOWS CHANGING FACE OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Today in 3rd graf, today refers to Monday.) 
By YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite a healthy economy, a majority of
Californians are holding jobs for shorter periods of time, have two
or more adults working per household and are working longer hours,
according to a study.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to dissect the nature of today's labor market,
researchers at the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the
University of California, San Francisco, conducted a yearlong
statewide survey of more than 1,700 adults and found that the
nature of employment in California has changed fundamentally.
</P>
<P>
   While the study, to be released today, found that unemployment
rates are low, researchers also found that jobs are increasingly
held for shorter periods. Among adults who are employed, almost
half (45 percent) report having worked for their current employer
for two years or less, while 22 percent worked less than one year
for their employer. The median job tenure is three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the dynamic nature of the economy, turnover in
jobs is at unprecedented levels,'' the study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The study, titled ``The California Work and Health Survey'' also
found that rates of job displacement are high, with one in six
California adults reporting that over the last three years they
either have lost a job or left one because they expected to lose
it.
</P>
<P>
   A profile of the work force shows that almost half of those
employed are 18 to 34 years old, 43 percent are female and 57
percent are male. More than half of the work force (58 percent) is
white, 27 percent is Latino, 7 percent is African-American and 8
percent is Asian.
</P>
<P>
   A large chunk of those employed tend to work long hours, with
about a third of the state's workers putting in 45 hours or more
per week and more than 40 percent reporting that their work pace is
fast and without breaks.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, households tend to have more than one adult
wage-earner (52 percent), but only 10 percent of workers hold down
two or more jobs, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   People who have not finished college, those age 55 and older and
those in poor health continue to have low rates of employment, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   On a more positive note, 60 percent of the state's workers said
they have the flexibility to change the hours they start and end
work. And more than one-third of those employed said that within
the last year they were promoted or made a job change that improved
their pay or status.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economy's strength, Los Angeles County reported the
highest number (24 percent) of household incomes below 125 percent
of the federal poverty level. Statewide, 18 percent of those
surveyed reported household incomes below 125 percent of the
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   Workers who tend to have difficulty living on their current
incomes tend to be female, under the age of 35 and not in excellent
health. Those who have no difficulty tend to be male, 35 or older
and in excellent health.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of California adults will be surveyed annually about
their employment and health for the study, which is funded by the
Work and Health Initiative of the California Wellness Foundation.
The results have a sampling error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage
points.

MCGWIRE, SOSA COME FACE TO FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS - Baseball is riding such an incredibly tasty wave
these days, it's only fitting the game's two biggest attractions
will be in the same ballpark for the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   For a game that has continually found a way to trip over itself,
that Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa will be at Busch Stadium this
afternoon and Tuesday night is akin to fool's luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the stars are lining up just right for this game,''
Cardinals outfielder Ron Gant said. ``The way this season has gone,
this is exactly the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   With Roger Maris' single-season home run record of 61 now within
biceps' reach _ McGwire is at 60, Sosa at 58 _ the game has been
dealt the equivalent of an inside straight.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens when the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis
Cardinals play these next two days, there will be no losers. The
biggest winners will be baseball and its growing legion of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be electrifying,'' said McGwire, who ripped one
into the seats Sunday that went foul by about eight feet. ``If you
can't be looking forward to these two games, then your heart is not
beating.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if neither hits a home run, there will be great
disappointment. Just about everyone in a stadium where McGwire or
Sosa is playing has come to anticipate a home run every time either
takes an at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast for the next two days? Unbridled optimism, starting
with the two stars of this motion picture-like scenario.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa seem to feed off each other as each attempts to
become the one to reach Maris first.
</P>
<P>
   Of McGwire's last nine home runs, 10 have come within 24 hours
of a Sosa home run. A quirky statistic like that cannot be simply
coincidental. Even if neither wants to admit it publicly, something
is going on between these two.
</P>
<P>
   The Busch Stadium scoreboard has even added a temporary category
_ a season home run tote board for McGwire and Sosa, whose only
lead this season occurred two weeks ago when he went ahead of
McGwire for 58 minutes in a game between the two clubs at Wrigley
Field.
</P>
<P>
   At Busch Stadium, the energy level rises to unfathomable levels
whenever McGwire is announced as the hitter. The frenzy of the home
fans is arguably unmatched in any of the other 29 big-league
ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   With each hitter enjoying unthinkable amounts of adulation in
opposing ballparks, the question now turns to how the Busch
faithful will receive Sosa, who is on the verge of becoming only
the fourth player to hit 60 home runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardinals fans have a reputation for being the most gracious
in the league,'' St. Louis Manager Tony La Russa said. ``I would
bet the great majority will recognize the greatness of Sammy.
Knowing St. Louis, they will give him what he earns.''
</P>
<P>
   So now the great home run chase of 1998 will turn its spotlight
up to full strength. Not only do the stars seem to be aligning in
just the right pattern, but the starting pitchers also seem
susceptible to lending a hand to this chase.
</P>
<P>
   Today's starters, Darren Oliver for St. Louis and Mike Morgan
for the Cubs, have combined to allow 29 home runs this season.
Tuesday's starters, St. Louis's Kent Mercker and Chicago's Steve
Trachsel have allowed a combined 30 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wrote a script like that and tried to sell it, you'd
get run out of town for being trite,'' said Commissioner Bud Selig,
who will remain in St. Louis the next two days and continue to
follow whomever leads at the time. ``It's unbelievable. I didn't
think I got nervous, but every time (McGwire) comes to the plate,
it's suffocating.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's infectious smile has managed to whip fans into a
delirious state whenever he bats. While McGwire is less
demonstrative, his genuine joy basically comes through the camera
during his post-game news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Just about anyone watching senses that these two are not putting
on any kind of act. They are sincere in their enjoyment of being in
their current positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rivalry has been so good,'' Selig said. ``These two young
men have captivated this country and captivated it in the best way.
This is a case where people are genuinely happy. One of the reasons
is the way the people involved have conducted themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   They swing, they connect, they send home runs screaming toward
the planets. Who couldn't love that equation? &QL;

<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. LOUIS _ This is why we stood in the back yard when we were
kids, our moms begging us to come in because it was getting dark.
</P>
<P>
   Our shirts were sweaty and dirty, our homework was untouched,
and dinner was getting cold. But we stood there, maybe with a
couple of friends from up the block, maybe all alone, with our
imaginations running wild and wandering to impossible dreams.
</P>
<P>
   We swung away at ragged baseballs, slamming them time and again
into the side of the garage. In our minds, we poked prodigious,
historic home runs. We imagined the fans craning their necks trying
to see our titanic shots, the flashbulbs popping, the cheers
echoing off the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   We practiced tipping our caps. We mocked our own play-by-play
calls, the announcers shouting our names and calling us things like
great, stupendous and heroic.
</P>
<P>
   This _ the Cubs' Sammy Sosa vs. the Cardinals' Mark McGwire,
beginning today at Busch Stadium _ is why we should have known
baseball would make a comeback from the depths it sank to in 1994,
when egos and salary disputes crippled a game that offers something
no other sport does.
</P>
<P>
   Time to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Imaginations were in full force Sunday afternoon every time
McGwire stepped to the plate as he tried to match Roger Maris'
big-league record of 61 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   With Roger Maris Jr. sitting down the first-base line, cradling
the bat his father used to smack No. 61 in 1961, there were 47,904
imaginations running wild at Busch Stadium and millions more doing
the same across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Would this be the day? How high and how far would the ball
travel? Who would be the unlucky pitcher? What would the cheers
sound like echoing off the rafters?
</P>
<P>
   Every time McGwire stepped up, the nervous tension and
anticipation seemed obvious on everyone's face except his. He was
cool, if ultimately unfulfilled, when the closest he got to
hammering No. 61 was a drive that wound up about 380 feet away but
about five feet foul in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, until his final eighth-inning swing ended with a
blistering grounder fielded by Reds second baseman Bret Boone,
baseball took a deep breath and enjoyed every moment McGwire
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors stopped their barking and simply watched. Fans stood and
clasped their hands together, as if praying for No. 61 to come.
Flashbulbs popped. Announcers cleared their throats. Even players
from both sides stepped up to the rail in front of their dugouts
and let imaginations run.
</P>
<P>
   This is what baseball gives us that no other sport does. This is
what will make the two-day showdown between Sosa and McGwire only
the latest addition to a remarkable resurgence for the game. Maybe
McGwire or Sosa will get No. 61. Maybe they won't get it, ever.
That's baseball.
</P>
<P>
   With baseball, we have time to think. We have time to watch
McGwire or Sosa take batting practice, or their practice swings in
the on-deck circle. We have time between innings to figure out how
many more at-bats they might have on this day. We let the
anticipation build, the nerves fray and the imagination wander to
countless hopeful thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the NBA thrills us with its nonstop action. But with the
NBA, we don't know that Michael Jordan is going to wow us until he
actually does. It's a flash of brilliance. There is no warning, no
dramatic anticipation, the way McGwire stares down pitchers or
steps out of the box to flex, or the way Sosa digs in mightily
before every at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the NFL probably is this nation's new No. 1 sport, with
its action, athleticism and entertainment. We love it. But in the
NFL, you either have game or you don't. Rare is it when one or two
players can get into an unfathomable groove, an otherworldly space
where they can captivate an entire nation like McGwire and Sosa
have.
</P>
<P>
   That's baseball. That's what Sosa and McGwire, like Cal Ripken
Jr., Pete Rose, Roger Maris and Joe DiMaggio before, have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a word out there to describe it, but I don't know
what it is,'' Cards manager Tony La Russa said. ``You just
appreciate the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1994-95 strike, many of us left baseball. But we
should have known we would come back, because Sosa-McGwire is what
baseball gives us that no other sport does. Time to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball commissioner Bud Selig called the home-run chase a
``situation in life that makes people happy.'' He said it was
enthralling and captivating. And it is.
</P>
<P>
   It is the looks on all the faces. It is the anticipation we feel
when the great sluggers go face-to-face for nine innings, like they
will today.
</P>
<P>
   It is what we imagined when we were kids and what we will see
up-close beginning today. Titanic shots, flashbulbs popping, cheers
echoing off the rafters.

ABC CREW CONNECTS WITH ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dann Dierdorf isn't hiding his head in the sand, nor is he too
embarrassed to his wear his old team beanie. The Cardinals Hall of
Famer, however, is frustrated with the state of affairs in
Birdland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a soft spot in my heart for this team,'' said
Dierdorf, who has been a member of the ``Monday Night Football''
crew at ABC-TV for 12 years. ``I played with the Cardinals (in St.
Louis) for 12 years, and I would love to see them regain some claim
to respectability.
</P>
<P>
   `'It's been a long time. They've accomplished next to nothing
since they've been in the Valley, but they may be on the verge of
rounding the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   But they'll have to round that corner on Sundays. For the third
straight season, none of the Cardinals' games will be on a Monday
night. ABC will begin its 29th season tonight, with New England and
Denver kicking it off at 5:20 p.m. (Arizona time) , 40 minutes
earlier than in the first 28 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the Cardinals, the booth will have an Arizona
flavor. Dierdorf will be joined by fellow analyst Boomer Esiason,
who put in a stint as a Cardinals quarterback, and play-by-play man
Al Michaels, who attended Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason, who replaced Frank Gifford on the three-man team,
didn't stay as long as Dierdorf did _ ``I played there for six
months and got out as quickly as I could'' _ said Cardinals fans
have a good reason to be excited about the coming season:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big-time player in Jake Plummer.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember the other guy? Frank Gifford? He's still around, but
his role has been diminished. He said that while it may appear that
he was forced out of his analyst's role after 27 years and handed a
pre-game gig, he maintained that was not the case. But he was not
happy with how things came about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition from the booth has been an easy one,'' Gifford
said. ``It had been talked about for a long time, but it was not
handled very well. I'm including myself in that. There was
miscommunication when Boomer came into the booth, and this kind of
leaked out before they talked to me in a definitive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told it was strictly up to me . . . It didn't appear
that way, but it actually was.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifford, who also spent eight years with CBS, figured he has
done about 700 games, and he said he's ready to spend more time
with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through one entire family I hardly knew,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Gifford helps to set the game up with Chris Berman, he
will get right into his pre-game show, which will last for about 20
minutes, and will focus on personalities of the game. The show,
done in partnership with NFL Films, will feature Broncos
quarterback John Elway tonight, and a main part of the story will
be his relationship with his high school coach.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Berman, better known for his antics at ESPN, will
show the top eight impact plays of the week, plus other ``plays''
from the pop or news world.
</P>
<P>
   Another addition to the team is sideline reporter Lesley Visser.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels said the new look is a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to get better every week,'' he said. ``The show has
always evolved. Our new roles are fairly well-defined.''
</P>
<P>
   For Esiason, it will be interesting to see if he is able to make
his point without trampling on his partners' air time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not naive enough to think I have all the answers,'' he
said. ``The biggest problem is realizing I know so much about the
game, and it's compacting my thoughts into short sound bites. At
times, I've been a little wordy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try to enlighten the viewer without being overbearing. I
feel comfortable, at home in the booth.'' &QL;

GILKEY HAVING VISION PROB LEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Diamondbacks outfielder  &UR; Bernard Gilkey likely will be
used on a limited basis by Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter during the last
three weeks of the season because Gilkey is having vision
difficulties. Gilkey said he probably will have corrective laser
surgery after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm debating on that, but I think I'm going to do it. I want
to get my eyes to the best possible vision I can,'' said Gilkey,
hitting .233 with five homers and 33 RBIs this season. He is
hitting .247 with one home run and five RBIs for the Diamondbacks
since being acquired in a trade with the New York Yankees on July
31.
</P>
<P>
   The type of surgery being considered has not yet been approved
by the Food and Drug Administration, according to Showalter, and
isn't scheduled to be approved until October. The procedure
apparently is legal in Canada now.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey was grazed in the front of the batting helmet by a pitch
from Pittsburgh's  &UR; Rich Loiselle on Wednesday and has not played
since, undergoing an exam in which his eyes were dilated on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When he was with the Mets, Gilkey was hit in the head by a
pitch, and has been having migraines off and on, but he doesn't
believe those are related to his current situation. He apparently
has had migraines since he was a youth.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said he thought part of the reason that Gilkey was hit
by Loiselle was because he didn't see the pitch very well. At times
this season, Gilkey also has appeared to have had trouble judging
fly balls at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey said he has tried contact lenses, but does not feel
comfortable with them. Although he denies that vision has affected
his play this season, Gilkey said the surgery ``sure couldn't hurt
my performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been taking batting practice in the cage, but I'm still
kind of in a holding pattern right now,'' he said. &QL; 
Drip . . . drip . . . drip &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What's up?'' third baseman  &UR; Matt Williams was asked as he
walked through the Diamondbacks' dugout before Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams looked back toward the infield and said, ``I think we
almost had a rainout.''
</P>
<P>
   A rainout? In a retractable-roof ballpark? Well, uh, almost.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds crew apparently was surprised by the strength of a
storm that arrived at the downtown Phoenix facility around 4 a.m.
Shortly after 1 p.m., about 3{ hours before the game, the crew had
a few portable fans out in an attempt to dry the infield and was
spreading sand that made the surface look much lighter than normal.
</P>
<P>
   It did not affect batting practice or the start of the game. &QL; 
Noble gesture &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks catcher  &UR; Kelly Stinnett stopped at Good Samaritan
Hospital on Sunday to visit  &UR; Jeff Boswell, the fan who was injured
when Stinnett's bat splintered and sailed into the crowd near the
home dugout on the third-base side during Friday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to be in pretty good spirits. I hope he gets out
soon,'' Stinnett said. &QL; 
3 million fans &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Larry Yena, a season-ticket holder from Chandler, was the 3
millionth fan to pass through the gate at BOB on Sunday. He was
rewarded with some prizes, including a ticket upgrade for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have drawn 3,029,420 fans, an average of 44,550
for 68 home dates. The team has 13 games remaining at home and five
on the road. &QL;

WADSWORTH MAKES GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It didn't take rookie defensive end  &UR; Andre
Wadsworth long to make his presence felt Sunday. On the fifth play,
Wadsworth, who ended a 44-day holdout Saturday, made his pro debut
at Texas Stadium, assigned to rush Dallas quarterback  &UR; Troy Aikman
on third and seven.
</P>
<P>
   The only way Cowboys right tackle  &UR; Erik Williams could keep away
Wadsworth was with hands to Wadsworth's face, a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   That's as close as the Cardinals came to sacking Aikman during a
38-10 season-opening thrashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre looked like he hadn't played in a while, but I thought
he was pretty good,'' said Cardinals defensive line coach  &UR; Joe
Greene. ``He came out no worse for the wear. He wanted to play. It
was good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Wadsworth was credited with one assisted tackle,
playing mostly as a nickel rusher early, and later relieving  &UR; Jerry
Drake and
 &UR; Simeon Rice at the ends on a hot muggy day.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Wadsworth apologized for the long holdout, saying he
knew it was a distraction to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we've got it out of the way,'' Wadsworth said. ``Now
they can forget about the stuff with me. I'm here. Now, let's get
focused on winning games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reactions were slow. I need to get some reps for the better
of me and the team.'' &QL; 
Turn out the lights &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't get any easier for the Cardinals, who on Sunday will
be chasing a 41-year-old rejuvenated quarterback,  &UR; Warren Moon, and
the otherwise youthful, up-and-coming Seahawks in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our backs already are against the wall,'' said Cardinals
cornerback
 &UR; J.J. McCleskey. ``Young teams like ours have to win early.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the Cardinals' worst opening loss since a 31-0 decision
in 1990 at Washington under  &UR; Coach Joe Bugel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the NFL, there are many distractions,'' said cornerback
 &UR; Aeneas
 &UR; Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that in the NFL, every week you have to
learn to focus. Look at Tampa Bay last year after it started 4-0.
There were thousands of reporters there, and they stayed focused
and had a great season. As a young team, we have to learn to do
that.'' &QL; 
Bad breaks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jake Plummer will never know how it might have changed the
game, but when he reviews game films, he plans to watch with
considerable interest a controversial kicking penalty against right
tackle  &UR; James
 &UR; Dexter. That nullified a 38-yard pass to tight end  &UR; Johnny
McWilliams to the Cowboys 3-yard line on the Cardinals first
possession. Instead of an early lead, the Cardinals had to punt
after the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see that kicking call,'' Plummer said. ``You're
going to have penalties but you hope they don't come on plays like
that. We were going to score a field goal for sure and we might
have had a touchdown.'' &QL; 
Take a seat &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The team declared outside linebacker  &UR; Terry Irving, tight end
 &UR; Terry
 &UR; Hardy and cornerback  &UR; Ty Howard its three game-day inactives.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Irving, who went into training camp listed first at
right outside linebacker, on the bench might have proved costly.
Starter
 &UR; Tony McCombs suffered a shoulder injury that could sideline him for
a week. Short on linebackers,  &UR; Patrick Sapp, whose action had come
mostly on the left side behind  &UR; Jamir Miller, was forced to finish
the game on the right. &QL;

COWBOYS SHOW RECEIVER CORPS NOT BARREN 
INSDIE THE GAME ANALYSIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Yes, the Cowboys can still use Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   However, if yesterday's performance can be used as evidence, the
Cowboys appear to better stocked than anticipated at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboy coach Chan Gailey always knew this. Everybody else found
out in the 38-10 victory against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin, showing that he's primed to regain his All-Pro
status after a two-year hiatus, led the way with nine catches for
119 yards. Free-agent pickup Ernie Mills added four catches for 78
yards, including a 30-yard touchdown reception. And first-year
starter Billy Davis had three receptions for 33 yards, including a
13-yard touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernie played great,'' Irvin said. ``Billy played great. All
the receivers played great. Football was fun today.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is not why _ the Cowboys usually have fun on
opening day _ but how. Especially after a summer when the
second-receiver quandary was second only to the pass rush as the
most asked question in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Added to the burden was the haunting presence of Moss, the
bad-boy rookie whom the Cowboys passed on in the 1998 draft. Moss
landed in Minnesota and has been an instant success, catching two
touchdown passes yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, however, said all along that a receiver wasn't the
primary concern in the draft because he believed in his current
group. What also was overlooked was how the Cowboys' new offensive
scheme could help Irvin become an even bigger threat.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's performance supported both assertions.
</P>
<P>
   While last season's offense was criticized for being
predictable, it also failed at times in not being able to get the
ball to Irvin, who was frequently double-teamed because of the
absence of a bona fide threat at second receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals took advantage last season when they held Irvin _
guarded primarily by All-Pro cornerback Aeneas Williams _ to just
six catches for 54 yards in two games. What wasn't said then was
how Williams got help from safety double-teams and how the Cowboys'
offense played right into their hands by using Irvin only at
outside receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's new system addressed that issue by moving Irvin to the
slot and in motion out of different formations to confuse the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The plans worked to perfection. Locked on Williams by himself,
Irvin repeatedly found room. Irvin certainly noticed the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the offense,'' Irvin said. ``I like the different
things I get to do with the movement and motion. It gives me a
chance to make plays. I like anything that allows me to make
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receivers coach Dwain Painter said that was the design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irvin is going to be a big part of this offense,'' Painter
said. ``He proved to anybody who doubted where he's at that he can
still play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Painter said the performance of Mills and Davis should quell
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had experience with Ernie and we knew what we had coming
in,'' Painter said. ``And Billy did a great job. People are going
to have to realize that we have other pass-catchers.''

CARDINALS' DEFENSE OFFENDS  
 SWANN'S EJECTION LEAVES LINE VULNERABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ How quickly the balloon of giddiness deflates.
</P>
<P>
   One evening, Andre Wadsworth arrives and it's like New Year's
Eve. The next afternoon, Eric Swann leaves _ technically, he was
``asked'' to leave _ and it's like the stock market crashed for a
defense that gave several supposedly aging Dallas superstars
carte-blanche in a 31-10 season-opening loss Sunday at Texas
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman was enjoying
a free and happy life under an assumed name in the Federal Witness
Protection Program. He threw 32 times, and the next time the
Cardinals sack him will be the first.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't stop with 256 yards and two touchdowns passing. Aikman
out-rushed Adrian Murrell, the Cardinals' featured running back. In
fact, Aikman, with 40 yards, very nearly out-rushed the entire
Cardinals offense (45 yards). Aikman's two rushing touchdowns
marked the most he's ever had in a ``season.''
</P>
<P>
   And how old was Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith supposed to be
_ 35, 40? He was spry enough to tote the ball 28 times for 122
yards.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was a humiliating experience for a youthful
Cardinals defense that endured the early exit of one of its leaders
and then fought through a series of injuries while being roughed up
by the former Super Bowl champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, maybe that's what it takes,'' said Cardinals end
Simeon Rice. ``It's not a game where you assume a win, you have to
get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Humbling?'' Pro Bowl cornerback Aeneas Williams asked
rhetorically. ``To me, we never had any reason to boast in the
first place. We are still a team that is learning how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals may have pulled off three turnovers _ including an
interception and fumble recovery by Cardinals middle linebacker Ron
McKinnon. Yet there were all sorts of theories for the collapse
that resulted in the Cowboys rolling to 439 total yards, converting
seven times on 13 third-down plays, gaining 4.4 yards a rush,
holding the ball for a 15-minute advantage, and still dominating a
young defense:
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Wadsworth holdout Saturday. No matter how the
club tried to soft-peddle it, it was a distraction. It might have
caused the game focus to take a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Swann suffering his second ejection in three games, this time
for duking it out with Cowboys right tackle Erik Williams, who also
was given the heave. Swann was drawing double-team attention.
Without him, the Cowboys had little regard for the Cardinals'
front.
</P>
<P>
   Underestimating a crew that in the early 1990s won three Super
Bowls but was coming in on a 10-game skid, final five last season
and all five in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think back to practice last week, and I didn't think we had
the intensity we needed to have,'' said outside linebacker Jamir
Miller. ``I blame myself. I'm a captain. I did see it, and I did
bring it up, but I should have been more adamant about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had some guys who looked at Dallas and felt they
would just fall down, like we were just going to come in here and
roll over the top of them. Maybe this was a learning experience for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and several teammates were irked by Swann's ejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset at him, we need him, that's inappropriate,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin was in a lather, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing good defense until one of our best linemen got
kicked out,'' Tobin said. ``We only had seven dressed, and one of
those (Wadsworth) had never played a snap.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Swann, the Cardinals had no presence up front, starting
a chain reaction throughout the unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave too many big plays,'' McKinnon said. ``It's all about
big plays.'' &QL;

COACH EXPECTS TKACHUK TO BE IN CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - Coyotes Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld might be
dreaming, but he expects disgruntled left wing  &UR; Keith Tkachuk to
honor his contract and report to training camp Friday with the rest
of the team's veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, he's a player under contract, and I
expect to see him here for the first day of training camp,''
Schoenfeld said Sunday, the first day of the team's rookie camp at
the Cellular One Ice Den in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources continued to say that Tkachuk will not play for
the team until he receives an acceptable contract extension.
Tkachuk, the team's captain and leading scorer the past three
seasons, has two years remaining on his current contract. He wants
an extension that will pay him $40 million through the 2002-2003
season.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld, who has built a strong relationship with Tkachuk in
the past year, declined to answer how he would feel if Tkachuk
becomes a holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll address that when and if it happens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been recent talks between General Manager
 &UR; Bobby Smith and Tkachuk's agent,  &UR; Bob Murray, a significant gap
remains in their negotiating positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea whether Keith's going to report to camp or
not,'' Smith said. ``We talked the other day about that, and Bob
Murray wouldn't commit to that either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he is willing to continue negotiations if Tkachuk
reports to camp, but if Tkachuk is still trying to get the $40
million over five years he seeks, ``then he'd be better off not
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith reiterated that he is hopeful the club will be able to
re-sign its three remaining unsigned free agents _ defenseman
 &UR; Keith Carney, right wing  &UR; Shane Doan and goalie  &UR; Scott Langkow _
before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Score card update &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least two players have decided to change their jersey numbers
from last season, according to the team's training camp guide.
Right wing  &UR; Rick Tocchet has gone from No. 92 to No. 22, the number
formerly worn by recently retired 700-goal scorer  &UR; Mike Gartner,
and enforcer
 &UR; Jim Cummins has abandoned No. 20 for No. 15, which center  &UR; Craig
Janney wore until he was traded to Tampa Bay this summer. &QL;

PICASSO SHOW DRAWS MIXED PALETTE OF VIEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The opening of the Pablo Picasso retrospective at
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art offered up distorted faces,
bulls and Minotaurs, and, of course, the artist's many women.
</P>
<P>
   With 115 paintings, sculptures, drawings, collages and prints
created between 1904 and 1971, the exhibit had at least a few works
to delight everyone attending Sunday. And if they were perplexed by
some pieces, they were fascinated or amused by others.
</P>
<P>
   Budding art star Aaron Yamagata, 8, of suburban Encino was there
with his mother, Didi, getting an education in a different way of
looking at the world. Aaron said he prefers Leonardo da Vinci
because of the Renaissance master's realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picasso doesn't paint things realistic,'' he said. ``He's not
my favorite artist, but he is a good artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum spokesman Keith McKeown said 4,500 people attended Sunday
and up to 400,000 people are expected to view the exhibit before it
closes Jan. 4. Tickets remain available through Ticketmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Mari Hulick found inspiration Sunday in ``Card Player''
(1914). The painting has many layers, from decorative elements of
the room surrounding the subject to the cards themselves, which
almost seem to float in space. Little of it conforms to reality as
we've seen it depicted by other artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get lost in the looking at,'' said Hulick, who was
sketching a copy of it with a pen. ``Which to me is what art is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people weren't inclined to make the effort to understand
Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wife viewing ``Girl Before a Mirror'' (1932): &LR;  ``She's looking
at herself in a mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Husband:  &LR; ``Oh, yeah?''
</P>
<P>
   Eight-year-old Lauren Landau, who attends The Buckley School in
suburban Sherman Oaks, looked at ``Project for a Monument to
Guillaume Apollinaire'' (1962), and admitted she wouldn't mind
climbing on the jungle gym-like sculpture. But she read some
writing on the pedestal and said climbing was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called `Please Don't Touch,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A few exhibit patrons clearly found some of Picasso's work a bit
off-putting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mother examining drawings: &LR;  ``It's Picasso's erotic art.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Teen &LR; - &UR; age daughter: &LR;  ``Eew!''
</P>
<P>
   But others at the show Sunday deemed the really challenging
pieces all the more rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   Take ``Woman Dressing Her Hair'' (1940), which features a woman
whose face and body don't exactly have their parts in all the usual
places. Ken and Elizabeth Merfeld loved the painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his inimitable style,'' said Ken Merfeld. ``I think it's
one of the strongest pieces in the show. It has a grotesqueness
with the bulbousness of the body parts. She's alluring in a bizarre
way. ... I'm fascinated with his play with dimension and use of
space.''

LOSS EXPOSES ASU'S WEAKNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona State cornerback Courtney Jackson was right. The sun did
rise on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the gray clouds that dotted the Valley skies were a metaphor
for the hangover the Sun Devils were feeling after Saturday night's
scoring binge with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss was a bitter pill,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said of
the 42-38 defeat. ``But in terms of trying to have a good season .
. . Are we a lousy team or do we have a chance to be a pretty good
football team?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a chance to be really good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils dropped six spots to No. 14 in the Associated
Press poll. The Huskies jumped from No. 18 to 11 and moved into the
driver's seat of the Pac-10 race. ASU will have two non-conference
games _ against Brigham Young and North Texas _ before it resumes
league play against Oregon State on Oct. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils have plenty of issues to sort out. Saturday's
game was a mix of promise and disappointment. Snyder addressed the
highs and lows on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The misses &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The defense's struggles against Washington's wide-open passing
game.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder acknowledged that the Huskies caught ASU off guard by
going to a shotgun and using five-wideout formations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington did some things offensively that we've never seen
Washington do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The inability of the secondary to stop the Huskies on a
fourth-and-17 play with less than a minute remaining. Quarterback
Brock Huard connected with tight end Reggie Davis for a 63-yard
scoring play.
</P>
<P>
   Davis got past cornerback Phillip Brown and evaded safety
Mitchell Freedman before reaching the end zone. Freedman, who is
one of the defense's best players, appeared to be trying to strip
the ball from Davis instead of tackling him and possibly holding
the Huskies to a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't talked to him,'' Snyder said. ``But I think maybe
his instincts took over. He believed he could punch the ball out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils' failure to convert on a fourth-and-1 at the
50-yard line in the third quarter. Tailback J.R. Redmond was
stopped for no gain. The Huskies scored on the next series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be some question if I should have done it at all,
although I don't really second-guess that.'' Snyder said. ``But the
choice of play, I should have called something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder thought the overall defense could have played better, but
believes the group will improve.
</P>
<P>
   What the Huskies ultimately did was expose the weakness of the
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be better against a more compact offense, rather than
one with five wideouts, a shotgun, no backs,'' he said. ``(Based)
on our personnel, and lack of depth in the secondary, we'll match
up better with a team that tries to be more balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   The hits &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Ryan Kealy is in top form. The sophomore passed for
302 yards and three touchdowns and didn't throw an interception.
</P>
<P>
   Creig Spann is going to make an impressive wide receiver unit
even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Spann is making the most of the sixth season the NCAA granted
him. He made some difficult catches and showed no fear of going up
the middle. He caught four passes for 71 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond is everything he's billed to be. He may not win the
Heisman, but he deserves any hype he receives. He shed tacklers
with ease and had a spectacular punt return for a touchdown called
back because of a penalty that probably didn't even affect the
play.
</P>
<P>
   Lenzie Jackson, who had five kickoff returns for 134 yards, is a
strong addition to special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Davaren Hightower gives the Sun Devils depth at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a beautiful opportunity to evaluate where we are,''
Snyder said. ``We've got to make sure they don't believe we're a
lousy team, because we're not. We've got to put all our focus on
BYU and get a win, something to build on.''

FINLEY SHUTS OUT ROYALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels reached the playoffs in Chuck Finley's
first season in the big leagues _ 1986 _ and haven't been back
since.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the 35-year-old lefty made a season-high 147 pitches
while throwing eight shutout innings in the Angels' 3-0 victory
over the Kansas City Royals on Sunday night before 33,941 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Because Texas lost, the Angels increased their lead in the AL
West to 3{ games with 19 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got all the offense they needed in the first inning
on Garret Anderson's three-run single off losing pitcher Tim
Belcher (12-12). Shigetoshi Hasegawa pitched a 1-2-3 ninth and
earned his fourth save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the game belonged to Finley, who allowed only three hits and
matched a season-high with 10 strikeouts. It was the third time
this season and 25th time in his career Finley has struck out 10 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time of the season you don't want to leave
anything out there,'' Finley said of his high number of pitches.
``I've got 13 years invested here, I'm going to do whatever it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley (11-6) had won only once in his previous five starts,
including two no-decisions on the recent East Coast trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great road trip, but I felt I didn't do a dang thing
to help us because we lost both games I pitched,'' Finley said. ``I
felt I'd pitched well all year, but September sheds more light on
what you're doing. I just wanted to do something to help the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want him to throw 145 pitches, but he did a great
job,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``I don't have to tell
you how important Chuck's going to be down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels put together their winning _ and only _ rally off
Belcher in the first inning, getting some help from the Royals
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had a runner at first with two out when Tim Salmon
his a grounder to the hole at short. Third baseman Scott Leius made
a diving stop, but his throw to second was too late to force Randy
Velarde.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Jefferies followed with a grounder to shortstop, but Shane
Halter booted it, loading the bases for Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson bounced a single to center, scoring all three
baserunners. Because the count was 3-2, the runners were moving
with the pitch and Jefferies got a tremendous jump off first as
Belcher went into his slow and deliberate wind-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time I've ever done that,'' Jefferies said of
scoring from first on a single. ``But that was my thought. If
there's a base hit, I'm going to score. That's why you run hard all
the time. (Third-base coach) Larry (Bowa) is very aggressive. It's
the element of surprise. I don't think (center fielder Johnny)
Damon thought I was going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got down in the count, I kind of did that Nomo
wind-up,'' Belcher said. ``I was so focused on trying to get the
hitter, Jefferies was just gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher went the distance without allowing another run, but the
damage had been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like 10 runs for me,'' Finley said of the three-run
inning. ``Usually I don't get that until the sixth or seventh
inning if I get it. That was big for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley took it from there. During one stretch, he retired 10
batters in a row. Not until the seventh inning did the Royals get a
baserunner as far as second base. No Royals baserunner reached
third in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had command of his fastball and he threw some good breaking
balls,'' Collins said of Finley. ``When he has command of his
fastball it sets up his split-finger. When he's making pitches with
his fastball he can get you out without having to use the
split-finger.

IT'S NOT NFL, HARDLY NASCAR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Welcome to L.A., where the only roar around the
Coliseum on Week 1 of the NFL season was supplied by a buncha
career-challenged NASCAR drivers slamming off portable concrete
barriers in Exposition Park, which forced the neighbors to crank up
the volume on their Sonys to try to decipher what Tim McCarver and
Bob Brenly were rambling on about how cool it would be if Mark
McGwire hit his 60th home run swinging the stick that Roger Maris
actually used for his 60th....
</P>
<P>
   _ The reason why the NFL can boast that each of its 15 games
Sunday were ``sellouts'' is because, in two cases, the teams did
sell out _ to the local TV station. CBS affiliate WKRC in
Cincinnati (no relation to... never mind) bought the Bengals' last
1,300 tickets to guarantee the local telecast and huge local ad
revenue !ital!after the league extended the 72-hour blackout rule.
In St. Louis, where sports fans drooled over Busch Stadium seats,
KTVI handed out $10,000 for the last 400 tickets to make sure the
Rams were at least on for the opener....
</P>
<P>
   _ NFL teams don't announce the no-show counts anymore. If they
did, they'd find that some teams averaged 55,000 last year,
reported the Wall Street Journal....
</P>
<P>
   _ In observance of Labor Day, the NBA owner and player reps
called a potshot truce. They all gathered around the TV to watch
Jerry Lewis' plea for more nickels and dimes to fight muscular
dystrophy....
</P>
<P>
   _ If the NBA players stick together on their issues, it's called
unity. If the NBA owners stick together on the issues, it's called
collusion. If the NBA fans get tired of the players and the owners
sticking it to them, it's not uncalled for....
</P>
<P>
   _ Many thanks again to our local Fox affiliate for sticking with
``The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' show Saturday morning instead
of that meaningless Cardinals-Reds game. It was MMPR episode No.52,
``The Sewerman Cometh'' _ the only one we hadn't been able to tape
to add to our collection....
</P>
<P>
   _ Sports, Accessories &AMP; Memorabilia Inc. will be hawking a
limited edition McGwire bobble-head doll for just $48.95. Andro not
included....
</P>
<P>
   _ The statistic that amazes even Vin Scully the most in all this
home-run talk: The year Babe Ruth hit his 60, he sacrificed 14
times....
</P>
<P>
   _ The Abbey restaurant in Seal Beach has run out of promotional
hats. That's because McGwire wears one during post-game press
conferences, so now everyone wants one....
</P>
<P>
   _ Too bad this two-game Cards-Cubs series isn't in Chitown. Love
to see a Wrigley customer throw back a McGwire home-run ball....
</P>
<P>
   _ Sources for The Sports Business Journal say that the
UCLA-Adidas deal brought the school more than $18 million in cash,
products and other kinds of contributions....
</P>
<P>
   _ Kings GM Dave Taylor drags his family home from a vacation in
Ontario just in time to see if he can talk Rob Blake into showing
up at the opening of camp Friday. Bring plenty of cash....
</P>
<P>
   _ If P.J. Goossen shows anything in his fight at the Reseda
Country Club on Wednesday, he could be next in line to take on
Macho Camacho ....
</P>
<P>
   _ Sean Burroughs' strategy for getting the San Diego Padres to
sign him _ hole up in a USC dorm room and threaten to go to class _
is one that all big-league prospects should consider. Then
forget....
</P>
<P>
   _ The Florida Marlins' pending ownership transfer from
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Huizenga to Boca Raton commodies trader John Henry
</P>
<P>
   could keep Dave Dombrowski anchored as the GM rather than have
him take any job the Dodgers would offer. Henry has already said
he'll spend dough to make the team competitive in the near
future....
</P>
<P>
   _ The family of former XTRA-AM talk-show host and ``Monday Night
Football'' producer Chet Forte was awarded $1.7 million last week
in a wrongful death suit filed against his cardiologist, Steven
Gross ....
</P>
<P>
   _ Can't be too surprised the Rose Bowl folks considered adding a
corporate sponsor for their facility. Best one we coulda come up
with is Old Grandad scotch....

   _ Move over Rap Master Shaq: Lakers guard Kobe Bryant
</P>
<P>
   seems to believe he has a future in the music business, having
signed a deal with Columbia. He's expected to enter the recording
studio soon....

<TEXT>
<P>
   Admit it: Everything you've ever learned about football has come
from TV.
</P>
<P>
   Try hitting the books once in awhile, Paulie.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, there's no shortage of gridiron-enlightening
literature, some specifically aiming to give you a lesson or two
when you least expect it:
</P>
<P>
   The Long and short of it: Main author credit on ``Football For
Dummies'' (IDG Books, $19.95, 407 pgs) is given to former Raiders
star, current Fox analyst and future has-been movie star Howie
Long, but it's our guess that the ``With John Czarnecki'' credit is
where a bulk of the info comes from.
</P>
<P>
   Czarnecki, a former Los Angeles Herald-Examiner NFL writer, is
really the fact-finder behind Fox's NFL Sunday shows. And he can
form a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   As with all ``Dummies'' books in the series, especially the
sports versions, the info is basic and well organized, but not
dumbed down enough to irritate those who pretend to know it all.
Just follow the icons (especially the cartoon version of Long) and
you even get an explanation of something you assumed was something
else.
</P>
<P>
   For a laugh or two at Howie's expense, also read how he recounts
the particular way he used to pull on his uniform (page 32) and his
tribute to Raiders owner Al Davis (page 231).
</P>
<P>
   The gospel according to Rosie: ``Football Doesn't Have to be a
Dirty Word: A Woman's Guide to Understanding the Sport'' (Advanced
Resources, $6.95, 27 pgs, (626) 797-9721) comes from Rosalie G.
Robles, a former nun and first cousin of ``Cheech'' Marin, which
seems to be enough qualification for anyone to write a know-it-all
football book.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously about 200 pages shy of Howie Long's endorsed effort,
Robles' simplistic approach is done so that only those who want the
bare essentials aren't overwhelmed. Yes, it can be a complicated
game, but it can also be explained easy enough for wives who
haven't figured out why their husbands spend so much time in front
of the TV yelling at guys in helmets on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good things happen when we give of ourselves and of our time
for someone else's enjoyment,'' writes Robles, an L.A. native who
does motivational speaking in the Pacific Northwest. ``The payback
is tremendous and almost always becomes mutual.''
</P>
<P>
   The abridged version from ESPN: In ``The ESPN Ultimate Pro
Football Guide'' (Hyperion/ESPN books, $14.95, 346 pgs), almost 50
folks are given author credit. It shows.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 30 NFL teams receives eight-to-10 depth-defining
pages that detail everything from franchise history, team trivia,
all-time position-by-position squads and media coverage info, plus
stuff about the stadium, sports bars and hotels in each city.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the ESPN heavyweights are credited more heavily than
the other researchers. It's another way to get the brand name out
there in the pursuit of world media domination. Even Chris Berman
gives the introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Get past that part, and enjoy it for its breezy approach.
</P>
<P>
   The latest angle from Jenkins: ``Rude Behavior'' (Doubleday,
$24.95, 421 pages) is the eighth novel and 15th book from fabled
football author Dan Jenkins. It's all one could expect from the man
who started ``Semi-Tough'' as a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   This one picks up the exploits of Billy Clyde Puckett, 20 years
after his debut in ``Semi-Tough,'' as he leaves the broadcast booth
and tries running an NFL expansion team owned by his father-in-law,
Big Ed.
</P>
<P>
   Hijinks ensue, Jenkins' style.
</P>
<P>
   His rants on modern-day football continue to be on target. As
you read it, imagine what actors will play each character when
someone finally gets around to making the movie version.
</P>
<P>
   The vanity that is Elway: Win a Super Bowl, and you can do
almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Elway'' (Benchmark Press, $50, 120 pgs), the story of the
former Granada Hills High preppie is chronicled in giant-sized,
coffee-table-book splendor. You hold this thing up, and it seems
better suited to show off more pictures of Monet's ``Water
Lillies.''
</P>
<P>
   This book can't possibly chronicle the entire essence of Elway,
it can only hope to contain it. John Elway is given writer's
credit, but with a book like this, the pictures of Marc Serota make
it.
</P>
<P>
   And fifty-freakin'-bucks? It'd be cheaper to get a dish and
watch all the Broncos games on TV this season.
</P>
<P>
   On the last page, Elway says: ``I can look at myself in the
mirror and say that I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING I could have done in my
football career.''
</P>
<P>
   Except retire. &QL;

 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani stepped up his defense Sunday
of police officers who stormed the stage at a youth rally in Harlem
on Saturday, saying that they had decided to move in only after the
keynote speaker began urging the crowd to fight and even shoot
police officers if provoked.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions about the rally's abrupt ending mounted Sunday, with
the organizers and community leaders in Harlem accusing the city of
using excessive force to shut down what had been a peaceful event.
</P>
<P>
   They threatened to sue the city, saying the police had defied a
court order permitting the rally and had violated the civil rights
of thousands of participants.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani gave several explanations for the police action. Early
Sunday, he said at a news conference that organizers of the even
had flouted a ``sacred'' court order by going past a 4 p.m.
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to know why the police came in at 4:01, go read
the court order,'' Giuliani said. ``This is all about creating a
respectful society. The court said they had between 12 and 4; it
meant exactly that.''
</P>
<P>
   But that explanation seemed at odds with comments that the mayor
made shortly before the rally, in which he said that the police
would allow ``some reasonable flexibility'' in ending the rally at
4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in a call to a reporter on Sunday night, Giuliani
sought to reconcile his previous comments. He said that the police
would indeed have allowed the event to run late, if the chief
organizer, Khallidun Abdul Muhammad, had not begun inveighing
against the officers in a speech laced with obscenity and
anti-Semitic slurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were quite prepared to be more flexible, but when the
speech turned to incitement to riot and murder, they closed down
the event,'' Giuliani said. ``I had given them the discretion to
make that determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 4 p.m. on Saturday, as dozens of officers in riot
gear assembled behind the stage, Muhammad told the crowd to gird
themselves for possible attacks by the police. If attacked by
officers, he said, members of the crowd should ``take their guns
away and use their guns in self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Muhammad was finishing his five-minute speech, a police
helicopter swooped low over a section of Lenox Avenue known as
Malcolm X Boulevard, where a crowd estimated by the police at 6,000
had assembled for the rally. Officers climbed onto the stage,
ducking thrown bottles and chairs as they shut down the sound
system.
</P>
<P>
   One civilian was injured as the crowd was dispersed, but not
seriously. About 15 police officers also received minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir said after the
rally that they wanted Muhammad to be charged with inciting to
riot. Although they said so again Sunday, no charges had been
pressed by Sunday night. Muhammad seemed to have disappeared from
the city, and neither his aides nor his son, Farrakhan, who
attended an afternoon news conference held by some of the rally
organizers, would disclose his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   But at that news conference, several organizers said they hoped
to sue the city for violating their constitutional rights to gather
in public, and for holding their event to a different standard from
that of the hundreds of other rallies that take place on city
streets each year. And in Harlem, several elected officials said
they would call for an investigation of whether police officers at
the rally had complied with the city's rules for dispersing crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody should be prosecuted, it should be Mayor Giuliani
and the police officers who engaged in criminal conduct,'' Michael
Warren, a lawyer for the rally organizers, said at a news
conference in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. ``We must go back to
court to challenge the propriety and the manner in which the police
dealt with our people in Harlem yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Two police officers who were observing the news conference were
assaulted by a group of men after the event ended at 4:30 p.m., the
police said. Officer Dennis Laffin, a Police Department spokesman,
said two officers dressed in plain clothes were assaulted as they
sat in an unmarked police car in front of 456 Nostrand Avenue. The
attackers tried to pull one of the officers from the car, broke the
vehicle's windshield and punched the other officer in the head, he
said. Neither officer was seriously injured and the attackers
escaped, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rally on Saturday culminated a monthslong battle between
organizers and the city. The city had denied the organizers'
request for a rally in Harlem on Labor Day weekend, saying the
neighborhood could not safely accommodate the one million people
that the organizers originally predicted would attend. It offered
an alternative time and location.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor repeatedly condemned the rally as a ``hate march,''
while the organizers complained that he was violating their
constitutional rights to free speech and used increasingly
strident, antiwhite invective against him.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a three-judge panel for 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals found last week that the organizers had a right to hold a
rally but not to dictate the terms of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   After a lawyer for the organizers acknowledged that they
expected only 50,000 people, the panel narrowed the rally, from 12
hours and 29 blocks to just four hours and six blocks. Community
leaders, who in recent weeks have walked a fine line between
denouncing Muhammad's racist statements and acknowledging his right
to free speech, said Sunday that they were disgusted by his remarks
at the rally, in which he called Jews ``bloodsuckers'' and
encouraged the crowd to beat police officers with wooden barricades
if the officers assaulted anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But State Sen. David Paterson and several other elected
officials from Harlem said they found the actions of the police on
Saturday even more appalling. ``We've been calling the organizers
irresponsible for the last month,'' Paterson said. ``We wouldn't
expect anything different from Mr. Muhammad. The shocking thing was
the fact that the police stormed the tranquil crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton also lashed out at Giuliani and the police
Sunday, questioning why the police had not allowed a ``grace
period'' of several minutes before shutting the rally down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a total irresponsible, juvenile action to allow someone
to move to that level of escalation at that stage of the game,''
Sharpton said. ``The march was over, Khallid Muhammad was walking
off the stage, there was no longer a threat of danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Other community leaders said the aggressive police action had
the unfortunate effect of making Harlem residents more angry at the
city than at Muhammad and others who spewed invective at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had ended in peace, maybe the focus would have been
totally on the language,'' said Bill Perkins, a City Councilman
from Harlem. ``Since the day ended in violence, the violence is the
focus. The police are the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone was one of the only public
officials who made a point of defending the police force Sunday. A
Democrat who is running for governor, Vallone said during a debate
Sunday that the police ``handled themselves very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he could have and should have been arrested on
the spot,'' Vallone said of Muhammad. ``Calling for violence like
that is absolutely outrageous.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ST. LOUIS _ Five feet, more or less. That's all that separated Mark
Mc-Gwire and destiny Sunday afternoon.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the first pitch of the bottom of the sixth inning from
Cincinnati pitcher Brett Tomko, McGwire hit a cannon-shot line
drive down the left-field line. Off his bat, it looked as if the
St. Louis Cardinals first baseman had connected for his 61st home
run, which would have tied Roger Maris' single-season record.
</P>
<P>
   But the line drive hooked foul and screamed into the loge-level
seats at Busch Stadium out of play by about five feet. McGwire
eventually struck out in that at-bat and went 0-for-3 with one walk
as the Cardinals beat the Reds 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   The countdown for the home-run record will continue today in
dramatic fashion. McGwire and the Cardinals will host Chicago Cubs
right fielder Sammy Sosa, who has 58 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Neither McGwire nor Sosa hit a home run Sunday, meaning
McGwire's record-tying homer and perhaps No. 62 could come with his
season-long competitor standing in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be electrifying,'' said McGwire. ``It's going to
be exciting. If you can't look forward to these two games, then
your heart is not beating.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's game, McGwire nearly set the hearts of the Gateway
to the West beating at a furious pace. The home run that wasn't was
the talk of the day at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said he didn't think the ball was going to stay fair
after he took one look at the way it began to hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, on contract, yes, I thought it had a chance,'' said
McGwire. ``But as it got into the outfield, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomko, who got McGwire to line out, issued him a walk and struck
him out, admitted he had a sinking feeling after the pitch left his
hand and McGwire unloaded one of his vicious swings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he hit it, I thought it was out,'' said Tomko. ``I
thought I had given up a home run. But when I saw it had a little
hook to it, I just looked away and didn't watch where it landed. It
was strike one, and I was thinking about the next pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the KMOX broadcast booth, legendary Cardinals broadcaster
Jack Buck nearly experienced an announcer's nightmare. The ball
left the park so quickly that Buck could scarcely begin his
trademark, ``Swing and a long one '' home-run call.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one got out there so fast, you couldn't even talk about
it,'' Buck said on the air after the crowd of 47,904 stopped
screeching and waited for the next pitch to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Buck said: ``I'm just glad it wasn't a home run.
I need a rainbow to say what I want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   In McGwire's first at-bat, he hit a screaming line drive that
Reds shortstop Barry Larkin caught on a dive. In the fourth inning,
Tomko walked McGwire on four pitches to start a two-run rally by
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   After the Cardinals went ahead 3-2 in the bottom of the eighth
against Reds reliever John Hudek, McGwire hit another line drive.
This one nearly took off Hudek's head as it went up the middle.
Second baseman Bret Boone made a good play to throw out McGwire.
Hudek then gave up back-to-back home runs to Ray Lankford and
Fernando Tatis.
</P>
<P>
   No one wanted to talk about those long balls, of course. Hudek,
incredibly, was asked by a reporter after the game if being hit by
a line drive up the middle by McGwire might be something a pitcher
would remember in this historic season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody wants to get hit by a line drive like
that,'' said Hudek. ``That's pretty ridiculous. That's like telling
somebody, `Go out on the interstate and wait to get hit by a
bus.'''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said he didn't think the ball was hit hard enough to hit
Hudek and lauded Hudek for going right after him for the second
straight day. For the series against the Reds, McGwire was 1-for-11
with one homer and six strikeouts. Reds pitchers threw 21 balls and
29 strikes to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the baseball world will stay on St. Louis today as
McGwire and Sosa go head-to-head. Twenty times this season, both
players have hit home runs on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has homered in 13 of his last 19 games. Sosa has hit
home runs nine times in his last 14 games. The last eight homers by
McGwire have come within 24 hours of a home run by Sosa, and five
have come on the same day. Despite that, McGwire insists he doesn't
feel he is being nudged toward the record by Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no competition,'' said McGwire. ``I don't know where
this `competition' started. It's just so good for the game of
baseball what is going on right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Sosa hit his 58th homer Saturday night in Pittsburgh _
hours after McGwire hit No. 60 in St. Louis _ he said he believes
there has been a healthy competition in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pushing each other,'' Sosa said. ``We're not going to
stop now.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the anticipation for the next two games between the
Cubs and Cardinals is ratcheting higher and higher in St. Louis. A
crowd of nearly 800 media representatives is expected to report on
today's game. The fever pitch is building.
</P>
<P>
   As Cardinals outfielder John Mabry put it: ``There's going to be
more reporters around here than if Elvis found Jimmy Hoffa's
body.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FARGO, N.D. _ It's another typical afternoon inside the Brass Mint
Lounge and Casino, just off the lobby of the Holiday Inn. Which
means that despite a high sun, cool air and perfect weather to be
outside in the wide-open spaces riding the range and chasing little
dogies like the Marlboro Man, the modern-day cowboys are sitting
inside a dark, smoky room watching the flickering pictures from
faraway places and racing each other through packs of cigarettes
and longnecks.
</P>
<P>
   There's a bartender named Jon, a waitress named Laura, four guys
who have commandeered two tables in order to spread out the rosters
of their fantasy-football-league teams, a man sitting by himself
with his arms folded across his chest and eyes that might be
closed, and a big-bellied fellow named Bob nursing a scotch while
playing blackjack against a blond dealer who just might be the
richest person in this part of the state if boredom were currency.
</P>
<P>
   When Mark McGwire steps up to home plate in the first inning for
this first shot of the day at hitting home run No. 61, which would
tie him with local legend Roger Maris, barely anyone notices. Maybe
that's because of the eight televisions spaced out near the ceiling
all around the room, only two are tuned into the Cardinals-Reds
baseball game. Five TVs are showing the 49ers against the Jets, and
the other has the NASCAR race from Darlington, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's because that after a summer of seeing McGwire and
Sammy Sosa making their runs at Maris, now, as Big Mac is perched
on the doorstep of history, Fargo is finally at peace with letting
go of the record.
</P>
<P>
   For 37 years, the home-run record has belonged to Fargo as much
as it has to Maris. The memory of a quiet, modest man and this
nondescript city on the northern plains had embraced each other and
forged a mutual identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most famous person to ever come out of North Dakota?'' asks
Sid the would-be snoozer, repeating the question. ``Sure, he was.
And I can't even tell you who might be in second place. Roger's
ours. Always was, always will be. Gives us a reason to stick out
our chests and feel proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly more than the deliciously quirky 1996 movie Fargo,
which told the story of a multiple murder, a victim who was chewed
up in a woodchipper, and a pregnant chief of police named Marge
Gunderson and left the impression that everybody in town talks with
a funny accent and says, ``Yah, sure, you betcha.''
</P>
<P>
   Fargoans are not fond of talking about that movie, and neither
for much of the summer were they too keen on the idea of somebody
knocking Maris from the top of the home-run list.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Wayne Blancard, a friend of Maris, was only
too happy to give this quote to the New York Post: ``I hope they
(McGwire, Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr.) break their legs. Roger's
record is something for us to hold on to.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, this is now, and the inevitable has a way of
changing your perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem at all with McGwire,'' D.J. tells his
buddies. ``He's a class act all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not mouthy,'' says Gary. ``He's the kind of guy who
probably would fit right in here and would have fit in with
Maris.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of bad feelings around here when the talk
about the record going down first started,'' Mike says. ``But
really, when you think about it, I guess what McGwire and Sosa have
done has drawn a lot attention back to Roger Maris and to Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time McGwire comes back to bat in the fourth inning, the
football fans are needling each other over the respective catches
of Jerry Rice and Wayne Chrebet. A few other customers arrive and
ask for the score of the Vikings game. Sid finishes his beer and
leaves. Big Bob's stack of chips has shrunk, and he has gained
company at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``What brought you all the way here from Houston?'' a woman
named Connie asks a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris, she is told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?'' asks Connie. The dealer rolls her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Maris' four sons are shown on the TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen them around town?'' D.J. asks his friends.
``They're here most every summer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' says Paul, who has no time for baseball.
``When are they going to put the score of the Dallas-Arizona game
up there?''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the room, a handful of bettors are
handicapping horse and dog races piped in from Saratoga and
Jacksonville. None of them even looks up in the sixth inning when a
McGwire line drive screeches just foul down the left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   Fargo now believes that Maris' consolation prize for being
pushed down to No. 2 or No. 3 on the homer list is that the renewed
interest in his career might finally win him election to the Hall
of Fame by the veterans committee.
</P>
<P>
   But as McGwire steps into the batter's box one more time in the
eighth, the topic has switched to what one might do if he caught
the historic 62nd home-run ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give it back to him,'' D.J. says matter-of-factly. ``It's
only right. It makes me sick to hear people say they'll hold out
for the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' says Mike. ``Get an autographed jersey and bat. Maybe
some game tickets. That way you've got something of your own, and
McGwire gets what he deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute,'' says Gary. ``Are you telling me that if I
walk in here with a half a million dollars and put it on the table,
you're going to walk away happy with an autograph?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, well, yeah,'' says D.J. ``If you just hand me the money,
I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire swings one more time and sends a grounder up the middle
that's gobbled up by the Reds' Bret Boone. He's thrown out at
first.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris and Fargo will keep the record for one more day.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bob turns back around to the blackjack table. ``Hit me,'' he
tells the dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You betcha,'' she replies.

RED SOX SWEPT OUT OF TORONTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The distinction may be lost on hand-wringing Red Sox
fans who have watched the team's lead in the wild-card race shrink
to five games with 21 left to be played. But there's a difference
between ``the sky is falling'' and a SkyDome mauling.
</P>
<P>
   Before he and his teammates take the field against the New York
Yankees Monday night in Fenway Park, Mo Vaughn plans to remind them
of that in the aftermath of a four-game sweep by the Toronto Blue
Jays that concluded with an 8-7 loss Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three big games coming up against the top baseball
team in the world,'' Vaughn said. ``If we can't get ready to play
these guys, we don't deserve what we're shooting for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 thing is not to doubt yourself, second-guess
yourself. Just play the game, dammit. Don't add any extra pressure.
We're in the lead, we're in command. How we respond in the next
week will determine whether we deserve to be in the playoffs or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   With manager Jimy Williams stewing somewhere out of sight after
being ejected in the sixth inning by plate umpire Dale Scott, the
Red Sox responded to a 7-1 deficit by scoring two runs in the
seventh and four in the eighth. Darren Bragg's RBI single following
Troy O'Leary's two-run double and Mike Stanley's RBI ground-rule
double tied the score.
</P>
<P>
   But reliever Derek Lowe couldn't hold service in the bottom of
the eighth, giving up a single to Tony Fernandez and a two-out
triple to Craig Grebeck, the miniature second baseman who would be
mistaken for one of Roger Clemens's kids if he spelled his first
name with a K.
</P>
<P>
   ``You fight back to the point where you think momentum is on
your side, but it didn't work out that way,'' said Stanley, who hit
his 29th home run, a two-run job that knocked out starter Chris
Carpenter in the seventh, before doubling off Paul Quantrill in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think there are too many guys in here thinking
about how we came back. They're thinking about the L.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe hadn't given up an extra-base hit in almost a month _ since
Will Clark doubled off him in Texas Aug. 9. The gapper by Grebeck,
who spots the 6-foot-6-inch Lowe a foot, was the blow that gave the
Blue Jays their 10th win in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' Lowe said. ``Bad timing, I guess. But you go
3-and-1, 3-and-2 _ I don't know if I was trying to lay it in there,
but it didn't have much sink and it drifted back over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no cause for Lowe to groove a pitch in that situation.
Fernandez had stolen second, so first base was open, and the No. 9
hitter, Alex Gonzalez, was due. But it was in keeping with the lost
weekend for the Sox bullpen, which gave up 10 earned runs in 10 1/3
innings here.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Pete Schourek, who is still 0 for Boston in six
appearances, left after five innings with a 4-1 deficit fashioned
by Jose Canseco's 40th home run, Shawn Green's two-run homer (No.
32), and Gonzalez's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   John Wasdin entered in the sixth, which began with a bloop
single by Canseco, who had five hits and three walks in the series,
including home runs in each of the last three games. Wasdin walked
Carlos Delgado, and after a ground ball moved the runners up, he
intentionally walked Fernandez. Then came the unintentional walk on
a 3-and-2 pitch to Benito Santiago, which forced home a run and
unhinged Williams, who was thrown out for disputing the call but
didn't leave until after he'd done some Lou Piniella-like
landscaping, kicking up the dirt around home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Grebeck bounced a ground ball up the middle for two more runs,
and it was 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd done my job,'' Wasdin said, ``we would have won that
game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of weekend for the Red Sox. They led only once
in four games, 1-0 Thursday night, and held that lead for one
inning. They were just 6 for 28 with runners in scoring position.
Vaughn, who hit his 35th homer for Boston's first run Sunday, Nomar
Garciaparra, and O'Leary combined to go 10 for 46 in the series,
with four RBIs. The Sox lost four in a row for the first time since
Baltimore swept them after the break, and they are now 15-18 in
their own division.
</P>
<P>
   And now come the Yankees, who in the next three nights can
accomplish what has been a foregone conclusion since Mother's Day:
clinching the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are we at as far as the standings?'' Bragg said. ``Five
up?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were picked to finish in fourth place. You talk to anybody
in this clubhouse and if they thought we'd be five up at this time
of year, they'd all be pretty happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad series, but it's over. We have a five-game lead,
and nobody picked us to be here.''

L.A.'S SAN FERNANDO VALLEY REAPS REWARDS FROM HOLLYWOOD GROWTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, despite its image
as little more than a massive suburb, has become one of the driving
forces of Hollywood, a place where the nuts-and-bolts work of
entertainment production takes place.
</P>
<P>
   Within a two-mile radius from downtown Burbank, a city bordering
L.A., are three of the biggest studios in the world _ Disney,
Warner Bros. and Universal, which generated an astounding $34
billion in revenues last year. Television has a huge presence with
NBC in Burbank and CBS Studio Center in Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   That's just the start. As worldwide demand for new programming
grows, production companies have been scrambling for space beyond
what Johnny Carson used to derisively call ``beautiful downtown
Burbank.'' Here are some of the most notable examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ For more than a year, hundreds of Disney animators have
occupied a former Lockheed plant near the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena
Airport that was once used to develop technology for spy planes
like the SR-71 and FA-117. Disney also bought 96 acres of property
in Glendale last year from Prudential Real Estate, figuring it made
more sense to own rather than rent.
</P>
<P>
   _ The massive Marquardt plant in Van Nuys, once used to build
anti-tank bombs, is now rented out to movie and TV producers such
as Disney, Warner Bros. and Spelling Entertainment, with as many as
five productions shooting simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   _ The former Redken shampoo factory in Canoga Park has been
renamed Ray-Art Studios and is home to four massive soundstages
with more on the way. ``We must get six calls a week from
production companies looking to shoot pilots here,'' said Harry
Smith, general manager of the facility. ``I wish we had more space
because there's definitely a demand for more large stages.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Panasonic announced in March it would move into 45,000 square
feet in North Hollywood to accelerate development of digital
products.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nickelodeon opened an animation studio in Glendale earlier
this year for production of five TV series, and DreamWorks SKG
opened its animation headquarters in the city a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lincoln Property Co. agreed earlier this year to buy Lockheed
Martin Corp.'s Rye Canyon aerospace test site in Valencia and
convert much of the 511 acres to entertainment production.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lincoln also plans to build 600,000 square feet of buildings
at the vacant railroad yards north of Dodger Stadium for
post-production and multimedia companies that can't find space in
Burbank, Glendale and Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   _ Location filming outside studio lots is booming. ``The
industry is just jamming right now,'' said Jim Thompson, head of
the Real to Real location-scouting service in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   _ And finally, after years of devastation in the commercial real
estate market, developers are erecting ``spec'' structures designed
to attract entertainment companies _ the 24-story Glendale Plaza,
which recently opened, and Burbank's six-story Media Center, due in
2000, between Warner and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   All this comes against a backdrop of hundreds of Valley
businesses already delivering the thousands of nitty-gritty show
business details every day, from prop builders to those who insert
laugh tracks in situation comedies. The success of the
entertainment industry has been so thorough that Burbank now boasts
an office vacancy rate of less than 5 percent while Glendale's is
under 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All this has not always been so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkable that in 20 years the entertainment industry
and the movie industry has gone from an era where its very survival
was questioned due to video and cable into an era where it has
rebounded resoundingly,'' said William R. Boyd, a senior vice
president of Grubb &AMP; Ellis and a veteran broker of commercial
property in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   For Boyd, a key move came in the early 1990s when Disney began
to move some of its corporate operations, such as its Disney Store
headquarters, from Burbank to Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, with Warner and Disney rooted in Burbank, it
wasn't too long ago that there was still a lot of resistance to go
outside,'' he recalls. ``The proximity issue was paramount, to coin
a phrase. I can recall a conversation in 1990 that even though you
could see Glendale from Burbank, Glendale was still too far way.''
</P>
<P>
   David Defore, first vice president at CB Commercial in Sherman
Oaks, said the demand for space for entertainment companies is now
percolating through the entire Valley. ``It just gets heavier as
you go toward the Burbank Media District,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's resulted in higher rental rates _ now better than $25 a
square foot annually in Burbank _ and drops in vacancies as far
away as Woodland Hills, where Warner Center's figures have gone
down from 18 percent a year ago to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be a few dark clouds on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may see some slowing in job growth due to the Asian
crisis,'' said Jack Kyser, economist for the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corp.

BOSTON-NEW YORK SERIES NOT LIKE OLD TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ It no longer translates into hate. Red Sox-Yankees.
Once the Hatfields and McCoys of the ballyard, these modern-day
American League powers are no longer fierce foes, Williams or
DiMaggio, the Bronx Bombers vs. Tom Yawkey's bunch of pampered pull
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main purpose in buying the Red Sox,'' the late Yawkey said,
soon after making the purchase around the time of the Great
Depression, ``is beating the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   That was long ago, 1933, before everyone (even some owners) knew
baseball was both national pastime and bountiful business, before
free agency, before the AFL and the NBA, and certainly before the
internet. Prior to the world becoming dot.com, all baseball knew of
The Net was that it diligently stood sentry above The Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Bucky Dent hit his in The Net. Arguably, the Red Sox-Yankees
rivalry as we knew it ended there, 20 years ago, in a soft, lofting
fly ball that crushed the Back Bay with a thundering silence when
it landed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I got the fastball in enough on him,'' said Mike
Torrez, the Sox righthander who served up Dent's three-run shot.
``He kind of jerked back, and I never thought it would carry ...''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will be at Fenway Park Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
nights, boasting their outrageous .714 winning percentage and their
guaranteed seed in the AL playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have had a banner year, too. But all too reminiscent of
decades past, Boston's best has not been better than the baseball
produced on the basepaths of New York.
</P>
<P>
   A continuation of the Curse of the Bambino? Perhaps. The Red Sox
looked at Babe Ruth as a pitcher first, a bat second, but
ultimately as the larder that would feed ``No No Nanette'' to
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks saw Ruth as the Sultan of Swat and built both a
ballpark and a dynasty around him.
</P>
<P>
   In case you're still doing the math:
</P>
<P>
   World Series championships for the Yanks since acquiring Ruth:
23.
</P>
<P>
   World Series championships for the Red Sox since dealing Ruth:
0.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball in the '90s, its rosters full of soldiers of fortune,
resembles only in bat and ball the game that gave birth to the Red
Sox-Yankee rivalry. For better (the Yankees) and worse (the Red
Sox), the game prior to the dawn of free agency in the '70s was one
of virtually no player movement.
</P>
<P>
   Mantle and Maris were the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Malzone and Monbouquette were the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lay not only the difference, but the essence of the
clubs' competitiveness. For decade upon decade, the Sox and Yanks
clashed and some names changed, but every year six or seven hitters
and a half-dozen pitchers remained constant on both rosters. When
in 1973 Thurman Munson and Carlton Fisk went down in a heap at home
plate, a pair of proud, brawling locomotives, they embodied not
only genuine dislike for each other but the hate that both clubs
and both cities had for each other dating back even to before the
Bambino.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was baseball,'' Yankee second baseman Willie Randolph
would say years later. ``It was real.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, we know the players' agents ahead of
their averages. We know their salaries, their endorsements, their
arrest records, their addictions. We know them right down to their
pierced body parts. Imagine The Mick with a gold loop danging from
his left earlobe.
</P>
<P>
   We know they are here today, gone tomorrow, sometimes fretting
for months whether they'll take the money and stay or do the same
and run. Today we believe Mo Vaughn is as Boston as the Duck Tour.
Tomorrow _ who knows? _ he could be the man in San Fran.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams played his first game for the Sox in 1939, his last
in '60. Lou Gehrig was in Yankee pinstripes from '23 to '39, Joe
DiMaggio from '36 to '51. The year after Williams left, Carl
Yastrzemski began his 23-season run in the Back Bay sun, which
included the rain that fell that day, Oct. 2, '78, when Dent's
homer helped the Yanks beat the Sox in the one-game playoff for the
AL East title.
</P>
<P>
   The final stroke that day came from the end of Yaz's bat, a high
pop off a Rich Gossage fireball that would land not in The Net but
in the soft palm of Graig Nettles's glove. Rick Burleson was left
at third, Jerry Remy at first.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees 5, Red Sox 4. Another season finished. Like so many
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Old Yaz retires,'' Yastrzemski said soon after the
loss, ``he's going to play on a world champion.'' Old Yaz was
finished five years later, along with his dream.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night the distant sons of Gehrig and DiMaggio, of
Williams and Yaz, of Dynasty and Despair will take the field one
more time.
</P>
<P>
   It is the school season again here in the Hub of the Universe,
and no doubt a sprinkling of New Yorkers will make their way to
Fenway from the campuses of Boston University, Boston College,
Harvard, MIT, and Northeastern. In that sense, the rivalry
continues. Those who dare show up in their NY caps will be booed
soundly, derided for their allegiance. The city that never wins
meets the city that never sleeps, one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's calendar is reaching the bottom of the order. The
nights are cool, the Yanks are in town, and 80 years past their
team's last true victory, Sox fans are asking if this is the year.
Can 1998 be different from all those others? The feel of the
rivalry has changed, but the question remains the same.

A FEW FEET AWAY FROM HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ There was a Moment, and when I say moment, I mean
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire was leading off the Cardinals' sixth. Cincinnati
starter Brett Tomko threw a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little in,'' the righthander recalled. ``A little down and
in. Not where I wanted to throw it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire swung. The ball left the bat on a line. It was
definitely going to have the distance. The question was, fair or
foul?
</P>
<P>
   ``When it left the bat,'' Tomko said, ``I thought, `Home run.'
But then I saw it hooking a bit and I stopped watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball entered the left-field seats in the vicinity of the
foul pole. To the dismay of 47,904 at Busch Stadium and the
millions watching nationwide on television Sunday, third base
umpire Larry Poncino raised his arms in the touchdown manner that,
for whatever cockeyed reason, signifies a foul ball in the world of
baseball umpiring.
</P>
<P>
   The official Associated Press-researched estimate: foul by 7
feet. Not 6, not 8; 7.
</P>
<P>
   The entire episode must have taken less than two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean,'' said Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin, ``that thing
was a bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was as close as Mark McGwire would come to hitting No.
61 on this oppressive (game-time temp was 98, with accompanying
humidity) Sunday afternoon in the heartland. Sammy Sosa also did
not augment his total, so when the Cubs arrive here Monday for the
first of a two-game series, the tally will be McGwire 60, Sosa 58.
</P>
<P>
   You'd have to say the Reds got out of here with their dignity
intact. McGwire completed the weekend series with one hit in 12
plate appearances, that being home run No. 60 off young Dennis
Reyes in the first inning Saturday. With six strikeouts and two
bases on balls, McGwire managed to put the ball in play only five
times in three days.
</P>
<P>
   They came. They saw. They competed.
</P>
<P>
   One home run in three games? That's a little under McGwire's
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a distraction,'' said Friday starter Pete Harnisch, a
gruff Fordham guy who would be right at home in an Edward Burns
movie. ``It's hard to pitch. He comes out to the on-deck circle,
the crowd goes crazy. He gets into the box, the crowd goes crazy.
And when he takes a swing during a night game, five million cameras
are going off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said on Saturday night I would be the most hated guy in
America tomorrow,'' sighed Tomko, clearly thrilled to have escaped
his confrontation with Big Mac with just a four-pitch walk in the
fourth. ``People boo every time you throw him a ball. You just have
to realize the situation and what they have come to see. They've
got to realize I have a job to do and my job is to get him out. If
I have to waste a pitch, and they boo, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   This probably would be a good place to point out what transpired
after McGwire's vicious foul ball in the sixth. Tomko ran the count
to 1-and-2 and got McGwire looking on a nice breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can say I struck him out with history on the line,''
Tomko pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   He also can frame McGwire's evaluation of that at-bat, if he'd
like. It might be worth showing to the grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I hit that one foul,'' McGwire said, ``he was flat-out
nasty. It was outside black. There isn't any human being alive who
could have hit that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   In case anyone has forgotten, it's not all that easy to hit a
home run, no matter what some of the naysayers might think. It's a
baseball axiom that good pitching generally will defeat good
hitting. In the course of this series, Cincinnati pitchers such as
Harnisch, Scott Sullivan (who fanned McGwire on three pitches
Friday night), and John Hudek made some great pitches as they
offered the requisite professional challenge to a man attempting to
make baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' said Harnisch. ``If you make good pitches,
you'll get people out. But if you miss your spot by 8 inches, the
ball can go 500 feet. You have to pitch with confidence. I throw a
pitch expecting to get someone out. I don't throw a pitch and say,
`Ooh, I'm glad he didn't just hit that pitch for a home run.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds left town exhilarated by three days and nights of a
carnival atmosphere that enlivened what would otherwise have been a
dreary September series by a pair of teams a combined 43-plus games
out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun to play,'' observed Larkin. ``It was really fun to
go out there where the fans were reacting to every single pitch
thrown to McGwire, and I mean every single pitch. That's how I
remember baseball when I was growing up in Cincinnati watching the
Big Red Machine.''
</P>
<P>
   How big is this Home Run Derby? Try this: It came up as a topic
on each of the three Sunday morning network political gabfests.
Geez, even The Boss _ and this does not mean George Steinbrenner _
checked in for this one. Yup, Springsteen came to the game in the
company of his 9-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   The game within a game will get even bigger now because the Cubs
arrive Monday. Under any normal circumstances, this is the most
important date on any good St. Louis fan's calendar. Throw in the
presence of Sammy Sosa, and the thing Monday and Tuesday is
positively seismic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be electrifying,'' predicted McGwire. ``It's
going to be exciting. If you can't be looking forward to these two
games, your heart is not beating.''

JINX DUE TO VANISH INTO THIN AIR

<P>
   DENVER _ I am here, getting acclimated to the altitude, but I
must be a little light-headed because I believe the Patriots are
going to win Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Win. It's time, don't you think? Isn't 30 years long enough
to wait for a victory in Mile High Stadium? Don't Patriots fans
deserve a break after watching John Elway &AMP; Co. maul the Flying
Elvises year after year?
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson was president, ``Hey Jude'' topped the charts,
and the Smothers Brothers had a hit television show when the
Patriots last won a football game in this rare air. And they never
have won at Mile High.
</P>
<P>
   And you are sick of hearing about it, I know. It's like the Red
Sox and that Curse thing. The Sox are taking on a little water at
the moment and there's fear in the side streets around Yawkey Way
because that's the way we've been trained to think.
</P>
<P>
   When the BoSox make it to the postseason, we will have to remind
you that it's been 80 years since they won a World Series. Worse,
we'll tell you that Boston has lost a record 13 consecutive
postseason games, starting when you-know-who missed that ground
ball the night we turned back the clocks in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   It was like this with the Bruins and the Canadiens for a long
time. And the Patriots and the Dolphins. But the B's finally
thumped Montreal in the playoffs, and the Patriots have put the
Miami jinx so far behind them that we didn't even mention it when
New England beat the Dolphins three times last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to throw off this Denver hex.
</P>
<P>
   New England's last victory here was a 20-17 AFL win on Sept. 29,
1968. Mike Holovak was the Patriot coach, Jim Nance led the team in
rushing, and Gino Cappelletti kicked the field goals and extra
points. It's so long ago that the late Billy Sullivan was still
talking to Will McDonough then.
</P>
<P>
   New England's last three performances against Denver have been
particularly ghastly. In 1995, Bill Parcells's team was routed,
37-3, at Mile High. A year later, the Super Bowl-bound Patriots
played host to the Broncos, carrying in a 7-3 record and a
four-game winning streak. It was going to be New England's
breakthrough game, but Denver stuffed Tuna's team, 34-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots (4-0) and Broncos (5-0) were both undefeated when
Pete Carroll &AMP; Co. came to the Rockies last October for some Monday
night theater. New England held serve for a half, but in the end it
was another blowout, this time by a score of 34-13. The late John
Denver watched from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   And there you have it, football fans. Three games in three years
have amounted to three losses by an aggregate 105-24. Overall, the
Patriots have lost 10 straight against the Broncos, and 10 straight
in Denver. New England's last victory against Denver was at
Foxborough in 1980. Elway is 9-0 lifetime against the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, everyone associated with the Patriots claims the past
has nothing to do with Monday night. This is an old Red Sox trick,
but New England fans know better. Players come and go, but jinxes
are continuous. New England's rookie running back, Robert Edwards,
can say he had nothing to do with 105-24, or 30 years of futility,
but he wears a Patriot uniform and his jersey is heavy with the
weight of the team's past against the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was first in line with the ``it's not about us'' theory.
He said, ``We have to deal with the aspects of the losing streak.
It all depends on how much you read about it or hear about it. Some
people are susceptible to that, but I don't understand why. That
was another time and this is another team.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe joined the chorus with, ``It's a different cast of
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, guys. In the eyes of your fans back home, you are
Patriots and you carry the ghosts of Babe Parilli and Jim Plunkett
on your backs. Former Red Sox outfielder Todd Benzinger, disputing
the long-running plague on Fenway, once said, ``It's not like we
have the same genes as all those players that played here before
us.''
</P>
<P>
   But they do. And the streak matters a lot until it gets snapped.
Happily, Monday night is the night. And then we won't write about
it or talk about it anymore.

HINGIS REPELS ANOTHER UPRISING 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Life as a kid queen isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Take Martina Hingis _ please! That's the sentiment around
Flushing Meadow, where even the commoners are trying to take her
out with a few well-aimed punches. The nerve of them! Lese majeste
on the asphalt lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at the US Open, it was pestiferous peon Nathalie Dechy of
France. Nathalie Dechy? Only No. 69 in the global scheme of things,
68 lengths behind Hingis. A household name maybe in Guadeloupe,
where she was born.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis has often said that the women's precinct championship
really begins in the quarterfinals, where she is uneasily perched
now after disciplining the disrespectful Dechy, 6-4, 6-4, coming
from service breaks behind in both sets. The first four rounds for
the royalty are supposed to be fun-and-games, like pin the tail on
the peasant or hassle the vassal.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``I'm just escaping every day,'' Hingis is saying, with
a Mary Queen of Scots look on her frowning 17-year-old face. Three
more escapes, though, and she'll retain her crown. But that's what
Mary, another teen queen, said.
</P>
<P>
   This is decidedly not 1997 revisited for Hingis, who was the
stingiest champ here in years, scattering crumbs amounting to 28
games and no sets to the rabble. For the campaign she won 14
titles, three of them majors, rang up a 78-5 match record, and said
the queen was not amused if somebody such as the Sisters Williams
questioned her divine right to be No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Measured against that, her current numbers make her seem a
pretender: four titles (one major, the Aussie), nothing won since
the Italian in May. Nine defeats against 59 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis was pressed for a long while in beating the faded French
queen of 1997, No. 21 Iva Majoli, 7-6 (7-4), 6-0, in the second
round. Then she got roughed up by a French 19-year-old, No. 31
Amelie Mauresmo, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, in the third.
</P>
<P>
   On the usual scale of 1-to-10, Hingis candidly rates herself:
``Six or seven. If I keep playing like this, it's not going to go
anywhere. Monica (Seles) is next, and I definitely have to raise my
level. I lost to her the last two times. I was motivated when I
came here to do well again. Instead of getting better, I'm getting
worse. It's not very easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her frankness hasn't endeared her to some colleagues, but Hingis
is a queen who doesn't hide behind diplomacy as a stream of
discomfort pours forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I play Mauresmo or Dechy, they're not, like, top players.
You have to play them, and it's like you think it's going to be
easy, but all of a sudden you're out there on the court, everything
is fine _ but you just kind of can't hit the ball in the court. So
that's a problem. Just can't find out the reason. It's complicated.
I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden everything turns against you. (Dechy) played
better angles, she moved and hit better. It's strange because I
didn't have these problems last year, but my legs were going
somewhere else in my mind. Maybe my body has changed. You think
it's going to be an easy shot, and the ball's going away, away. You
feel like,`hey, what's the matter?' I'm in a different position
definitely. Hopefully it can't be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis says she talks to herself when things are going gross.
Apparently it's a movie with a shaky script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess everybody talks to herself. I do it in Swiss, German,
and also in pictures. You kind of have pictures of what you could
do, how you could do it better. Then suddenly it doesn't happen.
Boom _ you hit it in the net or something goes wrong. Again and
again. I double faulted 20 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually nine, but it was a horror show: 41 errors to Dechy's
47.
</P>
<P>
   Dechy says, ``She didn't intimidate me, but ... but when the big
point came, Martina won it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis has known how to do that better than anybody else in
town. But ...
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm in the quarters again. Third straight time.''
</P>
<P>
   The queen will have to play big-point-bingo three times _
against Seles and the survivors of a crowd that includes Jana
Novotna, Venus Williams, Lindsay Davenport, Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario, Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   Her crown is feeling like Tiffany made it from bricks and
concrete.

GRAF SLICED OUT OF OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five times the US Open champion, Steffi Graf had a
couple of break points as Switzerland's Patty Schnyder served for
their fourth-round match Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   First break point: Graf sliced a backhand into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Second break point: Graf punched a backhand long.
</P>
<P>
   The slice backhand, perhaps Graf's most consistent weapon at one
time, was just one of the shots that let her down Sunday night. And
when it was over, Schnyder, a 19-year-old on a roll, had bounced
No. 8 seed Graf out of the tournament, 6-3, 6-4, in the fourth
round.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, who missed last year's Open after knee surgery and has
been making a comeback, was no match for the 11th-seeded Schnyder
this night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I made a lot of mistakes, easy mistakes,'' Graf
said. ``I just couldn't ... I don't know ... I just never got the
rhythm, just never found my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnyder, a lefty, earns a spot against No. 3 seed Jana Novotna
in the quarterfinals. Novotna beat No. 9 Irina Spirlea, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 seed and defending champion Martina Hingis overcame windy
conditions and Nathalie Dechy, 6-4, 6-4, and will play No. 6 seed
Monica Seles, who knocked off Kimberly Po, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, 29, was broken on her first service game, fell into a 3-0
hole, and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   She also was broken in the third game of the second set and this
time quickly broke back. But then she was broken again for 5-4 and
Schnyder served for the match.
</P>
<P>
   Graf said she will be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started playing my first tournaments in England, I had
no expectations whatsoever,'' she said. ``Really, it hasn't changed
very much. It has been difficult to accept it's going to take a
certain time. But then again, there were good and bad moments. In
general, I've been pretty happy the way it's been going.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 men's seed Marcelo Rios followed Graf onto the stadium
court and was outlasted, and upset, by unseeded Swede Magnus
Larsson, 6-1, 6-7 (3-7), 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Larsson took charge midway through the fifth set. He broke Rios
in the fifth game and again in the seventh and served for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Rios held him off on a couple of match points, but on the third,
Larsson drilled a 116-mile-per-hour ace down the middle to finish
it. Larsson had 17 aces for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Grant of Watertown, Mass., an up-and-comer at age 28, had
his impressive run cut short. But not before he went five sets with
Oliver Gross and came oh-so-close to advancing to the fourth round
in a 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 5-7, 6-3, 7-5 loss. And not before jumping his
ranking inside the Top 120 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just another step in the beginning of my career,''
Grant said. ``Even though it's starting a little late, I still have
plenty of time.''
</P>
<P>
   In another five-setter, No. 10 seed Carlos Moya came back to
beat Jan-Michael Gambill, a 21-year-old from Colbert, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Another casualty on the men's side was No. 5 seed Richard
Krajicek, who won his first set from Thomas Johansson and then had
to retire because of tendinitis in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who was given a wild card into this tournament, clung to
his life in the fifth set, 12th game. It was break point and a
Grant point would send the five-set match into a tie-breaker. But
Gross hit the winner, a backhand down the line. Then he nailed
another backhander cross-court. And when Grant followed with a
forehand return into the net, his run through the Open was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not incredibly disappointed,'' Grant said. ``I expected to
do well, so it's not like a shock. Going into today's match, that's
what helped me relax. I mean, I was going to be very happy with the
way the tournament finished up, if I were to lose today, as long as
I played every point as hard as I could. That's what I did.''

WILLIAMS GOES DOWN KICKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ With his first step out of the dugout and onto the
SkyDome rug in the sixth inning Sunday, Jimy Williams knew his day
was about to come to an abrupt end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an automatic ejection,'' Williams said. ``You can't argue
balls and strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the rule book dictated that plate umpire Dale Scott
would throw out the Red Sox manager the moment he opened his mouth
about a 3-and-2 pitch to Benito Santiago that Scott called a ball,
there was nothing to keep Williams from unburdening himself before
he left.
</P>
<P>
   And so he did, with a fit of pique that eclipsed anything that
has preceded it in Williams's nearly two-year term as Sox manager.
There were all the familiar gestures that Williams makes when he's
agitated: the hand-waving, the pointing index finger, the head
scratching, and the crossed arms.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams, after being ejected for the third time this
season, also kicked the dirt around home plate several times, at
one point employing a reverse kick to raise some dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things just happen in the course of a season,'' a considerably
calmer Williams said afterward. ``I'm not going to go out there
unless I see something different, so I went out there.''
</P>
<P>
   What Williams saw was catcher Scott Hatteberg set up on the
outside corner, then move back toward Santiago as John Wasdin
delivered a pitch that cut across the middle of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look at me,'' said Wasdin when asked whether the
umpire told him where the pitch was. ``I thought it was down the
middle. It was right there, but obviously it wasn't my call.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn said Williams was upset by more than an umpire's call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's frustrated,'' Vaughn said. ``He's a baseball man. You
don't see him complain about too many calls. Sure, he's frustrated,
and dammit, he should be. He got upset because there's probably a
lot of things going on in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because of us. He's upset because of us. We've got to
do a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams wasn't the only manager temporarily out of a job
Sunday. Scott also ejected Toronto's Tim Johnson and relief pitcher
Paul Quantrill as Quantrill was leaving the mound in the eighth
inning. On his way out, Quantrill had barked at first-base umpire
Ted Barrett, admonishing him to ``bear down'' because he thought
Barrett was out of position when he called Darren Bragg safe on an
attempted pickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett appeared to be out of earshot, but Scott charged
Quantrill, and after a brief exchange gave Quantrill the thumb.
Johnson joined the fray and he was gone in short order, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it's easy to rap the umpires after you can't hold onto
a 7-1 lead,'' said Quantrill, who didn't appreciate an umpire
offering an unsolicited critique, especially when he wasn't even
talking to Scott.
</P>
<P>
   With the season three weeks from its conclusion and the Red Sox
close to returning to the playoffs for the first time since 1995,
it's no surprise that emotions spilled over. Especially since the
Red Sox, who are just 15-15 in their last 30 games, have won just 3
of their last 11 games and were swept four straight here. Their
lead in the wild-card race stands at five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said something a month ago,'' said Dennis Eckersley, who has
been on six playoff teams and three World Series teams. ``It'll get
tighter again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want it to be, but it's inevitable. I think
everybody would rather cruise in, but there's something to be said
for keeping that edge, too. Last game of the season, and you're
still ready to play going into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing it on purpose, but it wasn't meant to be easy.
Not at all. This is going to make us play ball the way it's
supposed to be played, with pressure. That's what it's going to be
like (in the playoffs) anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a good experience for the club, he said. As for him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just what I need,'' said the Eck, rolling his eyes.

THUNDER STOLEN FROM SOSA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ You didn't have to see the ball heading toward left
field to know it was leaving Three Rivers Stadium Sunday. All you
had to do was hear it. It was the same sound that baseball fans in
the 1930s and '40s used to hear as they sat around radios and
listened for the thump coming across their airwaves _ the thump of
a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa was able to watch and listen in the 10th inning as
more than 22,000 people cheered during the ball's flight over the
fence. A few minutes after the winning home run had settled, Sosa
had to acknowledge that the swing was beautiful. For a change, the
swat and subsequent trot did not belong to the Chicago Cubs right
fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kendall, with 12 home runs, now trails Sosa by 46. But it
was the Pittsburgh Pirates catcher who turned on the third pitch he
saw from reliever Dave Stevens, ending Sunday's game and the
Pirates' eight-game losing streak. The final was 4-3. Sosa struck
out twice, singled twice, and reached on an error in five at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to understand that I'm not going to hit a home run
every time I come to the plate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. The nation's sports fans will take a homerless
Sunday in Pittsburgh. But there is a Sosa-Mark McGwire showdown in
St. Louis Monday. Sosa should know that most observers will be
disappointed if he does something wimpy, like hit a few doubles and
singles. And hey, if they are going to homer, anything less than
400 feet may be cause to call the asterisk people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be crazy,'' Sosa said of the two-game set with
McGwire's Cardinals. He said he will watch McGwire take batting
practice (``You better believe it'') and that he has so much to say
to McGwire that ``I'll probably forget when I talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's game will be nationally televised and there will be
hundreds of media outlets represented. Sosa is excited about this,
for himself and for his teammates, who are leading the National
League wild-card race by a game. He said the Cubs like playing in
front of full houses. And he likes it because he remembers the days
when people said he was not worth his $10 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt me,'' he said of the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   No one says that anymore. Now his days end with several
strangers standing around his locker, asking him to talk about home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Is he sick of all this yet?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``All the reporters have been great to me and
I've been great to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, after he was finished talking, he shook hands with
everyone he could see holding a microphone or a notebook. He said
he would see them in St. Louis. But before he headed closer to the
Mississippi River, he had to deal with the team that plays at the
confluence of the Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela Rivers. This may
seem like an easy task, considering that the Pirate infielders
juggle the baseball as if it were aflame. You could write a sports
thesis on how official records don't matter and that, yes, the
Pirates are the worst team in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pirates have a few pitchers who don't give up home runs.
One of them is Sunday's starter, Chris Peters, who has allowed only
12 all season. Another is reliever Rich Loiselle, who has given up
two _ one to Jeff Bagwell and the other to Mike Lieberthal. With
Mark Grace on first in the 10th, Loiselle entered the game to face
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He challenged me,'' Sosa said, explaining why he has respect
for Loiselle.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for respect is that the pitcher struck him out.
But please don't say that he is overswinging or pressing: ``When I
make contact, people say, `What a great swing.' When I miss, they
say I'm overswinging.''
</P>
<P>
   When the game went to extra innings, anyone with a sense of
season history would have known it would not be Sosa's day. He has
hit 58 home runs this season. He has hit them to left, right, and
center fields. He has hit them during the day, night, and twilight.
He has hit them on Sundays and Tuesdays and Fridays. But Sosa has
not hit a homer in extra innings this season. Not yet.

MCGWIRE WILL ZERO IN ON CUBS TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ What's the hurry? Let us not forget that Mark
McGwire still has three weeks to break Roger Maris's home run
record. Three weeks to blast his 62d of the season. Three weeks to
earn the adoration of a nation suddenly turned on by major league
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals slugger went 0 for 3 Sunday as his home
run total remained at 60. Amid the deafening roars of a sellout
crowd of 47,904 in Busch Stadiun, the big first baseman lined out,
grounded out, was called out on strikes, and walked in a 5-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the sixth inning, when McGwire hit a ball a few feet
foul deep down the line in left, did he come close to making
history.
</P>
<P>
   But a sense of history was tangible in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sellout crowd were Maris's four sons and two
daughters. His widow was supposed to be present, too, but after
becoming ill on the morning flight to St. Louis, she was
hospitalized briefly with an irregular heartbeat but in
satisfactory condition.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig flew in from Milwaukee for a potential
presentation but had none to make. He may not get a chance Monday
or Tuesday, either.
</P>
<P>
   With the Chicago Cubs in town for two games, McGwire will be
going head to head against his close pursuer in the home run derby,
Sammy Sosa, who remained at 58 after Sunday's game in Pittsburgh.
With the Cubs locked in the race for the National League wild card,
it is doubtful that their pitchers will be as eager to challenge
McGwire as the Reds were this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be electrifying and exciting,'' said McGwire,
making a rare postgame statement after not hitting a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Good defense as well as good pitching were working against
McGwire Sunday. In the first inning, he hit a line drive off Reds
starter Brett Tomko that shortstop Barry Larkin grabbed with a
diving catch. He walked on four pitches, and scored, in the fourth.
In the sixth, after the blistering foul ball, he was caught looking
on a Tomko curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I hit that one foul, he was flat-out nasty,'' said
McGwire. ``It was outside black. There isn't any human being alive
who could have hit that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, against reliever John Hudek, McGwire fell
victim to an infield shift that allowed second baseman Bret Boone
to throw him out on a ball that was smashed up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Just before that out, St. Louis had broken a 2-2 tie on a triple
by Delino DeShields and a sacrifice fly by Brian Jordan. After
Hudek got McGwire out, most of the crowd started to leave. But they
should have stayed around. Ray Lankford and Fernando Tatis promptly
smacked back-to-back homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Mark is not going to be the hero every game,'' said
Jordan. ``Everybody has to pick him up and put in their piece and
that's exactly what we've been doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt the fans want to see Mark set this record. In
the meanwhile, they're at a baseball game and we've been fortunate
of late to win a few.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds manager Jack McKeon said his club feels as though it has
been through a war, losing two of three in this series. Most
discouraging is that they have to play the Cardinals again
Wednesday and Thursday in Cincinnati _ after they go to Houston to
face Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was three exciting games that we certainly enjoyed,'' said
McKeon. ``We did the best we could to win and contain Mac. We have
another series coming up _ Randy Johnson. It's like going from the
frying pan into the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't break the record (by Wednesday), we'll see
everybody in Cincinnati and hear the same questions. All I know is
that it's going to happen somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals know there will be more at stake Monday with Sosa
around. ``Our pitchers are excited, too,'' said Jordan.

GROUNDS FOR HOPE: PATRIOTS MUST STAY IN RUNNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The best present would be a kick-butt win. Another nice
gift would be a running game that led to a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Armstrong would take either.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' veteran right tackle turns 33 Monday. He will, as
usual, be the main cog in the offensive line, which Monday night
against the Broncos will try to open holes for two inexperienced
running backs, Sedrick Shaw and Robert Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive captain, Armstrong must try to motivate an offense
that was lackluster at times last season. In fairness, a couple of
the bigger weapons _ running back Curtis Martin and receiver Terry
Glenn _ missed time with injuries. Now Martin is in New York, but
Glenn is coming off a productive preseason in terms of his mental
and physical approach to the game.
</P>
<P>
   However, Armstrong knows the run is everything. It means a
sustained offensive attack. It means the passing game opens up. It
means the defense won't be on the field as long and thus should be
more effective when it is out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the run,'' summed up free safety Willie Clay.
</P>
<P>
   It's also about respecting the run. Will Denver respect the
Patriots' running game? Even with Martin, the Patriots didn't have
much of a running game vs. the Broncos. Last year against Denver,
Martin gained 66 yards on 15 carries (4.4-yard average). In 1996,
he carried seven times for 13 yards (1.9), and in 1995 he carried
six times for 8 yards (1.3). Total: 28 carries, 87 yards (3.2).
</P>
<P>
   It's up to Shaw and Edwards to make it better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about everyone stepping up,'' said strong safety
Lawyer Milloy, who likely will shadow Shannon Sharpe most of the
game. ``That goes for the guys on offense and the guys on defense.
We think we're a championship team, so we have to play like one.
That means everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a usual opener. It's a game against the Super Bowl
champions, a team the Patriots likely will have to beat to claim
the AFC title. It's a team they must beat to gain respect; most
analysts give them no chance to beat the Broncos based on two
things: the absence of Martin and a lack of faith in Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew Bledsoe is a good friend of mine,'' said former Buffalo
Bills quarterback Jim Kelly, now a TV analyst, ``but without Curtis
Martin, he's going to find that it's difficult. All of the very
good or great quarterbacks who led their teams into the Super Bowl
had great running backs to take the pressure off them. Troy Aikman
had Emmitt Smith. I had Thurman Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes a big difference. No quarterback can do it on
his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, of course, went to a Super Bowl with Martin. He now
faces the challenge of winning with a second-year running back who
has one game of NFL experience or a rookie who has none.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be done?
</P>
<P>
   Sure.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be easy?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night should give us an idea of what to expect from the
running game. Certainly it's a work in progress, for Edwards missed
three exhibition games with a groin pull before returning last week
against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, Edwards showed good burst through the hole and
cutback ability. He was fast. But he gained only 38 yards on 15
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier, the man who
drafted Edwards, said that once he is able to loosen up and not
hold the ball with two hands when he doesn't have to, his talents
will come shining through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time to adapt to the pro game,'' said Edwards, who
would like nothing better than to be something like his Georgia
counterpart, Denver's Terrell Davis. ``I'm sure I'll get more
comfortable, go out there and run strong once I get into the flow.
I need carries, and the more carries I get, I'll get better.''
</P>
<P>
   It is indeed all about experience.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw is getting it first. He has paid his dues in training camp
and exhibition games, taking the pounding of the first-string
defenses. He also has taken the criticism of the media and the fans
about his shortcomings. He has been working intensely all week with
running backs coach Kirby Wilson. The Patriots want him to hit the
hole more consistently and not kick it outside as quickly as he
tends to do at times.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy will help his blockers as much as it will help
Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time for a running game to develop and click,'' said
new fullback Tony Carter. ``We're all new to each other out there.
I think we came a long way in preseason, but when the real season
starts is when you can really start making strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I know where Sedrick is going to go or where Robert is
going to go, I can be much more effective on my blocks. I might be
able to make one block that can spring Sedrick or Robert for 20 or
30 yards. But that takes time. Hopefully we can be effective
against Denver and control the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   including the play of the New England cornerbacks and the team's
ability to play mistake-free.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a big emphasis in practice about playing
``clean,'' as Pete Carroll likes to say. In recent matchups,
mistakes have put the Patriots in first-quarter funks against the
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Quickness and toughness are what the Patriots want against the
Broncos receivers. The biggest mismatch appears to be 5-foot-9-inch
Chris Canty vs. 6-5 Ed McCaffrey. But Canty should be able to
handle him with help from the safeties.

HEARST CRUSHES JETS WITH OT ROMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The former New Englanders were disconsolate. One
of the better NFL games of the last few years had just ended, but
one Jet after another _ Bill Parcells, Glenn Foley, Curtis Martin,
Otis Smith _ said that coming so close meant absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, the New York coach, typically saw no good in a
heartbreaking 36-30 overtime loss to the San Francisco 49ers
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough one to lose,'' Parcells said over and over.
``I can't be any more disappointed than what I am right now.''
</P>
<P>
   This truly was a game for the fans. Foley, the former Boston
College quarterback, led a 76-yard drive that tied the score at
30-30 with three seconds left in regulation. Then, in OT, Garrison
Hearst rescued the embattled 49ers by taking a simple inside
handoff at his 4-yard line, cutting back to the right, and refusing
to be taken down.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst took off on a scintillating 96-yard TD run, the longest
in San Francisco history, bettering Hugh McIlhenny's 89-yarder in
1952. Hearst stiff-armed two Jets and escaped the weak tackling
attempts of two others, rookie Kevin Williams and former Patriot
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my arms around him,'' said Smith. ``But I just couldn't
bring him down.''
</P>
<P>
   While the 49er fans shook 3Com Park in joy, Parcells was blunt
in the criticism of his tacklers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put players in position to make plays, but the players
didn't make plays,'' said Parcells. ``We recognized the play but we
didn't make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   While the performance of Foley (30 of 58, 415 yards, 3 TDs, 1
INT) was spectacular and bodes well for the Jets' future, Parcells
would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``His performance doesn't make much of a difference right now,''
said the coach. ``It wasn't quite good enough. I thought he played
well, but this is a win-or-lose business.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley thought the Jets were going to win when they forced the
overtime with John Hall's 31-yard field goal as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some good plays, but, yeah, it's a tough loss,'' said
Foley. ``We fight to get back into it, we tie it up, and we take it
to overtime. It's really tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Patriot Martin, in a familiar reprise, did not touch the
ball in overtime. Martin (22 carries for 58 yards, 4 receptions for
41 yards) said he noticed that, too, but he was not concerned. What
bothered the new Jet was that New York lost and how it lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, losing is like the worst thing in the world,'' said
Martin. ``Every loss irks me. I'm not a poor sport, but I'm so
competitive I always hate to lose. And this one really irks me.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci said that when he called that
running play for Hearst from the 4, quarterback Steve Young was
incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve looked at me and said, `Are you kidding? Let's pass the
ball,''' said Mariucci. ``We were just trying to run the ball off
of our own goal line, to try to make some room and make a first
down. But this play will go down in history as one of the great
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's run will make all the highlight reels for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had downfield blocking, broken tackles, and what a great
time to have that run to win the game,'' said Mariucci. ``I
couldn't even tell if he scored, the players were flying onto the
field and everyone was going crazy. What a finish!''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets had taken a 17-14 lead at halftime, primarily because
of a 41-yard TD pass from Foley to Keyshawn Johnson, who badly beat
defensive back Antonio Langham, and a 6-yard TD pass with 33
seconds left from Foley to Wayne Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers tied it up on a 22-yard field goal by Wade Richey
early in the third quarter, but Foley quickly answered with another
TD pass to Johnson (9 catches for 126 yards and 2 TDs), this one
for 21 yards. Indeed, Johnson outshone the returning Jerry Rice (6
catches for 86 yards, 1 TD).
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have had better statistics, but his team won the
game,'' said Johnson. ``He looked like the old Jerry Rice to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But these certainly didn't look like the old San Francisco
49ers. Despite his gaudy numbers (26 of 46, 363 yards, 3 TDs),
Young looked out of sync, and the defense looked most vulnerable,
with no pass rush and porous pass coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure we threw the ball a lot,'' said Jets offensive lineman
Jumbo Elliott, ``but that was by design. We had some success, so we
wanted to keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   A blocked extra point after a 14-yard TD pass from Young to Rice
in the third quarter kept the Jets clinging to a 24-23 lead going
into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   A 32-yard field goal by Hall with 3:38 left in regulation gave
New York a 27-23 lead. Then, with 1:26 left, San Francisco's J.J.
Stokes made an acrobatic, leaping catch of a 31-yard pass from
Young, giving San Francisco a 30-27 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the tying drive, Foley was shaky on his first two attempts,
but on fourth and 10 from the Jets' 46, he threw a perfect
22-yarder along the right sideline to Dedric Ward. Another pass to
Ward, this one for 19 yards, brought the Jets to the 13 with 17
seconds left. Hall's field goal soon tied it up.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers may not have looked good winning this game, but the
return of Rice from two knee injuries last year brought smiles to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you,'' said Rice, ``I'm not in game
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he was nervous until making his first reception.
``When I caught the ball everything felt well,'' he said, ``and I
went back to the huddle.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Jets went back to New York, bleeding from the deepest
kind of wound.

RAVING ABOUT STADIUM, NOT TEAM

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Everything was in order. Except the hometown Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe this?'' said Baltimore quarterback Jim
Harbaugh, holding his head despondently in his left hand while
soaking his right hand in a tub of ice when the debacle was all
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just gave the game away. Handed it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbaugh was knocked out of the game in the second period with a
ripped tendon in the ring finger of his throwing hand. And once he
left, the Ravens' chances of knocking off the Pittsburgh Steelers
on opening day in a spectacular new stadium disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Ravens drew a sellout crowd of more than 68,000
fans to their new stadium at Camden Yards on a cloudless, 90-degree
day complete with bands, politicians, honor guards, and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame we played this way today,'' said Ravens coach Ted
Marchibroda after his team disintegrated in a 20-13 loss. ``To work
as hard as we did in the offseason, to play as well as we did in
preseason, to have such high expectations, and then to come up with
a game like this hurts. Really hurts. All those mistakes just
killed us.''
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be the day the Ravens made a statement. The
state of Maryland had put up $223 million to build this magnificent
state-of-the-art facility, and it was supposed to be christened
with a victory over an archrival.
</P>
<P>
   But it all came apart for the Ravens. They played as if the day,
with all of its trappings, was just too much for them to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Matt Stover, one of the most accurate placekickers
in the history of the game, missed three field goals (42, 42, and
45 yards), as second-string long snapper Harper Le Bel delivered
the ball like Heathcliff Slocumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snaps from center cost us 10 points,'' said Marchibroda.
``It cost us a field goal and a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was 3-3 at the half, as Stover and Norm Johnson matched
field goals. But the Ravens easily could have been ahead by two
touhdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dropped an interception for a touchdown,'' said
Marchibroda. ``We dropped a touchdown pass. We went offside several
times on third and long. Our defense played good enough to win. Our
offense did nothing on third down. Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came in at the half, I told our team we were lucky to
survive,'' said Pittsburgh coach Bill Cowher. ``They had all kinds
of chances and didn't capitalize. I told our guys, `They are in
their locker room right now hoping to win. We are going out on the
field expecting to win. That is the difference.' And that's the way
it turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first 20 minutes of the second half, Pittsburgh ran off
17 points to take a 20-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after Johnson had put Pittsburgh ahead with a
49-yard field goal, Le Bel bounced a snap between the legs of
punter Kyle Richardson, who mistakenly kicked the ball farther back
toward his own goal line before diving on it at the 4. Two plays
Later, Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart jumped over for the
touchdown. Early in the fourth quarter, Stewart threw a laser down
the middle to wide receiver Charles Johnson for a 20-yard TD that
essentially wrapped up the game.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Zeier, who had replaced Harbaugh in the second period,
threw a 64-yard touchdown pass with 2:48 to play, but the Ravens
were out of timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we play these guys, we stink in the first half,''
said Steelers general manager Tom Donahue. ``We just play lousy. We
did it again today. Last year here, we were down, 21-0, in the
second period and came back to win. I don't know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowher was standing in the locker room 30 minutes after the game
when Stewart came past him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you trying to kill me?'' said Cowher, feigning concern.
``Why can't you have a good first half against these guys?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach,'' said Stewart with a wide grin, ``a friend of mine
said that that's the way you are (i.e. worried) and that's the way
I am (i.e. not worried), and that's why we love each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of them had a good laugh.
</P>
<P>
   They also had an important win in a game they easily could have
lost. Baltimore had momentum coming off a 4-0 exhibition season.
Harbaugh, playing behind a solid offensive line for the first time
in years, wanted to have a big game to christen the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster came in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was back to pass,'' said Harbaugh, ``and they had a guy
(Carnell Lake) coming in a pass rush. He hit me, and when I went
down, I landed on my right hand. This finger went one way and my
hand the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor put it back in place. I came in the dressing room
and got a shot, but the tendon ripped off the bone and took a piece
of the bone with it. I tried to throw on the sideline but I
couldn't grip the ball right. It went like a knuckleball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers had a good laugh at the end of the game when their
punter, Josh Miller, launched a 68-yard bomb in the closing seconds
to put the Ravens on their 4.
</P>
<P>
   Miller drives Cowher nuts. Last year, the coach would chew out
his punter during games, but this year he vowed to stop. After
Miller's second poor punt of the first half, though, Cowher was all
over him. After the last kick, Cowher ran onto the field and gave
Miller a high-five and a hug. The Steelers had ruined the Ravens'
party.

DOLPHINS PICK ON MANNING IN DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ As debuts go for rookie quarterbacks, it went
pretty well Sunday for Peyton Manning. Just not as well as his
father's went.
</P>
<P>
   Some 27 years ago, Archie Manning called a play he used to run
at Mississippi. With three seconds left in the first game of his
professional career, he ran down the line with the Los Angeles Rams
chasing him, cut back, and flopped into the end zone, dropping the
ball as he landed.
</P>
<P>
   Saints win! Saints win! Saints win!
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at the RCA Dome, Manning's son was hoping for the same
kind of storybook finish when his Indianapolis Colts got the ball
back trailing the Miami Dolphins by 8 with 1:32 to play and his
team backed up to its 4-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped back on first down and fired a pass to Torrance
Small, who had gotten a step or so behind the defense.
</P>
<P>
   But the hand of Calvin Jackson, a backup safety for the
Dolphins, either deflected the ball or distracted Small, and the
Colt receiver missed it.
</P>
<P>
   Eight seconds later, Dolphin cornerback Terrell Buckley was
celebrating in the end zone after returning his second interception
of the day for a 21-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins win! Dolphins win! Dolphins win!
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you lose a game you're not happy,'' the younger
Manning said after his debut ended in a 24-15 loss before
Indianapolis's first sellout of a home opener in nine years.
``Pretty much the tale is that if you turn the ball over, you're
not going to win the game. They had one turnover and we had four.
There's your story right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. There were a lot of stories, and more than a
few of them will be of interest to the Patriots. One was Jimmy
Johnson keeping his promise that the Dolphins would run the ball
more, as Karim Abdul-Jabbar carried 23 times for 108 yards and the
team rushed 30 times for 137 yards.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson hoped, that allowed his team to eat up large portions
of the clock in the first half and kept the burden of victory off
the aging shoulders of Dan Marino, who completed only 13 of 24
attempts. Marino passed only five times in the second half after
the Dolphins moved out to a 17-3 lead that was in part the result
of the first of three interceptions thrown by Manning.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Colts wide receiver Marvin Harrison tried
to run a slant from his 13 but Buckley got in front of him as
Manning released the ball and nabbed the pass to set up a 4-yard
Abdul-Jabbar touchdown that turned a 10-3 lead into the kind of
17-3 Rush Fest the Dolphins wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed we could run the ball today like we did in the
preseason and we stuck with it,'' Marino said. ``I didn't have to
throw a lot. In the second half it didn't seem we had the ball very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   In point of fact, they had it for less than 10 minutes, but
Manning threw two more interceptions over the final 30 minutes as
the Dolphins turned up the heat on him with an assortment of
coverages and zone blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   They caused enough problems to make his life difficult and turn
a nearly heroic start into just another in a long history of
season-opening defeats for the Colts, who are 3-11 in home openers
since moving to Indianapolis in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally a coach wouldn't say he was pleased with a
quarterback who threw three interceptions, but if you look at the
good things Peyton did, he played better than I thought he would,''
said Colts coach Jim Mora. ``I thought he battled. He came back
after throwing the interceptions. He did not get down. He kept
performing and moved our team pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he did, throwing for 302 yards and the first touchdown of
his career, a 6-yarder to Harrison as time ran out in the fourth
quarter. Scoring at the buzzer in his first game is something he
has in common with Dad. Winning that game, however, remains the
province of only the father, although he clearly wishes it were
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was awful tough,'' the elder Manning said. ``I thought
I'd be fine, but when I got to the stadium I got very nervous. He's
my son and I'm proud of him. I know how difficult it is to play
quarterback in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Now so does the son, a difficulty compounded by the fact that
his alter ego, San Diego's Ryan Leaf, became the first rookie
quarterback to win his opening NFL game since, well, Archie
Manning, as the Chargers defeated Buffalo, 16-14.
</P>
<P>
   But losses are relative, and no one realized that better than
Miami nickel package coach Bill Lewis. Lewis had flown to
Indianapolis early Sunday morning on Dolphin owner Wayne Huzienga's
private plane after having gone to Nevada Friday to identify the
body of his son, Greg, who died in a collision of Air Force
helicopters flying night maneuvers over the desert outside Las
Vegas earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   While Archie Manning talked softly about his son's difficult
afternoon, Bill Lewis spoke not a word after the Dolphins awarded
him the game ball. All he could do was hold it aloft for a brief
moment as his team applauded longer than the norm at such
presentations.
</P>
<P>
   When that was over, Archie Manning and his son left with their
loss and Bill Lewis left, alone, with his.

BRIGHT PROSPECT FOR BC 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ All of a sudden, going 4-0 in September does not seem
like an unattainable goal for Boston College's football team.
</P>
<P>
   After kicking off the season with an impressive 41-31
nonconference victory at Georgia Tech Saturday _ a triumph
highlighted by a balanced offensive attack and a hard-nosed
defensive effort _ the Eagles are looking at eminently beatable
opponents in their next three games.
</P>
<P>
   BC returns from Atlanta to Alumni Stadium for a two-game
homestand against Big East opponents. Next up Saturday is Rutgers,
which barely beat Division 1-AA Richmond, 7-6, to snap a 14-game
losing streak. The Eagles then host Temple, which dropped its
season opener to Toledo, 24-12. BC then hits the road for a Sept.
26 nonconference matchup at Louisville, which was riddled by
Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch (498 yards, 7 touchdowns) in a 68-34
romp.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those prospects, no one on the BC roster is about to get
carried away with one victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to reel ourselves in,'' said fifth-year quarterback
Scott Mutryn, who paced BC's 491-yard attack by completing 16 of 26
attempts for a career-high 220 yards, including a 15-yard TD strike
to tight end Rob Tardio.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody on this team that is going to look forward or
past this Rutgers team. They are the next team we're playing, and
we need to start the conference with a victory and we have to be
focused. We have to practice hard on Tuesday and Wednesday if we
expect to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we won here doesn't mean that, all of a sudden,
everyone's going to lie down and let us walk all over them. We have
to prepare for Rutgers as hard as we prepared for Georgia Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   That had to be music to the ears of BC coach Tom O'Brien, who
tried his best Saturday to protect his players from withering
94-degree heat by deploying nearly every man on his two-deep
roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I worry about now is having our legs back and being
able to practice this week so we can play Saturday,'' said O'Brien.
``It'll be tough, but we're going to have to fight through it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for being 1-0?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole lot better start than last year,'' O'Brien said,
alluding to BC's 28-21 season-opening loss at Temple in '97. ``The
thing is that you don't want to be 1-1. The key is that it's
Rutgers, it's a conference game, it's our first home game, and we
ought to have some excitement. Hopefully, we can fill the stands
and get people to come out and support this team, because this
team's going to come back and play hard. It's a great opportunity
for us and that's the way we have to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Georgia Tech, Mike Cloud tripped the light fantastic,
rushing for 200 yards, while the defense kept its poise despite
getting caught flat-footed in the third quarter when scatback
Charlie Rogers scored on a 58-yard TD that tied the game, 24-24.
</P>
<P>
   BC outscored Georgia Tech, 17-7, in a frenzied fourth quarter to
clinch the triumph, which earned it 17 votes in the USA Today/ESPN
coaches' poll and 12 in the Associated Press balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge. It's the biggest thing in the world,'' said senior
left guard Doug Brzezinski. ``Like I said to the other guys, it's a
mental steppingstone. We've been working on ourselves physically,
and now, mentally, we know that everything we've worked for has
paid off. Now we're starting to believe in ourselves again, that
we're a formidable team.''
</P>
<P>
   One that is quite capable of going 4-0 in September.

REVERSE PLAY FOR NOTRE DAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ The sighs of relief you may have heard late Saturday
night and early Sunday morning were from the powers that be who run
college football.
</P>
<P>
   On an amazingly entertaining Saturday of games, a major quake
hit college football. And this morning you will notice a shift in
the power structure. Oh, not at the very top. Ohio State and
Florida State, running 1-2 in the preseason polls, took care of
business.
</P>
<P>
   But if you look closely, you'll see a new but familiar face in
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to Notre Dame, which by virtue of its 36-20 pounding
of No. 5 Michigan rose from a very un-Irish No. 22 to a very
respectable No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   What was the old cliche about General Motors? ``What is good for
GM is good for the country''? Well, what's good for Notre Dame is
good for college football.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish have been struggling for the past few years: losing
almost as much as they win, and making bowl appearances in
Shreveport, La., instead of New Orleans, Tempe, or Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The victory over Michigan changes the perception immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Look at what happened in one weekend. Before Saturday's game,
the talk was about how tough the Irish schedule was at the start:
Michigan, Michigan State, Purdue, Stanford, all teams that beat the
Irish a year ago. And then comes a tough road game against an
Arizona State team that many people thought had a legitimate chance
to win the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens? Michigan falls apart in the second half.
Michigan State, which looked a little suspect a week earlier in
losing to Colorado State, confirms that theory by losing badly to
Oregon. Purdue opens its season with a loss to Southern California.
Stanford is so bad it loses to San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   And Arizona State is stunned at home, losing in the final
seconds to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, what looked like a 3-2 start for the Irish could turn
into 5-0, which would have the subway alumni in a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame coach Bob Davie, feeling the heat of expectations
that are always higher than they should be, knew what Saturday's
win meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest win I've ever had here,'' said Davie, who
has only eight victories in 14 games but can be forgiven for his
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Davie knows what his job is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, you better step up and win a big game,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That he has done, beating a team that had won a share of the
national championship a year ago and was in the Top 5 this season.
Where this takes the Irish is uncertain, but it definitely adds
spice to the next several weeks, if not longer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Football in the West and Southwest can be largely a mystery to
the fans in the East, as games do not end until 1 or 2 in the
morning here.
</P>
<P>
   But the results, no matter when they come in, are just as
important, and Arizona State and Colorado State took major hits
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it _ and I'm sure most of you did _ Arizona
State squandered an enormous opportunity in a 42-38 loss to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils have no one to blame but themselves. In a game
that almost literally went down to a last-team-with-the-ball-wins
situation, the Sun Devils had the Huskies pinned in their own
territory with less than a minute remaining _ fourth and 17 from
the 37.
</P>
<P>
   What happens? Washington quarterback Brock Huard, who had
exposed a weak ASU defense all night, throws a 63-yard TD pass to
tight end Reggie Davis for a remarkable win.
</P>
<P>
   ASU plays a good enough schedule that it can recover and get
back into the national championship hunt. The same cannot be said
for Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams turned some heads with an opening win over Michigan
State, a Top 25 team. What looked like a soft schedule the rest of
the way turned ugly Saturday night when archrival Colorado romped
to a 42-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
   See you later, CSU.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston College's 41-31 win over Georgia Tech creates an
interesting situation at the Heights. It transforms the Eagles from
underdogs to prohibitive favorites the next two weeks, when the
most hapless teams in the Big East, Rutgers and Temple, come to
town.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom O'Brien, who has done a marvelous job in rebuilding
the infrastructure of the program, must change his psychological
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Before the opening game, O'Brien had to convince his players
they were good enough to go on the road and beat Gerogia Tech. Now
he must convince them that they are not too good to lose to teams
everyone assumes they will beat easily.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Big East had its big exposure day Saturday and once again
the conference was overexposed. Syracuse continued its mysterious
September habit of losing games it should and could win with a
heartbreaking 34-33 loss to Tennessee. Now the Orangemen must go to
Michigan and face a team that desperately doesn't want to start
0-2. Neither does Syracuse, obviously, but if beating Tennessee was
tough, beating Michigan at home will be tougher.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia must regroup after a so-so showing in a 34-17 loss
to Ohio State. Granted, Ohio State was a better team, but the
Mountaineers didn't have their A game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but Miami may be a factor in the Big East. The
Hurricanes were thought to be a year away, and while their 66-17
rout of East Tennessee proves nothing, it may indicate a trend. A
year ago, the 'Canes were struggling even with the lesser
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's early, very early, but already players are making their
Heisman pitches. Leading the way? Kentucky's Tim Couch, who threw
for a school-record tying 498 yards and 7 touchdowns in a 68-34 win
over Louisville, and Central Florida's Daunte Culpepper, who
completed 24 of 37 passes for 370 yards and 4 touchdowns and also
ran for 2 touchdowns in a 64-30 win over Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The transition at Grambling from Eddie Robinson to Doug Williams
is complete. Williams, the former Grambling quarterback, won his
debut game, 11-0, over Alcorn State. Robinson, college football's
all-time leader in victories, retired at the end of last season ...
On the other hand, Prairie View, which has not won a game since
1989, opened with a 24-13 loss to Texas Southern. The Panthers'
NCAA-record losing streak is now at 78 games ... Kansas State
gained little respect for its 66-0 romp over Division 1-AA Indiana
State. KSU's schedule is soft enough with a lot of Mid-America
Conference teams among nonconference opponents; it should be
ashamed of itself for playing a 1-AA team ... Florida also
shouldn't be playing teams like the Citadel. In fact, unless there
is a compelling reason (such as geographical ties), 1-A teams
should play only 1-A teams ... Former Patriot linebacker Steve
Nelson began his coaching career at Curry College in Milton with a
21-7 loss to Norwich Saturday. Little steps before big steps.

 STAGE RACE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUTLAND, Vt. _ Mark Hagen of Natick, Mass., had changed from his
cycling jersey into a Hawaiian shirt Sunday and was nursing a tall
glass of beer in the Bistro Cafe after he had finished the 16-mile
criterium in the Killington Stage Race.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he had just finished second, in technically the same time
as the winner, and yes, he just last month was named national
champion in the men's masters' criterium.
</P>
<P>
   But the 44-year-old said he puts his full-time hobby into
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys in my class all ride to win, and we ride to have
fun,'' Hagen said. ``But we don't want to do anything stupid that
might cause someone to get hurt because we all have to go to work
the next day.'' Hagen is a computer consultant for Boston
University.
</P>
<P>
   Racing started at 8:30 Sunday morning as eight groups of riders
set out in the criterium race around downtown Rutland. The
master-50 riders completed 12 laps of the .8-mile circuit; the
professional and elite amateur men (category 1 and 2) rode 56 laps
totaling 45 miles. And while the 80-degree temperatures might have
wreaked havoc on the riders, the weather was a welcome break before
fall to the estimated 8,000 spectators who lined the course.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McCormack of North Easton, Mass., rode a dazzling race in
the men's pro as he and two others lapped the field twice. But his
win didn't affect the overall standings, where McCormack had almost
a 13-minute deficit to make up on leader George Hincapie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally figured out the way to win a stage,'' said McCormack
with a laugh. ``You have to be at least 10 minutes behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Bliss-Livingston won the women's 25-mile stage in 59
minutes 28 seconds, but Linda Jackson held onto the yellow jersey
with a 10-minute overall lead as the stage race enters its final
day Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the field at Killington is known for the elite
talent it attracts _ the US Postal Service, which races in the Tour
de France, sent three members here, including defending champion
Tyler Hamilton of Brookline, Mass., and Hincapie _ many riders,
like Hagen, are in it more for the experience than the glory.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 763 licensed racers riding, most are not full-time
professional riders. Only 150 are pro or elite riders, and just 32
are affiliated with professional teams. Some are junior riders, age
16 through 18; some are Category 3 and 4 riders, who might be
aspiring to move up to Category 1 and 2, and some race in the
over-30, over-40, and over-50 age groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of the ultimate for amateurs or masters,'' said
Lindsay Blount, 41, who said he rides about 200 miles a week. ``If
it's your hobby, you come here to see the big boys race. A race
like this is the only opportunity we have to do a real timed,
prestigious stage race. It's almost like a mini-Tour de France.''
</P>
<P>
   He won't be hanging around after the race is over this
afternoon. The radiation oncologist has to be back at work in Santa
Barbara, Calif., Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Takayama, 26, is also busy, as a PhD candidate in history
at Amherst College. But the Category 3 racer also hopes to move up
to Category 2. Takayama rides with the Green Mountain Bicycle Club
in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen, the Natick native, said he races all over New England
from April until October, but emphasized that he does have a life
outside the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cycle, but I'm not a `cyclist','' Hagen said.

JELLY ROLL JIVE CLASS OF MCCRACKEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, N.H. _ In a race named in honor of a noted gentleman,
what better outcome than to have the horse with the most class in
the field prevail?
</P>
<P>
   That was the case Sunday at Rockingham Park, as Jelly Roll Jive,
a winner of more than $200,000 who was purchased privately from the
powerful New York stable of Christophe Clement, captured the
$25,000 Sam McCracken Memorial Handicap, named for the late Globe
turf writer.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Kevin Joy, who bought Jelly Roll Jive for ``a premium''
on behalf of owner John Tombarello, completed a big weekend by
saddling his second stakes winner in two days. On Saturday, Joy,
33, sent Fortunate Review out to win the $25,000 Manchester
Handicap, the first stakes victory of Joy's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought in a million years that I'd have a horse like
this,'' said Joy. ``When I started in 1986, all I got were the $200
and $300 cripples. Now, with owners like Mr. Tombarello, it's just
snowballing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jelly Roll Jive was off as the 2-1 choice ($6.80 to win) under
Taylor Hole and settled into 10th place as the 12-horse field
undertook the mile-and-one-16th journey over the grass course. He
advanced quickly approaching the far turn, angled out and made a
rippling run to overhaul pace-setter Nasello, the second choice at
5-2 with Henry Ma, and pull away to tally by 3 lengths. Nasello
held the place by a half-length over 13-1 shot Ben's Approval,
ridden by David Amiss, who rallied late to finish third. The final
time was a fast 1:43 4/5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked my way along and got through traffic,'' said Hole,
who also had ridden Fortunate Review. ``My horse only really ran
the last 2 furlongs. I had a ton of horse. I couldn't pull him up
after the race. He's the real deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran awesome,'' said Joy, who has now won two races at Rock
with Jelly Roll Jive, the first being a top allowance on the dirt.
``Taylor just settled him in and when he came to the top of the
stretch, he exploded. He got into a little jackpot out of the gate,
and there was traffic, but he overcame everything and still got up.
I was a little concerned that he had not been over this course, but
he had no problems with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Tombarello told me to find a horse for him that would be
the one to beat every time I entered him in New England. I'll
nominate him to the Bruce Smith Memorial down in Boston, but I
might just put him in something out of town that offers more
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma felt the breeze aboard Nasello as Jelly Roll Jive flew past.
</P>
<P>
   ``My horse ran very relaxed to the quarter-pole,'' said Ma. ``I
asked him and he dug in hard. &UR;  &LR; He just got beat by a better
horse.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sept. 6, moved Saturday in the `a' category and are
repeated Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RISK-TAKERS-REVIEW _ Risk was a great thing when new worlds and
new frontiers beckoned and the risk-takers had little to lose. Now
millions of people crowd the coasts, living in more expensive
properties built more shoddily than a generation ago, and more
vulnerable to oceans and storms and quakes. Beyond the nation's
borders, in the world's financial markets, people are also living
nearer to the edge, in riskier ways, closer to the winds of rising
storms. As prosperity has grown, risk has grown with it. By Tim
Weiner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LITTLE-LEAGUE-REVIEW _ Roughly 80 percent of today's major
leaguers played Little League baseball _ including players from
places outside the United States, like Panama (Mariano Rivera of
the Yankees) and even tiny Curacao (Andruw Jones of the Atlanta
Braves). Eight played in the Little League World Series. By Alan
Schwarz. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMERS-REVIEW _ What consumer confidence is and isn't. By
Sylvia Nasar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ECON-REVIEW _ Life in Russia is hard _ harder still,
because so many expected better this time. But this is the nation
that coped with the Golden Horde, Ivan the Terrible, the siege of
Leningrad and communism, and outlived them all. Coping is in the
national genetic code, a source of humor and pride and even song:
``Anything but the war,'' goes a refrain from a popular Soviet-era
tune. In a nation where workers go months without pay, basic
services are spotty and the currency is losing its worth, it may be
Boris Yeltsin's salvation, too. By Michael Wines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-REVIEW _ Thinking like Kim Jong Il of North Korea. By
Nicholas D. Kristof. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-CLINTON-REVIEW _ Ever since the Lewinsky scandal broke in
January, Washington pundits have been saying that the time might
come when Democratic elders went down to the White House to tell
Clinton that, for the party's sake, he should begin to pack. One
difficulty with this vision is that there is only a handful of
Democrats on whom the president relies, and from whom he might take
such a message seriously. By Adam Clymer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BABY-LITERACY-REVIEW _ For baby's literary enlightenment, the
hand that rocks the cradle should also be turning the the pages of
``Good Night Moon'' or ``The Poky Little Puppy.'' At least that's
the hope of an assortment of major publishers seeking to raise a
new generation of book buyers. It's also the goal of a growing
number of charities and foundations that have brought together
pediatricians, volunteers and librarians in a less commercial quest
to promote the notion that reading aloud to toddlers, babies _ even
newborns _ is a child-care ritual as vital as mother's milk. By
Doreen Carvajal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX-RUMORS-REVIEW _ Everybody here is whispering about everybody
else's sex life. No one, of course, is recommending such talk.
Heaven forbid. No one wants the president's troubles to unleash a
squinty-eyed inquisition into the sexual mores of a publicly dull,
prudish city with a history of smeared lipstick behind closed
office doors. But in the White House, on Capitol Hill and in
political consultancies and law firms, people say it will happen.
By James Bennet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMERICANS-MOOD-REVIEW _ Americans are far from depressed. News
about falling currencies, market fluctuations and sexual
peccadilloes seem less harbingers of bad times than distractions
from the steak and hot dogs on the grill. While a few polls
indicate that some Americans are concerned about the distant
future, the reigning sentiment out there now is one of relative
satisfaction. By Jennifer Steinhauer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WALKING-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Take a hike! Can't you see I'm
reading?
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week. &QL;

   &UR; SPIN CYCLE: HOW THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE MEDIA MANIPULATE THE
NEWS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Howard Kurtz. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the bad marriage between President Clinton's
spinmeisters and a deeply mistrustful press corps, the media
reporter for The Washington Post shows how both sides connive to
control and package the news. The book, which features a new
chapter on the Lewinsky relationship, is ``a revealing, highly
detailed insider account,'' Wendy Kaminer wrote here earlier this
year.

   &UR; MAKING WAVES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Mario Vargas Llosa. Edited by John King. Penguin, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   In a collection of essays written over a 30-year period, the
Peruvian author reveals an enduring fascination with history and
politics, as well as a desire to balance social justice and
individual freedom, employing models from Sartre to Faulkner to
Isaiah Berlin. Last year in the Book Review, Jay Parini called this
``a diverse and representative volume that allows us, for the first
time, to trace this enigmatic, often brilliant writer's ...
intellectual journey.''  &UR; WHO KILLED PALOMINO MOLERO? &LR; 
(Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $11), one of two novels by Vargas
Llosa that have recently been restored to print, is a detective
story about the murder of a singer and a meditation on the elusive
nature of truth, love and evil. In 1987 our reviewer, Richard
Lourie, called the writing ``spare, rich and cruelly beautiful.''
The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE REAL LIFE OF ALEJANDRO MAYTA &LR; 
($13), which interweaves two narratives: that of the title
character, a guerrilla who leads a failed uprising in the Peruvian
mountains, and that of the novelist-narrator, who struggles to
reconstruct Mayta's life and times. ``It is the reader in the end
who 'writes' the story, piecing it together from all the lies and
contradictions, the unreliable testimony and historical `data'''
Robert Coover wrote here in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SEX ON THE BRAIN: THE BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND
WOMEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Deborah Blum. Penguin, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   Are women sentenced to be nurturing and passive? Are men doomed
to be aggressive? Judging from the physiological and behavioral
research into such loaded questions, our actions appear to be
driven in surprising ways by both biology and culture. ``Blum
manages the tricky art of good science reporting'' and writes
''clearly and accessibly,'' Ann Finkbeiner said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY LIFE, STARRING DARA FALCON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ann Beattie. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This novel's narrator, a naive housewife who is both passive and
sympathetic, is victimized in ways large and small by a would-be
actress who blows into her New Hampshire town. Beattie ``is as good
at acute observation as she ever was,'' Jim Shepard wrote here in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY: A MEMOIR OF LIFE IN DEATH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jean-Dominique Bauby. Vintage International, $11.
</P>
<P>
   A French magazine editor, after suffering a major stroke at the
age of 43, was left totally alert but unable to move anything but
his left eyelid, a condition that nonetheless allowed him to write
this lyrical book by means of an alphabetical code. ``The author
displays a writerly control equal to his honesty,'' our reviewer,
Thomas Mallon, said last year.  &UR; LOOK UP FOR YES &LR; , by Julia Tavalaro
and Richard Tayson (Penguin, $12.95), is another vivid survival
story by a stroke victim, in this case a Long Island woman who
awakens paralyzed in an unfamiliar hospital after a seven-month
coma. Tavalaro is ``endowed with extraordinary powers of memory and
description,'' Paula Friedman said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GUT SYMMETRIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jeanette Winterson. Vintage International, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This novel, whose title refers to both the human body and the
grand unified theory pursued by physicists, unfolds in the minds of
its three main characters: a Princeton scientist, his longtime wife
and a woman physicist who becomes romantically involved with both.
Last year our reviewer, Bruce Bawer, admired the author's ``fresh,
vivid way of putting things.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FIRST MODERNS: PROFILES IN THE ORIGINS OF TWENTIETH-CENTURY
THOUGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By William R. Everdell. University of Chicago, $16.
</P>
<P>
   The author locates the roots of modernism in discontinuity, a
fractured worldview that rejects smoothness as illusory and began
percolating through math, physics and painting in the late 19th
century. Everdell ``has himself recombined the parts of our era's
intellectual history in new and startling ways,'' Hugh Kenner said
here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONE OF US &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David Freeman. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $11.95.
</P>
<P>
   During the last days of British rule in Egypt, an ambassador
tries to turn the young King Farouk into a proper Englishman, a
misguided plan that results in cuckoldry and revenge. In this
historical novel of clashing cultures, ``Freeman has splendidly
re-created a fading colonial world,'' Jonathan Wilson wrote here
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE LATE THE SWEET BIRDS SANG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Kate Wilhelm. Orb/Tom Doherty, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   In this science fiction tale, the sterile survivors of a global
environmental catastrophe turn to mass cloning, but the clones'
communal upbringing deprives them of imagination and creativity.
The author's ``cautionary message comes through loud and clear,''
Gerald Jonas said here in 1976.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Aug. 29,
1998, at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000
other retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all
such outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.

   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, as the stock market tumbled, President Clinton's
political embarrassments deepened and Russia's financial crisis
snowballed, the biggest fear suddenly became fear itself.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the economy is in its best shape in decades,
that unemployment and inflation are remarkably low, the budget is
balanced and the Federal Reserve is content to leave interest rates
alone. The newest worry is that all the scary headlines will so
unnerve consumers _ whose spending has been a key source of the
economy's strength in recent years _ that sheer pessimism will keep
them away from malls, car dealerships and the housing market,
igniting a recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about psychology as opposed to money,'' said Nicholas
Perna, chief economist at Fleet Bank. ``I'm absolutely convinced
that people identify the stock market with the economy. When the
market is tanking, they know things can't be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Perna, revealing something of a pessimistic streak himself, said
he expected the economy to turn extremely sluggish or worse. But
the notion that a national case of the vapors _ as opposed to a
scarcity of jobs, income or wealth _ can cause an otherwise healthy
economy to swoon calls for some skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   As David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, put it
late last week, ``As far as getting spooked, it takes an awful lot
to scare an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic forecasters track two monthly indexes of consumer
confidence religiously. Even though economists disagree on how
important consumer confidence is and even what the indexes measure,
they agree that confidence has been hovering at historical highs
for the past few years and that spending has been remarkably
strong.
</P>
<P>
   The older survey of confidence, begun in 1947, is conducted by
the University of Michigan. The newer one was started in the late
1960s by the Conference Board, a New York-based research
organization, and is more familiar to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Each employs slightly different sampling techniques, asks
different questions and tabulates its results at different times of
the month. The Michigan survey is available only to paying clients,
while the Conference Board's index is released to the press.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to gauge consumer confidence, the surveyors are
actually trying to capture the expectations of households in three
basic areas: personal finance, economic conditions and buying
conditions. Both surveys ask five questions, but add others from
time to time to monitor consumers' changing concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In the Michigan survey, two questions focus on the respondents'
financial situation. Two other questions have to do with opinions
about overall economic conditions and the final one asks whether
now is a good time to buy a major appliance. The Conference Board's
questions focus more on job availability and less on personal
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan conducts a phone survey of 500 households and the
Conference Board mails questionnaires to 5,000 households, and
after the answers are collected they are are combined into the
indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Both confidence measures generally move in sync with consumer
spending, and every recession has been preceded or accompanied by a
sharp drop in confidence. Similarly, every recovery has been
preceded or accompanied by a rebound in confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Both the size and duration of the change in confidence make a
difference. It takes about a 10 percent decline over a month or two
to register as a significant shift, and it's not just the change in
confidence but the level that counts. ``Anything above 90 indicates
strong spending,'' said Lynn Franco, an economist at the Conference
Board.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the Conference Board's index was 133, close to the
high of 140 set in the late 1960s. ``It could drop 20 points
without necessarily signaling a sharp slowdown in spending,'' Ms.
Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan index is close to 105, also near its high. But
after last week's drop of 411.43 points in the Dow Jones industrial
average, economists will be looking for signs of consumers'
reaction in both September indexes.
</P>
<P>
   There is disagreement among economists as to whether confidence
measures are useful for predicting future spending patterns or
spotting turning points in the economy. The benchmark study of
confidence, published in the American Economic Review shortly after
the 1990-1991 recession, concluded that the indexes are useful but
limited in value.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent study by two economists at the New York Federal
Reserve, Sydney Ludvigson and Jason Bram, suggests that the
Conference Board index may be a more useful indicator. ``Consumers
seem to spend more when they feel good about future job prospects
than they do when they think business conditions are favorable,''
Ms. Ludvigson said.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable episode in which the consumer confidence index
was the first true sign that the economy was heading into a
recession was in the summer of 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait and
oil prices doubled within a matter of days. Confidence plunged, and
within weeks spending stalled and the economy was in a nose dive.
Lots of economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, were caught by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many drops in confidence are too small or too short to affect
spending. When political events lead to drops in confidence at a
time when the overall economy looks healthy, the drop is almost
always temporary.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1987, for example, the Dow plunged 500 points, or 20
percent, in a single day, and the next month the Conference Board's
index dropped 20 points, to nearly 100. But perhaps because an
export boom was under way, consumers recovered their spirits within
a couple of months, and the index bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Curtin, the economist who runs the Michigan survey,
points out that by the late 1980s consumers had figured out that
employment, income and economic growth no longer moved in sync with
the stock market _ as they had in the 1960s and 1970s. ``In 1987,
consumers saw no repercussions for income or employment growth from
the stock market decline and therefore mostly ignored it,'' Curtin
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, surges in confidence related to politically
popular events but not supported by improvements in the economy
also tend to be short-lived. Consumer confidence surged after the
Persian Gulf war, but the indexes quickly fell again because the
economy and job growth remained sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Other economists don't see much of a cause-and-effect
relationship at all between confidence and spending, but see the
indexes as useful nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence is more of a summary measure of things that affect
spending than a specific cause in its own right,'' said Ed
McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In general, forecasters say the real importance of measuring
confidence has less to do with the power of psychology than the
timeliness of the reports. Confidence surveys come out two weeks
before the government's monthly employment reports and a month to
six weeks before reports on consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   If consumer sentiment reflects their perception of the job
market and business conditions, then it is a convenient preliminary
reading for economists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no denying it's important, but the main thing that
makes it interesting is that it comes out on a timely basis,'' said
one forecaster. ``If you could see the September employment numbers
or the Conference Board survey, you'd rather see the jobs
numbers.''

   Walking seems simple: You take your right foot and place it
ahead of your left. Then you take your left foot and place it ahead
of your right. Locomotion ensues. You may wish to vary the starting
foot. Left, right _ It's up to you.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, walking is a lot less complicated than the
hokey-pokey, but you don't see a lot of books written about the
hokey-pokey, even though pretty much everybody has to dance it at
weddings, sometimes drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Walking, on the other hand, has inspired dozens of books as well
as a glossy magazine in recent years _ a response to an
increasingly aging, sedentary and obese population that recognizes
the need to get off its collective keister but also says, ``Hey,
let's not overdo it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, as walking has assumed a lucrative, baby-boomerish niche
in the consumer economy, this simple activity, in typically
American fashion, has become rocket science, brain surgery,
quasi-religious ritual and organizing principle of life all rolled
into one.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the impression you come away with after
perusing volumes like those excerpted below, lugged back to the
office after a recent foray into one of Manhattan's book
superstores.
</P>
<P>
   Before trying this or any other strenuous activity, consult your
physician.

   How-to-Walk Book No. 2: ``Walking: A Complete Guide to the
Complete Exercise'' by Casey Meyers (Random House, 1992, 313 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Quote: I have worked with thousands of people in walking clinics
coast to coast. During this time two things have struck me as
funny. First, everybody drove to the clinic to learn how to walk,
and second, almost all knew more about how their cars functioned
than about how their bodies did.

   How-to-Walk Book No. 3: ``Walk Yourself Well'' by Sherry
Brourman, P.T., with Randy Rodman (Hyperion, 1998, 292 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Quote: Every step we take has two phases: a stance phase and a
swing phase. The stance phase is the part of walking when the foot
is touching the ground. The three parts to the stance phase are:
(1)  &UR; heel strike, &LR;  when only the heel is on the ground; (2)
 &UR; mid-stance, &LR;  when the foot and toes come to the ground; and (3)
 &UR; pushoff, &LR;  when the foot lifts onto the toe, which bend, squeeze
down, and propel us forward, mostly with the big and middle toe.
</P>
<P>
   The swing phase is everything that happens between the time that
the toes go airborne until the heel of the same foot strikes the
ground again. Both stance and swing phases play a primary role in
propelling us forward with optimal balance.

   Quote: Walking is walking. That's it. You might go faster, or
you might go slower, but if you're putting one foot in front of the
other for your health, fitness or performance, you're walking.

<P>
   How-to-Walk Book No. 5: ``Walking'' by Ruth Rudner (Human
Kinetics, 1996, 120 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Quote: One bright autumn Sunday afternoon, I left the village of
Igls, a couple of miles from and a thousand feet above Innsbruck in
the Austrian Tyrol, to go for a walk. The air was crisp, the world
shimmering with the gold of larch trees and birches. The pretty
forest path was well-trod by about 200 years of walkers. I was
headed for a mountain hut a few miles distant for an afternoon of
coffee and cake. On the way, I came upon an old woman walking up
the path, holding the hand of a tiny girl. The girl was little
enough that walking must have been a new activity for her. The two
kept pace with one another, their footsteps matching. It struck me,
in that moment, that I was seeing the ending and the beginning of
life; that the rhythm of age and childhood were in accord; and that
all of this was happening on foot.

   How-to-Walk Book No. 7: ``The Spirited Walker: Fitness Walking
for Clarity, Balance and Spiritual Connection'' by Carolyn Scott
Kortge (HarperSanFrancisco, 1998, 253 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Quote: When you've had a day filled with activity and what you
need most is to quiet your mind so that you can reconnect with
nature _ and with your own divine nature _ experiment with
contemplative walking meditation. Pick a location where you can
focus fully on your steps. It might be a hallway or your living
room. Perhaps you know a quiet path outdoors. Lower your eyes and
turn your attention to your steps. Walk slowly, counting each step
in a pattern of one to four. When your attention strays, simply
begin the count again. Or focus on your breathing, blocking out
mental chatter by thinking ``in'' as you inhale and ``out'' as you
release each breath.
</P>
<P>
   Thich Nhat Hanh, Vietnamese Buddhist monk and peace activist,
teaches meditation students to plant peace and happiness on the
earth with each step. . . . Be aware of your foot touching the
ground and consciously imprint peace with each step. Think about
leaving footprints that heal the earth.

<P>
   Groucho-Based Exercises:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Groucho Walk  &LR; . . . Start walking, then bend your knees so you
are in a deep lunge position. Make sure your knees stay over your
heels (forming a 90-degree or wider angle at the knee) as you step
forward. Walk quickly in this squat position while pumping your
arms.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Groucho Lay-Ups  &LR; . . . Take three Groucho steps beginning with
your right foot, then hop on the third step (on your right foot),
bringing your left knee up and landing on your foot again. When you
land, be sure to bend your knees to help absorb the impact. Take
three Groucho steps beginning with your left foot, hop on your
third step (on your left foot). Pump the arms as you Groucho-walk
and then swing them wider or shoot them overhead, as in basketball,
when you hop. Continue to step-step-step-shoot (on the count of 1,
2, 3, 4).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Backward Groucho Walking Uphill  &LR; . . . Be sure the way is clear
of debris. Crouch low into the knees (however, avoid bending too
low and putting stress on the knee) and Groucho-walk up the hill
backward.

   How-to-Walk Book No. 9: ``Walk It Off! 20 Minutes a Day to
Health and Fitness'' by Suzanne Levine, D.p.m. (Plume/Penguin,
1990, 257 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Sample Walking Type: The Sensual Stroller . . . For this one,
think Marilyn Monroe or Elvis Presley. Your whole body is alive
with pleasure as you walk. You feel your lithe limbs moving under
your clothes. You step forward with a slinky roll, leading with
your hips, your arms gracefully flowing forward and back with each
sensuous unfolding of your thighs.
</P>
<P>
   You move like a graceful tiger, leisurely but calculating. . . .
You're beautiful and desirable, and you know it. You're humming
something provocative, like ``Mama Said There'd Be Days Like This''
or ``The Girl From Ipanema.'' You know you look marvelous. You're
in the mood for love.
</P>
<P>
   How-to-Walk Book No. 10: ``Walk Yourself Thin'' by David A.
Rives (Moon River, 1998, 149 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Quote: First of all, it really is a fact of life: If you're
going to get thin, you're going to have to control  &UR; something! &LR;  If
you don't want to control the amount you eat, then you're going to
have to control the amount you exercise. There's no getting around
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, poop!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Postscript: Perhaps walking isn't for you. In that case, you might
consider books like ``The Art of Breathing'' by Nancy Zi (Vivi,
1997), or even ``The Art of Doing Nothing'' by Veronique Vienne
(Clarkson Potter, 1998), which includes chapters on lounging,
napping and yawning.  &LR;

 DIRTY LAUNDRY: NOW, THE SPIN CYCLE

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Everybody here is whispering about whispering about
everybody else's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   No one, of course, is recommending such talk. Heaven forbid. No
one wants the president's troubles to unleash a squinty-eyed
inquisition into the sexual mores of a publicly dull, prudish city
with a history of smeared lipstick behind closed office doors.
</P>
<P>
   But in the White House, on Capitol Hill and in political
consultancies and law firms, people say it will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is going to burn,'' predicted one prominent
Democrat here, while insisting that his camp would have nothing to
do with setting the blaze. The prospect of a report to Congress by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr started the latest round of
expectant rumor-mongering.
</P>
<P>
   But predictions of a sexual Armageddon have been rife almost
since the president was first reported to have had an affair with
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. They have yet to come true.
While Ms. Lewinsky's dirty laundry _ literally _ has been aired in
press accounts, few others besides her and the president have been
seared so far.
</P>
<P>
   One exception is House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose sexual past
was recently picked over in the online publication ``Salon.'' The
article reprised reporting in Vanity Fair three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the most prominent exception is Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who
admitted Friday that he had had an extramarital relationship years
ago that produced a son. Earlier in the week, Burton had told
constituents of unspecified past troubles in his 38-year marriage,
saying he was motivated by the fear that Vanity Fair (again) was
about to publish scandalous details.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Burton's disclosure, jittery politicians were
admitting mistakes or declaring their virtue right and left.
Obliquely asked by reporters if marital faithfulness was properly
an issue in presidential contests, some have pre-emptively declared
themselves true to their wives. Texas Gov. George W. Bush has done
so, as has former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   ``To run in 2000, as a prospective presidential candidate in
particular, you're going to have to be Mr. or Mrs. Clean,'' said
Greg Mueller, a Republican political strategist.
</P>
<P>
   The other approach _ admitting mistakes _ was on display last
week. In criticizing Clinton, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut
and several other Democratic senators practically stumbled over
each other in conceding, vaguely, transgressions (though not
necessarily sexual ones) in their personal lives. That technique
blunted not only any appearance of censoriousness, but also the
news hook that an accusation of hypocrisy might provide reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In admitting his mistakes, Burton blamed the White House for
putting Vanity Fair onto the story, an accusation dismissed by the
administration and the magazine. ``When it comes to anybody's
personal life, that's just off limits as far as we are concerned,''
said a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say that it would be stupid for them to
risk spreading sexual rumors, though they say they worry that rogue
aides might be freelancing.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists' willingness to poke into bedrooms is often traced _
wrongly _ to a challenge in 1987 by Gary Hart, then a Democratic
candidate for president, to a reporter from this newspaper.
``Follow me around,'' he said. ``I don't care. I'm serious. If
anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They'd be very
bored.'' In fact, by the time those words were published, people
already were tailing him. They weren't bored.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent rumors of Hart's womanizing appear to have piqued
reporters' interest, and let the genie out of the bottle. Then, in
1991, the face-off between Anita Hill and Supreme Court nominee
Clarence Thomas helped turn sexual behavior in the workplace into a
national issue. That set the stage for Sen. Bob Packwood's
resignation in 1995, after years of criticism and investigation of
his relations with women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, presidential candidate Bill Clinton was beset by rumors
similar to those that dogged Hart. This time, a woman, Gennifer
Flowers, stepped forward to describe an affair. The accusation came
as Clinton was under fire for his honesty on issues like the
Vietnam draft. Reporters rolled such matters together under the
portentous-sounding heading of the ``character issue.''
</P>
<P>
   That journalistic approach seemed vindicated last week when
Lieberman delivered his speech. ``I know that the president is far
from alone in the wrongdoing he has admitted,'' he said. ``But the
president, by virtue of the office he sought and was elected to,
has traditionally been held to a higher standard.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last presidential campaign, the sex life of
Republican nominee Bob Dole came under scrutiny, but not only
potential presidents have been held to the higher standard. Dick
Morris, a Clinton political adviser, was accused in print of seeing
a prostitute. The story was deemed newsworthy in part because
Morris had devised a campaign emphasizing ``values.'' He was forced
to resign.
</P>
<P>
   After Morris, two Republican political consultants, Arthur
Finkelstein and Don Sipple, found their private lives explored in
magazines. (Last week, in Salon, Democratic consultant James
Carville argued that consultants should be exempted from such
prying. ``Isn't there a danger here that we might be going too
far?'' he wrote, with admitted self-interest.)
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and their advisers blame the news media in part for
legitimating and aiding attacks over private behavior, treating
people in politics more like Hollywood celebrities in a quest for
ratings and readers. Sensational stories like the O.J. Simpson
murder trial, according to this argument, addicted reporters and
editors even at once-staid organizations to sensational stories
that run for weeks like soap operas, but may have little policy
significance.
</P>
<P>
   In the view at least of Democrats here, Starr's inquiry into
Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky burned down any remaining
fences around politicians' _ and maybe prominent journalists' _
private lives.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic political consultant Carter Eskew argued that the
Lewinsky matter demonstrated that while voters are disgusted by
adultery, they are also angered by people who dredge it up. Most
political candidates, he said, would not risk airing opponents'
sexual secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end it's mutual assured destruction,'' he said. ``So it
won't happen.''

 POSTCARDS FROM A WHAT-ME-WORRY SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally files on Saturday, September (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, Jamie Dimon, the co-chairman of Salomon Smith Barney, had
to fly home from his August vacation in Europe when the market fell
over 500 points last week. But after noodling with his Bloomberg
terminal and conferring with colleagues, he headed right back once
the Dow regained some of its steadiness.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Daub, owner of Nantucket.net, an Internet cafe on the
Massachusetts island, noticed in recent weeks more people coming in
to check stock quotes _ most with a beach towel on one arm and a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the summer of our blithe ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the country has been faced with weeks of
turmoil. ``If someone sat down on July Fourth and made a list of
predictions for the political and economic outlook, most of them
would have been wrong,'' said David Blitzer, chief economist at
Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. in New York. ``Everyone thought Monica
Lewinsky would go away, she didn't. We thought we knew Russian
policy. People thought the Asia crisis was taking a step back, but
it reawakened.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Americans are far from depressed. News about falling
currencies, market fluctuations and sexual peccadilloes seem less
harbingers of bad times than distractions from the steak and hot
dogs on the grill. While a few polls indicate that some Americans
are concerned about the distant future, the reigning sentiment out
there now is one of relative satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public feels the media is out of touch with day-to-day
life,'' said Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers Magazine, a trade
publication for talk radio and television shows. ``It IS a time of
uncertainty, but people base their confidence or lack of it based
on what is happening in their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   So where is the outrage, as Bob Dole once demanded? It is
apparently limited to those beachgoers vexed by the twittering
cellular phones of their neighbor on the next towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were pacing back and forth on the beach in East Hampton
looking very stressed,'' said Jason Weisenfeld, an executive at
Barneys New York. ``It was very out of character.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the lot of most Americans. Though more of them
own mutual funds today than before, most are passive investors,
doing pretty much what their broker tells them, and are in for the
long term. Those sophisticated enough to manage their own money are
far too wealthy to let one downturn scare them.
</P>
<P>
   With the horrific exception of recent terrorist bombings and
last week's airplane crash, many crises of the summer of 1998 have
lacked human drama. Who will say, as they did with the death of
Princess Diana, ``Where were you when Russia devalued the ruble?''
</P>
<P>
   Some, though, simply see opportunity in the losses. ``With the
Asia collapse, everyone says it is terrible,'' said Richard
Gelfond, the co-chief executive of Imax Corp., in a phone interview
from his home in Southampton. ``We are saying to theater owners
that real estate prices there have fallen so much that they can
open theaters at a fraction of the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   People who were more connected to the economic vicissitudes had
their summer vacations marred. ``When the world's events are
dominating the news, taking a vacation is not going to happen,''
lamented Lisa Berkowitz, the vice president and director of
marketing and communications for Harper Business, a unit of
HarperCollins, the publisher. ``Between the stock market and
Russia, everyone in public relations cringes. You're afraid to
leave the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who have taken vacations to give the
appearance of indifference to crisis _ only to have to cut them
short. Like Bill Clinton. Bringing his problems with him like so
much carry-on luggage, he went to Martha's Vineyard _ a place where
others may have been trying to escape him _ then promptly returned
home to deal with military action against terrorist targets.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of politics, things could be better. ``It has been a
rough summer for political folks,'' said Chris Lapetina, a partner
at Global Strategy Group, a democratic polling firm in New York,
where a primary election is just around the corner. ``Those who
think about the global financial situation are thinking about that
more than the political situation here, and that is very
frustrating for our candidates. People just are not focused in at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   And while many chief executives are relaxing at their summer
homes, some of the workers in Wall Street's trenches _ brokers,
traders and analysts _ will respond to the question of what they
did this summer with one word _ panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a prisoner of my own vacation,'' lamented Thomas Hanley,
a managing director at Warburg Dillon Read who analyzes bank
stocks. ``First, there was Hurricane Bonnie. Then, there was the
market. Calls. Faxes. Messages. Traders. Media. I've been doing
this for many years, but this has been the most difficult summer I
can remember in 25 years.'' Hanley was so stressed that he recently
locked himself out of his Southampton house.
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co., simply took her computer along on vacation. During market
turmoil in early August, she sent reassuring faxes from Israel to
clients. ``Nothing ruined my wonderful trip,'' she said. ``I don't
ever really turn off. I go into standby mode.''

   Reno Opens the Door To Campaign Inquiries
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Attorney General Janet Reno resisted calls that
she sek independent investigations of allegations that Democrats
violated election funding laws in the 1996 campaign. Now she has
opened the door.
</P>
<P>
   First she ordered an investigation into whether Harold M. Ickes,
the former deputy White House chief of staff, committed perjury
last year when he told a Senate committee examining Democratic
campaign funding practices that he knew nothing about White House
efforts to intervene in a labor dispute on behalf of the teamsters'
union. At the time, Democrats were seeking the union's campaign
support. Ickes' lawyers said he told the truth, but the Senate
panel said it had uncovered evidence that Ickes sought to aid the
union.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also reopened a Justice Department inquiry into whether an
independent prosecutor should be named to examine spending by the
1996 Clinton-Gore campaign. She cited a Federal Election Commission
audit that questions the legality of an advertising campaign
underwritten by the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Stranded by Floods
</P>
<P>
   China has declared at least a temporary victory against its
swollen rivers, but its authorities are facing a problem more
daunting than this year's record-breaking floods: millions of
refugees whose homes and belongings were literally washed away.
They are a sad lot, now camping out in tents, schools, factories or
at relatives' homes until they can began rebuilding their lives. It
may not be soon.
</P>
<P>
   Although the record river levels have now started to recede,
many towns will remain submerged for a month or more. In the south,
this means thousands could be stuck living on dikes, drinking
contaminated Yangtze River water. In the frigid northeast, where
night temperatures are approaching freezing, many of the more than
2 million flood refugees will not have a chance to rebuild their
mud-brick homes before winter comes. The provincial government has
said that ``home'' this winter for hundreds of thousands of
displaced people will be government-provided tents.

   A Summit Trip Like No Other
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton met with President Boris Yeltsin in
Moscow, the near collapse of Russia's economy was on his mind, but
there wasn't much to be done beyond expressions of support if
Russia stayed the course of reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians and Americans also concluded an agreement that
would let U.S. satellites give Russia dependable warnings about
missile launchings around the world. The satellites were originally
put up to safeguard America against Russian missile launchings. But
now there is another danger: errors could be made by the
deteriorating Russian early-warning system, leading to an
accidental nuclear war. Thus the American backup.
</P>
<P>
   After Russia, Clinton proceeded to Northern Ireland, where he
was greeted as a peacemaker, and the Irish Republic, where he
praised the country's prosperity as a fruit of peace. He also
resumed facing reporters' questions about his relationship with the
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians Execute 2
</P>
<P>
   The first executions by the Palestinian Authority were hardly a
paragon of justice. Only three days passed from the time members of
the Abu Sultan family killed two brothers from the al-Khalidi clan
to the time two Abu Sultan brothers were executed by firing squads
in the Gaza police headquarters _ just time enough for some
threatening protests in the streets, a quickie military trial and
an OK from Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the executions had virtually unanimous support in the Gaza
Strip. One reason was that ancient tribal codes of justice still
predominate in Gazan society, and if the Palestinian Authority had
not executed the Abu Sultans, the large and powerful al-Khalidi
clan would have had to do so itself.
</P>
<P>
   But the most significant reason was that the killings brought
out a rising anger among Palestinians about the misuse of firearms
and power by members of Arafat's many security forces (There are at
least 12 such forces).
</P>
<P>
   The condemned Abu Sultan brothers were both members of the
security forces, and they had used their service weapons to gun
down the al-Khalidi brothers in a dispute.

   Airline Stalls State
</P>
<P>
   While the Northwest Airlines pilots strike might have
inconvenienced much of the country, most people probably made do
with another airline or a delay. Not in North Dakota. There people
were forced to do without the state's only major airline.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest city, Fargo, was reduced to three 30-seat United
Express commuter flights a day. The state capital, Bismarck,
hobbled by with six 19-seat turboprop flights. And people in the
third and fourth largest cities in the state, Grand Forks and
Minot, could not fly in or out at all.
</P>
<P>
   And then came a second double blow. No more driving north and
flying out of Winnipeg. Air Canada went on strike, too.

   Prosecutors Drop Murder Case Against 2 Children
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, prosecutors in Chicago accused two boys, 7 and 8
years old, of having murdered an 11-year-old girl riding her
bicycle in their neighborhood. The girl's body was found with
evidence of having been sexually molested, and the police said the
boys had confessed to attacking her.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, the prosecutors dropped the murder case against the
boys after a crime laboratory report issued to prosecutors showed
the presence of semen in the girl's underpants; police crime
experts said it was highly unlikely that boys so young could
produce semen.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the police said the boys had initially reported
seeing a strange man lure the girl, Ryan Harris, into a car, but
had changed their story under questioning. Defense lawyers
contended all along that the questioning _ which produced the
incriminating admissions on which the police based their case _ had
been improper.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism, For Once, in Ulster  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in a more secure future has unexpectedly come to
Northern Ireland scarcely three weeks after the most deadly episode
in the conflicted province's bloody history.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 15, former members of the Irish Republican Army unhappy
with the organization's 14-month old cease fire and its apparent
tactical shift in favor of a negotiated settlement bombed the town
center of Omagh, killing 28 people and wounding more than 200
others. Public revulsion at the bombing converted the act, designed
to sink the peace agreement signed last April, into one that gave
the accord new buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political ally, condemned the Omagh bombing. He said violence in
Northern Ireland was ``a thing of the past, over, done with and
gone,'' and committed his party to the effort to plan the gradual
disarmament of paramilitary groups. The statements from Adams were
carefully crafted to meet demands that the IRA declare its war over
and signal its willingness to talk about dismantling its arsenal of
weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant opponents welcomed the moves and hinted strongly that
they were prepared to end their snubbing of Sinn Fein and to clear
the way for party members to enter fully into the leadership of the
new Northern Ireland Assembly and other political institutions set
up by the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   On hand to witness this hopeful moment was President Clinton,
hailed by the British Prime Minister Tony Blair as an invaluable
participant in the forging of the peace settlement. Clinton's
troubles in Washington went unmentioned as adoring crowds cheered
him on his one-day visit to Northern Ireland. He told them the
peace they had constructed should now become the model for warring
communities in other ethnic conflicts around the world.

   After All, Dear, It's Only Money  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross first announced that
she would run for governor, Democrats took notice. She had just
joined the Democratic Party, and she was still a relative newcomer
to the business of politics, but she came with the promise of money
_ courtesy of her husband, investment banker Wilbur Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross pledged that her husband would bankroll a
lush campaign, complete with the television advertisements she
would surely need to appeal to Democratic primary voters who might
be wary about supporting someone who had been elected as the
running mate of the Republican George Pataki in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But now all that has collapsed, in an episode that underscores
the lesson that the strongest campaigns are not necessarily those
blessed by the richest benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Ross withdrew $2.25 million of the money he had
given her. That left the candidate struggling to find a way to stay
afloat in the final days of her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross said her husband had acted ``for reasons
unrelated to this campaign, for personal and financial reasons,''
and remained chipper on Friday, asserting that nothing had changed
_ except, of course, for money.

 FEELING SECURE IS A RISKY BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, September (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans who never fought a war or feared a
depression could be forgiven for imagining a risk-free world.
Living high and mighty, consuming more than their share of the
world's food and fuel, feeling secure within their borders and even
reasonably safe outside them, they could envision a boundless zone
of security in which American money and power and culture and
technology would insure some sort of peace.
</P>
<P>
   But when markets tumble into turbulence, wiping out $4 trillion
of the world's wealth, and a plane to Switzerland _ home of stolid
banks and precise watchworks _ plummets from the sky, and the
United States hurls missiles at an armed theosopher in Afghanistan,
inviting retaliation against American emblems everywhere, the odds
in the big casino can feel like they are shifting back to the
house.
</P>
<P>
   At least subconsciously, people calculate those odds every time
they board a plane or take a flier. Today the well-off may have
reason to feel at risk: They have more to lose, more creature
comforts, more paper profits. Global crashes can stir the
survivalist inside the most confident suburbanite.
</P>
<P>
   Risk was a great thing when new worlds and new frontiers
beckoned and the risk-takers had little to lose. Now millions of
people crowd the coasts, living in more expensive properties built
more shoddily than a generation ago, and more vulnerable to oceans
and storms and quakes. Beyond the nation's borders, in the world's
financial markets, people are also living nearer to the edge, in
riskier ways, closer to the winds of rising storms. As prosperity
has grown, risk has grown with it.
</P>
<P>
   How do people deal with invisible global forces? Mostly, they
don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reference point to calculate our probabilities,''
said Howard Kunreuther, co-director of the Center for Risk
Management and Decision Processes at the Wharton School. ``So, we
forget. It's very costly to be scared every moment. We say, `This
isn't going to happen to me.' And then we're surprised if it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the world really more risky than it was 40 years or 40 days
ago? If so, why? As the rigid Cold War past melts into the fluid
present, where the chances of being vaporized by a nuclear bomb
from Vladivostok are down, but the chances of being wiped out by a
currency crash in Jakarta are up, calibrating these dangers is
complicated. It has energized an increasingly interesting field:
risk analysis, a school of thought built from risky business:
managing nuclear power, launching rockets, building dams, curing
cancers, combating terrorists, buying insurance, managing mutual
funds and pension plans, playing the markets _ the gamut of global
gambles.
</P>
<P>
   Risk, it turns out, can be quantified. But a sense of security
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is risk?'' asks Yacov Haimes, president of the Society
for Risk Analysis. ``Risk is measurable, and composed of two parts:
What could go wrong and what are the consequences? Now, safety is
something else. Safety is the level of risk that's acceptable to
you. Today in America we are seeking more comfort. We can afford
more comfort. We expect more comfort. Go to Phoenix, in Arizona _
in a desert, they have lawns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, is our world more dangerous?'' he said. ``It is. We are
asking more of it, more comfort and therefore we are more
vulnerable. The more secure we are, the more we feel the danger of
losing our security. There are easy ways to inflict major pain with
no major effort. People can intrude on our financial and
national-security systems in much easier ways. This is because of
the interconnectedness of the world and its infrastructures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This interlinkage,'' a presidential commission warned in
October, ``has created a new dimension of vulnerability, which,
when combined with an emerging constellation of threats, poses
unprecedented national risk.''
</P>
<P>
   This more interwoven world may remind people of an old
high-school biology lesson: that everything is connected to
everything else. It calls to mind a principle of chaos theory _
that a butterfly flapping its wings in Mexico can set off a chain
of disturbances that causes a hurricane in China.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, a plunge in the Indonesian rupee causes chaos
with the Russian ruble _ and, conceivably, with the U.S. Treasury,
and millions of mutual funds, pension plans and young children's
college savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only my small world any more,'' said Kathleen S.
Gurney, chief executive officer of Financial Psychology Corp.,
which counsels investors, investment advisers and companies on
risk-taking. ``My world extends into places I have no way of
gauging. I am dealing with psyches I don't understand any more. My
sense of prediction is no longer as solid and as true for me. I
don't have the same self-confidence I had two weeks ago. If I'm
feeling this way, others must be feeling this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the world of the calculated risk do share that
assessment. ``In fact, there is more risk,'' said Tom Hutton,
president of Risk Management Solutions, Inc. ``Risks are being
driven by a more complex set of factors.'' Hutton feels safer
flying than driving, but the airport he uses, in San Francisco,
``handles dramatically more flights than it used to, so the risk
there increases exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to the butterfly that can cause a hurricane,'' he
said. ``When you see the linkages between something happening in
Indonesia, a country most people can't find on a map, and its
impact on the world economy, when you can make those connections
and see the number of things that could cause a world financial
crisis, you see more risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect our borders to provide safety, and they don't
anymore,'' he said. ``When you and I were growing up people had
faith in the government, and that allowed them to be comfortable.
That faith has been disturbed. Both the perception of risk and the
risk itself have changed as people see they have linkages to parts
of the world they didn't think affected them.''
</P>
<P>
   Readjusting people's sense of risk without scaring them
senseless is itself a risky business. When Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan warned of ``irrational exuberance'' awhile ago, he
was saying that Americans were underestimating their risks, and
that the boom (or the bubble) of the '90s was feeding American
culture with the notion that things would always rise and never
fall _ a dangerous idea, since markets, like planes, do crash, and
sometimes for similar reasons, like a loose bolt somewhere in the
big machine.
</P>
<P>
   This may unsettle those who dreamed of a risk-free world. ``How
can people assess their tolerance for risk when they've never had a
loss?'' Ms. Gurney said. ``People have grown up in a society where
they have never experienced terror, never lived through a war,
never gone through a depression. Some have made fortunes overnight.
They began to believe in magic.''
</P>
<P>
   In days gone by, people turned to leaders in times of risk.
``Can you name a world leader who is strong today?'' Ms. Gurney
said. ``Someone we can count on? Someone we can trust? We have no
one we can look toward.''
</P>
<P>
   Another risk miscalculated: A president averse to taking chances
in the public realm risked his political life for seconds of
private pleasure, and so lost power to soothe people who may have
reason to be scared.

 THE HYPE AND HOPE OF READING TO BABY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, September(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For baby's literary enlightenment, the hand that rocks the
cradle should also be turning the pages of ``Good Night Moon'' or
``The Poky Little Puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the hope of an assortment of major publishers
seeking to raise a new generation of book buyers. It's also the
goal of a growing number of charities and foundations that have
brought together pediatricians, volunteers and librarians in a less
commercial quest to promote the notion that reading aloud to
toddlers, babies _ even newborns _ is a child-care ritual as vital
as mother's milk.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that there's little evidence that reading aloud
to infants and toddlers has any dramatic benefit. ``The general
consensus is that it's important, but it may be of relatively
modest provable effect based on current research,'' acknowledged
Dr. Robert Needleman, a Cleveland pediatrician and a research
consultant for Reach Out and Read, a national program that
encourages pediatricians to ``prescribe'' story reading for
children at their check-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Needleman added, however, that ``What has been shown is that you
can make small but significant differences in their verbal
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of definitive baby-literacy research has not slowed
profit-oriented publishers and literacy advocates _ even as their
logic has come under attack from a provocative new book on
developmental psychology that has generated hyperbolic magazine
headlines about whether parents' efforts to mold their children
really matter very much.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the
Way They Do'' (Free Press), by Judith Rich Harris, maintains that
parents aren't as important as children's peers and society at
large in determining adult behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence suggesting that reading to children makes them
smarter in school is ambiguous evidence,'' Mrs. Harris said. ``The
fact that there is a correlation between reading to a child and a
child doing well in school can be due to different reasons. Perhaps
it does have an effect. But other evidence suggests that's not the
case. That could be due to the genetic effects of parents who like
to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harris questions the view that parents can affect a child's
personality and temperament. ``The nurture assumption is a
20th-century belief that has turned into a myth in a very
exaggerated form,'' she said. ``It has almost become a religion
that parents have to do this and that. And if they don't, their
children will be irrevocably damaged. This has placed a very heavy
burden on parents. They're feeling guilty and intimidated that one
misstep will ruin their child for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Mrs. Harris' views about the limits of
parental influence are heresy to reading advocates, though she said
she generally supported reading aloud to babies _ sticking to her
theory that if the broader society and peer groups value reading,
than so eventually will children.
</P>
<P>
   To support the merits of baby literacy, groups like the
Association of American Publishers and the American Academy of
Pediatricians cite the positive impact of reading aloud on brain
development. A fact sheet issued by the publishers' association
summarizing recent research asserts: ``A child-care provider reads
to a toddler. And in a matter of seconds, thousands of cells in
these children's growing brains respond. Some brains cells are
`turned on,' triggered by this particular experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But the scientific evidence is less clear. Richard Aslin, a
professor in the brain and cognitive sciences department at the
University of Rochester, has been studying infants from birth to 12
months old to determine how well they hear speech. By repeating
nonsense words to babies and watching their movements, Aslin said,
his research has shown that babies are quicker learners than
usually given credit for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brain does develop rapidly very early in life, but it's
not clear whether these kinds of brain development are so critical
that you have to have certain kinds of experiences to develop
normally,'' Aslin said. ``We just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, efforts to promote baby literacy continue to gather
steam. The William Penn Foundation recently spent more than $2.5
million on a program promoting reading in 300 Philadelphia day-care
centers with more than 18,000 children, many of them under the age
of 3.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers' association and the Boston-based Institute for
Civil Society are planning to imitate this program in other cities
in a campaign tentatively called ``Books for Babies.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Scholastic, a leading publisher of children's
books, is sponsoring a tour by the author Rosemary Wells to promote
``Read to Your Bunny,'' a picture book about the rewards of reading
20 minutes a day to young children. And HarperCollins has been
expanding its line of books labeled for age groups from newborn to
3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Schroeder, the former Colorado Representative and chief
executive of the publisher's association, has also jumped on the
baby-buggy campaign. For her son's wedding in July, 750 copies of
``Read to Your Bunny'' were donated to Easton Hospital in
Pennsylvania in lieu of traditional gifts to the bridesmaids and
ushers.
</P>
<P>
   These broader efforts might actually have their desired effect,
Mrs. Harris contends _ regardless of a parent's specific
storytelling rituals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a child grows up in a culture where most of the parents do
read to children and books are important, then that child is going
to pick up that culture, first at home and then when they go out,''
she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It's already autumn in Russia, and as a pleasure drive
along any country road outside the capital will reveal, the
countryside is a riot of beautiful flowers. It is also a riot of
Mickey Mouse beach towels, fresh and not-so-fresh fruit, various
grades of motor oil, stuffed toys, bricks, pillows, used furniture,
just-picked mushrooms and, in at least one instance, gravestones,
available with your choice of inscription.
</P>
<P>
   From the daisies to the markers, they are all for sale, by
householders and their children who sit patiently by the roadside
in straight-backed chairs dragged from their homes, eking out a few
extra rubles in the after hours.
</P>
<P>
   Such riots are one reason there have not yet been riots in the
face of Russia's deepening economic gloom.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Russia is hard _ harder still, because so many expected
better this time. But this is the nation that coped with the Golden
Horde, Ivan the Terrible, the siege of Leningrad and communism and
outlived them all.
</P>
<P>
   Coping is in the national genetic code, a source of humor and
pride and even song: ``Anything but the war,'' goes a refrain from
a popular Soviet-era tune.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where workers go months without pay, basic services
are spotty and the currency is losing its worth, Russians' ability
to cope may be Boris N. Yeltsin's salvation, too. Americans lose
their cool when that lever on the ice-cube maker gets stuck and the
bin in the freezer isn't replenished. Russians LIVE in a freezer
with not much more ill humor, and considerably more ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   In Vladivostok, on the Sea of Japan, a prolonged drought this
summer rendered water supplies non-potable and limited working
faucets to but a few hours a day. Strikes and bankruptcies in the
coal industry made electricity a sometime thing at best. The city
is broke and many toilets don't work. By the way, the mayor also
suspended rat extermination last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Some 635,000 people live in Vladivostok, most of whom could not
take regular baths this summer because of the drought. For
entertainment, they turned to hand-cranked generators to power
radios and televisions. To eat, they cooked on Bunsen burners. To
bathe, one woman slept with her faucet turned on, so that a sudden
decision by the water works to begin pumping _ usually in the dead
of night _ would produce a sudden blast of water and awaken her.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of things Russians do in place of just
complaining. The woman with the ever-ready bathtub has a friend, an
American who edits The Vladivostok News, who wrote in The Moscow
Times that he left his faucet on, too _ and flooded his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, coping literally starts at childbirth. The average
Russian family consists of a couple and one child, and few have
more than two. In Soviet times, the reason was simple: children
were too expensive. Moreover, housing was so cramped _ with
husband, wife and in-laws sometimes stuffed into two rooms that
shared a kitchen with three or four other apartments _ that more
children were not only too much to bear but too difficult to create
amid paper-thin walls.
</P>
<P>
   Under capitalism, the apartments are being combined to create
middle-class residences. Unfortunately, all else remains the same
for Russians beneath the middle class, except that their pay is
less than it was and they frequently have been evicted by landlords
seeking better-paying tenants. In such cases, they and their
lower-class country cousins resort to time-honored Russian coping
tactics, honed under years of communism.
</P>
<P>
   The principal ploy, called ``blat,'' is a way of getting
something _ a new carburetor or theater tickets or an introduction
to an employer _ by leaning on someone to whom you have granted a
favor. One might call it string-pulling, but it is really a social
convention, a form of barter that fills a real need that the Soviet
system would not satisfy, and that capitalism so far cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Where blat does not suffice, Russians turn to relatives. Parents
work past retirement to feed their jobless or employed-but-not-paid
children. Rural families get packages from their city relatives;
city folk get food from backyard gardens that have become
absolutely essential to winter survival in the boondocks.
</P>
<P>
   And not only the boondocks. It is seriously believed by some
that Russians have been so compliant in the face of adversity this
autumn because they are so busy tending their gardens and hoarding
for winter; this leaves no opportunity for full-time protest. Some
units of the ill-fed Russian army were granted leave this summer to
pick mushrooms, a national passion that for some has become a
necessity as well.
</P>
<P>
   In some of Russia's most remote reaches, coal miners have been
on strike for months, raising families without drawing pay. They
survive in part on the vegetables and chickens in their yards, in
part on the money their wives earn at jobs or by selling handmade
goods, and in part on a communist-era holdover _ the factory lunch,
which they still get and take home.
</P>
<P>
   There is charity: American-style philanthropy, through Rotary
clubs and similar organizations, is taking root. Submarine-builders
in the Far East who have not been paid for 16 months survive in
part on free bread, doled out through passes from a local baker.
</P>
<P>
   And there is subversion of the system, sometimes called theft.
True to the old Communist notion that the people own the nation's
means of production, workers have been known to quietly claim their
share of coal, autos and other necessities of life.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they cut out the middleman and make the products
themselves. Although Russia's production of raw ethyl alcohol is
dramatically increasing _ up 12 percent in the first half of 1998
from a year before _ the vodka production of government-sanctioned
companies is plummeting. Indeed, legitimate producers of vodka make
up a mere 29 percent of the market, the government said recently.
The rest appears to be controlled by a thriving industry of
bootleggers.
</P>
<P>
   Which suggests that however difficult it is for average Russians
to cope with the collapse of their economy, capitalism has some
life left in it yet.

 EX-LITTLE LEAGUERS: THE BOYS OF SUMMER ONCE REALLY WERE BOYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Origianlly file on Saturday, September(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By ALAN SCHWARZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pictures of the Little League champions from Toms River, N.J.,
standing proudly next to their Yankee counterparts during the
National Anthem at Yankee Stadium last Tuesday did more than give
the kids the second thrill of their lives in a week. They evoked
the fact that the big leaguers once were Little Leaguers
themselves, sporting baggy uniforms and major league dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember it like it was yesterday,'' said Paul
O'Neill, the Yankee right fielder, who played Little League in
Columbus, Ohio. ``I remember pitching when I was 12. I pitched the
championship game and struck out a kid named Darren Waugh to end
it. I remember every detail. The games then meant as much to you as
these games do now. And you got to go to Dairy Queen afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 80 percent of today's major leaguers played Little
League baseball _ including players from places outside the United
States, like Panama (Mariano Rivera of the Yankees) and even tiny
Curacao (Andruw Jones of the Atlanta Braves). Eight played in the
Little League World Series. Derek Bell of the Houston Astros and
Gary Sheffield of the Los Angeles Dodgers were on the same Tampa,
Fla., team in 1980. Only one played for a champion: Marc Pisciotta,
a right-hander for the Chicago Cubs, pitched his Marietta, Ga.,
team to the 1983 title.
</P>
<P>
   With or without any national glory, major leaguers look back on
their Little League days more nostalgically as the years pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just had fun,'' said the Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter, who
played in Kalamazoo, Mich. ``You didn't worry about making an error
or striking out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee pitcher David Wells, already beefy as an 11-year-old
in San Diego, once slammed two home runs in a game, and played
every position but one. ``Catcher,'' he said. ``I refused.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first at-bat as a 10-year-old in Southern California,
Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals hit _ what else? _ a home
run. (Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, his rival in the current
home-run chase, didn't play Little League ball in his native
Dominican Republic.)
</P>
<P>
   For Cal Ripken, the iron man of the Baltimore Orioles, the
Little League was the place to hone a boy's unabashed love for
baseball. ``I shined my shoes after every game,'' Ripken recalled,
``and sometimes wore my uniform to bed because I couldn't wait for
the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter can't imagine how the Toms River boys withstood the
pressure of playing before 41,200 spectators at the World Series
last weekend in Williamsport, Pa., with millions more watching on
national television.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, there were like 12 people in the stands,''
he said. ``And all of them were parents.'' Not that those folks
can't get pretty boisterous themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar, the catcher for the Cleveland Indians, grew up in
Puerto Rico, where baseball is a cultural passion. ``The thing I
remember the most is the competitiveness, and a lot of that has to
do with the parents,'' he said. ``The Little League parents are
even worse in Puerto Rico than they are in the States. They will
scream at the kids for whole games. They put a lot of pressure on
the kids. Every parent thinks their kid is going to play in the
major leagues someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Connie Mack, the Hall of Fame manager for the Philadelphia
Athletics in the first half of the century, looked into the future
with a more discerning eye. In 1954, when he watched the Little
League World Series, he commented to a friend, ``I wouldn't be
surprised if some of these kids made it to the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Five players went on to become the first Little
League World Series veterans to reach the big leagues, including
the 1962 National League Rookie of the Year, Ken Hubbs, and the
Baltimore Orioles slugger Boog Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while youngsters dream of reaching The Show, most have
other, more pressing concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two teams in our area, the Lions and the Expos,''
recalled Chipper Jones, the Atlanta Braves third baseman.
``Everybody wanted to play for the Lions because they had
better-looking uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan, who struck out more batters and threw more
no-hitters than any major leaguer ever, said his fondest baseball
memories were of Little League ball in Alvin, Texas. ``We played
for the love of the game and the camaraderie,'' he said. ``Little
League was the first opportunity for children in Alvin to get
involved in any organized activity. It was one of the biggest
events in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   So even if the boys of Toms River never won the World Series,
never stood next to the Yankees at the Stadium and never make the
majors, they won't forget their Little League days. Still, it makes
you wonder who some of them might be standing next to in 15 years.

 INSIDE THE MIND OF NORTH KOREA'S `DEAR LEADER'

<TEXT>
<P>
   So I finally got the world's attention! The United States and
Japan thought they could ignore me and _ kersplash _ I send one
missile shooting over Japan, and finally they look in my direction.
Ha! Maybe I should do this more often!
</P>
<P>
   And then they call me irrational. Can't they see that this was
the only rational thing to do? If I didn't scare them every now and
then, they would ignore me totally and I'd be like Fidel Castro, a
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Look at me! The imperialists tried to bully me back in 1994,
telling me I had to stop my nuclear program. But I was ready to go
to war with them, and so they decided to save lives and chicken
out. We reached a big agreement: I would freeze my program and the
Americans and the other countries would give me free heating oil
and build me a $4 billion light-water nuclear reactor. You've got
to be pushy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Americans tried to double-cross me. Despite their
agreement, they wouldn't lift most of their sanctions, they lagged
in building the new reactor, they delayed shipping me oil and they
didn't even think about normalizing relations.
</P>
<P>
   I was ready to get rid of my whole missile program in exchange
for the right payoff, but they wouldn't cough up the kind of dough
I was talking about. They wouldn't pay me money and they wouldn't
pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now maybe they'll pay something! If my nuclear program got
them to give me a $4 billion reactor and free oil, think what my
missile program should be worth _ especially since the CIA thinks I
still have a few nukes that I just might figure out how to attach
to a missile. The imperialists were worried about my old Nodong
missiles, which couldn't even reach Tokyo. Well, they missed a
bargain. Now they'll have to pay billions for my program, because I
can take out anything in Japan. And if my engineers can improve the
booster rocket, I'll be able to reach Alaska and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK, I know the missiles are hopelessly inaccurate. But so
what if I aim for the Yankee base at Yokosuka and hit Tokyo
instead? It just makes the Japanese more nervous than ever. And
their fear is what gives me bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, and think of all that free advertising I got. The Syrians
and Iranians see Secretary of State yapping puppy Albright denounce
my missiles, and they'll pay more than ever. I'll get paid off one
way or another; by the Yankees for giving up my missile program or
by the Syrians and Iranians for continuing it. These two-stage
rockets can deliver a one-ton payload more than 1,000 miles, and
Israel will be in the bombsights.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, my Foreign Ministry is whining these days. The
diplomats say we may have overplayed our hand, and they're worried
now that Japan has cut off aid and flights to our country, now that
the Yankee Congress is sniveling about whether to back away from
the 1994 nuclear agreement. Huh! Wimps!
</P>
<P>
   Washington will come through because it knows that it would be
risking war if it didn't. Sure, I would lose. But I've got one
thing in my favor: 10 million people within artillery range. Seoul
will be a sea of flames. I have the guts to fight to lose, but the
Yankees don't have the stomach to fight to win.
</P>
<P>
   The imperialists don't really think I'd level Seoul, but they
can't be sure. Sometimes it pays to be perceived as irrational, and
sending a missile racing over Japan just adds to my credibility as
a maniac. (And wasn't it a nice touch when we said later that the
missile launched a scientific satellite transmitting immortal
revolutionary hymns?)
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, sure, if the Yankees do cut off aid, then that will
make it tougher here. But when things get really desperate, people
will come running with aid. If people go hungry here, then the
pressure is on Washington and Tokyo, not me.
</P>
<P>
   I love to read what these foreign analysts say. They think North
Korea is falling apart. It's just like those foreigners who thought
China was falling apart in the early 1950's. But hunger doesn't
make people rebel; it just makes them die.
</P>
<P>
   In China, 30 million people died in Mao Zedong's famine of the
early 1960's; there wasn't a peep of protest. Then Deng Xiaoping
gave the Chinese people pork and rice and they tried to stage a
revolution against him at Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   I'll never make that mistake. I know that contact with
barbarians or, worse, bourgeois democracy, destabilizes a country.
I'll never open up my country the way Deng did.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrogant foreigners think they can make life hard on us
and change us. This is Korea! We're not weaklings. If we were
compromisers our nation would have been absorbed by China or Japan
a thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years ago, King Yongjo knew his son would be a
terrible heir, so he locked the weeping young man in a box in the
courtyard and left him to die. It took 13 days. That's the
toughness that it takes to be a king of Korea, and I've got that
toughness.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean puppets have lost their strength, and we in the
North are the only real Koreans left. That's why we have restored a
dynasty, just like the ancients. My father died four years ago, and
the foreigners all puzzled about why I didn't fill the vacancy and
whether that meant I was weak. Don't they know about filial piety?
If they had read Korean history, they would have known that a good
Korean prince waits several years before succeeding his father. I'm
not a communist. I'm a Confucian.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is my turn to succeed my father as president and party
leader. I'll reform the economy and try to rely more on the market
mechanism, because that's the only thing that works. But I'll never
open up this country. I'll never risk losing control.
</P>
<P>
   I will stand up to the foreigners and my people will stand
behind me, as long as they have the strength to stand. I need
enemies more than I need friends.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, what a lovely missile that was. It made me a few more
enemies. They can despise me, insult me. But they'll have to
respect me.
</P>
<P>
   Poor little Castro. I should sell him a missile or two to launch
over Florida. Then he would get some respect as well, and maybe
some American foreign aid.

 LONELY STANDS ON CAPITOL HILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, September(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By ADAM CLYMER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman uncomfortably cast himself in
one of the capital's classic roles Thursday, going to the floor and
demanding ``some measure of public rebuke'' for President Clinton,
an old friend and ally, for his admission of an inappropriate
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While it was early to talk of
impeachment or resignation, he said, Clinton's conduct ``had
diminished the office he holds'' and was ``reinforcing one of the
worst messages being delivered by our popular culture, which is
that values are fungible.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Washington's favorite images is that of the courageous
senator (why is it almost never a representative?) who breaks with
his party _ or with his president _ for the greater good of the
nation. John F. Kennedy wrote about eight of them in ``Profiles in
Courage,'' most of them from the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   It has happened more recently. In August 1974, Barry Goldwater,
Hugh Scott and John Rhodes (who actually WAS a representative) told
Richard M. Nixon it was time to quit, and he did. But that came
after almost every Nixon defender had left the sinking ship. Early
warnings from two Republican senators, Edward Brooke, a
Massachusetts liberal, and James Buckley, a New York conservative,
had no impact on Nixon's determination.
</P>
<P>
   If one seeks the critical moment in the saga of Watergate, it
was not a speech but the October 1973 firing of Special Prosecutor
Archibald Cox and the consequent firestorm of protest that fatally
weakened the president.
</P>
<P>
   An even slower political death came to Sen. Joseph McCarthy of
Wisconsin. It was June 1, 1950, when his fellow Republican,
Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, said in her first major speech that
the Senate had been ``debased to the level of a forum of hate and
character assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was four years before the Senate mustered the courage to
condemn the communist-hunter who gave his name to irresponsible
investigations that ignore the rights of individuals. The most
effective words came in a Senate committee room in June 1954.
Lawyer Joseph Welch protested the senator's attacks on a junior
attorney and said: ``Let us not assassinate this lad further,
Senator. You've done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir? At
long last, have you left no sense of decency?''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's attack is most striking because he is among a
handful of senators who are politically close to Clinton. The two
Democrats who followed Lieberman to the floor to praise his
remarks, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, are hardly friends of the president. Clinton, responding
Friday, said, ``I can't disagree with anyone else who wants to be
critical of what I have already acknowledged was indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Lewinsky scandal broke in January, Washington
pundits have been saying that the time might come when Democratic
elders went down to the White House to tell Clinton that, for the
party's sake, he should begin to pack.
</P>
<P>
   One difficulty with this vision is that there is only a handful
of Democrats on whom the president relies, and from whom he might
take such a message seriously. They include former Sen. David Pryor
and Sen. Dale Bumpers, two Arkansans; Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle; Sen. Edward Kennedy, Vice President Al Gore and
fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe _ along with Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the conflicted Connecticut senator, the others have
largely kept their own counsel or adopted some version of the party
line that says the American people want Washington to forget about
scandal and deal with campaign finance laws, education or abuses by
health care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   That does remain the clear reading of the polls, though it's
been nearly two weeks since the summer's incessant sampling last
produced a public result _ an August 23 ABC News Poll showing
two-thirds of the public did not want Clinton to resign or to be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress occasionally does step out ahead of public opinion,
and that is plainly what Lieberman thought was his duty. His impact
is far less certain.
</P>
<P>
   After all, there were some strong Republican voices in January
1987 demanding that President Ronald Reagan take the blame for the
Iran-Contra mess. Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, for example,
said, ``The people just hope they don't find out the president
wasn't telling them the whole truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Congress did not test the president's veracity,
and as far as he was concerned, the case blew over.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a displaced stone can start a political landslide.
Sometimes it just falls by itself. &QL;

RUSSIA'S RETREAT FROM THE WEST By Martin Malia - an Op-Ed from The
New York Times - 800 words The only certainty in Russia's present
crisis is that it marks the end of an era - the Yeltsin years for
sure and quite probably the end of the theory, widely trumpeted
just a decade ago, that market democracy has triumphed as a
universal ideal. The author, professor emeritus of history at the
University of California at Berkeley, discusses other social models
that Russia may follow now that Yeltsin's has failed. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------2. AS THE CRISIS
WORSENS, RUSSIA NEEDS A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL SALVATION By MIKHAIL
GORBACHEV - updated version The presidents of the United States and
Russia, who recently met in Moscow, are both in trouble. Some have
called their meeting a lame-duck summit. Nevertheless, dialogue
must not be broken off, particularly at such a difficult time.
----------------------------------------------------------------3.
RUSSIA MAY YET HAVE A CHARISMATIC LEADER By Aileen Kelly - an Op-Ed
from The New York Times - 800 words In the 1920s, philosopher
Bertrand Russell confided that, horrible though the Bolshevik
dictatorship was, it seemed the best sort of system for that
country. As Russia spins out of control, many Western leaders echo
Russell's view and yearn for a strong hand to arrest the chaos... 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------4. THE CULT OF JOYCE
MAYNARD By LARISSA MacFARQUHAR From The New York Times Magazine
Joyce Maynard has written about everything from her messy divorce
to her breast implants - and now there's a detailed account of her
youthful affair with J.D. Salinger. The literati may be appalled,
but her devoted fans relish every word.
----------------------------------------------------------------5.
A FUTURE WITHOUT DISEASE From Der Spiegel (English translation) -
1.900 words In this in-depth interview, American molecular
biologist Craig Venter talks about his plans to sequence the human
genome in three years and about selling gene and the dangers of
genetic omniscience. ``The drive to be successful is just one of my
genetic defects'' he says.
----------------------------------------------------------------6.
WHAT DRIVES KEN STARR By MICHAEL WINERIP From The New York Times
Magazine With another special prosecutor, things might have turned
out differently. As it is, Ken Starr's character has forever
changed President Clinton's destiny. Is it true that the Ken we see
now is not the Ken Starr some people once knew? Is there really a
new Ken Starr? .
----------------------------------------------------------------7.
THE ZOMBIE WITHIN By Bob Holmes from New Scientist
</P>
<P>
   Although a metaphor, the word zombie is increasingly being used
by psychologists and neuroscientists to capture a division in our
mental life that is at one level mundane, and at another, deeply
strange. The division is between what your conscious self sees,
smells and hears as you go about your daily life and what your
brain and body unconsciously register is ``out there'' and needs
dealing with. The two are not always the same. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------8. A SLEEPING STORM By
Carl Zimmer From Discover - 1.700 words Sleeping sickness - once
thought to be fading into oblivion - is raging back across Africa.
At the center of the epidemic, an American doctor is trying to
clear a small patch of good health.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Does Russia matter any more? It is tempting to say no. Once a
superpower with a mighty military machine and a driving belief in
its destiny as the only great nation straddling Europe and Asia,
its economy is now on a par-- in size if not quality -- with
Spain's and only two-thirds as big, by some measures, as
Indonesia's.
</P>
<P>
   Good riddance, then, to the pretensions of a once-proud nation?
And good riddance to its once-heroic but fast-crumbling leader,
Boris Yeltsin?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite yet. Russia still matters hugely by virtue of its
sheer geographical size, lumbering across 11 time zones, with a
large and well-educated population of 147 million, and endowed with
the richest natural resources in the world.
</P>
<P>
   That its human and material potential remains so vast only makes
its latest plunge to ruin all the more regrettable. And it still
boasts an array of nuclear weapons, some of which, though unlikely
to be used, could yet be lost as internal chaos spreads. Meanwhile,
its capacity for political mischief is immense.
</P>
<P>
   As for Yeltsin, his era is drawing to an early close, whether or
not he formally bows out. His second term of office has been little
short of disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   But, given the grisly list of flawed candidates who might
replace him, he may be able to perform one last service -- by
hanging on as a last-gasp president to give a breathing space for a
new order, one with parliament and a coalition government making
the running, that might halt the slide into total anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, something nastily authoritarian, perhaps even a
thoroughgoing tyranny, could ensue.
</P>
<P>
   The West's ability to help shape a better Russia -- whether
economically or politically -- is limited, as President Bill
Clinton no doubt ascertained during his visit to Moscow this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is one area where America and its European friends can
continue to make a difference: security. American efforts to cajole
Russia into signing the START-2 nuclear arms-cutting treaty, held
up by a recalcitrant Duma, need to go on. In its own interests, the
West should go on buying up surplus nuclear material and ensuring,
by bribery if need be, that underpaid Russian scientists do not
sell their skills to rogue countries trying to build nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   On a more conventional plane, as the delicate business of NATO's
enlargement proceeds, the alliance needs to offer every sort of
inducement to Russia to maintain and extend the sort of cooperative
partnership that is already under way.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it must be made plain, to whomever rules in
the Kremlin, that any Russian bullying of small neighbors such as
the Baltics or bigger ones like Ukraine will not be tolerated. As
Russia wobbles, the West must try harder to bolster the countries
on Russia's fringes.
</P>
<P>
   For all these reasons, even if Russia turns sulkily inward, it
must be kept as strategically engaged with the West as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In economics, the kind of engagement of recent years must,
perforce, cease. For the time being at least, Russia has forfeited
hopes for help. The West took a big but reasonable gamble by
lending money to Russia when it was led by a team of reformers
trying to do roughly the right thing. But the Russians have now
flouted just about every condition for getting help from outside.
</P>
<P>
   When, in its own good time, Russia has made real reforms and
something of a civic order, built a tax base and solid
institutions, and learned that honesty in business pays, then the
West should come back in. Not now. And things may well have to get
a lot worse before then.
</P>
<P>
   It is even less wise for the West to play politics: picking
Russian winners is a fool's lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The real reformers -- the likes of Boris Nemtsov, who sadly
failed to achieve much in Russia's recent string of
down-the-rabbit-hole governments -- are simply not going to be
elected. Their sponsorship by the West could make them even more
disliked.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if elections to parliament and the presidency were held
tomorrow, none of the possible winners -- Communists in league with
nationalists, crony-capitalists, ex-military strongmen -- would be
able to save Russia from further ruin. And the drift during the
three months that would have to elapse before people got to the
polls could harm Russia further.
</P>
<P>
   Better, perhaps, if a government of national unity could be
cobbled together, including the Communists, so that an
all-but-neutered Yeltsin and it is to be hoped a more responsible
parliament could stagger on.
</P>
<P>
   Russians, however, may think otherwise; and one could hardly
blame them.

IS THE GLOBAL ECONOMY HEADING FOR A MELTDOWN?

<TEXT>
<P>
   The global economic crisis continues to deepen. The latest
horror, Russia's collapse, may be insignificant judged by that
economy's puny weight in the world, but it was nonetheless a
turning-point: the sickness that started in Asia is spreading
still, claiming victims far beyond its source.
</P>
<P>
   Investors cannot find time to count their mounting losses, so
busy are they trying to guess where the plague will strike next.
The recent extraordinary (and mainly downward) gyrations in
stockmarkets bear witness to the new surge of fright and
confusion_and to mounting concern that the turmoil in emerging
markets will end in worldwide depression.
</P>
<P>
   It is a time when anyone would be grateful for reassurance. Yet
the best the world's leaders could do was a tragicomic meeting of
Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, the first destroyed by political
enemies and forces beyond his control, the other crippled by his
own weakness of character. Was ever a ``summit'' so likely to be
prologue to disaster?
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the early 1980s, global slump is a
thinkable, even plausible, outcome. Indeed, in some ways the danger
now is greater than it was then. Much of the world is already deep
in recession; the chances are that the worst is not yet over for
many big emerging-market economies (as we will continue to call
them for now), not to mention for a handful of rich-country
commodity producers, whose export revenues have crashed.
</P>
<P>
   What mainly stands between the world and an economic setback
worse than anything since the Great Depression of the 1930s is the
present momentum of growth in America (above all) and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Can that momentum be relied upon? Mid-week, Wall Street stood
some 15 percent lower than at its peak in July. Yet at these prices
American equities are still dear.
</P>
<P>
   If the market were to fall another 20 percent, say, the shock to
American consumers might be enough to bring the country's long
expansion to an end. With it would go any hope that the United
States could pull the world out of its troubles.
</P>
<P>
   With luck that will not happen. With luck Wall Street will take
its losses and stabilize. And if share prices do fall further, or
if demand in America slows abruptly for some other reason,
effective remedial action is still possible: the Fed could cut
interest rates (as it did, too much so as it turned out, after the
stockmarket crash of 1987) or Congress could cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, to get from here to recession in America, and
thence to global slump, is likely to require not just bad fortune
but also bad judgment. Perhaps that thought is not as consoling as
it should be: when things get tough, judgment all too often seems
to go out of the window.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly dangerous, though by no means unexpected, form of
bad judgment is abroad just now. It is the kind that says: ``See,
that's what free-market capitalism does for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Using more or less those words, Malaysia's leader, Mahathir
Mohamad, announced Sept. 1 a bold initiative to put the country on
the path to recovery: an array of severe controls on cross-border
flows of capital. Malaysia must insulate itself from the global
market, he said; it will no longer place its fate in the hands of
currency speculators.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the answer? In the past few weeks, the pundit consensus,
such as it is, has swung behind the idea that ``capital controls''
make sense. Unfortunately, as it stands, this is hardly more
illuminating than it would be to say ``monetary policy makes
sense.'' As with many things, it depends what you mean.
</P>
<P>
   At one extreme, governments might try merely to regulate their
banks' exposure to currency risk: whether that is ``capital
controls'' or ``prudential supervision'' is a question of semantics
over which there is no need to shed ideological blood.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme is a conscientious attempt to create a kind
of financial autarky, a space in which the government can steal and
squander its citizens' wealth without the inconvenience of allowing
them any alternative.
</P>
<P>
   When the range of possibilities runs so widely, from the
defensible to the insane, it is well to make some careful
distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's plan appears to be somewhat toward the crazy end of
the spectrum. By trying so hard to discourage capital outflows, the
government could end up, net, increasing them.
</P>
<P>
   Draconian capital controls do not stop capital flight (Latin
America in the 1980s, passim); what they may well stop is private
capital inflows -- and not just the volatile, short-term sort. An
abrupt and exaggerated slowing of inflows brought Malaysia and the
other ex-tigers to their present state. The best way back includes
a resumption of those inflows. Mahathir seems to be ruling this
out.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, a lot of hard thinking needs to be done about
the international financial system -- and, even more important,
about the domestic financial systems of emerging economies that
wish to avail themselves of the global capital market. Although the
economic pain that is being inflicted on Russia and the ex-tigers
is out of all proportion to the policy errors of their governments,
the fact remains that the vulnerability to financial crisis was
created not by international speculators and other bogeymen but by
woefully inadequate oversight of domestic finance, private, public
and quasi-public.
</P>
<P>
   But the governments concerned were not the only ones who failed
to realize that. They had many willing helpers in screwing things
up. There is plenty of blame to go around.
</P>
<P>
   As for the sentiment that it is not merely the international
capital market but the basic principles of capitalist economics
that need to be questioned, one can only despair that the thought
has even surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, China and India, which for years have been far less
connected to the global capitalist system than South Korea and the
others, have fared much better in this crisis. There are doubtless
lessons to be learned from this. But can it seriously be contended
that they chose the right path? Even if the tigers' troubles get
much, much worse before they get better, China and India after
their years of relative isolation will still be far, far poorer at
the end of it all.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the task now is to ensure that things do not in
fact get much worse. The heaviest burden of responsibility lies
with Japan, whose government could do a great deal to make the
world a safer place if at long last it took steps to repair its
broken banks, and began to act as a stabilizer for Asia (as the
United States was for Mexico after the peso crisis of 1995).
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, unless demand slows enough in America to justify
action by the Fed (which hasn't happened yet), it is a question of
avoiding mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   That should not be too difficult. Yet Malaysia has already made
one big error. And quite soon America's Congress threatens to make
another -- by failing, out of a mixture of exhaustion and
disapproval, to replenish the IMF's depleted resources.
</P>
<P>
   Two varieties of economic isolationism, of hoping that the world
and its troubles will go away. Come to think of it, there was a lot
of that in the 1930s.

<P>
   ``Day five: strike cost update for September 2, 1998,'' screamed
the full-page advertisement by Northwest Airlines: ``$350 million
to the US economy and counting . . . `` If clever publicity wins
the public's hearts and minds, then Northwest's management, despite
laying off 27,500 of the company's 50,000 workers on the very same
day, have probably won.
</P>
<P>
   The 6,200 pilots who walked off on August 29 have lost almost
regardless of the strike's outcome. After all, the average American
worker's annual salary is around $28,200 for working 40 hours a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the scathing question from the management's August 31
advertisement: ``$150,000 a year for 14 days of work per month. So
why are the pilots striking?''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots' reply, scarcely heard against management's louder
voice, was that they were seeking to recover what they had given up
five years ago -- some $365 million in wages and other concessions
-- as Northwest flirted with bankruptcy. Having ``shared the
pain'', they now wanted to ``share the gain'' of their airline's
subsequent four years of record earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Others will conclude that the Northwest strike is part of a
pattern -- witness last year's strike against United Parcel
Service, and this summer's strike at General Motors -- in which
American workers are taking advantage of sustained economic growth
and a tight labour market to extract higher wages, to the eventual
detriment of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   They see similar evidence of workers' muscle-flexing in last
July's two-day general strike in Puerto Rico, designed to protest
against the privatization of the island's telephone company and the
job losses the unions assume will follow.
</P>
<P>
   They make a tempting argument. Unemployment at some 4.5 percent
of the workforce, is at its lowest for a generation; labor-force
participation, at just over 67 percent, is at a record high, thanks
to the creation of 11 million more jobs than there were five years
ago; and still the nation's employers, whether they are selling
software or hamburgers, complain they cannot get workers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the argument is surely misleading. The tally of strikes
involving 1,000 or more workers last year reached 29, the lowest
since World War II and one-eighth the level of two decades ago.
This year, labor experts expect an even smaller total.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, union membership is stagnant at some 14 percent of
the workforce, compared with 35 percent in the 1950s. The
Employment Policy Foundation (EPF), a Washington think-tank,
calculates that if they are to keep their share of the workforce,
the unions will have to increase their present membership by
200,000 a year (which will also mean stopping average membership
losses of 110,000 a year).
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, says the EPF's chief economist, Kenneth Deavers,
there is no pattern of union activism: the strikes are all
``one-off events''.
</P>
<P>
   He may well be right. The cynical view of last year's strike at
UPS is that it had more to do with boosting the Teamsters' boss,
Ron Carey (since dismissed for corrupt practices), than securing
better terms for UPS workers. By contrast, the GM strike, which
lasted 54 days and cost $2.2 billion in lost sales, was a
straightforward battle by the United Auto Workers to slow the pace
of restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Northwest dispute, some observers trace it not just
to the 1993 agreement (in which the pilots' wage concessions were
alleviated by the award of stock in the company and a seat on the
board) but to dislike of the abrasive style of Al Checchi, chairman
until last year, before his quixotic decision to run for governor
of California.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, say the union-bashers, if there is a pattern, it
is chiefly one of continued union decline. Bosses are no longer
easily intimidated; more small firms, which tend not to be
unionized, are being bred than big ones; and the economy's gravity
is shifting geographically to the union-hostile South and West, and
sectorally from manufacturing, the traditional stronghold of the
unions, to service industries which think them irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what do strikers win? Deavers and his colleagues
calculate that it will take a full-time employee of UPS five years
to recover what he lost during the strike; the part-timers will
never make up their losses. In a report released last month, the
EPF calculated that in 18 strikes between 1985 and 1996, lasting
between five and 70 days, most of the strikers would never recoup
their lost pay in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   Should the AFL-CIO, the unions' umbrella organization, therefore
be downhearted? Not necessarily. Ron Blackwell, its director of
corporate affairs, argues that ``the pattern is fewer strikes but
better strikes'' which, by raising workers' wages, actually force
companies to take ``a high road to competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the AFL-CIO and its sympathizers can produce figures
to show that the average worker has lost out during seven years of
sustained economic growth. Only in the past two years, for example,
have wages begun to increase in real terms, and one study to be
released next week reckons that the real earnings of the median
worker last year were still 3.1 percent lower than in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, over that same period the remuneration package for
the average chief executive doubled to a level 116 times that of
the average worker.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when the unions are in decline and the economy
still seems robust, can labor still make its voice heard
politically?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it can. As last year's inquiry into campaign finance
depressed business contributions to the Democrats, so the party
became more reliant on the support of the unions. This year, with
the Lewinsky saga gnawing at the party's reputation, the reliance
is even greater -- and will especially benefit Dick Gephardt and
President Bill Clinton's other opponents on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is one small puzzle. Why has Clinton, who last
year ordered a 60-day ``cooling-off'' period when American
Airlines' pilots threatened to strike, been so reluctant to make a
similar intervention in the Northwest strike (his transport
secretary, Rodney Slater, has merely been getting both sides to
give him their views)? After all, not only is the airline America's
biggest freight-carrier to Asia, but it is the only convenient air
access for big swathes of the mid-west.
</P>
<P>
   The cynical answer is that the Northwest board includes
Democratic luminaries: not just Checchi, but also Richard Blum, the
husband of California's Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   The more likely explanation is that, with Asian trade down and
with other carriers able to take up any slack, Northwest's absence
will have little effect on traffic between America and Asia;
whereas several Latin American and Caribbean countries pointed out
to Clinton the economic harm they would suffer if American Airlines
could no longer serve their region.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sign of the times that many Americans will prefer the
cynical answer.

<P>
   Bill Clinton picked a bad week to visit Russia, but for the past
thousand years or so Russia has rarely had a good week.
</P>
<P>
   The visit was planned months ago as a way for Clinton to provide
comfort for the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, and to signal
American support for Russia as a more or less normal country with a
few passing problems of governance.
</P>
<P>
   However brief Clinton's stay, he must have noticed that Russia
was far from normal, its problems far from passing, and its
president far from comfortable in any sense of that word.
</P>
<P>
   In the preceding two weeks Russia had defaulted on much of its
debt and let the ruble collapse, roughly halving in value. Yeltsin
had sacked his government for a second time in six months, leaving
Russia temporarily without one.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's arrival interrupted Yeltsin's efforts to install a new
prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin -- the same man he had sacked,
eccentrically, in March. The appointment needs approval from the
Duma, the Communist-dominated lower house of parliament -- it
rejected Chernomyrdin at the beginning of the week and postponed a
second vote on the nomination until next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duma rejects Chernomyrdin three times, Yeltsin is obliged
to dissolve it and call fresh parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   But many in the Duma clearly thought it was time for Yeltsin
himself to go, and that Russia should hold a presidential election
instead.
</P>
<P>
   If Yeltsin does decide to go -- he is chronically sick, confused
and reclusive, and has no hope of winning a third term when his
present one expires in 2000 -- he will leave a devalued legacy
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 he engineered the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
birth of a new, democratic Russia. But seven years later the
Russian state consists of a few shallowly rooted institutions -- a
presidency, a parliament, a central bank and so on -- which have
yet to earn public trust, and which are dwarfed by an impenetrable
and antique hinterland of cynicism, incompetence, racketeering and
bureaucratic dead weight.
</P>
<P>
   Weak and corrupt government means that Russia has no rule of
law. There is no local investment, only capital flight.
Manufacturing industry and agriculture are dying, though commerce
survives. Public services are minimal, often criminal.
</P>
<P>
   There are pockets of brilliance and generosity to be found, but
only amid a wasteland of misery and poverty, ugliness and
pollution, created partly by the builders of communism, partly by
its collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The dream survives, in Russia and elsewhere, that the new Russia
can somehow be induced to behave like a modern western country with
a modern western government.
</P>
<P>
   One day the dream may even come true. But for most practical
purposes the hopes of the West to that effect have been bound up
closely with the person of Yeltsin, and they have been waning along
with Yeltsin himself.
</P>
<P>
   Since his re-election in 1996 the president has undergone a
sharp political, moral, physical and intellectual decline. Whereas
once he looked reasonably sure of an honored place in history as
the man who led Russia from dictatorship into democracy, history
seems lately to have been sizing him up for a much less attractive
role: as the man who caused democracy to fail in Russia through his
own arrogance and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   If his first term had its ups and downs, his second has been a
fiasco from the start. He suffered one or two serious heart attacks
during the election campaign in June 1996, and disappeared
immediately after his inauguration for a quintuple heart-bypass
operation. It was deemed a clinical success, but the patient never
quite recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has come into the Kremlin only rarely (even during this
crisis), and with hindsight he might have done better to stay away
altogether. His capacity for misjudgment touched bottom -- or so it
must be hoped -- five months ago when he sacked Chernomyrdin, his
prime minister of more than five years' standing, out of sheer
pique, and with no replacement prime minister in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin sensed that Chernomyrdin was coveting the presidency for
himself -- hobnobbing with other world leaders on foreign trips,
cultivating ties with Russian financiers, planning for an
anticipated succession if Yeltsin's health collapsed entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The president was accurate in his assessment, but foolish in his
response. In place of Chernomyrdin he lighted on an unknown called
Sergei Kiriyenko, then only 35, who had barely a year's experience
in national politics. He was not without intelligence, but was
wholly without authority.
</P>
<P>
   His installation coincided with financial crises in other
emerging markets and a slump in Russian oil revenues. The result
was a rapid erosion of confidence in the Russian ruble, in the
Russian banking system, and in the creditworthiness of the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
   For Yeltsin, the worst of all worlds has followed. He has been
obliged to sack Kiriyenko and recall Chernomyrdin. He has been
under pressure from the Duma and from Chernomyrdin to surrender
some of his sweeping powers. His reputation and economic
achievements -- a stable ruble was, briefly, their crowning glory
-- are in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   For Russia too it has already been a rough ride. The question
now is whether even more wretched social and political consequences
can be avoided: whether serious unrest might finally erupt among
the poor, perhaps even among the army; whether Yeltsin can be
prevailed upon to resign; and, if so, whether his successor would
be found through constitutional, democratic means.
</P>
<P>
   Those are horrible questions to be haunting any country. But
they follow directly from failings in Yeltsin's character that were
either known or predictable when he was re-elected in 1996. He had
a history of illness. He had a history of cronyism. He had a
history of emotional and arbitrary behavior probably linked to
excessive drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Those were all factors in his decision to invade Chechnya in
December 1994, which, as a display of his capacity for stupidity
and even wickedness, should have been unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all that, Russians elected Yeltsin 18 months later,
and the West supported him financially and politically. They did so
because, though the prospect of a Yeltsin victory was unattractive
in many ways, the alternative was much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was the only non-Communist candidate capable of carrying
the election. Had the Communist candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, won
instead, Russian finances would have collapsed in 24 hours, not 24
months. And they would have done so with substantially less chance
of revival.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it would have been better if Russian finances had not
collapsed at all; if the economy had started growing durably; if
living standards had risen as Yeltsin promised they would do.

   RUSSIA-CRISIS _ MOSCOW _ As Russia's economy continued to
unravel, acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin again was
rejected by the Communist-led Duma, prolonging the country's
political crisis even as the ruble fell to new lows. Chernomyrdin
warned that the country was ``on the verge of a precipice'' and
President Boris Yeltsin offered new concessions in an unsuccessful
attempt to win support for his choice to lead a new government, a
sign that the Kremlin is growing increasingly worried about its
grip on power. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   MOTT-SUGAR _ CLEWISTON, Fla. _ Meet the United States Sugar
Corp., the small-town company that's one of America's biggest
producers of sugar and orange juice. Now meet the Charles Stewart
Mott Foundation of Flint, Mich., the country's 15th-largest
enterprise of its kind as of 1995. The Mott foundation gives away
up to $72 million a year, gets the president's attention and sits
on $58 million worth of U.S. Sugar stock, making the charity one of
the sugar company's biggest stockholders. Those holdings also make
the sugar company stock one of the charity's biggest assets. The
two entities even share a chairman. But at times, their interests
conflict. An examination of this strange relationship. (Peltz, Palm
Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   MOTT-SUGAR-ECCENTRIC _ Charles Stewart Mott once, the story
goes, changed a 30-watt refrigerator bulb to 15 watts to save
electricity. That might not have been unusual for someone who'd
endured the Great Depression. But Mott, creator of what became the
country's 15th-largest charitable foundation, was then considered
one of the richest men in the United States. But C.S. Mott was as
generous as he was thrifty. (Peltz, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   MOTT-SUGAR-GLADES _ BELLE GLADE, Fla. _ In 62 years, the Charles
Stewart Mott Foundation has spent $1.1 million in the sugar-farming
area that provides much significant share of the foundation's
money. (Peltz, Palm Beach Post)

   NC-CLINTON _ CLINTON, N.C. _ Talker on Clinton, N.C., and what

<P>
   WEBVOTE _ ATLANTA _ Harlan Barnes, son of Georgia Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Roy Barnes, is in charge of computer
operations (including the campaign Web site) for his father's
campaign. This election year, it's seems almost every candidate has
a Web site. Story looks at Internet campaigning, how effective it
is, what works and what doesn't. (Walston, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

   SCI-BIRDS-RETURN (New York) _ In the last two decades,
undeterred by PCBs, noise, smells and other pollutants, exploding
populations of herons and egrets, glossy ibises and double-crested
cormorants have joined the ubiquitous gulls that call the New York
harbor home. Although to humans several of the harbor islands and
their environs may look like slums, to the birds they resemble an
Everglades paradise, replete with food and nesting sites and free
of threats from people, raccoons and most other predators. By Jane
E. Brody. (2,000 words)

<P>
   SCI-ABUSE-VERACITY (Undated) _ After a spate of child abuse
cases, perhaps 500 studies have been conducted on children's
``suggestibility'' _ the extent to which suggestions implanted by
adult interviewers can influence children's recollections and
accounts. As a result, researchers describe an emerging consensus
over how children should be interviewed to minimize false reports.

   SCI-SOCIAL-WORMS (Undated) _ Scientists have discovered a gene

<P>
   SCI-1918FLU (Undated) _ Members of an exhumation project in
Spitsbergen, Norway, digging for samples of the virus that caused
the 1918 flu pandemic believe they may have found what they were
looking for. But not without problems. The bodies were buried in
shallow graves and were not protected year-round by the permafrost.
The decay will make the detective work all the more difficult.
Researchers hope to use the results to help forestall future
epidemics and to treat against the virus. By John Noble Wilford.

   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Last week's announcement that the Food
and Drug Administration is recommending approval of the drug
tamoxifen to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer provides
another _ though imperfect _ hormone replacement option for
high-risk women. Though it has its drawbacks, this so-called
``designer estrogen'' also offers women who take it an opportunity
to glean some of the benefits of estrogen replacement, such as
reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. By Jane E. Brody. (1375

EVEN PRIVATELY OWNED FORESTS NEED FEDERAL OVERSIGHT

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two-thirds of America's forest lands are owned by local, state
or private entities. Recently, the well-respected National Research
Council released a report calling for a national policy to help
maintain these important non-federal forest lands. The report hit
the hot button for Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, and he has called for
its total rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Young is overreacting to this thrust for forest
conservation. He receives a large chunk of his campaign
contributions from the timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council is an independent body that was
organized by the National Academy of Sciences back in 1916 _ during
World War I _ to promote the national security and welfare of the
nation using scientific and technological expertise. The council is
administered by the National Academy of Sciences, the National
Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 council report, ``Forested Landscapes in Perspective:
Prospects and Opportunities for Sustainable Management of America's
Nonfederal Forests'' took two years to research and write and makes
a number of recommendations to ensure the long-term health of these
forest lands.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recommendations encroach upon private ownership _
causing Young to see red. He sent letters to 300 timber industry
executives alerting them to the report, and included his staff's
unfavorable analysis of it.
</P>
<P>
   Young's Aug. 11 letter overstates the report's conclusions:
``Basically, their (the report's authors) argument is that in the
name of `public interest' the federal government can do with your
private land as it pleases.'' Young uses his letter to urge timber
companies to politically support greater logging on federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   He's lobbying the timber industrys' lobbyists to support him in
his battle with the Clinton administration and against the new
direction taken by the U.S. Forest Service that no longer makes
logging a priority.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC report suggests the following key recommendations for
the federal government:
</P>
<P>
   _Strengthen programs that monitor non-federal forest health.
</P>
<P>
   _Provide greater assistance to states for wild-fire suppression
and fuel management technologies.
</P>
<P>
   _Establish a national policy for non-federal forests.
</P>
<P>
   _Identify national interests in non-federal forests and create a
strategic plan for federal action.
</P>
<P>
   _Establish partnerships with private forest landowners.
</P>
<P>
   _Create educational programs focused on non-federal forests.
</P>
<P>
   _Using fiscal and tax incentives, coordinate regulatory and
technical assistance programs for landowners with large tracts of
forest.
</P>
<P>
   _Use fiscal incentives and technical assistance to promote
sustainable non-federal forests.
</P>
<P>
   _Design regulatory programs that reflect public and private
rights, responsibilities and interests in maintaining healthy
private forest lands.
</P>
<P>
   The report's regulatory language dropped like a brick on Young's
knee, his leg kicked out: ``Imagine,'' he wrote in his letter to
timber industry executives, ``the red tape of a coercive federal
regulatory scheme being applied to your private property.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the nation needs to promote
sustainability in all forest lands. Our wildlife and watersheds
need protection on these 490 million acres of state and private
forest lands. Nearly 90 percent of threatened or endangered species
have habitat in these forests.
</P>
<P>
   If long-term forest health can be accomplished through
education, technical assistance and tax incentives _ without the
heavy hand of federal regulation _ the nation is richer _ including
the private forest owners.
</P>
<P>
   Tax and fiscal incentives can entice private owners to entered
into agreements with the federal government to use good management
practices in their forests. If these incentives are successful, the
short-term profit gained by clearcutting large tracts of land
gradually will be replaced by long-term goals that sustain profits
over decades and sustain healthy forest lands.
</P>
<P>
   A person who owns a house in a community does not have the right
to burn it down. Private ownership is not the issue _ public safety
is. The forests can be looked at the same way. Privately owned
forests are part of the larger forest ecology. Destructive forest
management practices put the nation at risk _ through soil erosion,
endangering water quality, destruction of watersheds and
elimination of wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Young could take a leadership role on this issue by accepting
and promoting some of the report's better recommendations and
criticizing those that would take an ax to private ownership.

   NEW YORK _ Break a leg, knock 'em in the aisles, stage-door
Johnny, stage mother, stage-struck, twofer, understudy ... much of
the language of the theater has become the language of the street.
But not all of it, and as the curtain rises on a new Broadway
season, it's a good chance to consider some of the most
enlightening theatrical terms.
</P>
<P>
   We'll do our considering from the topmost seating in the  &UR; house &LR; 
(meaning either the theater building itself or the people who pay
to enter it), up in the place the Brits call  &UR; the gods &LR;  but we feel
right at home in as the  &UR; peanut gallery &LR; . The origin is not that
the spectators looked, from the stage, as small as peanuts, but
rather that the audience in the cheapest seats often ate goobers.
(Way beneath us are the  &UR; mezzanine &LR;  (the first upper floor), the
 &UR; first balcony &LR;  (atop that) and then the  &UR; second balcony &LR;  (so close
you can hear the shells drop).
</P>
<P>
   The prize for the most colorful language probably goes to the
 &UR; juicers &LR;  and  &UR; gaffers &LR; . The  &UR; juicer &LR; , no surprise, is an
electrician who turns on the you-know-what. The  &UR; gaffer &LR;  has been
around considerably longer; for centuries the word has designated
the foreman of a stage crew. (In film and television, it has become
more specialized, meaning the head electrician.) The word
originated in the 16th century, used as an altered form of
 &UR; godfather &LR;  or  &UR; grandfather &LR; . In the 19th, a foreman or overseer
was called a  &UR; gaffer &LR; , particularly in Britain, as was a master
glassblower.
</P>
<P>
   Types of lighting equipment used on the stage and in film,
television and elsewhere range from  &UR; baby &LR; ,  &UR; junior &LR;  and  &UR; peewee &LR; 
to  &UR; brute &LR;  and  &UR; senior &LR; . The slang usually refers to the size or
other characteristics of the lamps, luminaries and luminants. For
example, a  &UR; brute &LR;  is a high-intensity arc spotlight. A  &UR; mini-
brute &LR;  is smaller and is used for supplementary illumination ( &UR; fill
light &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorites is an  &UR; inky dink &LR; ; also called  &UR; dinky inky &LR; 
or simply  &UR; inky &LR;  or  &UR; dinky &LR; . It's a small incandescent ( &UR; inky &LR; )
lamp.  &UR; Dinky &LR; , from the Scottish, means small.
</P>
<P>
   Others with illuminating derivations are  &UR; barn door &LR; ,  &UR; bazooka &LR; 
and  &UR; birdseye &LR; .  &UR; Barn doors &LR;  are hinged flaps or blinders on the
front of a spotlight to control the beam of light. They are also
called  &UR; flippers &LR;  or  &UR; shutters &LR; . A  &UR; bazooka &LR;  is a device on a
 &UR; catwalk &LR;  (a narrow elevated walkway or platform) to support
lighting units. Its origin is not as straightforward as that of the
 &UR; barn doors &LR; . World War II veterans remember the weapons that were
used to launch armor-piercing rockets. They were called  &UR; bazookas &LR; 
because of their resemblance to a horn popularized by the comedian
Bob Burns (1896-1956). Let's go further back. He named it after the
slang word  &UR; bazoo &LR;  (mouth or nose), which is probably from
 &UR; bazuin &LR; , the Dutch word for trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Birdseye &LR;  is surprising in its etymology. This spotlight with a
reflector back was invented by Clarence Birdseye (1886-1956), who
is better known for developing methods for quick-freezing foods.
Actually, it's a PAR light, short for  &UR; parabolic &LR; . The name is also
an acronym for  &UR; parabolic aluminized reflector &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Theater (and film) audiences are familiar with  &UR; fresnel &LR;  light
devices, since the name sometimes appears in the credits.  &UR; Fresnel &LR; 
lights have adjustable lenses in front of the bulb to concentrate
the light. They are named after Augustin Jean Fresnel (1788-1827),
a French physicist. For post-theater expositors, by the way, the
correct pronunciation is fray-nell or fruh-nell, not fres-nell.
</P>
<P>
   The two best-known names in lights are probably  &UR; Klieg &LR;  and
 &UR; Century &LR; . The powerful  &UR; klieg lights &LR;  are often used at premieres,
store openings and other events. These wide-angle carbon-arc lamps
were invented by John Kliegl (1869-1959) and his brother Arthur
(1872-1927).  &UR; Century lights &LR;  were made for many decades by Century
Lighting Co. and attached to a three-legged portable metal stand (a
 &UR; Century stand &LR; , generally called a  &UR; C-stand &LR; ) that is ubiquitous
in theaters and film studios.
</P>
<P>
   Some names of lights, of course, are used in everyday language.
A  &UR; spotlight &LR;  is a light with a directed beam, and to  &UR; spotlight &LR; 
is to focus or draw attention. Similarly, to  &UR; highlight &LR;  is to
emphasize.  &UR; Footlights &LR;  _ a row of lights along the front of a
stage _ are so common that the word often refers to the theatrical
field.
</P>
<P>
   To be in the  &UR; limelight &LR; , or center of attention, derives from
the brilliant lights of the same name. The origin is absolutely
literal:  &UR; Limelights &LR;  were stage lights in which lime (calcium
oxide) was heated to incandescence.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the names used by  &UR; gaffers &LR;  are simply shortened forms.
A  &UR; cookie &LR;  is a  &UR; cukaloris &LR; , which is a piece of netting or
cardboard with shapes cut out of it to cast patterns of light. A
 &UR; nookie &LR;  is a small light, and its origin is a small area or nook.
A  &UR; strobe &LR;  is a stroboscopic light that produces pulsating visual
effects (wanna disco?) and also is used to create the illusion of
movement ( &UR; strobe effect &LR; ). The Greek  &UR; strobos &LR;  means twisting
around. A  &UR; torm &LR;  spotlight is mounted on the side of a stage; its
name is from the  &UR; tormentor &LR; , which is a curtain or piece of
scenery on the side.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of  &UR; juicers &LR; , lighting  &UR; grips &LR;  (workers with firm grips
who carry or push dollies and other equipment) and other crew
members are old-timers who, alas, sometimes resort to sexist or
vulgar language. For example, at least for one that is suitable for
this page, an  &UR; emily &LR;  is a  &UR; broad &LR; , or floodlight, with one lamp,
which in turn makes it a  &UR; single broad &LR; . The term undoubtedly was
first used by a gaffer who had a friend named Emily.
</P>
<P>
   In the current ``environmental production'' of ``Cabaret,''
where the lights are back on after a construction accident turned
them off for 35 performances this summer, the theater has been
transformed into a nightclub evocative of 1930 Berlin. Lighting
really sets this stage, so Mike Baldassari, the co-lighting
designer, has even christened some of his new effects:
 &UR; Podunwarferstein &LR; , a Germanic old-fashioned contraption for
hanging lights;  &UR; Wikki &LR; , a move in which the  &UR; follow spot &LR;  operator
opens and closes the  &UR; iris &LR;  (the shutter in front of the spotlight)
in rapid succession, and  &UR; Jiffy &LR; , the panning and tilting that
create a three-dimensional  &UR; iris &LR;  effect.
</P>
<P>
   In the  &UR; house &LR;  of ``Cabaret,'' $80-a-ticket patrons watch from
nightclub tables. (The economy classes fill the balcony.) As yet,
Baldassari has not given the table lamps a name. Why not  &UR; eine
kleine Nightlampe &LR; ?

PERSONAL HEALTH: FINDING A REPLACEMENT FOR HORMONE REPLACEMENT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making an informed decision about whether to take replacement
hormones during and after menopause is hard enough for women with
no prior health problems. It is far more difficult for a woman who
has had breast cancer or who has a strong family history of this
most common cancer in women. Because estrogen can stimulate the
growth of a breast cancer, women and their physicians are
understandably reluctant to consider hormone replacement for
someone at high risk of developing a new or recurrent cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But this means that such women may miss important health
benefits of estrogen after menopause, among them a reduced risk of
heart disease, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease as well as
diminished menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats and
vaginal dryness.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's announcement that the Food and Drug Administration
is recommending approval of the drug tamoxifen to reduce the risk
of developing breast cancer provides another, though imperfect,
hormone replacement option for high-risk women. Though it has
drawbacks, this so-called ``designer estrogen'' also offers women
who take it an opportunity to glean some of the benefits of
estrogen replacement, such as reduced risk of cardiovascular
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But these questions remain: Can some former breast cancer
patients safely take hormone replacement, and if so, which ones?
Are there reasonable alternatives that will grant women at least
some of the benefits of estrogen without adding to their concerns
about developing a new or recurrent cancer?
</P>
<P>
   The answers concern 2.4 million American women, and millions
more worldwide, who have survived breast cancer, as well as those
at high risk of the disease.At a consensus conference last fall
sponsored by The Hormone Foundation, the Susan G. Komen Breast
Cancer Foundation and others, experts and patient advocates
concluded that treating menopausal symptoms and long-term health
risks in breast cancer patients should be ``tailored to individual
patients' needs'' and employ strategies that ``would avoid the use
of estrogen while providing its benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen plays a critical role in the initiation and/or
promotion of breast cancer. Many studies have shown that the longer
a woman's breast is exposed to high levels of estrogen, the greater
are her chances of eventually getting breast cancer. The cells of
most breast cancers have receptors for estrogen and respond to the
hormone's growth-stimulating effects. Patients with these cancers
are typically given treatments to block the effects of their own
estrogens.
</P>
<P>
   Recent findings strongly suggest that this increased risk
extends to postmenopausal women who take replacement hormones,
either estrogen alone or estrogen with progestin (the latter is
added to protect the uterine lining from estrogen's
growth-stimulating effect). For each year that women take these
hormones, their risk of developing breast cancer rises slightly, by
an amount roughly equal to the increase associated with a one-year
delay in the onset of menopause. After 10 years on hormone
replacement, according to the experience of 80,000 nurses, the
increase in risk is about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence of estrogen's influence on breast tissue comes
from the effects of designer estrogens like tamoxifen. These
substances act as weak estrogens and block the action of natural
estrogen in some tissues but not others. Tamoxifen has been shown
to help prevent a new or recurrent breast cancer apparently by
blocking the stimulating effects of a woman's own estrogen on
breast tissue. Preliminary evidence was presented recently for a
second designer estrogen, the bone-building drug raloxifene, which
also seemed to reduce a woman's chances of developing breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Though not ideal substitutes for the real thing, designer
estrogens offer high-risk women some estrogen benefits. Tamoxifen,
for example, does reduce cardiac risk, but not to the extent that
estrogen does. However, like estrogen, tamoxifen also stimulates
cell growth in the uterus and increases the risk of uterine cancer.
Raloxifene, marketed as Evista to help prevent osteoporosis, also
has some of estrogen's cardiovascular benefits and, unlike
tamoxifen, it does not stimulate uterine cell growth.
</P>
<P>
   Ongoing research should lead to the development of better
designer estrogens, perhaps one that protects the heart, bones and
brain as well as the breast and uterus and diminishes menopausal
symptoms. Meanwhile, what are the options for a menopausal woman
who has had breast cancer or is at high risk of getting it?
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, she needs to adopt the healthy habits known
to or strongly suspected of reducing the risk of heart disease,
osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease. This familiar list includes,
quitting smoking; achieving and maintaining a normal body weight;
doing regular weight-bearing exercise like brisk walking or
strength training; reducing consumption of meat and dairy fat,
sugars and refined starches; and eating more vegetables, whole
grains, beans and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a postmenopausal woman, even if she takes hormones, should
consume at least 1,500 milligrams of calcium a day (from nonfat
dairy products like yogurt and skim milk, calcium-rich vegetables
and calcium-enriched orange juice supplemented, if needed, by
calcium tablets). She might also take a daily supplement of vitamin
E (200 to 800 international units, to protect against heart disease
and Alzheimer's disease) and vitamin D (to bring her daily total to
800 international units, for proper absorption and use of calcium).
</P>
<P>
   Many menopausal women have recently turned to the lowly soybean
as a substitute for replacement hormones, but the jury is still out
on how effective it is. Soy contains weak estrogens called
isoflavones, which may mimic some of the effects of natural
estrogen. Despite glowing testimonials for soy foods like tofu,
tempeh, soy milk and soy-based candy bars, properly designed
studies have found that soy is only slightly more effective than a
look-alike placebo in controlling hot flashes, a common and easily
assessed symptom of menopause. Researchers suspect that soy may
help some women dramatically, others slightly and still others not
at all. Still, experts say soy is worth a try for women with
bothersome symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But, with regard to the long-term benefits provided by natural
estrogen, the data on soy are preliminary, the findings of studies
are inconsistent and the amount of soy needed to gain significant
benefit is far more than American women are likely to consume. Dr.
Mark Messina of Loma Linda University, who consults for the soy
industry, said the ability of soy to protect against breast cancer,
osteoporosis and heart disease is at best speculative.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an effect on breast cancer risk, it most likely
operates during the teen and young adult years rather than after
menopause, when a woman's own estrogen production is minimal. Most
researchers believe that factors other than soy consumption are the
primary reasons Asian women have much lower rates of breast cancer
than American women do. As for heart disease, soy does lower
cholesterol, but its effects seem limited to women with very high
levels of artery-damaging LDL-cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Margo Woods of the Tufts University School of Medicine, who
is studying whether soy bars can control hot flashes, expressed
concern about the growing market for supplements containing
isolated isoflavones. ``We don't know if these products act the
same as soy-based foods,'' Dr. Woods said. ``You may need
isoflavones and soy protein together to get an effect.'' She also
has reservations about recommending soy for breast cancer patients
who are taking tamoxifen, because soy may block the drug's
benefits.

   &UR; Bright Venus &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is Venus so much brighter in the sky than Mercury, which
is closer to the Sun?
</P>
<P>
   A. Venus is brighter because it is much larger, because it has a
reflective atmosphere and because it makes close approaches to
Earth, said Joe Rao, lecturer at the Hayden Planetarium of the
American Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   First, Mercury is about 3,100 miles in diameter, compared with
about 7,700 miles for Venus, Rao said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, there is no atmosphere surrounding Mercury, while
Venus does have a thick atmosphere, composed chiefly of clouds of
carbon dioxide,'' he said. ``These clouds have a very high
reflectivity, causing Venus to appear to shine with great
brilliance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And third, Venus can approach the Earth much more closely than
Mercury,'' he said. ``In fact, Venus periodically can come closer
to Earth than any other known celestial body, except for the Moon,
as close as 25 million miles. All of these things allow Venus to
shine more brightly than not just Mercury, but than any of the
other planets in our solar system.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Mercury and Venus are ``inferior'' planets, or planets
that are closer to the Sun than Earth is, they can show phases like
those of the Moon, Rao said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mercury shines at its brightest for us, it appears
through a telescope as a gibbous or nearly full phase,'' he said.
``When Venus appears to shine at its most brilliant for us, it
appears in telescopes not as a nearly full phase, but rather as a
slender crescent.''

A NEW TWIST ON AIRMAIL FOR UNPLUGGED TRAVELERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a few short years, e-mail has become the pulse of the
workplace and a tool that is often most missed when an Internet
connection is unavailable. A wireless e-mail service answers that
need by enabling business travelers to send and receive electronic
messages almost anywhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   PageNet, a leading paging company, last month introduced its
Two-Way service built around the PageWriter 2000, a palm-size
6.7-ounce device made by Motorola that opens like a clam to reveal
a tiny screen in the upper shell and a keyboard below.
</P>
<P>
   The PageWriter has no external antenna, no modem and no
telephone jack, yet it sends and receives e-mail almost instantly,
and it does so from deep within steel-and-concrete buildings where
cellular phones cannot receive a signal.
</P>
<P>
   No one is going to write a doctoral dissertation using this
Lilliputian device, but it does offer a remarkable set of features
and a lot of processing power, considering its size. In addition to
sending and receiving Internet e-mail, it includes an address book
that can be used independently to store telephone numbers,
addresses and personal identification numbers for other pagers that
are capable of receiving text messages. It can also send faxes and
is designed to be upgraded with more storage capacity and extra
programs, including a calendar application and games.
</P>
<P>
   The basic model comes with one megabyte of flash memory, which
is a type of memory that is used instead of a disk drive, and 256
kilobytes of RAM for a total of 1.25 megabytes, about one-eighth
the memory of a typical palm computer but still enough to store
dozens of messages and several hundred address-book entries.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a docking station that doubles as a battery
charger and connects the PageWriter to a standard computer to
transfer data between the two machines. That feature could not be
tested for this review because, as of last week, the software for
the personal computer end of the connection was not yet available.
</P>
<P>
   The NimH (nickle metal hydride) battery is rated to last for
seven days of standby, that is, waiting to receive a message. After
its first charge, the model tested for this review went dead at the
end of three days. But performance improved with each charging;
after the fourth, it lasted about five days, during which it was
left on continuously and was used to send and receive several dozen
messages a day.
</P>
<P>
   The PageWriter uses Motorola's own operating system, called
Flex, which cannot run programs written for other handheld devices.
Still, the overall design is well-conceived and easily learned.
</P>
<P>
   A single home button always returns the user to the PageWriter's
main menu of functions. The interface is point-and-click, although
in place of a mouse, the device uses a pancake-shaped button called
a ``NavDisc'' that moves the cursor, joystick-like, around the
screen. The tab key jumps the cursor from function to function and
can be used to cycle quickly through menus. With a little practice,
navigation becomes second nature.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-tiny keyboard _ about 3.5 inches by 2 inches _ is very
difficult to get used to. But a user eventually discovers that the
secret is to avoid the natural inclination to push the keys with
the index finger of the right hand while holding the PageWriter
with the left. It is much more efficient, and surprisingly more
comfortable, to punch out messages with two thumbs while holding
the device with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   By necessity, the keyboard has the standard arrangement for
letters but almost everything else is non-standard. Yet, the
functions are logically designed. For example, with so little room,
it would take the dexterity and small motor skills of a surgeon to
hold the shift key while simultaneously depressing any other key.
So the shift key has been designed to produce the uppercase
character of the first key depressed subsequently.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful feature for e-mailing on the go, and a bit of
compensation for the keyboard, is a list of 16 stock responses that
pops up whenever the user replies to a received message. These
range from simple ``yes'' and ``no'' to ``Can this wait?'' and ``On
my way.'' The user can add custom responses to the list.
</P>
<P>
   For safety reasons, the PageWriter can be turned off completely
when boarding aircraft (required by federal law) and can be set to
receive-only mode for hospitals, clinics and other environments in
which radio transmissions interfere with sensitive equipment.
</P>
<P>
   When the PageWriter is turned off or is unable to receive
signals, the PageNet system stores incoming messages, then delivers
them as soon as the pager is turned back on or as its signal is
restored.
</P>
<P>
   The price for this convenience is relatively high. The
PageWriter 2000 costs about $360, although it can also be leased to
own for $19 a month for two years. The PageNet service plans are
based on the number of characters sent and received. They range
from $24.95 a month, which includes 8,000 characters (a little
longer than this column) plus 12 cents for every character over
that limit, to $129.95, which includes 60,000 characters plus 4
cents per 10 characters. This is more expensive than it seems
because all messages are rounded up to the nearest 10 characters;
thus, sending a simple ``yes'' counts as 10 characters against the
monthly limit.
</P>
<P>
   Because this product is built around paging technology, each
user's e-mail address is his paging number, minus the 800, plus
``pagenet.net.'' This is a convenience in terms of remembering
one's own address but is generally annoying to other people, since
it is typically easier to remember an address built around a
person's name than around a seemingly random seven-digit number.
</P>
<P>
   This is exacerbated by a major drawback to the Flex e-mail
system _ its inability to use any identification other than the
e-mail address of the user in the ``From'' field of the message
header. Thus, instead of getting a message from, say, Fred Klein,
the recipient gets a message from someone identified only as
5551234(AT)pagenet.net.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the user send a ``Subject'' line, which might be used to
note his or her identity. In a corporation that adopts this system,
employees are going to find themselves staring at inboxes full of
messages from senders identified only as numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that is a relatively minor flaw. Of greater concern is
that on two occasions e-mail sent to the device bounced back to the
sender with a notice that no such e-mail account existed. For all
the convenience this system offers, reliability is far more crucial
to business users, especially at the price of this service.

 &HT;    DOUBLE WHAMMY: RUBLE AND CHERNOMYRDIN FALL AGAIN IN HEAVY
TRADING
 &HT;    (EDs: With optional add beginning at 700 words.)
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's double-barreled crisis deteriorated to a new
and perilous degree Monday as the ruble plunged dramatically and
President Boris Yeltsin's choice for prime minister was again
rejected by the Communist-dominated parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The result was continuing political instability and economic
turmoil. The country began its third week without a government as
many apprehensive Russians began rushing stores in panic buying of
dwindling food supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the verge of a precipice and we may be ... losing
the country,'' acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told the
opposition-led Duma, the lower house of parliament. The country's
economy is declining ``at a disastrous rate,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in eight days, the Duma voted by a 2-to-1
margin against confirmation of Chernomyrdin, who was nominated
after Yeltsin abruptly fired the previous government on Aug. 23.
The Duma vote was 273-138 -- the remainder were either abstentions
or unfilled seats.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said that Yeltsin and
Chernomyrdin were as despised by the public as the regime of Czar
Nicholas II just before the 1917 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one trusts him. He has no (economic) program. He lacks the
courage to withdraw his name,'' said Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a third and final showdown vote in the Duma on his
attempt to assemble a new government, Yeltsin can choose over the
next week to renominate Chernomyrdin or bend to the will of the
opposition and select a compromise alternative.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duma again rejects Chernomyrdin, or any other candidate
proposed by Yeltsin, the president must dissolve the chamber and
call an early parliamentary election. That could also cripple the
highly unpopular Yeltsin, who would rule by decree until a new
parliament was elected, but with little support from the people.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves Yeltsin with one of the most difficult decisions of
his seven-year presidency, similar to the power struggle in October
1993 when he eventually sent tanks to oust dissident legislators
from parliament: Yeltsin can stick with Chernomyrdin and risk a
dangerous constitutional crisis or concede defeat and cede power to
a compromise candidate for prime minister, a move that would
probably signal the end of Yeltsin's career.
</P>
<P>
   Bread lines returned to the streets of Moscow at some shops as
people scrambled to purchase goods after the ruble plummeted and
prices soared further. The ruble crash prompted the much criticized
Central Bank president Sergei Dubinin to submit his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Store shelves were empty of some goods, as Russians stuffed
large boxes and bags full of staples like flour, sugar and
vegetable oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saving all our dollars and we're buying everything we
can,'' said Yekaterina Avagimova, 60, a retired director of a
children's day-care center, outside a Moscow grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Her pension of 400 rubles a month was worth about $65 in
mid-August, but was valued at only $20 by Tuesday. Meanwhile,
prices have risen 50 to 120 percent on most food items. ``We can't
survive if this continues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank set the ruble at 18.9 to the dollar for
Tuesday. But the figure has little relation to reality.
</P>
<P>
   The official rate Monday was 20.66 to the dollar before trading
was suspended on the inter-bank currency exchange. Dealers
anticipated the rate would fall to 30 in trading Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks ago, the ruble stood at 6.2 to the dollar, but
analysts said it has dropped an average of about 67 percent since
devaluation began on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The second rejection of Chernomyrdin prolonged the uncertainty
of how and when Russia will embark on a plan to salvage its
economy. Chernomyrdin unveiled a broad plan last week for an
``economic dictatorship,'' including printing more rubles to pay
the country's debts.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties have proposed more than a dozen names of
possible compromise candidates to replace Chernomyrdin. Among the
most prominent are Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly angered after his second rebuff by parliament,
Chernomyrdin accused some lawmakers of inciting social tensions for
their political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone clearly wants store shelves with nothing on them and
people massing in the streets,'' Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
   Grim and weary in his address to the Duma, Chernomyrdin accused
parliament of seeking to turn Russia into Indonesia, ``where they
burned down the whole country -- that's where you want us to go.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the harsh rhetoric from both sides there is still a
chance the Duma could back down, as it did in April in the third
vote for the previous prime minister, reformer Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who served as prime minister from 1992 until March
of this year, was criticized by parliamentary opponents, who called
him responsible for many of Russia's current problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chernomyrdin garnered only 94 votes in the 450-seat
Duma, far short of the 226 votes he needed.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's vote, Yeltsin held awkward talks at the Kremlin
with parliamentary leaders designed to coax their support for
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   He also signed a draft power-sharing agreement -- the first time
in his presidency he has agreed to yield authority -- that would
have given the parliament a new role in helping to choose the
cabinet and set policy.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin also suggested that Chernomyrdin would serve for a
six-month trial period, with the possibility of being replaced if
he had not gotten a handle on the crumbling economy.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition parliament members were not swayed by the
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said the Duma had given Yeltsin ``time
to think about the situation. We have (in Chernomyrdin) a candidate
who enjoys no trust, no matter what program he might come up
with.''

   &UR; Flying Solo, Minus One &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It has taken seven decades, but the aviation world has at last
done Charles Lindbergh one better: An airplane has flown nonstop
across the Atlantic, not with just one person on board, but with no
one.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane in question is a 29-pound propeller-driven pixie,
with a 10-foot wing span and a gas-powered engine that is far
tinier than the average car's. Its 1,900-mile flight last month,
from Newfoundland to the Outer Hebrides, was the first Atlantic
crossing by a civilian robotic aircraft. After being launched from
the roof of a moving car, it made the trip in about 26 hours,
flying well below commercial air traffic lanes.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, called an Aerosonde, was developed by Australian and
American companies with assistance from the Australian Bureau of
Meteorology and researchers at the University of Washington. The
developers hope robotic planes can be used as a relatively low-cost
means of gathering weather data over remote areas like oceans.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was a major test of the Aerosonde's ability to
function solo. It was out of radio contact for most of the journey,
relying instead on a satellite's Global Positioning System to keep
it on track.
</P>
<P>
   The developers acknowledge that the planes still have a few
bugs; indeed, they launched four Aerosondes, fully expecting that
not all would make it. And that's what happened: one crashed on
takeoff and two, like Amelia Earhart, just disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tagging the Tuna &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Under the Atlantic, bluefin tuna are sporting a bit of satellite
technology of their own these days.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from Stanford University, the Monterey Bay Aquarium
in California and the National Marine Fisheries Service have been
using new ``pop-up'' tags since 1996 to track movements of giant
tuna. The tags, which contain microprocessors to record water
temperature and other data, pop free of the fish at a set time,
float to the surface and send data to a satellite. The transmission
also pinpoints the tag's location.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional tags are recovered only if a fish is caught and a
tag is turned in by the fisherman. With bluefin tuna, only about
one in eight conventional tags are ever recovered.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, of 37 fish tagged off Cape Hatteras, N.C., with the
new devices, data was collected from 35. The researchers, who plan
to tag at least 600 tuna over the next two years, will use the
information to help increase the tuna population, whose breeding
numbers have declined greatly over several decades. Bluefin tuna
are currently treated as two separate stocks, one in the western
Atlantic and one in the eastern, with different catch quotas for
each. Already, the scientists have discovered that some of the fish
cross the line separating the two stocks, casting doubt on the
effectiveness of the management strategy.

   &UR; Putting Bacteria to Work &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson that every farmer knows: The roots of certain
legumes like soybeans have bacteria capable of changing nitrogen in
the air to a form the plant can use, enabling it to grow in poor
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Australian scientists have identified an enzyme that is
involved in transferring the ``fixed'' nitrogen in the form of an
ammonium ion from the bacteria to the host plant. The enzyme
controls nitrogen transfer across what is called the peribacteroid
membrane, which keeps the bacteria separate from the plant tissue.
Still to be determined is exactly how the enzyme, a protein,
creates a channel for the ions to cross. The researchers, reporting
on the discovery in a recent issue of Nature, say its helical
structure may play a role.

 &HT;    DOUBLE WHAMMY: RUBLE AND CHERNOMYRDIN FALL AGAIN IN HEAVY
TRADING
 &HT;    (EDs: With optional add beginning at 700 words.)
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's double-barreled crisis deteriorated to a new
and perilous degree Monday as the ruble plunged dramatically and
President Boris Yeltsin's choice for prime minister was again
rejected by the Communist-dominated parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The result was continuing political instability and economic
turmoil. The country began its third week without a government as
many apprehensive Russians began rushing stores in panic buying of
dwindling food supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the verge of a precipice and we may be ... losing
the country,'' acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told the
opposition-led Duma, the lower house of parliament. The country's
economy is declining ``at a disastrous rate,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in eight days, the Duma voted by a 2-to-1
margin against confirmation of Chernomyrdin, who was nominated
after Yeltsin abruptly fired the previous government on Aug. 23.
The Duma vote was 273-138 -- the remainder were either abstentions
or unfilled seats.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said that Yeltsin and
Chernomyrdin were as despised by the public as the regime of Czar
Nicholas II just before the 1917 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one trusts him. He has no (economic) program. He lacks the
courage to withdraw his name,'' said Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a third and final showdown vote in the Duma on his
attempt to assemble a new government, Yeltsin can choose over the
next week to renominate Chernomyrdin or bend to the will of the
opposition and select a compromise alternative.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duma again rejects Chernomyrdin, or any other candidate
proposed by Yeltsin, the president must dissolve the chamber and
call an early parliamentary election. That could also cripple the
highly unpopular Yeltsin, who would rule by decree until a new
parliament was elected, but with little support from the people.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves Yeltsin with one of the most difficult decisions of
his seven-year presidency, similar to the power struggle in October
1993 when he eventually sent tanks to oust dissident legislators
from parliament: Yeltsin can stick with Chernomyrdin and risk a
dangerous constitutional crisis or concede defeat and cede power to
a compromise candidate for prime minister, a move that would
probably signal the end of Yeltsin's career.
</P>
<P>
   Bread lines returned to the streets of Moscow at some shops as
people scrambled to purchase goods after the ruble plummeted and
prices soared further. The ruble crash prompted the much criticized
Central Bank president Sergei Dubinin to submit his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Store shelves were empty of some goods, as Russians stuffed
large boxes and bags full of staples like flour, sugar and
vegetable oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saving all our dollars and we're buying everything we
can,'' said Yekaterina Avagimova, 60, a retired director of a
children's day-care center, outside a Moscow grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Her pension of 400 rubles a month was worth about $65 in
mid-August, but was valued at only $20 by Tuesday. Meanwhile,
prices have risen 50 to 120 percent on most food items. ``We can't
survive if this continues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank set the ruble at 18.9 to the dollar for
Tuesday. But the figure has little relation to reality.
</P>
<P>
   The official rate Monday was 20.66 to the dollar before trading
was suspended on the inter-bank currency exchange. Dealers
anticipated the rate would fall to 30 in trading Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks ago, the ruble stood at 6.2 to the dollar, but
analysts said it has dropped an average of about 67 percent since
devaluation began on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The second rejection of Chernomyrdin prolonged the uncertainty
of how and when Russia will embark on a plan to salvage its
economy. Chernomyrdin unveiled a broad plan last week for an
``economic dictatorship,'' including printing more rubles to pay
the country's debts.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties have proposed more than a dozen names of
possible compromise candidates to replace Chernomyrdin. Among the
most prominent are Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly angered after his second rebuff by parliament,
Chernomyrdin accused some lawmakers of inciting social tensions for
their political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone clearly wants store shelves with nothing on them and
people massing in the streets,'' Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
   Grim and weary in his address to the Duma, Chernomyrdin accused
parliament of seeking to turn Russia into Indonesia, ``where they
burned down the whole country -- that's where you want us to go.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the harsh rhetoric from both sides there is still a
chance the Duma could back down, as it did in April in the third
vote for the previous prime minister, reformer Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who served as prime minister from 1992 until March
of this year, was criticized by parliamentary opponents, who called
him responsible for many of Russia's current problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chernomyrdin garnered only 94 votes in the 450-seat
Duma, far short of the 226 votes he needed.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's vote, Yeltsin held awkward talks at the Kremlin
with parliamentary leaders designed to coax their support for
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   He also signed a draft power-sharing agreement -- the first time
in his presidency he has agreed to yield authority -- that would
have given the parliament a new role in helping to choose the
cabinet and set policy.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin also suggested that Chernomyrdin would serve for a
six-month trial period, with the possibility of being replaced if
he had not gotten a handle on the crumbling economy.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition parliament members were not swayed by the
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said the Duma had given Yeltsin ``time
to think about the situation. We have (in Chernomyrdin) a candidate
who enjoys no trust, no matter what program he might come up
with.''

   &UR; Wanting to Lose &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Little about weight loss seems fair. Now new research
underscores that sense: In a controlled study, the people who had
the hardest time shedding pounds were those who did not like the
way they looked, and who had lost weight _ and regained it _ many
times.
</P>
<P>
   The research, conducted at the Stanford Center for Research in
Disease Prevention and published in this month's issue of the
journal Annals of Behavioral Medicine, was not intended to rub it
in. Dr. Michaela Kiernan of the center said the study was designed
to try to better understand people who have trouble losing weight.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers enlisted 177 mildly to moderately overweight men
and women who were quizzed about previous weight loss efforts and
several psychological factors, including body dissatisfaction. They
then were randomly assigned either to a diet program or a diet and
exercise program.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest predictor of success turned out to be the most
obvious: Those who exercised and ate less were twice as likely to
lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   But within the exercise group were other striking differences:
Participants who were satisfied with their bodies were also twice
as likely to succeed as those who were not, and subjects who had no
history of repeated weight loss were much more likely to lose
weight compared with those who reported shedding more than 10
pounds as part of an ``average'' year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diet and exercise may be viewed as the panacea,'' Kiernan
said, ``but there are subgroups that aren't doing as well.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the research suggested the need for looking at ``more
tailored strategies'' to help those who face particularly stiff
obstacles. For instance, people who dislike their bodies may be
reluctant to participant in the kind of group exercise program
included in the study. For them, she said, a home program or
exercise with friends might prove more effective.

DOW SLIDE MAY RENEW SOME VISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Are you a person with vision?
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have my sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   It's nearly impossible these days to have vision, or to think
long term. Nobody's interested. The whole world wants results, and
they want them now, thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a world of five-minute doctor visits, drive-through
restaurants and instant gratification. ``Long-term planning'' in
most companies means next week, not next year.
</P>
<P>
   So it has been rather interesting to watch the craziness
surrounding Internet start-up companies. Now here's an industry
where ``long term'' is everything.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's making money yet, except, perhaps, Yahoo!. Yet
investors have flocked to such companies, flooding them with cash
on the expectation that there's money to be made down the road, as
millions of consumers begin using the new online medium.
</P>
<P>
   There is money to be made. But it ain't happening yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Stock Index, for example, tracks about 50 top
Internet-related stocks. Two-thirds of the companies on the list
operate in the red or just break even.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wolff's new book, ``Burn Rate,'' details the absurdity
of it all, beginning with the title. ``Burn Rate,'' the former
journalist and entrepreneur points out, refers to the amount of
money a promising start-up company consumes each month in excess of
its income.
</P>
<P>
   It's all so bizarre that even the comic strip ``Doonesbury'' has
gotten into the act, making fun of Internet companies that operate
in the red, yet keep attracting millions of dollars in investment
capital.
</P>
<P>
   But is the tide turning?
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 31 market crash hit technology stocks hard.
Internet-related stocks took the brunt of it. Stock in Amazon.com,
a hugely successful online book seller, lost 21 percent of its
value Monday, and 4.5 percent more on Sept. 1. Yahoo! sank 17
percent Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Such stocks may have made up their losses by the time you read
this, but many in the industry are wondering whether the honeymoon
is over. Could it be that investors have turned a corner, and from
now on will require a bit more in return for their cash?
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't surprise me. After all, investing in the future
requires vision. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Seniors page debuts &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! has produced another one of its trademark specialty
areas. This time, the special area is devoted to senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Yahoo! Senior's Guide, seniors.yahoo.com. (Note:
There is no ``www'' at the beginning of that Web address.)
</P>
<P>
   The site takes all the Web has to offer and filters it, leaving
only those resources that might be interesting to older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There are familiar categories _ computers, entertainment,
travel, etc. . . . But when you click on them, you're treated to a
group of Web sites and other resources that apply to seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Click on Computers, for example, and you get subcategories
including links to other Web sites for seniors and links to topics
of interest to seniors, such as genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   There also are links to senior-oriented live chats and a host of
message boards on topics ranging from health care to personal
finance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, something funny &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Owen Whetzel, a fine gentleman I once worked with in California,
keeps in occasional touch with me via e-mail. And I appreciate
that, too, as he often forwards humorous postings he runs across in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   His latest electronic dispatch began:
</P>
<P>
   ``If lawyers can be disbarred, and clergymen defrocked, doesn't
it follow that . . .
</P>
<P>
   - Electricians can be delighted.
</P>
<P>
   - Cowboys can be deranged
</P>
<P>
   - Models can be deposed
</P>
<P>
   - Organ donors can be delivered
</P>
<P>
   - Musicians can be denoted.
</P>
<P>
   - Bedmakers can be debunked.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. I guess so. Thanks for pointing that out, Owen! &QL;

AMERICANS NEED MORE VITAMIN C, RESEARCHER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 C-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Put down that coffee and pick up some orange
juice. A good chunk of Americans aren't getting enough vitamin C,
leaving them open to a host of health problems, according to an
Arizona State University researcher.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of people studied by ASU nutrition researcher
Carol Johnston were depleted of vitamin C, a condition that causes
fatigue and irritability, as well as worsens respiratory
infections. The worst conditions can develop into scurvy.
</P>
<P>
   The results surprised Johnston, an associate professor of family
resources and human development, who has researched vitamin C since
the early 1980s. The patients didn't fit the typical profile:
``They were basically healthy and many of them were pregnant,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's research is published this month in the ``Journal of
the American College of Nutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston tested the blood of 494 patients at a Cigna HealthCare
of Arizona clinic and found that 30 percent of them were vitamin
C-depleted and 6.3 percent suffered from the more severe vitamin C
deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's findings bolster the idea that people may be aware of
nutritional campaigns such as ``Five-A-Day'' but aren't following
them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of eating five servings of produce daily, most Americans
squeak by with one or two, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they meet their quota, they may not be biting into
foods rich in vitamin C. Bananas, apples, potatoes and lettuce,
America's favorite produce, aren't high in vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the B vitamins and folic acid, it's not easy to fortify
food with vitamin C since its potency is weakened when exposed to
heat and air, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 days in a fridge, fruit and vegetables lose up to half
of their vitamin and mineral content. Oranges _ usually the big
kahuna of vitamin C _ can lose their potency if cut up for fruit
salad.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston isn't against using supplements _ it's estimated that
43 percent of American households take supplements. But a glass of
orange juice would provide the daily requirements, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements, established by the Food and Drug
Administration, are under fire from nutritionists and others who
argue they are too low.
</P>
<P>
   A federal study in 1996 suggested it should more than triple the
daily recommended levels of vitamin C to 200 milligrams from 60
milligrams.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston recently testified before a panel of the National
Academy of Sciences about the advantages of raising the level.
Current levels prevent scurvy, but higher levels of vitamin C could
minimize the effects of colds and encourage exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The vitamin's reputation took a hit in the late 1980s when Nobel
chemist Linus Pauling declared it as a treatment for everything
from colds to AIDS. Since then, it has lost luster in mainstream
medicine, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   But research continues to show that taking vitamin C at least
reduces the length of time people suffer from colds. Vitamin C
depletion is linked to higher blood levels of histamine, the stuff
that makes noses run and get stuffy; vitamin C is like nature's
antihistamine, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   The word may still be out on the vitamin's role in defusing
colds, but its value at warding off scurvy is undisputed.
</P>
<P>
   Scurvy begins as a skin rash and swelling, but leads to joint
pain and bleeding gums.
</P>
<P>
   Although vitamin C levels in the blood are easy to test, few
physicians suspect it as they make their diagnoses, she said.
</P>
<P>
   One physician, for example, thought a girl had polio but in
fact, she was low on vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   The case was a warning that scurvy isn't a thing of the past,
Johnston said. &QL;

CAN THE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR OF MAN BE GLIMPSED IN A LOWLY WORM? 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does behavior have a genetic basis? People may find the idea
unwelcome, at least as applied to their own conduct, but genes that
govern certain behaviors in animals are beginning to come to light,
the most spectacular of them in an article in the current issue of
Cell.
</P>
<P>
   The gene governs sociability and feeding behavior in a
microscopic roundworm, a favorite laboratory organism chosen for
its ease of study and its relative simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fascinating beginning of a whole field, the
molecular biology of social behavior,'' said Dr. Eric Kandel, a
leading neuroscientist at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Computer programmers, who know that one typographical error can
alter a whole program, may be comforted to learn that the same
principle applies in the genetic programming of the worm's
behavior. In the newly discovered gene, the change of a single unit
of DNA converts the worm from a solitary forager into a gregarious
diner.
</P>
<P>
   Different though humans may generally be from worms, it is
striking that the gene is related to a counterpart human gene, one
that responds to a hormone involved in feeding behavior. And what
ritual is more central to human sociality than the breaking of
bread?
</P>
<P>
   The relatedness of the worm and human genes occurs in the
recognizably similar sequences of chemical letters in their DNA.
Each gene is descended from a gene in a common ancestor that lived
about 600 million years ago, before the separation of the
evolutionary paths leading to worms and to humans.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic switch was discovered by Dr. Mario de Bono and Dr.
Cornelia Barghmann of the University of California at San
Francisco, who were following up observations that some laboratory
worms clump together when feeding, while others forage alone. The
worms, Caenorhabditis elegans, are barely visible, transparent
creatures with little resemblance to earthworms, although they also
live in soil.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting strains of C. elegans from several continents, the
two researchers found a natural variation in behavior between
solitary foraging and communal feeding. Some strains did one, some
the other. Both behaviors turned out to be governed by the same
gene, one that makes a receptor that studs the surface of the
worm's nerve cells. The antennalike part of the receptor that juts
out from the cell picks up signals from the hormones known as
neuropeptides, while its interior segment relays the message to the
information center in the cell's nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   Neuropeptides are not well understood, but in humans one of
them, known as neuropeptide Y, helps regulate food consumption,
mood, anxiety and memory retention. The worm's version of
neuropeptide Y has not been identified but can be assumed to exist
because the newly discovered gene, to judge by its DNA sequence,
makes a receptor quite similar to the human neuropeptide Y
receptor.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barghmann found that the solitary and the social strains of
the worm differed at one position in their neuropeptide receptor
gene. The solitary worms have as the 215th group of the gene the
DNA units G-T-T, which specify the component known as valine at the
corresponding position in the protein chain of the receptor. Social
worms have the DNA units T-T-T, which call for phenylalanine at
this position. T and G are two of the four kinds of units in the
DNA chain.
</P>
<P>
   This unit difference lies on the interior of the receptor, and
presumably influences how the neuropeptide message is conveyed to
the nerve cell's nucleus, but the exact mechanisms have yet to be
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The social strains of worm not only clump together, but move
more rapidly than solitary worms and search for food more eagerly.
Thus a whole pattern of behaviors is governed by this one letter
difference in DNA. How this is accomplished is not known but if,
for example, three classes of nerve cells in the worm possessed the
neuropeptide receptor, then three kinds of behavior could be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barghmann says she believes that neuropeptides, which
generate long-lasting effects in the brain, may be a system in
which natural variations in animal behavior are easily produced.
Lions and tigers, she notes, are so similar that they can
interbreed, yet lions are gregarious and tigers are solitary;
perhaps the big cats, like the two strains of C. elegans, differ in
their neuropeptide receptor genes.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the known neuropeptides are involved in control of
feeding and appetite, behavior so basic that these hormones may
have existed from the earliest days of animal evolution. Whether
the hormones have anything to do with human sociability, Dr.
Barghmann is intrigued by the idea that social groups and feeding
might have a close relationship. ``I am amused that the essential
social interaction between nonmates is the meal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternity of biologists who work on C. elegans sometimes
tends to regard humans as little more than large worms and misses
no chance to underline the similarities. Recent findings, such as
an insulinlike gene that regulates the worm's energy metabolism,
give some support to their case.
</P>
<P>
   Students of the human brain, like Dr. Kandel, are willing to be
persuaded. ``The more the C. elegans field keeps going, the more
they are convincing,'' Dr. Kandel said. Dr. Barghmann's experiment,
he said, ``shows what brilliant use one can make of an organism
over which one has such powerful genetic control.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ralph Greenspan, an expert in the neurobiology of another
model animal, the Drosophila fruit fly, said it was hard to know if
the clumping of the worms represented true social behavior. Genes
often work the same way in different animals at the level of cells
``but there is no rule about how much conservation there may be
above that level, such as with behavior,'' said Dr. Greenspan, who
is at the Neurosciences Institute in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kandel said it might seem that only an absurd reductionist
would argue that the communal feeding of a lowly worm, way down the
evolutionary scale, had anything to do with people's socializing at
a party. But he said he regarded Dr. Barghmann's work on the worm's
social behavior as the beginning of a hierarchy of studies that
might explain the genetic underpinnings of animal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will say, `Ridiculous, this has nothing to do with
social behavior,' but I strongly believe we will learn a lot from
it,'' Dr. Kandel said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the biologist who first advocated the worm as the
key to solving problems of human biology, Dr. Kandel noted that
``Sydney Brenner once said the strategy of biology is to think
small and talk big.'' Dr. Barghmann's work on the worm, he said,
``is a perfect example.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has taken a cosmic problem,'' he said, ``and shown how you
can begin to approach it.''

<P>
   Making an informed decision about whether to take replacement
hormones during and after menopause is hard enough for women with
no prior health problems. It is far more difficult for a woman who
has had breast cancer or who has a strong family history of this
most common cancer in women. Because estrogen can stimulate the
growth of a breast cancer, women and their physicians are
understandably reluctant to consider hormone replacement for
someone at high risk of developing a new or recurrent cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But this means that such women may miss important health
benefits of estrogen after menopause, among them a reduced risk of
heart disease, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease as well as
diminished menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats and
vaginal dryness.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's announcement that the Food and Drug Administration
is recommending approval of the drug tamoxifen to reduce the risk
of developing breast cancer provides another, though imperfect,
hormone replacement option for high-risk women. Though it has
drawbacks, this so-called ``designer estrogen'' also offers women
who take it an opportunity to glean some of the benefits of
estrogen replacement, such as reduced risk of cardiovascular
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But these questions remain: Can some former breast cancer
patients safely take hormone replacement, and if so, which ones?
Are there reasonable alternatives that will grant women at least
some of the benefits of estrogen without adding to their concerns
about developing a new or recurrent cancer?
</P>
<P>
   The answers concern 2.4 million American women, and millions
more worldwide, who have survived breast cancer, as well as those
at high risk of the disease.At a consensus conference last fall
sponsored by The Hormone Foundation, the Susan G. Komen Breast
Cancer Foundation and others, experts and patient advocates
concluded that treating menopausal symptoms and long-term health
risks in breast cancer patients should be ``tailored to individual
patients' needs'' and employ strategies that ``would avoid the use
of estrogen while providing its benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen plays a critical role in the initiation and/or
promotion of breast cancer. Many studies have shown that the longer
a woman's breast is exposed to high levels of estrogen, the greater
are her chances of eventually getting breast cancer. The cells of
most breast cancers have receptors for estrogen and respond to the
hormone's growth-stimulating effects. Patients with these cancers
are typically given treatments to block the effects of their own
estrogens.
</P>
<P>
   Recent findings strongly suggest that this increased risk
extends to postmenopausal women who take replacement hormones,
either estrogen alone or estrogen with progestin (the latter is
added to protect the uterine lining from estrogen's
growth-stimulating effect). For each year that women take these
hormones, their risk of developing breast cancer rises slightly, by
an amount roughly equal to the increase associated with a one-year
delay in the onset of menopause. After 10 years on hormone
replacement, according to the experience of 80,000 nurses, the
increase in risk is about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence of estrogen's influence on breast tissue comes
from the effects of designer estrogens like tamoxifen. These
substances act as weak estrogens and block the action of natural
estrogen in some tissues but not others. Tamoxifen has been shown
to help prevent a new or recurrent breast cancer apparently by
blocking the stimulating effects of a woman's own estrogen on
breast tissue. Preliminary evidence was presented recently for a
second designer estrogen, the bone-building drug raloxifene, which
also seemed to reduce a woman's chances of developing breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Though not ideal substitutes for the real thing, designer
estrogens offer high-risk women some estrogen benefits. Tamoxifen,
for example, does reduce cardiac risk, but not to the extent that
estrogen does. However, like estrogen, tamoxifen also stimulates
cell growth in the uterus and increases the risk of uterine cancer.
Raloxifene, marketed as Evista to help prevent osteoporosis, also
has some of estrogen's cardiovascular benefits and, unlike
tamoxifen, it does not stimulate uterine cell growth.
</P>
<P>
   Ongoing research should lead to the development of better
designer estrogens, perhaps one that protects the heart, bones and
brain as well as the breast and uterus and diminishes menopausal
symptoms. Meanwhile, what are the options for a menopausal woman
who has had breast cancer or is at high risk of getting it?
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, she needs to adopt the healthy habits known
to or strongly suspected of reducing the risk of heart disease,
osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease. This familiar list includes,
quitting smoking; achieving and maintaining a normal body weight;
doing regular weight-bearing exercise like brisk walking or
strength training; reducing consumption of meat and dairy fat,
sugars and refined starches; and eating more vegetables, whole
grains, beans and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a postmenopausal woman, even if she takes hormones, should
consume at least 1,500 milligrams of calcium a day (from nonfat
dairy products like yogurt and skim milk, calcium-rich vegetables
and calcium-enriched orange juice supplemented, if needed, by
calcium tablets). She might also take a daily supplement of vitamin
E (200 to 800 international units, to protect against heart disease
and Alzheimer's disease) and vitamin D (to bring her daily total to
800 international units, for proper absorption and use of calcium).
</P>
<P>
   Many menopausal women have recently turned to the lowly soybean
as a substitute for replacement hormones, but the jury is still out
on how effective it is. Soy contains weak estrogens called
isoflavones, which may mimic some of the effects of natural
estrogen. Despite glowing testimonials for soy foods like tofu,
tempeh, soy milk and soy-based candy bars, properly designed
studies have found that soy is only slightly more effective than a
look-alike placebo in controlling hot flashes, a common and easily
assessed symptom of menopause. Researchers suspect that soy may
help some women dramatically, others slightly and still others not
at all. Still, experts say soy is worth a try for women with
bothersome symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But, with regard to the long-term benefits provided by natural
estrogen, the data on soy are preliminary, the findings of studies
are inconsistent and the amount of soy needed to gain significant
benefit is far more than American women are likely to consume. Dr.
Mark Messina of Loma Linda University, who consults for the soy
industry, said the ability of soy to protect against breast cancer,
osteoporosis and heart disease is at best speculative.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an effect on breast cancer risk, it most likely
operates during the teen and young adult years rather than after
menopause, when a woman's own estrogen production is minimal. Most
researchers believe that factors other than soy consumption are the
primary reasons Asian women have much lower rates of breast cancer
than American women do. As for heart disease, soy does lower
cholesterol, but its effects seem limited to women with very high
levels of artery-damaging LDL-cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Margo Woods of the Tufts University School of Medicine, who
is studying whether soy bars can control hot flashes, expressed
concern about the growing market for supplements containing
isolated isoflavones. ``We don't know if these products act the
same as soy-based foods,'' Dr. Woods said. ``You may need
isoflavones and soy protein together to get an effect.'' She also
has reservations about recommending soy for breast cancer patients
who are taking tamoxifen, because soy may block the drug's
benefits.

QUESTIONS SURROUND PERFORMANCE ENHANCER

<P>
   In the 1940s, not long after the discovery and isolation of
testosterone, the hormone in the body that can help build rock-hard
muscles, it was learned that baseball players on the St. Louis
Cardinals had loaded up on extra large doses of vitamins to try to
enhance their performance. This led Paul de Kruif, a popular
science writer of the day to comment: ``We know how the St. Louis
Cardinals have won championships supercharged by vitamins. It would
be interesting to watch the productive power of an industry or a
professional group that would try a systematic supercharge with
testosterone.''
</P>
<P>
   Was that statement, about the pennant-winning predecessors of
Mark McGwire's team from St. Louis, also a highly prophetic
description of an experiment being tested now more than a
half-century later?
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, McGwire has been taking androstenedione
(pronounced andro-STEEN-die-own) or simply ``andro'' as the
athletes call it, an over-the counter supplement that converts to
testosterone in the body. Though McGwire and others say it has
helped him to a banner homerun season, surprisingly little is known
about androstenedione, including whether it works at all.
</P>
<P>
   And other major questions remain unanswered: is taking andro
safe and what are the long-term effects of using the supplement?
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione is a ``pre-hormone,'' meaning that it is a
precursor that is converted into testosterone. Testosterone is
produced mainly in the male testes (and, to a lesser extent, in the
adrenal glands and in a woman's ovaries) and is responsible for
male characteristics like increased muscle, facial hair and a deep
voice. Elevated levels of testosterone also enable athletes to work
out harder and recover more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione was first developed in the 1970s by East German
scientists to try to enhance their athletes' Olympic performances.
The substance was introduced commercially in this country two years
ago by Patrick Arnold, a chemist, as president of Seymour
Bio-Organics of Seymour, Ill. Manufacturers assert that a
100-milligram dose of androstenedione increases testosterone levels
by 300 percent and lasts for about three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Although androstenedione, which is in a class called C-19
steroids, is inactive when it first enters the body, it quickly
becomes anabolic and converts into testosterone to produce muscle
growth like other anabolic steroids. Unlike many anabolic steroids,
which are widely banned, it is allowed in professional baseball.
But it is banned by other sports governing bodies, including the
National Football League and the International Olympic Committee.
Anyone can buy andro as a result of 1994 drug deregulation laws.
But some stores refuse to stock it because of possible risks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Linn Goldberg, professor of medicine and head of the
division of health promotion and sports medicine at the Oregon
Health Sciences University, sees little difference between
androstenedione and the anabolic steroids that have ignited
controversy in sports throughout the years. ``When androstenedione
is converted to testosterone, it is no different than taking
anabolic steroids,'' he said. ``It's an attempt to cheat to improve
your performance, by unnaturally boosting your testosterone
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason some athletes may use androstenedione is its
suspected ability to mask the illegal use of testosterone. To
Jeffrey Brown, an endocrinologist at the University of Texas Health
Sciences Center in Houston, ``There's no question that
androstenedione could be used very effectively to escape detection
of testosterone use.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Don Catlin, a professor of medicine at UCLA, added, ``In
today's world, athletes who are determined to cheat know that
natural substances are the way to, because they are so difficult to
detect.''
</P>
<P>
   Other detractors point to possible harm in using
androstenedione. Although scientists say there are insufficient
data on this particular substance to draw definitive conclusions,
the case against anabolic steroids and excess testosterone is
clear. It is well documented that testosterone in excess amounts
can be very harmful, especially to children and adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg believes that supplement manufacturers and athletes who
are using androstenedione play down the possibility of harmful
effects. ``They keep saying androstenedione is no big deal,'' said
Goldberg who is also a crew chief for drug testing for the U.S.
Olympic Committee. ``But if it's not a big deal, why are athletes
taking it? It is unhealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Steroid use can lead to a number of dangerous side effects
including, lowered levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
which benefits the heart, and lowered levels of harmful low-density
lipoprotein; stimulation of prostate tumors; clotting disorders,
and liver problems. Psychologically, anabolic steroids can make a
person more aggressive and in some can cause uncontrolled
aggressive behavior and psychosis. Cosmetic changes that can be set
off by steroids include baldness, increased body hair, acne and
breast growth in men.
</P>
<P>
   Women who are pregnant and men with prostate problems are
specifically advised by androstenedione manufactures to avoid the
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers using androstenedione may also face increased risk of
serious side effects. For instance, in adolescents, steroids trick
the body into thinking it is older and can shut off bone growth,
thus stunting height.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg and his colleague Dr. Diane Elliot have completed a
three-year study, published in The Journal of the American Medical
Association, designed to persuade adolescent athletes to stay clear
of supplements like androstenedione and other steroids. Their
program, tested among 3,200 athletes in 31 high schools in Oregon
and Washington, reduced student-athletes' desire to use steroids
and lowered new anabolic steroid use by a reported 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They used one of the lesser known effects of prolonged use of
steroids _ reduction in the size of the testicles _ to drive the
point home.
</P>
<P>
   In a video, a 275-pound high school football player, is shown
holding a frying pan with two grapefruits. He points to the
grapefruits and says, ``These are your testicles.'' Then he
replaces the grapefruit with peanuts and says: ``These are your
testicles when you use steroids. Any questions?'' Goldberg pointed
out that the reduction to peanut size testicles was factual.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the evidence against steroids in general, trainers and
manufacturers of androstenedione say it is unfair to indict it,
since there has been no clear-cut independent research on it. They
insist that the data do not exist to conclude that androstenedione
has the same adverse effects as excessive amounts of testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, who introduced androstenedione in this country, contends
that the supplement is ``a very safe way of performance
enhancement, as safe as drinking a cup of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Wadler, a steroid authority at New York University,
disagrees. He pointed out that the federal government considers
testosterone a controlled substance and a user needs a triplicate
prescription to acquire it. ``It would be foolish to ``delude
anyone that this is an innocuous substance,'' he said.

BOMBINGS CAST A SHADOW ON EAST AFRICAN TOURISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Sept. 13)  
(JT) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The bombings at the American Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania have frightened away travelers from East Africa just as
Kenya was hoping for an end to a years-old slump in foreign
tourism, and as Tanzania was finally beginning to reap the benefits
from a major investment in the travel industry.
</P>
<P>
   Tour operators who specialize in travel in Kenya and Tanzania,
which boast some of Africa's best game parks and sunniest beaches,
say there have been no mass cancellations as a result of the Aug. 7
Embassy bombings in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, which left more than 250 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   But they report a number of worried calls from prospective
travelers, many of them alarmed by the possibility of more
terrorist attacks in the region. ``People have been calling, and
we've been reassuring them that we don't see further problems,''
said Mary Mkimbo, a spokeswoman in New York for the Kenya Tourist
Office.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, which does not want to see Kenya and
Tanzania punished economically as a result of terrorist attacks
that were clearly targeted at the United States, has lifted dire
travel warnings issued just the bombings that urged Americans to
stay away from the two countries. New public announcements put out
on Aug. 13 suggest only that Americans ``exercise caution'' when
visiting Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Embassy employees in both cities have gone back to work,
although in new locations. The bombed-out Embassy in Nairobi is
expected to be demolished after the FBI has finished gathering
evidence. The embassy in Dar es Salaam suffered less damage from
the blast, although it, too, may have to be razed. For now, the
State Department says, Embassy employees can offer only emergency
consular service.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign visitors to Nairobi and Dar es Salaam since the bombings
have noted a reassuringly heavy presence of both police and
soldiers on the streets of the two capitals. Crew-cut FBI agents
fill many of the luxury hotels in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats and intelligence officials say there is no
reason to believe that terrorists affiliated with Osama bin Laden,
the exiled Saudi millionaire who is accused of organizing the
Embassy bombings, plan to strike again soon in either country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the televised images of the charred hulks of the American
Embassy buildings will likely haunt the travel industry in East
Africa for years. ``The tourism industry is very sensitive to the
news media,'' said Ms. Mkimbo. ``We do expect a little downward
movement in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The tourism industry in Kenya has been troubled for years _ in
part because of the opening of new safari destinations in South
Africa, in part because of Nairobi's well-deserved reputation for
street crime. Tourism industry revenues reportedly dropped to $300
million last year, down from $450 million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The government has responded to the slump with a series of
actions to lure tourists back, including a marked improvement in
the service of Kenya Airways, the national airline, which has gone
into partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The bombing will
doubtless set back those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism has never been so well-developed an industry in
neighboring Tanzania, which is home to Mt. Kilimanjaro, the
magnificent wildlife of Serengeti National Park and the exotic
island of Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of infrastructure has worked to Tanzania's
advantage in recent years given the dramatic growth in the number
of adventure travelers who are willing, even eager to go without
the five-star safari resorts that Kenya offers. The number of
visitors to Tanzania jumped from fewer than 100,000 in 1980 to more
than 300,000 last year, prompting the government to improve roads
needed for safari tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tanzania has just been underdeveloped for years, and they're
beginning to develop it now,'' said Jalal Ebrahim, president of
Safaricentre International, a tour operator in Manhattan Beach,
Calif. ``There were fewer people in the parks in Tanzania, and
that's what attracted visitors. It was more pristine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebrahim, whose company has been sending American travelers on
East African safaris for 13 years, said that his company had
received only one cancellation as a result of the embassy bombings
_ and that he did not expect many more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one cancellation from a couple who decided they were
just going to wait and see what happened,'' he said. ``Our clients
are adventure travelers and most of them are very savvy. They read
a lot, they stay on top of world events.'' They understand, he
said, that increasingly terrorism knows no borders.

<P>
   Q. I'd like to spend the winter at an artist colony or school in
a warm area. Have you any recommendations? _ Dorothy Epstein, Brick
Township, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. First, find a good guide to art schools, colonies and
workshops, since there are many to choose from in all parts of the
country _ although many run in the summer in areas that welcome
skiers in the winter. Also remember that many true artist colonies
are places that do not offer instruction, but are retreats for
working away from most mundane distractions, according to Miriam
Feurle, program coordinator at the Alliance of Artists'
Communities, 2325 East Burnside Street, Portland, Ore. 97214; (503)
797-6988, fax (503)-797-956.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance offers a directory of artists' communities _ many
of which, but not all, are competitive-entry refuges that do not
offer classes _ for $20.95, which includes shipping, by mail or
through its Web site, www.artistcommunities.org/.
</P>
<P>
   A broader listing of art-study opportunities is available
through Shawguides, which offers its Guide to Art and Craft
Workshops ( 1991) for $16.95 from Bookmasters, (800) 247-6553 or
(419) 281-1802, fax (419) 281-6883. This is not updated yearly, but
the Web site, www.shawguides.com/ is, and it allows you to look for
classes by subject or region.

   &UR; A Quick Honeymoon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am getting married this fall and my fiance and I want to go
on a mini-honeymoon of just two nights, within a few hours' drive
of home. Any suggestions? _ Lenore Levy, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are surely many choices within 150 miles of New York,
but a few destinations come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayflower Inn, Route 47, Washington, Conn. 06793, is
definitely romantic _ a number of couples hold their weddings there
each year. This restored inn is set among spectacular gardens in a
quiet corner of Litchfield County. There are 25 rooms,
painstakingly decorated with antiques, an excellent restaurant,
tennis courts, a heated outdoor pool, a spa, aerobics and tai chi
classes and wilderness trails. Doubles range in price from $270 to

868-9466, fax (860) 868-1497.
</P>
<P>
   If you enjoy seaside vacations, consider the Mainstay Inn in
Cape May, N.J., a Victorian former gentlemen's club (read casino).
It has three buildings _ two traditional B&AMP;B's and the more
resortlike Officer's Quarters, with four suites that offer an array
of amenities like fireplaces, in-room Continental breakfast and
whirlpool tubs. All buildings have airy rooms and furnishings that
you might think belong in a museum. There is no smoking in the
buildings. Double-occupancy rates, which include Continental
breakfast and afternoon tea, are $95 to $255. Call (609) 884-8690.
</P>

Office Box 95, Lenox, Mass. 01240, which treats honeymooners to
champagne in their rooms. This Tudor mansion has 23 rooms _ eight
with fireplaces _ divided among the main house, carriage house and
three cottages, on 85 acres, and a splendid restaurant. There are a

   &UR; Getting to Althorp &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to visit Althorp, the ancestral home of Diana,
Princess of Wales, next year. Is there public transportation
available from London? _ Lucy Foster, Stratford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. The closest train station to Althorp, some 70 miles northwest
of London, is Northampton. According Britrail, there are frequent
trains _ as many as three an hour _ from Euston station in London
to Northampton, costing $32 first class or $22 second class each
way for the 75-minute trip.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, shuttle buses took visitors from Northampton to the
estate, several miles out of town. Transportation information was
given out with tickets to tour the estate. But it closed to the
public Aug. 30, and next year's schedule won't be announced for
several months. The telephone number for Althorp ticket information
is (44-1604) 592-020; for Britrail information and tickets, (888)
274-8724.

   &UR; Monet, With a Mint on the Pillow, in Boston &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Several Boston-area hotels and Amtrak are offering packages that
include passes to the exhibition ``Monet in the 20th Century,'' at
the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The show will run from Sunday
through Dec. 27 before traveling to the Royal Academy of Arts in
London. It will include more than 80 paintings produced by Claude
Monet from 1900, when he was 60, until his death at 86.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tickets being sold for the exhibit to the general
public specify a time for entry, the passes that come with the
packages may be used by visitors anytime during their stay,
according to Erin Gobeil, marketing coordinator for the museum.
Both groups of museumgoers may have to wait for up to a half hour
to enter the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak Vacations' Best Buys weekend packages, (888) 268-7251,
include round-trip coach rail fare, two nights at the Midtown Hotel
and a trolley tour of the city. Prices vary depending on the
departure city; from New York City prices start at $279 a person,
double occupancy. Tickets may be included for an additional $17.50.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel packages include accommodations for two and passes to the
Monet exhibit. Breakfast and parking are also included in most
packages. At the Four Seasons Hotel Boston, (617) 338-4400, rates
range from $585 to $760 and include town-car service to the museum
and passes (but not breakfast or parking). Packages are available
at Le Meridien, (617) 451-1900, on Friday and Saturday nights for
$280 a night, and at the Swissotel Boston, (800) 621-9200, on

</P>
<P>
   The Back Bay Hilton package, (800) 445-8667, starts at $260
until Nov. 13, after which it drops to $195. At the Hyatt Regency
Cambridge, (800) 233-1234, instead of breakfast, the package
includes a $25 credit which can be used for room service or in the
restaurants; it costs $285 until Nov. 18, $190 until Dec. 27. The
four-month-old, eight-room Gryphon House, (617) 375-9003, offers a
two-night package on Friday and Saturday or Saturday and Sunday for
$430, and a $215 one-night package on weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   General admission to the Monet exhibition, with a reserved date
and time of entry, is $15 on weekdays, $17.50 on weekends; $13
weekdays and $15 weekends for students and adults over 64, and $5
for children aged 6 to 17. Exhibit information: (617) 542-4632.

   &UR; In London, New Home For Sadler's Wells &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sadler's Wells Theater will get a new home on its old site when
it reopens on Oct. 12, with computerized stage flying machinery,
state-of-the-art lighting and a glass facade that will act as a
video screen. The theater, which dates to 1683, has been closed for
two years for the $82 million construction project. Situated in
Islington, about three miles from central London, Sadler's Wells is
the second oldest working theater in London after Drury Lane. It is
the city's main stage for touring dance companies and was the first
home to the company that eventually became the Royal Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   The design, with an interior by Nick Thompson of Renton Howard
Wood Levin and an exterior by Nicholas Hare Associates, includes a
new auditorium with 1,500 to 1,800 seats. The previously cramped
stage now will accommodate a 60-member corps de ballet or chorus
and 90-piece orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The medicinal springs and waterworks that lie beneath the
theater have also been put to use: the naturally filtered water
will be bottled and sold and will also be used in the air-cooling
system. The bore hole to the well will be presented inside the
theater as a wishing well that will respond with music and lights
when money is placed into it.
</P>
<P>
   Art exhibits will be staged in the enlarged foyer (starting with
an installation by Gary Hume); a small studio space, the Lilian
Baylis, seating 200, will be ready in March.
</P>
<P>
   One of Britain's leading contemporary dance companies, the
Rambert Dance Company, will perform at Sadler's Wells Oct. 12 to
17. The program will include the world premiere of ``New Work,'' by
Christopher Bruce. It will be followed by a season of the Royal
Ballet, still homeless while Covent Garden is renovated. Pieces by
Twyla Tharp, Kenneth MacMillan, Frederick Ashton and Rudolph
Nureyev after Marius Petipa will be given from Oct. 20 to Nov. 7.
Prices are about $13 to $60, based on $1.70 to the pound. Sadler's
Wells, Rosebery Avenue, London EC1R 4TN; (44-171) 863 8000.

   &UR; A Fast Ferry Speeds The Trip to Majorca &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The ferry between Barcelona and Palma de Majorca in the
Mediterranean was a state-run monopoly for 19 years until last
summer, when a new private competitor, Buquebus, introduced a sleek
catamaran that makes the trip in 3 hours and 25 minutes, one hour
faster than the government ferry. Yet both charge the same for a
one-way ticket, $90 in first class, at 141 pesetas to the dollar,
and $58 in tourist class.

<P>
   Buquebus, of Buenos Aires, also has committed to operating its
fast ferry throughout the year, unlike the state-owned
Transmediterranea, which runs a slower eight-hour ferry year-round
but uses its fast ferry only during the summer and other peak
vacation periods, such as the year-end holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Buquebus' five-deck white ferry, named Catalonia after the
northeastern region whose capital is Barcelona, has a large store,
snack bars and a day-care center. It cruises at a maximum of 45
knots and can carry 900 passengers and 240 vehicles. (The fee for a
standard-sized car is about $132.)
</P>
<P>
   The ferry travels between the wharves in central Barcelona and
in Palma, near downtown. The 40-minute flight between the two
cities is $68 to $82 for one-way tourist fare.
</P>
<P>
   Through this month, Buquebus will operate two trips daily in
each direction. Starting Oct. 1, there will be one ferry in each
direction on Monday to Thursday and on Saturday, and two in each
direction on Friday and Sunday. Buquebus telephone: (34)

<P>
   &UR; Shipboard Video Link For Medical Matters &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A live two-way video link will allow passengers who are injured
or become sick while traveling on the 109,000-ton Grand Princess,
the world's newest and largest cruise ship, to get a second
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise ships generally have medical offices and physicians on
board who can consult with other physicians using radios. But the
new system, known as Sea Med, allows on-board doctors to send
video, X-ray images and other information for live consultations
with emergency room physicians at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Med was developed by Image View of Los Angeles to allow
communications with remote locations including commercial ships and
oil platforms.
</P>
<P>
   The system may be installed on the eight other Princess ships,
said Julie Benson, a spokeswoman for the cruise line. Sea Med said
it expects live video imaging to become standard on cruise ships.
Passengers who use the system will have their medical insurance
billed for the cost, Ms. Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Palazzos and Chalets Invite (Paying) Guests) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you don't have to be an aristocrat to live like one.
An Italian bed-and-breakfast chain called Caffelletto, which began
operating a few months ago, offers rooms in more than 60 homes _
some with noble lineage _ throughout Italy. The homes have been
chosen for historic association, location and comfort. The hosts
also have to meet hospitality standards.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company's bilingual guide is divided into 10 regions, each
with a brief description of its character, art, cuisine and people.
There's a chalet at the foot of Mount Marmolada, the highest peak
in the Dolomites, where you can ski in winter and go on nature
walks in summer. Or one might prefer the Villa Pisani, a
17th-century palazzo built by Francesco Cardinal Pisani as his
summer residence in the small town of Vescovana, a short drive from
Padua and Venice. Beautifully frescoed by famous artists of the
time, including Paolo Veronese, the villa is nestled in its own
landscaped park where guests can wander, swim or ride.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another choice, the Sosta a' Busini, a Medici villa built in
1400, is about 18 miles east of Florence and surrounded by a
272-acre park that offers swimming and tennis and a working farm
where Chianti wine and olive oil are produced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prices start at $27 a person, double occupancy, for lodgings
with private bath and breakfast, and range up to $48 to $90 a
person in the luxury category. Many homes will also provide meals
on request. Bookings can be made by telephone Monday through Friday
from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 3 to 6 p.m. Italy time, which is six
hours ahead of Eastern time, or by fax or e-mail. The guidebook,
$12 plus about $10 shipping and handling, can be ordered by e-mail
(info(AT)caffelletto.it) or fax. Contact Caffelletto, 23 Via di
Marciola, 50020 San Vincenzo a Torri, Firenze, Italy; (39-055)

EURO TRANSLATES CURRENCY BABEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Sept. 13)  
(JT) 
 By ROGER COLLIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Travelers will love the euro _ the new single European currency
_ which officially came into being on May 1. They'll no longer have
to figure out how many zillion lire to the dollar or pesetas to the
French franc or Deutsche marks to the guilder _ plus they'll save a
fortune not having to change money back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   And one currency will make European price comparisons much
easier. The fact that a 1.5-liter bottle of Coca-Cola might cost
3.02 marks or 6.50 francs is baffling. But from Jan. 1 _ the start
of a three-year transition period _ double price lists will show
French Coke costing, say, 98 euro-cents compared with 1.30 euros in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   During this transition, the rates of exchange between the euro
and the particular currency of each nation that uses it will be
irrevocably fixed, so there will not be a daily euro-franc exchange
rate, for example, to worry about. Consumer organizations will
publish price comparisons of popular items in the 11 countries of
the euro zone. And it will be much easier to shop for the best
cross-border air fares, hotel rates and other travel services in
different countries.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of the euro has been hailed as momentous, creating
the largest currency union in financial history, with the euro
rivaling the dollar and the yen on the money markets. But until
January, when the euro starts to be traded, travelers will notice
little change.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the only difference travelers are likely to see is
that shops, restaurants and hotels may display their prices in
euros as well as the local currency. With euro notes and coins not
due to enter circulation for another three years, transactions in
euros may seem unreal: an invisible currency that everyone is
talking about and more and more people are using _ even the
British, whose self-imposed exclusion from the euro means that they
won't join the European Monetary Union (the agreement that created
the euro) until at least 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But travelers should start thinking euros right from the start,
and make as many transactions as possible in euros when this
becomes possible next year. If you have problems figuring it all
out, take heart. You can be sure that many Europeans are just as
confused. And as Groucho might have said: ``If you play your cards
right, you can keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   A Frenchman I know still believes that one franc will equal one
euro and that prices will therefore be the same across Europe.
Otherwise, what's the point? he says. He may well have a point; but
that's another story. The euro is a political project, designed to
propel the nations of Western Europe toward political union.
Creating the euro is one thing, but success is not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Europe seems to do many things in stages: Airline deregulation
was finally achieved on April 1, 1997, after a series of reforms
that started in 1987. The European Monetary Union will take a mere
four years.

 UNDATED: four years.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The countdown for the euro began in May 1998 when European Union
finance ministers met in Brussels to agree upon the 11 countries _
France, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Ireland,
Austria, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Finland _ which will
participate in the ``first wave'' of the single currency on Jan. 1.
The four European Union members who are not joining right away are
Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece. Britain, Denmark and Sweden
may join the second wave around 2002, while Greece (unlike most
other countries) has not yet been able to fudge the tough limits on
debt levels, inflation and interest rates _ the ``convergence
criteria'' set by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, the euro will become the official currency of the 11
participating countries _ although not in the form of cash.
National currencies will still exist alongside the euro, which can
be used in noncash transactions, such as credit card payments,
checks and direct debits. Countries not using the single currency,
like Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece, will continue to
experience exchange-rate fluctuations against the euro.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth stating the obvious that there will be no
exchange-rate cost between, say, the euro and the French franc,
because it is not a foreign currency transaction, simply an
``expression'' of the same money. It is the official exchange rate
that has to be used (something to watch out for with rogue
traders).
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, 2002, euro notes and coins will be introduced and all
prices will be posted in euros. National currencies will gradually
be withdrawn and will cease to be legal tender by June 30, 2002, at
the latest. Designer Cash
</P>
<P>
   When they arrive in 2002, not all euro notes and coins will look
the same. (You didn't expect it to be that simple, did you?) One
face will be the same for all euro countries; the other side will
bear suitable motifs to salvage national sentiments in a brave
united Europe. There will be eight coins _ 1- and 2-euro pieces and
1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 euro-cents; notes will be in 5, 10, 20, 50,
100, 200 and 500 euros _ different colors, but all the same size,
like United States bills. The decision to issue the
500-denomination notes was made to placate Germany, which issues
notes up to a face value of 1,000 marks.
</P>
<P>
   At a euro-dollar exchange rate of 1.10, the new 500 euro note
will correspond to $550 _ a rival to United States bills as the
underworld's currency of choice. Instead of lugging thick wads of
$100 bills in a suitcase, you will be able to pack $1 million worth
of 500-euro notes into a purse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a little less than four months away from the euro,
double pricing is appearing in banks and shops across Europe. Banks
and retailers are giving away euro pocket calculators to convert
back and forth with the local currency.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers should start collecting them to become familiar with
the rates and to compare prices _ and therefore the euro value of
goods and services in different countries. Even in Britain _
perhaps especially in Britain _ where sterling will still reign,
major retailers will accept euros and major businesses are starting
to denominate contracts in euros, forcing smaller suppliers to do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-year transition period, there will be no
obligation for merchants to accept euros and no compulsion for you
to pay in euros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travelers will be able to pay for tickets in euros or local
currency right from the start,'' says Anita Macleod, head of a euro
task force at the International Air Transport Association in
Geneva. ``We will have common ticket stock available that accepts
the euro or local currency _ but we're not forcing airlines to deal
in euros.''
</P>
<P>
   Henri Ruff, head of euro at Visa International in London, said:
``The euro is going to make prices much more competitive across
borders. Americans will find it easier to shop for holidays and
trips across Europe because they'll be able to compare prices in
euros. This transparency, this ability to compare, will influence
the market and perhaps bring prices more in line across borders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss and Norwegians are well prepared for the euro, he
said, with hotels and restaurants ready to accept it as a foreign
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect in the so-called front-line states in Eastern Europe
_ Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, cities like Prague exposed to
tourists _ that hotels and stores will accept euros from Day 1,''
Ruff said, ``in the same way that they might accept dollars or
German marks now, leading possibly to unofficial _ meaning more
favorable _ exchange rates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our advice is to start dealing in euros wherever possible,''
he added. ``We'll have euro traveler checks ready for Jan. 1. And
start paying in euros wherever possible on your charge card.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardholders who want to pay in euros at places that are prepared
to accept euros can do so, Ruff said, and they don't have to worry
about whether their cards will work. ``We expect card usage to
increase, because it's the only way in the transition period for
people to trade in euros,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers can expect wider swings in exchange rates between the
dollar (or other currencies) and the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro itself will probably be a fairly volatile currency
for a period of years,'' said William Essex, an investment

Italy is weak, so they've got to settle which is dominant within
the euro zone, whether Germany's strength is more influential on
the currency than the peseta.'' He also said that a lot of currency

   &UR; Sunny Art Classes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to spend the winter at an artist colony or school in
a warm area. Have you any recommendations? _ Dorothy Epstein, Brick
Township, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. First, find a good guide to art schools, colonies and
workshops, since there are many to choose from in all parts of the
country _ although many run in the summer in areas that welcome
skiers in the winter. Also remember that many true artist colonies
are places that do not offer instruction, but are retreats for
working away from most mundane distractions, according to Miriam
Feurle, program coordinator at the Alliance of Artists'
Communities, 2325 East Burnside Street, Portland, Ore. 97214; (503)
797-6988, fax (503)-797-956.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance offers a directory of artists' communities _ many
of which, but not all, are competitive-entry refuges that do not
offer classes _ for $20.95, which includes shipping, by mail or
through its Web site, www.artistcommunities.org/.
</P>
<P>
   A broader listing of art-study opportunities is available
through Shawguides, which offers its Guide to Art and Craft
Workshops ( 1991) for $16.95 from Bookmasters, (800) 247-6553 or
(419) 281-1802, fax (419) 281-6883. This is not updated yearly, but
the Web site, www.shawguides.com/ is, and it allows you to look for
classes by subject or region.
</P>
<P>
   Among those that may meet your desires are these three:
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale Artists' School, 3720 North Marshall Way, Post Office
Box 8527, Scottsdale, Ariz. 85252; (800) 333-5707, fax (602)
990-0652. This organization offers dozens of five-day workshops
through the winter taught by visiting professional artists from
around the country, costing $375 to $500. It also offers classes
one day a week for 10 to 12 weeks. It doesn't provide lodging, but
arranges for discounts from hotels and motels.
</P>
<P>
   Konis Art offers a chance to ``paint and party'' in Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, Feb. 6 to 15. Taught by Ben Konis, who
specializes in pastels and oils, classes are held four hours on
each of five days of the trip. There will be informal Spanish
lessons at cocktail hours. Accommodations at the villa Casa de los
Abuelos and all meals _ but not air fare _ are included in the
price of $2,125. Contact Jini Konis, Workshop Director, 712 West
17th St., Amarillo, Texas 79102; (806) 373-8458, fax (806)
354-2148.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Center for the Arts offers more of a residency
experience. Teachers choose up to 10 students for the five to six
sessions _ lasting from one to three weeks _ from slides, a resume
and a letter of intent. But Jim Frost, assistant to the program
director, says the program is not limited to experienced artists
and encourages anyone to apply.
</P>
<P>
   A three-week residency costs $800, including a private room with
bath, communal living space and kitchen. Transportation and meals
are extra. The center is at 1414 Art Center Ave., New Smyrna Beach,
Fla. 32168; (904) 427-6975, fax (904) 427-5669;
www.atlantic-centerarts.org.

<P>
   &UR; A Quick Honeymoon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am getting married this fall and my fiance and I want to go
on a mini-honeymoon of just two nights, within a few hours' drive
of home. Any suggestions? _ Lenore Levy, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are surely many choices within 150 miles of New York,
but a few destinations come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayflower Inn, Route 47, Washington, Conn. 06793, is
definitely romantic _ a number of couples hold their weddings there
each year. This restored inn is set among spectacular gardens in a
quiet corner of Litchfield County. There are 25 rooms,
painstakingly decorated with antiques, an excellent restaurant,
tennis courts, a heated outdoor pool, a spa, aerobics and tai chi

868-9466, fax (860) 868-1497.
</P>
<P>
   If you enjoy seaside vacations, consider the Mainstay Inn in
Cape May, N.J., a Victorian former gentlemen's club (read casino).
It has three buildings _ two traditional B&AMP;B's and the more
resortlike Officer's Quarters, with four suites that offer an array
of amenities like fireplaces, in-room Continental breakfast and
whirlpool tubs. All buildings have airy rooms and furnishings that
you might think belong in a museum. There is no smoking in the
buildings. Double-occupancy rates, which include Continental
breakfast and afternoon tea, are $95 to $255. Call (609) 884-8690.
</P>
<P>
   Fall is prime season to enjoy the Berkshires and Blantyre, Post
Office Box 95, Lenox, Mass. 01240, which treats honeymooners to
champagne in their rooms. This Tudor mansion has 23 rooms _ eight
with fireplaces _ divided among the main house, carriage house and

</P>
<P>
   For an active retreat, Skytop Lodge, Skytop, Pa. 18357, in the
Poconos is a large, picturesque, old-fashioned fieldstone resort on
5,500 acres that include a golf course, tennis courts, a lake for
boating, streams for fishing and trails for biking and hiking.
There are 185 rooms, including 19 suites, decorated in English
country or contemporary style. A Romantic Getaway package,

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Getting to Althorp &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to visit Althorp, the ancestral home of Diana,
Princess of Wales, next year. Is there public transportation
available from London? _ Lucy Foster, Stratford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. The closest train station to Althorp, some 70 miles northwest
of London, is Northampton. According Britrail, there are frequent
trains _ as many as three an hour _ from Euston station in London
to Northampton, costing $32 first class or $22 second class each
way for the 75-minute trip.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, shuttle buses took visitors from Northampton to the
estate, several miles out of town. Transportation information was
given out with tickets to tour the estate. But it closed to the
public Aug. 30, and next year's schedule won't be announced for
several months. The telephone number for Althorp ticket information
is (44-1604) 592-020; for Britrail information and tickets, (888)
274-8724.

 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLYMOUTH, Mass. _ After nearly 13 years in prison, convicted of
raping children at his family's suburban Boston day care center
despite his avowals of innocence, Gerald Amirault says he is
pinning his hopes on new science to get him out.
</P>
<P>
   Not on microbiology; not on DNA testing. No physical evidence of
that sort exists against Amirault, his sister and their late
mother. All three were convicted in 1986 and 1987 in the Fells
Acres Day School case, which has become the longest-running of the
highly publicized day-care sexual abuse cases that swept the
country back then.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Amirault is counting on the science of psychology. And
judging by a blistering ruling this summer in his sister's legal
battle, he may have a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Those day care cases, it turns out, from the McMartin Preschool
in California to Wee Care in New Jersey, set off an explosion of
psychological research into the accuracy of children's memories and
reporting of events.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, researchers estimate, 500 studies have been
conducted on children's ``suggestibility'' _ the extent to which
suggestions implanted by adult interviewers can influence
children's recollections and accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Though debate still burns high on some points _ like the general
level of children's accuracy and how resistant they are to
disclosing that they have been abused _ researchers describe an
emerging consensus over how children should be interviewed to
minimize false reports.
</P>
<P>
   Warring camps of psychologists also appear to have reached broad
agreement on this basic picture: The vast majority of the tens of
thousands of child sexual abuse accusations each year are true, and
most children display a tremendous capacity to be accurate; but
under certain conditions, if they are pushed and prodded in the
wrong ways, children may say false things. And preschoolers of 3
and 4 tend to be more suggestible than older children.
</P>
<P>
   It was that body of research that underlay the Massachusetts
Superior Court ruling by Judge Isaac Borenstein in June that
Amirault's sister, Cheryl Amirault LeFave, should be granted a new
trial on her conviction of sexual abuse because of new scientific
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overzealous and inadequately trained investigators, perhaps
unaware of the grave dangers of using improper interviewing and
investigative techniques, questioned these children and their
parents in a climate of panic, if not hysteria, creating a highly
prejudicial and irreparable set of mistakes,'' the judge wrote.
``These grave errors led to the testimony of the children being
forever tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein is not the first to cite suggestibility research in
overturning a ruling made when it was all but given among
clinicians _ based more on gut instinct than data _ that children
would never lie about sexual abuse. The research played a role in a
New Jersey appeals court's 1993 decision to free Margaret Kelly
Michaels, who was convicted in 1988 in the Wee Care case, and has
figured in other rulings and verdicts. The Michaels decision noted
that ``certain questions planted sexual information in the
children's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The developing consensus has been emerging in guidelines set by
associations of psychiatrists, psychologists and other
professionals who deal with accusations of child sexual abuse.
Among the rules of thumb are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Children should be interviewed in the most open-ended way
possible at first, allowed to engage in ``free recall'' rather than
responding to specific questions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in its 1997 guidelines for evaluating children who
may have been abused, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry recommends that interviewers' initial questions should
not be ``leading or suggestive and should be phrased in such a way
that an inability to recall or lack of knowledge is acceptable. A
leading question is, `Uncle Joe touched your bottom, didn't he?' A
suggestive question is: `Did Uncle Joe touch your bottom?' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ The interviewers should be as unbiased as possible about
whether abuse actually occurred, because studies have shown that
interviewer bias can influence responses from children eager to
please adults.
</P>
<P>
   _ No bribes, threats or peer pressure should be brought to bear
on the children. There should be no ``Johnny told me. Why won't
you?''
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of interviews, repetitious questions and leading
questions should be kept to a minimum. Many communities around the
country, including virtually every major city, have set up
children's assessment centers over the last several years so that
children who may have been abused can often undergo one-stop
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   _ Interviews should be carefully documented and preserved so the
record can be checked for tainting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Children should not be encouraged to imagine acts that did not
occur. Such imaginings, studies have shown, can sometimes be
confused with real memories.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Anatomically detailed'' dolls, dolls with genitalia meant to
help children demonstrate the abuse perpetrated on them, should be
used with great care if at all. Research has shown that a child's
natural interest in the dolls' sexual organs can sometimes mislead,
though the dolls are also known to help children disclose abuse.
The guidelines of the American Professional Society on the Abuse of
Children say: ``Anatomical dolls should not be used as a diagnostic
test for sexual abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of a consensus about child suggestibility has
carried particular scientific drama because of the high stakes
involved: Underestimate the power of suggestibility and innocent
people could go to jail; overestimate it, and abused children might
not be believed, traumatizing them still more and allowing child
abusers to victimize more children.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Worries that abuse is under-reported have been bolstered by
suggestibility studies showing that children are likelier to lie by
denying something although it really happened than by making
something up that never occurred, noted Dr. Carolyn Newberger, an
expert on sexual abuse who works at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would indicate there are far more children who are abused
and don't let anyone know than who are not abused and tell someone
they are,'' Dr. Newberger said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet disclosure is critical, because diagnosing child sexual
abuse sometimes remains difficult. The American Academy of Child
and Adolescent Psychiatry guidelines note that studies have shown
that no one symptom characterizes a majority of sexually abused
children, and about one-third of victims exhibit no symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   What researchers have done, then, is to progressively close in
on sexual abuse by creating or exploiting situations like it, as
well as conditions and strategies that mimic those of forensic
interviews, then building a case and plugging holes, in study after
study after study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying they're the perfect analogue of sex abuse, but
you look at research as a building process,'' said Dr. Stephen
Ceci, a Cornell University developmental psychologist who has been
a leader of the camp of researchers who emphasize how suggestible
children are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each new study tries to rule out some weakness in the prior
studies,'' Ceci said. ``People looked at painful things,
embarrassing things, genital things, within a whole web of motives:
lying to protect loved ones; lying to avoid embarrassment; lying to
gain material reward; lying to avoid punishment; lying to keep
secrets; lying to sustain a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggestibility studies once focused largely on asking a
misleading question and seeing how it affected children's
perceptions of an event they had witnessed. Now, many studies have
moved toward focusing more on personally salient events, in
situations more reminiscent of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit for Ms. LeFave's motion for a new trial, Dr.
Maggie Bruck of McGill University, another top researcher in Ceci's
camp, cited a 1996 study from the Monographs of the Society for
Research in Child Development. The researchers, Margaret Steward
and David Steward, interviewed children using anatomical dolls
three times after a pediatric clinic visit. ``With each interview,
children's false reports of anal touching increased,'' Dr. Bruck
wrote. ``By the final interview, which took place six months after
the initial visit, more than one-third of the children falsely
reported anal touching.''
</P>
<P>
   But other studies by Dr. Gail Goodman, a University of
California at Davis psychologist and a foremost suggestibility
researcher in the camp that tends to emphasize children's
truthfulness, highlighted the great accuracy of children's reports
even in such intimate situations. Dr. Goodman and colleagues
studied the accounts of children who had been catheterized for a
necessary test of the urinary tract that the researchers considered
the closest medical procedure to child abuse _ embarrassing,
genital and painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done that's somewhat different from what Ceci
usually does is we ask very abuse-related questions,'' she said.
``He asks, `Did they tear up the teddy bear and spill coffee on
you?' And we ask, `Didn't he touch your bottom,` or, `How many
times did he kiss you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``We find,'' she said, ``that once the kids are around 5 years
of age, they're just surprisingly accurate on those kinds of
questions. The 3-year-olds tend to make more like 25 percent errors
on average.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the focus is also shifting to the individual
differences that make one child much more suggestible than another,
and to experimental interviewing techniques that help children tell
more without contaminating their memories.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one other great point of consensus among child-abuse
experts, it is on the great need for even more training of social
workers, police investigators, psychologists and others in the
proper way to deal with children who may have been abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consensus about what people say they should do shouldn't be
confused with what's actually happening,'' said Michael Lamb, a
researcher at the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development in Bethesda, Md. ``We've found that in fact, in the
field, the overwhelming majority of the questions put to children
during investigative interviews are more focused questions and only
between 2 and 6 percent are actually open-ended.''
</P>
<P>
   True to Lamb's findings, cases are still cropping up in which
highly questionable interviewing techniques have been used. The
Washington branch of the American Civil Liberties Union has
complained that in the 1994 Wenatchee sex-ring case in Washington
state, the police investigation violated several basic tenets of
interviewing; among them, children were threatened with punishment
or marathon interrogation if they did not say that they had been
sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gerald Amirault, he is serving his 30- to 40-year prison
sentence and watching what happens as prosecutors appeal the ruling
in his sister's case to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.
If the ruling holds, Amirault can try a similar appeal, said his
lawyer, Daniel Williams of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintain that the Amiraults got fair trials, and the
state supreme court has repeatedly ruled against the family. But
the court has never dealt with a lower court ruling like
Borenstein's.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 when he was on trial, Amirault said, ``It was looked at
as right to question the children the way they did.''
</P>
<P>
   But back then, he noted, suggestibility research ``was a brand
new area, a brand spanking new area. The expert pool hadn't even
been established. So I couldn't even find experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``The way you perceive everything is looked at in a totally
different light,'' he said. ``I would love to go back to trial.''

pay smart, ambitious workers a relatively low base salary _ along
with the promise of great riches if their sweat and creativity help
the ventures to take off. Along the way, that phenomenon seems to
have sparked a unique brand of investment psychology that can be

volatility that might be unimaginable to a more traditional
mutual-fund investor. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

`AT HOME IN THE WORLD': MORE OF HER LIFE, AND LOVE, TO LOOK BACK
ON  
 (PUBLICATION NOTES AT END)  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Promotional copy from the publisher of Joyce Maynard's new
memoir says: `` `At Home in the World' is the story of a girl who
loved and lived with J.D. Salinger, and the woman she became.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a misleading description that gives the wrong impression _
namely, the impression that this volume is simply a crass attempt
to cash in on our celebrity-obsessed culture's appetite for gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Although many readers will doubtless find the Salinger chapters
the most compelling _ and unsettling _ part of this book, ``At Home
in the World'' is not a sleazy tell-all memoir about the author's
affair with a famous (and famously reclusive) man. It's actually an
earnest, if at times self-serving, autobiography that, in the
course of tracing the author's coming of age, delineates her first
serious love affair, one that happened to be with the author of
``Catcher in the Rye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At Home'' is too solipsistic, too beholden to the confessional
tenets of the therapeutic movement to be a first-rate memoir. But
if it often bears an uncomfortable resemblance to an analyst's
session, it's also a far cry from ``Here but Not Here,'' Lillian
Ross' self-aggrandizing account of her affair with the New Yorker
editor William Shawn.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Ms. Maynard is no newcomer to the craft of
autobiography. She first came to national attention in 1972 with an
essay titled ``An 18-Year-Old Looks Back on Life,'' published in
The New York Times Magazine, and has since continued to chronicle
her own life through columns, essays, books and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with those earlier forays into autobiography, ``At
Home'' demonstrates a marked leap forward in maturity and emotional
candor. The sanctimonious world-weariness affected in ``An
18-Year-Old'' _ in which Ms. Maynard presumed to speak for her
generation _ has been replaced by a more direct, uninflected voice,
just as the cloying tone of many of her essays has given way to a
more unsparing brand of self-scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Maynard writes in this volume with a sort of double
vision, recreating the girl and young woman she was while at the
same time looking at that younger self through the retrospective
lens of middle age. She points out that she once used her
storytelling skills to create ``a family mythology more comfortable
than the real one'' she couldn't ``bear to acknowledge,'' and that
the ``youth-spokesperson'' persona she frequently adopted was just
that: a persona that enabled her to pretend to be the
``all-American girl, the Miss Teen-Age America of print'' that she
knew she wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her youth, Ms. Maynard now tells us, she felt like a
misfit, cut off from her schoolmates in the small town of Durham,
N.H. This was in large part a consequence of her anomalous
childhood, as the younger daughter of an overbearing mother and an
alcoholic father who shared extravagant dreams for her future.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Maynard recalls that her mother lavished her Martha
Stewart skills on the family, knitting a sweater for one of Joyce's
stuffed animals with toothpicks, she also subjected her daughter to
sexually suggestive cuddling. Her father, too, had a
Jekyll-and-Hyde-like personality. Her daytime father, a professor
at the University of New Hampshire, was ``trim, handsome,
fastidious, funny, brilliant, and courtly.'' ``Nighttime Daddy,''
the drinker, was ``rageful and depressed'' _ ``unshaven, unkempt,
red-eyed and ranting.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushed to achieve the kind of worldly success that had eluded
her parents, the young Joyce became a willfully ambitious child,
desperate to win their approval. At 8 or 9, she wrote to the
president of CBS, suggesting she might play the daughter on ``The
Danny Thomas Show.'' At 15, she wrote the Children's Television
Workshop, suggesting it include a teen-age character _ to be played
by herself _ on ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is this precocity (reminiscent of qualities possessed
by the Glass children) that first attracts the attention of J.D.
Salinger. After reading her 1972 article in The Times Magazine (and
seeing her photo), he writes her a fan letter, she recalls, and the
two start corresponding: Salinger, telling her they're soul mates
and rhapsodizing about her writing, while Ms. Maynard natters on _
tailoring her ``language to suit him'' _ about her life as a
freshman at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the letters give way to phone calls, and the phone
calls to visits. The second time Ms. Maynard visits Salinger's New
Hampshire home, she says, they end up in his bedroom. Within
months, she has dropped out of Yale and moved in with him. Her
parents' reaction is decidedly odd: they not only shrug off the
35-year difference between their daughter and her 53-year-old
companion, but actually give the relationship the seal of their
approval.
</P>
<P>
   As depicted by Ms. Maynard, Salinger emerges as an eccentric
curmudgeon, dedicated to the practice of homeopathic medicine and
so obsessed with the strictures of his diet (mainly raw fruits,
vegetables and nuts) that he forces himself to throw up whenever he
eats something bad. Although he is occasionally playful, even
childish, she says, he is more often bitter, judgmental and
suspicious. He dismisses doctors, Ms. Maynard writes, as a ``bunch
of cardigan-wearers who couldn't cut it on the PGA tour,'' declares
that ``a lot of jazz is outright fraud,'' and rails against
political leaders, therapists, feminists, the publishing
establishment and John Updike.
</P>
<P>
   It's not long before this outlook is passed on to Ms. Maynard,
reinforcing her own sense of alienation. ``In one way or another,''
Ms. Maynard writes, ``what Jerry is telling me all that spring and
summer returns to one relentless refrain. `You are alone in the
world. Nobody else is like you. No one will understand you.''' When
she expresses excitement over being interviewed on the subject of
the '60s, she recalls, he tells her: ``These people have corrupted
you. They've made you a worldly, greedy, hungry person.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship ends less than a year after it started, Ms.
Maynard writes, when Salinger takes her on a trip to Daytona Beach,
Fla., with his two children, then abruptly tells her to go home and
remove her things from his house. When she confronts him some 20
years later _ after her own marriage and divorce, and the birth of
three children _ she reports that he has little to say. ``I didn't
exploit you!'' she recalls him as saying.  &UR; ``I don't even know
you.'' &LR;

A CLEANER HARBOR LURES WATER BIRDS TO NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Each year, 1,700 tankers bring 18 billion gallons of
oil into New York Harbor. And each day huge barges carry 14,000
tons of garbage to the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island. The
harbor, also heavily trafficked by container ships, gravel boats,
tugs and pleasure craft, hardly seems a good place for fish-eating
birds to settle and raise their families. Surely they would never
choose to live among the flotsam and jetsam and just plain trash
washing up on the shores, nor among wrecked ships and docks and
long-abandoned buildings on islands that look nothing like a
wildlife refuge. Surely elegant snowy egrets or black-crowned night
herons would never call a place like that home.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they would and they do.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, undeterred by PCBs, noise, odors and
other types of pollutants, exploding populations of herons and
egrets, glossy ibises and double-crested cormorants have joined the
ubiquitous gulls that call the harbor home. Thousands of
long-legged waders have no compunctions about nesting in unkempt
spots or dining on fish and shellfish from polluted water.
Although, to humans, several of the harbor islands and their
environs may look like slums, to the birds they resemble an
Everglades paradise, replete with food and nesting sites and free
of threats from people, raccoons and most other predators.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the species now thriving here had once been
threatened with extinction; others had never been known to nest
anywhere near New York City. Their expanding presence in the harbor
is testament to the incredible resilience of nature, once it is
given half a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The birds live, breed and feed on islands never visited and
rarely noticed by most New Yorkers despite their proximity to the
five boroughs _ North and South Brother Islands between Queens and
The Bronx; U Thant Island in the East River, a hefty stone's throw
from the United Nations; Shooter's Island in the Kill (or stream)
Van Kull; Prall's Island and the Isle of Meadows in the Arthur Kill
between Staten Island and New Jersey, and Swinburne and Hoffman
Islands in Lower New York Bay between Brooklyn and Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   These harbor islands, along with the islands of Jamaica Bay and
a few islands east of the Bronx in Long Island Sound, comprise
fewer than 1,000 acres, said Dr. Paul Kerlinger, an environmental
consultant. Yet Kerlinger reported in the current issue of Living
Bird Quarterly, the annual surveys he conducts with volunteers from
the New York City Audubon Society, that the harbor islands alone
are breeding grounds for nearly 1,000 pairs of black-crowned night
herons and several hundred pairs each of snowy egrets, great
egrets, cattle egrets and glossy ibises.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to mention the rapidly expanding populations of
double-crested cormorants, sleek black fish eaters that had not
been known to nest in New York Harbor until eight years ago. There
are now _ count them _ about 960 breeding pairs of cormorants in
the harbor, where the federally protected birds have so far escaped
persecution by fishermen who elsewhere view them as competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly says something about the quality of the
water,'' said Peter Mott, president of the New York City Audubon
Society, as he toured the islands by boat recently. Mott said that
in 1960 no egrets or ibises were nesting in the harbor and a mere
sighting of an ibis in 1950 ``was so unusual that I played hooky
from school just to see one.''
</P>
<P>
   He credits the Clean Water Act of 1972 for the fact that the
harbor is now hospitable to myriad aquatic species _ from snails
and tiny shrimp to crabs and bait fish _ and the long-legged wading
birds that depend on such fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1970, if you put mummichog into the Arthur Kill in summer,
it quickly died for lack of oxygen,'' he recalled. Mummichog, a
salt marsh fish used for bait, is a favored food of black-crowned
night herons, among other waders. The Clean Water Act mandated a
reduction in the amount of fecal and other organic matter that
could be contained in the effluent of sewage treatment plants. This
meant that there was less oxidizable material in the processed
sewage, which in turn meant that oxygen levels in harbor waters
into which the treated sewage was dumped could rise to a point that
could sustain aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the level of dissolved oxygen falls below 3 parts per
million, the water can't support most fish life or invertebrate
life,'' Mott said. ``Now in the Arthur Kill, 64 percent of the
fresh water comes out of sewage plants.''
</P>
<P>
   But organic matter from sewage is not the only contributor to an
oxygen shortage in waters surrounding a big metropolis like New
York. Mott said that runoff from the rain and snow that reaches the
harbor has very low oxygen levels.
</P>
<P>
   One need not go any further than tiny U Thant Island, named for
the former secretary-general of the United Nations, to witness the
consequence of cleaner harbor waters. Cormorants have built nine
nests in the island's two spindly trees, and the other day the
residents of those nests were feeding furiously on a school of
small fish that had become confused by a rip in the current just
north of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Cormorants are not the only inhabitants of this rocky
outcropping in the East River. Their companions include a young
herring gull and a young black-backed gull, ``both of which
probably hatched on the island,'' Mott said, and several spotted
sandpipers. In addition to the trees, there is a gridwork of steel
tubing erected as a memorial to the former secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   A little farther north on South Brother Island, in the shadow of
Riker's Island, about 850 cormorants have claimed squatter's
rights. In fact, there are so many of the birds that their noxious
droppings have killed most of the trees where they nest and
threaten to render the island inhospitable to black-crowned night
herons, which are still the most abundant long-legged waders in the
harbor. Here and on neighboring North Brother Island, where a
long-defunct sanitarium once housed Typhoid Mary, ``about 1,000
black-crowned night herons and 200 snowy egrets raise their chicks
every year,'' wrote Margaret Mittelbach and Michael Crewdson in
their book ``Wild New York'' (Crown, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   On Shooter's Island, once a thriving shipyard at the foot of
Newark Bay and now a veritable sanctuary for wading birds, hundreds
of great egrets and snowy egrets build platter-sized nests on the
island's low-growing cherry trees each spring, Ms. Mittelbach and
Crewdson noted. Nesting egrets were first spotted on this shipping
channel island in 1974, and in each successive year there are more.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katherine Parsons of the Manomet Bird Observatory in
Massachusetts and collaborators, who studied bird colonies in the
harbor for a decade, found the most productive salt marsh among the
shipwrecks at the west end of Shooter's Island. There, surrounded
by the decaying wrecks and dry docks, ``hundreds of young herons
get their first food-finding experience,'' Mott said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   The cormorant population on Shooter's Island was set back about
five years ago when someone set fire to some of the old wooden
structures that supported their nests. Mott said dry docks are
ideal nesting places for cormorants because their excrement cannot
destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   An oil spill in 1990, which dumped 567,000 gallons of fuel oil
into the Arthur Kill and contaminated the surrounding salt marsh,
took its toll on glossy ibises, which depend on marsh snails for
sustenance, and snowy egrets, which feed along the edge of the
marsh on mummichogs and silversides.
</P>
<P>
   But with the cleanup and salt marsh restoration undertaken by
the city's Department of Parks and Recreation, the birds have
returned. The restoration was financed with $1 million from a trust
fund established by Exxon Corp. to settle charges that it was
responsible for the spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Altogether, on island rookeries throughout New York Harbor,
more than 4,000 wading birds are nesting,'' Ms. Mittelbach and
Crewdson wrote in their book about New York City's wildlife.
``These birds have chosen their sites so well that most New Yorkers
will never see a heron's nest. In addition to being almost totally
inaccessible (the harbor acts like an enormous moat), the islands
are near sparsely populated, industrial areas where, despite
passing boats, the birds can keep a relatively low profile.''
</P>
<P>
   But while they keep their nests well-concealed, the birds think
nothing of drifting inland to feed, and city dwellers are often
treated to the sight of an island-dwelling heron, especially a
great egret or black-crowned night heron, stalking its prey in the
freshwater ponds and lakes of city parks. Like most people, these
birds are ``generalists,'' who enjoy variety in their diet. The
black-crowned night heron, most numerous perhaps because it is
least fussy about what it eats, dines on everything from fish and
crayfish to frogs and insects, Mott said.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow-crowned night herons, on the other hand, are
``specialists'' who feed almost exclusively on fiddler crabs in New
York Harbor, he said. Their dietary restrictions contribute to the
fact that they are the least populous of the long-legged waders in
the area, with only nine nesting pairs counted last year on the
harbor islands.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, the most omnivorous of sea birds are the
gulls. Until the 1600s, Mott said, herring gulls nested only north
and east of Portland, Maine They headed south when Europeans
settled on these shores. Commercial fishing piers and garbage dumps
provided the birds with a year-round food supply. Then at the turn
of this century, the demand for their feathers by the millinery
trade decimated the population of herring gulls on the east coast.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1970, Mott said, ``these island nesters occupied
virtually every suitable island from Newfoundland to Virginia.'' In
New York Harbor, however, the annual bird counts have detected a
decline in the herring gull population, Mott said, ``maybe because
garbage dumps have been closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerlinger said: ``The gulls specialize in garbage because it's
easy. They also eat fish, shellfish and any meat-type food that
washes up on the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible reason for the decline in gulls, Kerlinger
said, is the succession of plant growth on the dredge-built islands
where they've been nesting. Gulls need sandy, open habitat for
their nests; the trees and shrubs now growing up on the islands
near the Fresh Kills landfill are reducing available nest sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent harbor tour revealed no shortage of gulls. The
railing of the fence that surrounds the landfill was fully occupied
by hundreds of gulls, mostly great black-backed gulls of various
vintages, evenly perched like targets in a shooting gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the gulls have been in a steady decline, there is no
conservation worry about it,'' Kerlinger said. ``The balance of
nature is not really balanced. Populations wax and wane and move
from island to island.
</P>
<P>
   Through his annual surveys of bird life in the harbor, Kerlinger
said: ``I hope to learn more about the dynamics of populations.
What are the normal fluctuations? We now have 14 years of data on
the birds inhabiting the harbor islands. It's a giant mosaic, with
the numbers changing from year to year and from island to island as
the birds change nesting places. We're still in the early stages of
trying to know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   How to See the Harbor Birds
</P>
<P>
   The boats that regularly travel through harbor waters, like the
Circle Line and the ferries, do not go close enough to the islands
to permit viewing of the birds. But the New York City Audubon
Society operates an annual benefit cruise to the harbor islands in
May. For more information, contact the society at 212-691-7483.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Digging in a cemetery on the Arctic island of Spitsbergen,
Norway, medical scientists found the seven coffins they were
looking for, but the coffins lay in shallow graves _ not what they
wanted to find. They had hoped they would be 6 feet deep, in
permafrost, where the bodies would still be frozen and well
preserved 80 years after dying in the terrible influenza pandemic
of 1918.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists would not describe the condition of the seven
bodies after years of seasonal freezing and thawing. But they said
the victims, young coal miners, appeared to have been buried in
haste, probably out of fear of the contagion that had claimed their
lives. Their bodies had been buried without clothes, wrapped only
in newspapers. The graves were no more than 3 feet deep, above the
permafrost line.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, members of the exhumation project said last week that
they got what they came for: samples of tissues from six of the flu
victims (they did not have permission to sample the seventh). They
denied earlier published reports that the coffins contained only
bones and no retrievable tissue specimens.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kirsty Duncan, a Canadian medical geographer who directs the
project, said the pathologists were able to get more than 100
soft-tissue samples, including several from the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists will be examining the lung tissues in particular for
traces of the mysterious flu virus that killed more than 20 million
people worldwide in 1918 and early 1919. They are looking for clues
to why that contagion was so much more virulent and lethal than any
flu virus before or since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got good stuff, really good stuff,'' Dr. Duncan, a
professor at the universities of Windsor and Toronto, said in an
interview by telephone from her office in Toronto. ``Virologists on
the team are very hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Webster, a member of the team who is a virologist at
St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., reacted
more cautiously. ``The samples were not exactly what we thought we
were going to get,'' he said in an interview. ``How much we're
going to find out from them remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Research over the last five years by Dr. Duncan had pinpointed
these seven graves in Longyearbyen _ the principal community on the
island of Spitsbergen, some 700 miles from the North Pole _ as the
most promising place to look for well-preserved specimens of the
1918 virus.
</P>
<P>
   With new techniques in molecular biology and genetics, perhaps
such long-frozen specimens could now reveal why that virus was one
of the most lethal organisms that ever attacked humans. The
knowledge might then help fight future outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   The state of the specimens has not altered the overall plans for
laboratory testing. The samples are being shipped to London for the
first round of analysis by scientists at the National Institute of
Medical Research and the London Hospital Medical College. Specimens
will later be distributed to scientists in Canada, the United
States and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said they could know in three months if the samples
are likely to yield significant results, after which they might
spend another three years on further analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be harder work than if the tissues had been frozen,''
Webster said, explaining that the degraded tissues probably contain
only scraps from the genetic material of the flu virus, which may
present problems in reconstructing the structure of genes critical
to the virus's infectious behavior. ``We might get less out of the
samples than we initially hoped,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Webster said the lung tissues would probably be the most useful,
because flu viruses spread by infiltrating the cells lining the
respiratory system and thus should have left traces there. They
were not able to take lung samples from all six bodies, he said.
This suggests some bodies were badly decomposed.
</P>
<P>
   Some samples were also taken from other organs. Researchers have
speculated that the 1918 variant of the flu virus might have been
especially virulent if it somehow attacked throughout the body, not
just in the respiratory system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles R. Smith, the project's pathologist and a forensic
pathologist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, said he
wanted to extract brain tissues to investigate any possible
relationship between the 1918 flu and the widespread incidence of
sleeping sickness in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said they were confident that the exhumed bodies
were those they were looking for. The bodies were clearly once
strapping young men. The seven victims were 18 to 29 years old when
they came to Spitsbergen from the Norwegian mainland to work in the
coal mines, but they contracted flu on the boat. All of them died
in the first week of October, at the height of the global pandemic.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys with ground-penetrating radar had led the team to think
the coffins were 6 feet deep. The radar detects differences in
subsurface densities and textures, indicative of disturbed
conditions or buried objects.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, suggested Dr. Duncan, the team leader, the
gravediggers in 1918 might have used dynamite to break up the
permafrost down to 6 feet below the surface, which would have left
radar traces of disturbed ground at that depth. Then, in haste,
they might have buried the coffins in shallow graves without
clearing out the dynamited rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The Spitsbergen exhumations are only part of a quickening
scientific quest to identify the 1918 flu virus and determine its
lethal power. The team that has made the most progress is led by
Dr. Jeffrey Taubenberger, a biologist at the Armed Forces Institute
of Pathology in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Reid, a molecular biologist working with Taubenberger, said
Friday that the team had completed a significant step in
understanding the 1918 flu virus by decoding the sequence of units
composing one of its important genes. This is the hemagglutinin
gene, which directs the production of proteins that enable the flu
virus to attach itself to a cell in the respiratory system.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reid said that the decoding of a second critical component
of the virus, the neuraminidase gene, may be completed in two or
three months. Neuraminidase is the substance that enables the virus
to penetrate a cell and, like a parasite, to use its new home for
making more viruses that spread to invade more cells _ and leave a
person miserable with the chills and aches of flu.
</P>
<P>
   An understanding of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase is central
to preventing and fighting flu. When attacked by flu or in response
to flu vaccines, the body's natural immune system produces
antibodies that cover the outer part of the virus, disabling the
virus's mechanisms for invading cells.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the genetic decoding of the 1918 virus had revealed
anything to make it clear why it was such an unusually deadly
strain, Ms. Reid said, ``Nothing I would call a smoking gun.'' So
far, she added, it appeared to be similar to a swine flu virus
isolated in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   The research by Taubenberger and Ms. Reid is based on tissue
specimens preserved from two American soldiers who died in 1918 and
from an Alaskan woman whose well-preserved body was exhumed last
year. Tissues from another American flu victim, also a soldier, are
being scrutinized because he died in the summer of 1918.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an outbreak in the spring that year, and then
something took place in that summer that made the virus more
lethal,'' Ms. Reid said. ``Maybe this will give us a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Two researchers at the University of Wisconsin School of
Veterinary Medicine in Madison have also looked into possible
reasons that some flu strains are more deadly than others. Dr.
Yoshihiro Kawaoka and Dr. Hideo Goto, whose work was described in
the Aug. 18 issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, studied a laboratory-altered virus descended from the
1918 strain.
</P>
<P>
   They identified a molecular mechanism involving neuraminidase
that jump-starts hemagglutinin replication and could be a means,
they wrote, ``by which influenza viruses, and perhaps other viruses
as well, could become highly pathogenic in humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Taubenberg called the new findings ``another potential
explanation of the virulence of the 1918 flu'' that needs to be
explored.

   UNDATED - When historians one day write the account of Bill
Clinton's stewardship in the White House, they may well pinpoint
Sept. 3 as the beginning of the end.
</P>
<P>
   Other moments have been critical, of course - Jan. 17, when he
first lied under oath to Paula Jones' lawyers, and Jan. 21, when
the Monica Lewinsky story first broke, and Jan. 26, when he wagged
his finger at America and denied it all, and Aug. 17, when he
admitted to us that it was all a scam.
</P>
<P>
   But through the tumultuous months, as his grasp on power grew
more tenuous, the president was steadied by a rock of Democratic
support in Congress, where his fate would finally be decided.
Anchored by that rock, he was immovable.
</P>
<P>
   And then it cracked. First, Pennsylvania Rep. Paul McHale called
on Clinton to resign, but as a lame-duck congressman of modest
reputation, he was easy to ignore. But when Connecticut Sen. Joseph
Lieberman took the Senate floor, where he is admired as a clarion
of conscience and one of Clinton's sturdiest allies, (law student
Clinton volunteered in Lieberman's first campaign), the crack
became a chasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is not just the elected leader of our country,''
he said to a silent chamber. ``He is...`the one-man distillation of
the American people'...the personal embodiment and representative
of their dignity and majesty... The inescapable truth is that the
president's private conduct can and often does have profound public
consequences... ``(Clinton's) behavior is not just inappropriate,
it is immoral. And it is harmful, for it sends a message of what is
acceptable behavior to the larger American family, particularly to
our children.'' His deception was troubling not just because it was
a ``reflexive act of concealment,'' but because of the
``intentional and premeditated decision to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Words that belong in the next edition of an American civics
text. Words that Americans should ponder thoughtfully in the
difficult weeks that surely lie ahead. &QL;

CAMBODIAN STRONGMAN MOVES TO QUELL POST-ELECTION PROTEST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Cambodia's post-election standoff erupted
into turmoil and gunfire Monday as the country's strongman, Hun
Sen, ordered the arrests of his opponents and as security men fired
into crowds of protesters, killing at least one person.
</P>
<P>
   A long day of tension, threats and surging crowds appeared to
end on a calming note at midnight as a representative of Hun Sen
said that no immediate arrests would be made. He also withdrew Hun
Sen's threat to remove by midnight thousands of protesters who have
filled a park for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the organizer of the protests, and the chief target of Hun
Sen's threats _ Sam Rainsy _ remained overnight inside the huge
riverside Cambodiana Hotel, where he had taken refuge at the office
of the United Nations representative in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If needed, we will invite him for talks and information, but
there is no arrest warrant for Sam Rainsy,'' said Hun Sen's
representative, Prum Sokha, the information director in the
interior ministry. He spoke following strong pressure from foreign
governments and the United Nations to back away from Hun Sen's
threats, which followed the explosion of two grenades at Hun Sen's
house.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Norodom Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy has led an
increasingly assertive protest against the results of a
parliamentary election, held July 26, in which Hun Sen was declared
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy claim that the election was
marred by irregularities and they are demanding a review of the
ballots and new voting in areas where they question the results.
</P>
<P>
   They have said they will block the formation of a new government
at the end of this month by denying Hun Sen the chance to put
together a coalition of two-thirds of parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
   The official election results give Hun Sen's party 64 seats,
Prince Ranariddh's party 43 seats and Sam Rainsy's party 15 seats
in the 122-seat National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's confrontation was touched off when three hand grenades
were thrown from one or more motorcycles at Hun Sen's house in
downtown Phnom Penh. Two grenades exploded inside his compound and
one fell harmlessly outside, police said. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen rarely stays at his Phnom Penh house, preferring a
palatial, heavily guarded compound south of the city. For the past
several days he has been in the northern city of Siem Reap for
highly publicized meetings with King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless he immediately branded the attack a coup attempt
and his police chief, Hok Lundy, called it an assassination
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking angrily to reporters in Siem Reap, Hun Sen announced:
``The arrests are to start from this hour. How many people will be
arrested is up to the prosecutors to decide. We urge the people who
are to be arrested not to resist.''
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen denied speculation that he had staged the attack as a
pretext to move against his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called for soldiers, police to shoot me, to overthrow me;
they called on the United States to fire missiles at my house,'' he
said, referring to some of Rainsy's incendiary rhetoric. ``But when
he could not succeed, he used this act of terrorism. So I think it
has come to a stage where legal action must be taken against this
terrorist leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainsy, who appears to have been trying to provoke Hun Sen into
rash action, had earlier used the ``terrorist'' label against him.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen's statements aroused both the police and the
demonstrators in this city where tensions have grown as the
round-the-clock protest has continued in a tent city outside the
parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   As monks chanted in the campground Sunday afternoon, the police
fired automatic weapons into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred young men then gathered in a noisy crowd at the
gates of the Cambodiana Hotel where Sam Rainsy had taken refuge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hun Sen is a dog!'' they shouted. ``Hun Sen is Vietnamese! The
police are Vietnamese! The hotel is Vietnamese!''
</P>
<P>
   In his speeches to the demonstrators over the past two weeks,
Sam Rainsy has helped arouse anti-Vietnamese fervor in a nation
where hatred of Cambodia's eastern neighbor runs deep. Mobs have
killed several Vietnamese residents in recent days. Hun Sen was
first installed as Cambodia's leader by a Vietnamese occupying army
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Three times, as the crowd surged toward the hotel's gates,
security forces within the grounds fired pistols and automatic
weapons. Some fired into the air, some at the ground.
</P>
<P>
   One man in his late 20s was killed when he was shot in the back
of the head and was taken to a hospital in a U.N. vehicle. The
protesters immediately created a small shrine beside a pool of his
blood, with candles, sticks of incense, a collection of shell
casings and the young man's cap, its back portion in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   There were unconfirmed reports that other people had also been
killed. Several people were wounded, including a Buddhist monk.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As Hun Sen's midnight deadline approached, an official read the
crowd a statement from King Sihanouk, who has deplored the
post-election standoff and threatened to abdicate if it is not
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mr. Hun Sen,'' the statement read. ``I have just received
information of the use of violence against our beloved people and
monks. The use of weapons is outside Buddhist teachings and is
something that could make the national crisis more serious and push
our nation to death.''
</P>
<P>
   From inside the hotel, Sam Rainsy called the cellular telephone
of Brad Adams, a former U.N. official who was standing in the
crowd. Adams gave the telephone to one of the demonstrators, Im
Saveoun, and Sam Rainsy urged him to return with the others to the
protest campsite.
</P>
<P>
   Im Saveoun, an 18-year-old high school student, was almost too
excited by his conversation to pass on the message.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his name, he shouted, ``I am Hun Sen! I can do anything I
want to!''

`COSTELLO': STEREOTYPES ABOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   There are entirely too many colorfully crude blue-collar
characters in ``Costello,'' and the show's star, Sue Costello, is
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The weird thing about this new Fox sitcom, which has its
premiere Tuesday night at 8:30, is that it purports to be in favor
of getting away from all that tackiness. Sue Murphy (Ms. Costello,
a stand-up comedian who looks like a cross between Ellen DeGeneres
and Anne Heche but sounds like Rose Marie) has just broken up with
her boyfriend, P.J., because she wants more than her narrow little
life as a bartender in South Boston has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. has proposed because he finally has the security he needs:
a job with the transit authority _ on the Red Line, no less. But
when Sue says, oh boy, that's great, now I can stop tending bar and
take some courses at UMass, P.J. looks at her blankly, and she
realizes something crucial: ``I'm not the person I want to be
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   So she decides to dump P.J., open a dictionary and learn a new
word every day. Even more shocking, she starts going to a
psychotherapist. Which leads her to begin talking to herself _
well, doing her affirmations (``You're pretty, you're smart, and
you're strong'') _ while gazing into the Coors mirror behind the
bar. Her regular customers order by saying, ``Hey, Sue, could you
actualize your potential and get me a beer?''
</P>
<P>
   This premise has possibilities, sort of an Irish-American
``Educating Rita'' with attitude. But audiences aren't likely to
believe for a minute that Sue Murphy has her eye on some better way
of experiencing life. She's far too comfortable in the middle of
the fighting, the four-letter words and the bathroom jokes; in fact
she seems to relish it all. Sue's handsome, blond younger brother,
Jimmy (Chuck Walczak), seems likelier to break out of the
lower-middle-class milieu.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens with the series, it's sad to see Dan Lauria,
who was so affecting and complicated as the 1960s father in ABC's
``Wonder Years,'' reduced to a stereotype as Sue's rough-edged dad.
</P>
<P>
   The first episode of ``Costello'' does have one bright spot,
though. When P.J's two sisters _ one of whom looks like Anybody's,
the boyish teen-age girl in ``West Side Story,'' and the other like
a Nazi commandant _ walk into the bar, they do bring to mind, for a
second, ``Newhart'' and the first time Darryl and Darryl walked
into Dick Loudon's Vermont inn.

A DOOMED GHETTO LIVES IN A TIME CAPSULE OF ART AND DESPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the grainy black-and-white picture, a bundled-up
woman is trudging behind a makeshift cart, a star sewn onto the
back of her coat. Evocative as it is of the ghettoization of Jews
in World War II, the photograph is notable for another element _ a
black smudge in the lower right corner.
</P>
<P>
   The smudge is the shadow of the photographer, George Kadish, a
fellow Jew imprisoned in Lithuania's Kovno ghetto. He snapped such
images furtively, often through the buttonhole of his overcoat,
with a camera he made himself, with film he bartered for and
secretly smuggled past Nazi guards in a hollowed-out crutch. His
shadow looms in this photo and many others as the stamp of a
witness to genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish was not the only witness. All of Kovno's Jewish prisoners
_ painters, doctors, lawyers, diarists, photographers, graphic
artists, even children _ worked surreptitiously to preserve their
stories in secret archives in the expectation that few of them
would survive.
</P>
<P>
   Few did. Of the 37,000 Jews in Kovno before the war, 3,000
remained afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of loss at other ghettos was greater; the history
of others is seared more deeply into the public consciousness. But
the accumulated evidence from Kovno, collected for the first time
and on exhibition through Oct. 3, 1999, at the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Museum in Washington, adds up to one of history's great
acts of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit consists of more than 500 artifacts, pictures and
paintings that the Jews buried in wooden crates in the Kovno ghetto
before its liquidation in 1944. They were retrieved from personal
collections and archives in 14 countries during the last five
years. The exhibit differs from others by transcending individual
stories of survival to show how the community as a whole survived
for more than three years. It demonstrates the power of
documentation and the value of order as internal protection from
external chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally I draw more freely,'' Esther Lurie, a gifted painter
trapped in the ghetto, says in a taped reminiscence. ``But I felt a
compulsion to leave something that would serve a purpose.'' From
her meticulous drawings and watercolors, historians could map the
ghetto's physical landscape as well as the emotional terrain, from
the panic caused by a sudden deportation to the soulful gloom of
the trail that led to the killing forts surrounding the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   Kovno, a cultural and religious center where Jews had lived for
more than 500 years, was occupied by the Soviet Union under terms
of the German-Soviet pact. When the Germans swept into Kovno in
June 1941, the Lithuanians welcomed them as liberators. But with a
fierce anti-Semitism pervasive in Lithuania, some of the locals
became Nazi collaborators. With the Germans, they immediately
established a ghetto in Kovno and sealed it off in August.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition includes propaganda posters from the pro-German
Lithuanian Activist Front. ``Who brought you famine, tears and mass
murder?'' the posters ask. ``The Jew!'' ``Who had all the best
garments? The Jew! Who worked least and ate best? The Jew!''
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, about 235,000 Jews lived in Lithuania. By the
end of the war, 94 percent of them had been slaughtered, not in the
mass executions of the ovens but by handgun and machine gun in
rampages by the Germans and their Lithuanian allies. Kadish
survived, eventually making his way to the United States, where he
died last September in Hollywood, Fla.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The organizers of Kovno's secret archival project were members
of the Jewish Council, which was set up by the Germans to
administer the ghetto's daily life. In some ghettos, such councils
sought to save themselves. In Kovno, the council followed Nazi
orders by day and scrupulously documented them by night, deploying
the talents of the doomed.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates recorded their shifting demographics in vivid
charts, marking the rapidly declining population of women, children
and the elderly, all useless in the labor brigades. (On one day
alone _ Oct. 28, 1941 _ the Germans and their Lithuanian
collaborators killed 9,200 people in Kovno.) They drew maps of the
ghetto's ever-shrinking boundaries. They transformed official
German orders into graphic art. The council protected the ghetto's
professional musicians _ otherwise extraneous _ by appointing them
police officers. Those who were forced into labor in workshops for
the German war effort secretly funneled clothes, mess kits and soap
to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish doctors treated their Nazi oppressors, then hid cases of
typhus and scarlet fever among the Jews for fear that word of the
highly contagious diseases would give the Germans an excuse to
exterminate the entire ghetto. The inmates hid orphans, who would
have been exterminated, and secretly divided up their own meager
food rations to feed them. In pen and ink and watercolors, the
prisoners recreated their world, marking the disappearance of trees
and furniture as they were scavenged for firewood and the
disappearance of people as they were herded out for labor and
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish, a high school science teacher with a special knowledge
of photography and X-ray equipment, was assigned by the Germans to
work at the local city hospital repairing X-ray machines. There, he
obtained film and secretly used the hospital's lab to develop his
own pictures. ``My camera,'' said Kadish, who escaped the ghetto
and photographed its destruction, ``will be my revenge.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Strong breezes from the north and northwest will prevail from
New England to the northern Middle Atlantic states Tuesday,
replacing the recent summery warmth with autumnal chill. Residual
moist air will mix with a deepening pocket of cold air aloft to
create roiling clouds and scattered showers near the eastern Great
Lakes and over the interior Northeast. Patches of clouds and spotty
sprinkles will occur east of the crest of the Appalachians Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The cold front will press into the Deep South Tuesday afternoon,
after exiting the southern Middle Atlantic states. A broken band of
strong thunderstorms with high winds and hail will accompany the
front as it reaches the coastal waters of the Carolinas later on
Tuesday. Meanwhile, bands of thundershowers from a developing
tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico will spiral onto the
coast from Texas to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will build across the Midwest, sponsoring ample
sunshine from the middle Mississippi Valley to upper Plains. Along
the boundary between this autumnal air and a sultry air mass,
scattered thunder will develop from the lower Mississippi Valley to
Southern Plains. A few storms will also form in the western high
Plains as converging winds ascend the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Thundershowers will erupt over the higher terrain of the Rocky
Mountain states by midday Tuesday. Meanwhile, a cold front slicing
eastward from the northern Rockies to southern Oregon will ignite
scattered severe storms this afternoon. In California, isolated
thunder will develop in the Sierra, while fog patches begin the day
at the Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Warmest Before Chill &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It is typically warmest just ahead of a cold front. On Monday,
as a cold front moved toward the Northeast coast, temperatures
soared into the 90s from New York to Washington. As a cold front
approaches, winds ahead of the front blow more strongly from the
south. These southerlies are agents of the tropics, carrying warm
air northward. In addition, the warm air ahead of a front is often
relatively free of clouds so incoming solar energy is maximized. On
Tuesday, in the wake of a front, gusty northerly winds and some
clouds will keep temperatures far below the seasonal average in the
Northeast.

   RUSSIA-CRISIS _ MOSCOW _ As Russia's economy continued to
unravel, acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin again was
rejected by the Communist-led Duma, prolonging the country's
political crisis even as the ruble fell to new lows. Chernomyrdin
warned that the country was ``on the verge of a precipice'' and
President Boris Yeltsin offered new concessions in an unsuccessful
attempt to win support for his choice to lead a new government, a
sign that the Kremlin is growing increasingly worried about its
grip on power. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   MILLION-YOUTH _ ATLANTA _ Those at the Atlanta wrap march on
Monday in the first Million Youth Movement numbered far fewer than
1 million. But it was quality, not quantity, organizers drew to an
event that often resembled a street party more than a political and
sociological movement. Most of the seven-block route along historic
Auburn Avenue was lined with vendors selling t-shirts, hair
products and cold drinks, not supporters calling for economic,
social and educational equiality. But still those who preached hour
after hour to the crowd of 500 to 750 at the end of the block _
``in the shadow of Martin Luther King's grave'' _ were hopeful. ``I
am inspired by the collective spirit of determination and purpose
that emanates throughout this gathering,'' said Martin Luther King
III. (Cook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   MOTT-SUGAR _ CLEWISTON, Fla. _ Meet the United States Sugar
Corp., the small-town company that's one of America's biggest
producers of sugar and orange juice. Now meet the Charles Stewart
Mott Foundation of Flint, Mich., the country's 15th-largest
enterprise of its kind as of 1995. The Mott foundation gives away
up to $72 million a year, gets the president's attention and sits
on $58 million worth of U.S. Sugar stock, making the charity one of
the sugar company's biggest stockholders. Those holdings also make
the sugar company stock one of the charity's biggest assets. The
two entities even share a chairman. But at times, their interests
conflict. An examination of this strange relationship. (Peltz, Palm
Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   MOTT-SUGAR-ECCENTRIC _ Charles Stewart Mott once, the story
goes, changed a 30-watt refrigerator bulb to 15 watts to save
electricity. That might not have been unusual for someone who'd
endured the Great Depression. But Mott, creator of what became the
country's 15th-largest charitable foundation, was then considered
one of the richest men in the United States. But C.S. Mott was as
generous as he was thrifty. (Peltz, Palm Beach Post)

<P>
   MOTT-SUGAR-GLADES _ BELLE GLADE, Fla. _ In 62 years, the Charles

A RHAPSODY OF WORDS, ASSEMBLED FOR THE EAR  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT WOLF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a south London sound studio miles away from the
tonier spaces of the Royal Shakespeare Company or even the restored
Globe playhouse, Shakespeare's every printed word is coming to
recorded life.
</P>
<P>
   This particular day, the finishing touches are being put on
``Measure for Measure.'' A cast of onetime Royal Shakespeare
regulars is navigating the darkly passionate conclusion to a play
that several of its principals have acted in before.
</P>
<P>
   On previous occasions, however, Roger Allam, who is playing the
Duke, and Stella Gonet, as the teary novitiate Isabella, have had
to worry about costumes, entrances and projection. This time, it is
half-steps from microphones and precisely monitored ``caesura
breaks.'' But such are the concerns of a $3 million project for a
London company called Arkangel that has reached the halfway point
and is expected to give nearly 600 actors work: an audio book of
Shakespeare's 38 plays, including his 1613-14 collaboration with
John Fletcher, ``The Two Noble Kinsmen.''
</P>
<P>
   The first set of audio cassettes was released in May in Britain
and early in July in the United States, distributed by Penguin:
``Henry V,'' ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' ``Romeo and Juliet''
and ``Twelfth Night,'' with Brian Cox, who is now on Broadway in
``Art,'' and Joseph Fiennes, younger brother of Ralph, among the
performers involved. Another group came out in the United States on
Aug. 24, including ``Macbeth,'' ``All's Well That Ends Well'' and
``The Merchant of Venice.'' ``Measure for Measure'' goes on sale in
the United States in January, along with ``The Comedy of Errors''
as well as a ``Pericles'' that numbers among its cast John Gielgud,
who is now 94.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 19 of the plays have been recorded, all of them
directed by Clive Brill, and the remainder are to be completed and
go on sale not long into the millennium. (The producers are hoping
to release the set on CD as well as cassette.) And though Britain
has been host of such ventures before _ the record companies Argo
and Caedmon were producing their own recordings of Shakespeare's
better-known works three decades ago or more _ the current venture
aims to marry scholarship and accessibility on an unmatched scale.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Shakespeare bowdlerized or radically cut, as the
voguish approach to his work can be onstage (the Royal
Shakespeare's recent ``Hamlet,'' for instance, which visited the
Brooklyn Academy of Music in May). But it is not a roomful of
people indulging in old-fashioned verse declamation in absurdly
plummy accents.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier recordings, ``the acting was a bit, shall we say,
obvious,'' said Bill Shepherd, 54, the television and film producer
(``Mrs. Dalloway'') who first conceived the Arkangel venture. He
took the project to Tom Treadwell, an Anglo-American academic who
lives four doors away in Chiswick, a west London neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Treadwell, 55, said that ``turning 50 had come as a tremendous
shock, and I really decided I wanted to do something different with
my life.'' So before long, the two had embarked on a venture that,
at a cost of roughly $70,000 a play, may take years to pay for
itself. But Treadwell said he preferred to think pragmatically of
an endeavor intended to appeal to schools and libraries over the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to get super-rich,'' he said. ``We know
perfectly well that we'll sell more `Hamlet' than `King John.'''
Each play costs $16.95, rising to $17.95 in the new year; some
5,000 copies of each title are being distributed in the United
States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The appeal is self-evident for the performers, a mixture of
Shakespeare veterans (Gielgud, Cox, Eileen Atkins, who plays
Constance in ``King John'') and relative neophytes. Among the
latter is Rupert Graves, the boyish actor probably still best
remembered for his roles in Merchant-Ivory films like ``A Room With
a View'' and ``Maurice.'' Graves was hired to play the title role
in ``Richard II,'' one of Shakespeare's most demanding and lyrical
parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rupert could see the cracked, flawed character of Richard
II,'' said Shepherd, who had employed Graves on screen in ``Mrs.
Dalloway.'' ``That's what he's very good at. In the end, we were
completely gobsmacked'' _ stunned _ ``by what he did with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Atkins has been married for 20 years to Shepherd, and she
recalled how initial doubt turned to excitement when she heard of
the project. ``I did think, `My God, I wonder if anybody's going to
buy `Timon of Athens,''' she said. ``I went into a shop to see what
was the latest `Romeo and Juliet' you could get, and it was Albert
Finney and Claire Bloom. I thought: `Bill's right. Time has moved
on, and younger actors have moved up. These old recordings are
outdated now.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Adrian Lester, ``It's brilliant actors on a brilliant text,
and only for a week.'' Lester, 29, the English theater actor, was
cast as Marc Antony in ``Julius Caesar,'' a play he had not
performed onstage. (American filmgoers know Lester from ``Primary
Colors,'' in which he played the Stephanopoulesque aide to John
Travolta's president.)
</P>
<P>
   And while one might imagine actors seated around a table merely
speaking into a microphone, Lester spoke of rehearsing the play as
if it were going to be performed onstage. ``You have to get some
physical presence, some movement, behind the language,'' he said,
``because if you close your eyes, you have to believe you're
listening to it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it virtually is. Actor Ciaran Hinds ``really went for
it,'' during the taping of ``Antony and Cleopatra'' with Estelle
Kohler, said Brill, the director. ``He was so hot to trot that it
became embarrassing when they kissed.''
</P>
<P>
   On this recent day, however, the emotions were the tremulous,
morally ambiguous ones that accompany the resolution of ``Measure
for Measure,'' once the duke drops his disguise to confess a love
for Isabella that she does not necessarily return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just find it thrilling to be able to get in and do it, and
then you don't have to do it again,'' said Ms. Gonet, who spoke of
being ``racked with pain and tears'' nightly when she played the
same role onstage for the Royal Shakespeare Company three years
ago. ``It's very upsetting playing Isabella, though I think I'm
stronger now, much stronger. It's lovely to just do it, and then
that's it, no more.''

PERENNIAL ENEMIES MEET BRIEFLY FOR ULSTER TALKS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Two of the bitterest perennial
enemies in the war and peace in Northern Ireland spoke directly to
each other for the first time Monday in a brief polite dialogue
aimed at furthering the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of
the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army, and David
Trimble, the Protestant first minister of the new provincial
Assembly, exchanged mild statements in a meeting that just a few
years ago most people here could not have foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was an otherwise dull preliminary session of leaders
of the assembly, established to put in place political changes that
would give Catholics added power in this predominantly Protestant
province and the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic more
influence in northern affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But when Trimble, who is also head of the Ulster Unionist Party,
addressed the Sinn Fein leader by name, another modest historic
step was taken in the five-year-old peace effort. Neither leader
had any emotion in his voice, according to people at the meeting,
which was closed to reporters and camera crews.
</P>
<P>
   For years Trimble refused to meet Adams, who, he said,
represented the IRA, an illegal organization that had killed
hundreds of Protestants. Adams has said the only way to deal with
sectarian problems was direct talk.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble described the meeting, at the Stormont government
complex in Belfast, as ``workmanlike.'' Adams said it had been a
``good engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   The men are to meet alone on Thursday, presumably to discuss the
issue that threatens to impede the work of the Assembly, the
disarmament of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders did not discuss disarmament, which is called
decommissioning here, but made oblique references to the problem.
``The word `decommissioning' was not used by anyone,'` Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble spoke of the responsibility of ``paramilitary-related
parties,'' a clear reference to Sinn Fein and the disarmament
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Trimble, as chairman of the Assembly, is insisting
that there be some IRA disarmament before the next step is taken.
That is the creation of a Cabinet to enact the provisions of the
peace agreement that party leaders and referendums here and in the
Irish Republic approved in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Adams says disarmament should not be a precondition for Sinn
Fein's gaining ministerial posts in the new provincial executive
body to be created by the Assembly. The executive Cabinet is to
create cross-border institutions in which politicians from both
sides of the border cooperate in areas like tourism and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA said last week that it had no plans to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Just before President Clinton's visit here last week, Adams said
that he thought that the IRA campaign of violence was a thing of
the past. But Protestant leaders were quick to point out that he
did not state that the IRA had permanently abandoned violence.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has been slow to deal directly with Adams and Sinn Fein,
because that would leave him open to attacks by dissident members
of his party and the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party of the
Rev. Ian Paisley, who boycotted the meeting Monday in Parliament
Buildings, the former site of the provincial legislature that
Britain dissolved in 1972, at the height of the sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not negotiating the future of our province with them,''
Paisley said of Sinn Fein. ``Nor are we taking part in acts of
government with them.''
</P>
<P>
   His deputy party leader, Peter Robinson, said he was certain
that ``the IRA will not indicate it has given up war.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Each year, 1,700 tankers bring 18 billion gallons of
oil into New York Harbor. And each day huge barges carry 14,000
tons of garbage to the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island. The
harbor, also heavily trafficked by container ships, gravel boats,
tugs and pleasure craft, hardly seems a good place for fish-eating
birds to settle and raise their families. Surely they would never
choose to live among the flotsam and jetsam and just plain trash
washing up on the shores, nor among wrecked ships and docks and
long-abandoned buildings on islands that look nothing like a
wildlife refuge. Surely elegant snowy egrets or black-crowned night
herons would never call a place like that home.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they would and they do.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, undeterred by PCBs, noise, odors and
other types of pollutants, exploding populations of herons and
egrets, glossy ibises and double-crested cormorants have joined the
ubiquitous gulls that call the harbor home. Thousands of
long-legged waders have no compunctions about nesting in unkempt
spots or dining on fish and shellfish from polluted water.
Although, to humans, several of the harbor islands and their
environs may look like slums, to the birds they resemble an
Everglades paradise, replete with food and nesting sites and free
of threats from people, raccoons and most other predators.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the species now thriving here had once been
threatened with extinction; others had never been known to nest
anywhere near New York City. Their expanding presence in the harbor
is testament to the incredible resilience of nature, once it is
given half a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The birds live, breed and feed on islands never visited and
rarely noticed by most New Yorkers despite their proximity to the
five boroughs _ North and South Brother Islands between Queens and
The Bronx; U Thant Island in the East River, a hefty stone's throw
from the United Nations; Shooter's Island in the Kill (or stream)
Van Kull; Prall's Island and the Isle of Meadows in the Arthur Kill
between Staten Island and New Jersey, and Swinburne and Hoffman
Islands in Lower New York Bay between Brooklyn and Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   These harbor islands, along with the islands of Jamaica Bay and
a few islands east of the Bronx in Long Island Sound, comprise
fewer than 1,000 acres, said Dr. Paul Kerlinger, an environmental
consultant. Yet Kerlinger reported in the current issue of Living
Bird Quarterly, the annual surveys he conducts with volunteers from
the New York City Audubon Society, that the harbor islands alone
are breeding grounds for nearly 1,000 pairs of black-crowned night
herons and several hundred pairs each of snowy egrets, great
egrets, cattle egrets and glossy ibises.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to mention the rapidly expanding populations of
double-crested cormorants, sleek black fish eaters that had not
been known to nest in New York Harbor until eight years ago. There
are now _ count them _ about 960 breeding pairs of cormorants in
the harbor, where the federally protected birds have so far escaped
persecution by fishermen who elsewhere view them as competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly says something about the quality of the
water,'' said Peter Mott, president of the New York City Audubon
Society, as he toured the islands by boat recently. Mott said that
in 1960 no egrets or ibises were nesting in the harbor and a mere
sighting of an ibis in 1950 ``was so unusual that I played hooky
from school just to see one.''
</P>
<P>
   He credits the Clean Water Act of 1972 for the fact that the
harbor is now hospitable to myriad aquatic species _ from snails
and tiny shrimp to crabs and bait fish _ and the long-legged wading
birds that depend on such fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1970, if you put mummichog into the Arthur Kill in summer,
it quickly died for lack of oxygen,'' he recalled. Mummichog, a
salt marsh fish used for bait, is a favored food of black-crowned
night herons, among other waders. The Clean Water Act mandated a
reduction in the amount of fecal and other organic matter that
could be contained in the effluent of sewage treatment plants. This
meant that there was less oxidizable material in the processed
sewage, which in turn meant that oxygen levels in harbor waters
into which the treated sewage was dumped could rise to a point that
could sustain aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the level of dissolved oxygen falls below 3 parts per
million, the water can't support most fish life or invertebrate
life,'' Mott said. ``Now in the Arthur Kill, 64 percent of the
fresh water comes out of sewage plants.''
</P>
<P>
   But organic matter from sewage is not the only contributor to an
oxygen shortage in waters surrounding a big metropolis like New
York. Mott said that runoff from the rain and snow that reaches the
harbor has very low oxygen levels.
</P>
<P>
   One need not go any further than tiny U Thant Island, named for
the former secretary-general of the United Nations, to witness the
consequence of cleaner harbor waters. Cormorants have built nine
nests in the island's two spindly trees, and the other day the
residents of those nests were feeding furiously on a school of
small fish that had become confused by a rip in the current just
north of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Cormorants are not the only inhabitants of this rocky
outcropping in the East River. Their companions include a young
herring gull and a young black-backed gull, ``both of which
probably hatched on the island,'' Mott said, and several spotted
sandpipers. In addition to the trees, there is a gridwork of steel
tubing erected as a memorial to the former secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   A little farther north on South Brother Island, in the shadow of
Riker's Island, about 850 cormorants have claimed squatter's
rights. In fact, there are so many of the birds that their noxious
droppings have killed most of the trees where they nest and
threaten to render the island inhospitable to black-crowned night
herons, which are still the most abundant long-legged waders in the
harbor. Here and on neighboring North Brother Island, where a
long-defunct sanitarium once housed Typhoid Mary, ``about 1,000
black-crowned night herons and 200 snowy egrets raise their chicks
every year,'' wrote Margaret Mittelbach and Michael Crewdson in
their book ``Wild New York'' (Crown, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   On Shooter's Island, once a thriving shipyard at the foot of
Newark Bay and now a veritable sanctuary for wading birds, hundreds
of great egrets and snowy egrets build platter-sized nests on the
island's low-growing cherry trees each spring, Ms. Mittelbach and
Crewdson noted. Nesting egrets were first spotted on this shipping
channel island in 1974, and in each successive year there are more.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katherine Parsons of the Manomet Bird Observatory in
Massachusetts and collaborators, who studied bird colonies in the
harbor for a decade, found the most productive salt marsh among the
shipwrecks at the west end of Shooter's Island. There, surrounded
by the decaying wrecks and dry docks, ``hundreds of young herons
get their first food-finding experience,'' Mott said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The cormorant population on Shooter's Island was set back about
five years ago when someone set fire to some of the old wooden
structures that supported their nests. Mott said dry docks are
ideal nesting places for cormorants because their excrement cannot
destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   An oil spill in 1990, which dumped 567,000 gallons of fuel oil
into the Arthur Kill and contaminated the surrounding salt marsh,
took its toll on glossy ibises, which depend on marsh snails for
sustenance, and snowy egrets, which feed along the edge of the
marsh on mummichogs and silversides.
</P>
<P>
   But with the cleanup and salt marsh restoration undertaken by
the city's Department of Parks and Recreation, the birds have
returned. The restoration was financed with $1 million from a trust
fund established by Exxon Corp. to settle charges that it was
responsible for the spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Altogether, on island rookeries throughout New York Harbor,
more than 4,000 wading birds are nesting,'' Ms. Mittelbach and
Crewdson wrote in their book about New York City's wildlife.
``These birds have chosen their sites so well that most New Yorkers
will never see a heron's nest. In addition to being almost totally
inaccessible (the harbor acts like an enormous moat), the islands
are near sparsely populated, industrial areas where, despite
passing boats, the birds can keep a relatively low profile.''
</P>
<P>
   But while they keep their nests well-concealed, the birds think
nothing of drifting inland to feed, and city dwellers are often
treated to the sight of an island-dwelling heron, especially a
great egret or black-crowned night heron, stalking its prey in the
freshwater ponds and lakes of city parks. Like most people, these
birds are ``generalists,'' who enjoy variety in their diet. The
black-crowned night heron, most numerous perhaps because it is
least fussy about what it eats, dines on everything from fish and
crayfish to frogs and insects, Mott said.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow-crowned night herons, on the other hand, are
``specialists'' who feed almost exclusively on fiddler crabs in New
York Harbor, he said. Their dietary restrictions contribute to the
fact that they are the least populous of the long-legged waders in
the area, with only nine nesting pairs counted last year on the
harbor islands.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, the most omnivorous of sea birds are the
gulls. Until the 1600s, Mott said, herring gulls nested only north
and east of Portland, Maine They headed south when Europeans
settled on these shores. Commercial fishing piers and garbage dumps
provided the birds with a year-round food supply. Then at the turn
of this century, the demand for their feathers by the millinery
trade decimated the population of herring gulls on the east coast.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1970, Mott said, ``these island nesters occupied
virtually every suitable island from Newfoundland to Virginia.'' In
New York Harbor, however, the annual bird counts have detected a
decline in the herring gull population, Mott said, ``maybe because
garbage dumps have been closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerlinger said: ``The gulls specialize in garbage because it's
easy. They also eat fish, shellfish and any meat-type food that
washes up on the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible reason for the decline in gulls, Kerlinger
said, is the succession of plant growth on the dredge-built islands
where they've been nesting. Gulls need sandy, open habitat for
their nests; the trees and shrubs now growing up on the islands
near the Fresh Kills landfill are reducing available nest sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent harbor tour revealed no shortage of gulls. The
railing of the fence that surrounds the landfill was fully occupied
by hundreds of gulls, mostly great black-backed gulls of various
vintages, evenly perched like targets in a shooting gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the gulls have been in a steady decline, there is no
conservation worry about it,'' Kerlinger said. ``The balance of
nature is not really balanced. Populations wax and wane and move
from island to island.
</P>
<P>
   Through his annual surveys of bird life in the harbor, Kerlinger
said: ``I hope to learn more about the dynamics of populations.
What are the normal fluctuations? We now have 14 years of data on
the birds inhabiting the harbor islands. It's a giant mosaic, with
the numbers changing from year to year and from island to island as
the birds change nesting places. We're still in the early stages of
trying to know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   How to See the Harbor Birds
</P>
<P>
   The boats that regularly travel through harbor waters, like the
Circle Line and the ferries, do not go close enough to the islands
to permit viewing of the birds. But the New York City Audubon
Society operates an annual benefit cruise to the harbor islands in
May. For more information, contact the society at 212-691-7483.

ASIDE FROM REJECTING CHERNOMYRDIN AGAIN, COMMUNISTS AGREE ON
LITTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: RUSSIA-POLITICS, RUSSIA-ECON.)

 By MICHAEL WINES

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Monday might be one of those rare heady days for
Russia's post-Soviet communists, if only someone could say what a
post-Soviet communist is.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party in Russia's parliament, the legislature's
biggest, used to crumple under President Boris Yeltsin's glare.
Monday it contemptuously threw back his choice of Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister for the second time, demanding to
regain part of its old power and threatening to block a new
government _ and bring Russia to its knees _ if need be.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, it is not clear even to communists what is to
be done. Some unreconstructed radicals yearn to oust Yeltsin's
regime and restore the monopolistic control of Soviet days. Some
want to put the government in charge of key industries and banks,
but leave part of the capitalist sector untouched. Some are so
house-trained that Yeltsin long ago invited them to join his
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gennady Zyuganov, the party leader in the lower house of
parliament, or Duma, spoke approvingly in a radio interview last
month of the anti-crisis program once mounted by that noted
radical, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're struggling between two major ambitions,'' said Boris
Makarenko, deputy director of the Center for Political
Technologies, a research organization in Moscow. ``One is to become
a legitimate part of this political regime and play by the
constitutional rules. And the second ambition is to undo this
regime and restore the Soviet communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only a division between factions or fragments of
the party,'' he said, ``but inside the soul of each of the
members.''
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, they do not seem right now to have much
of a choice. The Communist Party holds more than 30 percent of the
seats in the Duma, twice that of its closest rival, but virtually
nobody believes it could win a majority in a presidential election
or restore Soviet rule by force. Seventy-four years of misrule left
the party with a besmirched name among average citizens that not
even the current disastrous situation has erased. Its base is
middle-aged or elderly, party members of habit rather than ideology
who are dying off in greater numbers with each passing day.
</P>
<P>
   The party casts itself as the voice of the disenfranchised _
Russia's boom market, for sure _ but even there, strongmen like
Aleksandr Lebed, the former Army general and Siberian governor, and
the mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, have siphoned away loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves playing by the constitution, and for the moment, the
party is holding a strong hand. Besides a choice of several cabinet
ministers and a voice in economic policy, the communists' principal
demand in the present standoff with Yeltsin is a rewrite of the
Russian constitution, shifting the nation away from an all-powerful
president toward parliamentary democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In a parliamentary democracy, the largest political party has
the greatest sway over policy. And for all their faults, the
communists have the largest and deepest political organization in
all of Russia, with branches in the smallest towns, unions and
factories.
</P>
<P>
   That backdoor approach to regaining authority could give the
communists real authority in setting Russian policy.
</P>
<P>
   The question, which not even the communists seem able to answer
with much authority, is what they would do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The party's official program, published on a World Wide Web that
Leonid Brezhnev would never have tolerated, states in unambiguously
Soviet terms that ``the principal struggle between capitalism and
socialism under whose mark the 20th century progressed is not
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Alexander Kuvayev, a communist Duma deputy from Moscow,
sounded Tuesday more like a Chamber of Commerce initiate. ``They
say we'll nationalize all private property. That's not true. We'll
only nationalize that which was illegally privatized,'' he said.
``We won't touch apartments, garden plots, small business. Small
business must develop.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PLYMOUTH, Mass. _ After nearly 13 years in prison, convicted of
raping children at his family's suburban Boston day care center
despite his avowals of innocence, Gerald Amirault says he is
pinning his hopes on new science to get him out.
</P>
<P>
   Not on microbiology; not on DNA testing. No physical evidence of
that sort exists against Amirault, his sister and their late
mother. All three were convicted in 1986 and 1987 in the Fells
Acres Day School case, which has become the longest-running of the
highly publicized day-care sexual abuse cases that swept the
country back then.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Amirault is counting on the science of psychology. And
judging by a blistering ruling this summer in his sister's legal
battle, he may have a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Those day care cases, it turns out, from the McMartin Preschool
in California to Wee Care in New Jersey, set off an explosion of
psychological research into the accuracy of children's memories and
reporting of events.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, researchers estimate, 500 studies have been
conducted on children's ``suggestibility'' _ the extent to which
suggestions implanted by adult interviewers can influence
children's recollections and accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Though debate still burns high on some points _ like the general
level of children's accuracy and how resistant they are to
disclosing that they have been abused _ researchers describe an
emerging consensus over how children should be interviewed to
minimize false reports.
</P>
<P>
   Warring camps of psychologists also appear to have reached broad
agreement on this basic picture: The vast majority of the tens of
thousands of child sexual abuse accusations each year are true, and
most children display a tremendous capacity to be accurate; but
under certain conditions, if they are pushed and prodded in the
wrong ways, children may say false things. And preschoolers of 3
and 4 tend to be more suggestible than older children.
</P>
<P>
   It was that body of research that underlay the Massachusetts
Superior Court ruling by Judge Isaac Borenstein in June that
Amirault's sister, Cheryl Amirault LeFave, should be granted a new
trial on her conviction of sexual abuse because of new scientific
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overzealous and inadequately trained investigators, perhaps
unaware of the grave dangers of using improper interviewing and
investigative techniques, questioned these children and their
parents in a climate of panic, if not hysteria, creating a highly
prejudicial and irreparable set of mistakes,'' the judge wrote.
``These grave errors led to the testimony of the children being
forever tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein is not the first to cite suggestibility research in
overturning a ruling made when it was all but given among
clinicians _ based more on gut instinct than data _ that children
would never lie about sexual abuse. The research played a role in a
New Jersey appeals court's 1993 decision to free Margaret Kelly
Michaels, who was convicted in 1988 in the Wee Care case, and has
figured in other rulings and verdicts. The Michaels decision noted
that ``certain questions planted sexual information in the
children's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The developing consensus has been emerging in guidelines set by
associations of psychiatrists, psychologists and other
professionals who deal with accusations of child sexual abuse.
Among the rules of thumb are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Children should be interviewed in the most open-ended way
possible at first, allowed to engage in ``free recall'' rather than
responding to specific questions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in its 1997 guidelines for evaluating children who
may have been abused, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry recommends that interviewers' initial questions should
not be ``leading or suggestive and should be phrased in such a way
that an inability to recall or lack of knowledge is acceptable. A
leading question is, `Uncle Joe touched your bottom, didn't he?' A
suggestive question is: `Did Uncle Joe touch your bottom?' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ The interviewers should be as unbiased as possible about
whether abuse actually occurred, because studies have shown that
interviewer bias can influence responses from children eager to
please adults.
</P>
<P>
   _ No bribes, threats or peer pressure should be brought to bear
on the children. There should be no ``Johnny told me. Why won't
you?''
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of interviews, repetitious questions and leading
questions should be kept to a minimum. Many communities around the
country, including virtually every major city, have set up
children's assessment centers over the last several years so that
children who may have been abused can often undergo one-stop
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   _ Interviews should be carefully documented and preserved so the
record can be checked for tainting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Children should not be encouraged to imagine acts that did not
occur. Such imaginings, studies have shown, can sometimes be
confused with real memories.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Anatomically detailed'' dolls, dolls with genitalia meant to
help children demonstrate the abuse perpetrated on them, should be
used with great care if at all. Research has shown that a child's
natural interest in the dolls' sexual organs can sometimes mislead,
though the dolls are also known to help children disclose abuse.
The guidelines of the American Professional Society on the Abuse of
Children say: ``Anatomical dolls should not be used as a diagnostic
test for sexual abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of a consensus about child suggestibility has
carried particular scientific drama because of the high stakes
involved: Underestimate the power of suggestibility and innocent
people could go to jail; overestimate it, and abused children might
not be believed, traumatizing them still more and allowing child
abusers to victimize more children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Worries that abuse is under-reported have been bolstered by
suggestibility studies showing that children are likelier to lie by
denying something although it really happened than by making
something up that never occurred, noted Dr. Carolyn Newberger, an
expert on sexual abuse who works at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would indicate there are far more children who are abused
and don't let anyone know than who are not abused and tell someone
they are,'' Dr. Newberger said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet disclosure is critical, because diagnosing child sexual
abuse sometimes remains difficult. The American Academy of Child
and Adolescent Psychiatry guidelines note that studies have shown
that no one symptom characterizes a majority of sexually abused
children, and about one-third of victims exhibit no symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   What researchers have done, then, is to progressively close in
on sexual abuse by creating or exploiting situations like it, as
well as conditions and strategies that mimic those of forensic
interviews, then building a case and plugging holes, in study after
study after study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying they're the perfect analogue of sex abuse, but
you look at research as a building process,'' said Dr. Stephen
Ceci, a Cornell University developmental psychologist who has been
a leader of the camp of researchers who emphasize how suggestible
children are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each new study tries to rule out some weakness in the prior
studies,'' Ceci said. ``People looked at painful things,
embarrassing things, genital things, within a whole web of motives:
lying to protect loved ones; lying to avoid embarrassment; lying to
gain material reward; lying to avoid punishment; lying to keep
secrets; lying to sustain a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggestibility studies once focused largely on asking a
misleading question and seeing how it affected children's
perceptions of an event they had witnessed. Now, many studies have
moved toward focusing more on personally salient events, in
situations more reminiscent of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit for Ms. LeFave's motion for a new trial, Dr.
Maggie Bruck of McGill University, another top researcher in Ceci's
camp, cited a 1996 study from the Monographs of the Society for
Research in Child Development. The researchers, Margaret Steward
and David Steward, interviewed children using anatomical dolls
three times after a pediatric clinic visit. ``With each interview,
children's false reports of anal touching increased,'' Dr. Bruck
wrote. ``By the final interview, which took place six months after
the initial visit, more than one-third of the children falsely
reported anal touching.''
</P>
<P>
   But other studies by Dr. Gail Goodman, a University of
California at Davis psychologist and a foremost suggestibility
researcher in the camp that tends to emphasize children's
truthfulness, highlighted the great accuracy of children's reports
even in such intimate situations. Dr. Goodman and colleagues
studied the accounts of children who had been catheterized for a
necessary test of the urinary tract that the researchers considered
the closest medical procedure to child abuse _ embarrassing,
genital and painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done that's somewhat different from what Ceci
usually does is we ask very abuse-related questions,'' she said.
``He asks, `Did they tear up the teddy bear and spill coffee on
you?' And we ask, `Didn't he touch your bottom,` or, `How many
times did he kiss you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``We find,'' she said, ``that once the kids are around 5 years
of age, they're just surprisingly accurate on those kinds of
questions. The 3-year-olds tend to make more like 25 percent errors
on average.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the focus is also shifting to the individual
differences that make one child much more suggestible than another,
and to experimental interviewing techniques that help children tell
more without contaminating their memories.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one other great point of consensus among child-abuse
experts, it is on the great need for even more training of social
workers, police investigators, psychologists and others in the
proper way to deal with children who may have been abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consensus about what people say they should do shouldn't be
confused with what's actually happening,'' said Michael Lamb, a
researcher at the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development in Bethesda, Md. ``We've found that in fact, in the
field, the overwhelming majority of the questions put to children
during investigative interviews are more focused questions and only
between 2 and 6 percent are actually open-ended.''
</P>
<P>
   True to Lamb's findings, cases are still cropping up in which
highly questionable interviewing techniques have been used. The
Washington branch of the American Civil Liberties Union has
complained that in the 1994 Wenatchee sex-ring case in Washington
state, the police investigation violated several basic tenets of
interviewing; among them, children were threatened with punishment
or marathon interrogation if they did not say that they had been
sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gerald Amirault, he is serving his 30- to 40-year prison
sentence and watching what happens as prosecutors appeal the ruling
in his sister's case to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.
If the ruling holds, Amirault can try a similar appeal, said his
lawyer, Daniel Williams of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintain that the Amiraults got fair trials, and the
state supreme court has repeatedly ruled against the family. But
the court has never dealt with a lower court ruling like
Borenstein's.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 when he was on trial, Amirault said, ``It was looked at
as right to question the children the way they did.''
</P>
<P>
   But back then, he noted, suggestibility research ``was a brand
new area, a brand spanking new area. The expert pool hadn't even
been established. So I couldn't even find experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``The way you perceive everything is looked at in a totally
different light,'' he said. ``I would love to go back to trial.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAPPORO, Japan _ No business failure in Japan has been more
traumatic than that of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, one of the nation's
biggest financial institutions. Its collapse last year sent the
entire financial system into a tailspin and set off alarm bells
that are still ringing in markets around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   But now, take a walk inside the marble-pillared, wood-paneled
halls of the bank's headquarters here on the northern island of
Hokkaido. On a recent morning, more than 120 customers bustled
about, making deposits and withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the bank rose like a phoenix from the ashes. It
just never burned up. After announcing that the bank had failed,
the government plugged it into a life-support system, and nothing
really changed. It will be acquired soon by another institution,
but many of its money-losing operations could continue indefinitely
under another name.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar is happening throughout Asia: corporations are
``failing'' in record numbers, but many keep on going anyway. As a
result, the feeble are not eliminated, the fat is not trimmed, and
the region's long-term prospects suffer.
</P>
<P>
   A common refrain among Westerners is that there should be more
out-and-out business failure in Asia. ``Capitalism without
bankruptcy is like Christianity without hell'' is a line heard
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   But governments and legal systems routinely protect tycoons from
their own incompetence, setting the stage not for a Darwinian
struggle but for survival of the flimsiest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about every country has problems of this kind'' in Asia,
said Rajeev Malik, regional economist at Jardine Fleming
International Securities Ltd. in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it is totally sink or swim in the United States; the
government did help rescue Chrysler Corp. in 1979. And when a U.S.
bank fails, regulators try to broker a rapid transfer of ownership
so that the old bank may close its doors on a Friday and reopen the
next Monday with a new name, and the customers may barely perceive
a change.
</P>
<P>
   While under bankruptcy protection, U.S. companies can dismiss
workers fairly easily and radically reshape themselves. They might
reappear stronger and more efficient, or they might be broken up
and sold. But in Asia, big companies often hang on until they
simply expire in a cloud of debt, rather than liquidate themselves
or file for bankruptcy protection to restructure.
</P>
<P>
   In most countries here, the legal framework for bankruptcy is
vague and loosely formed, management is given little protection
against creditors, and there is rarely any thoroughgoing change. In
countries that have known little but expansion for four decades,
the idea of layoffs or dragging dirty linen through the courts
makes banks and companies highly uncomfortable about bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real challenge,'' said Oh Soo Geun, a law professor at
Inha University in South Korea. Insolvent conglomerates,
particularly in South Korea, he said, ``are really too big to
kill.''
</P>
<P>
   So while large companies in Asia may become insolvent, or cannot
keep operating without help, they tend not to file for bankruptcy.
Indeed, the executives of such companies may not know how badly off
they are, and many simply choose to pretend that little has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Governments, fearful of economic chaos, frequently approve. So
failed companies hang on in corporate limbo, neither collapsing nor
expanding, and relying on government handouts and good luck.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Asia has seen bankruptcies for years, with the
number soaring in the last year. But formal bankruptcies have
mostly been at small and medium-sized companies, while corporate
giants generally manage to hang on.
</P>
<P>
   Governments are understandably loath to shut down insolvent or
cash-squeezed banks, for fear of provoking chaos in the financial
system. Washington stepped in, for example, when Continental
Illinois Bank and Trust Co. failed in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But economists cite several reasons failed companies should, in
general, be formally put to rest.
</P>
<P>
   First, the disappearance of bad companies takes overcapacity out
of the system and improves the prospects of better-managed
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Second, without having to face a day of reckoning, companies and
financial institutions might take foolish risks. If they bet right,
they know, they will prosper; if they bet wrong, they will still
muddle through.
</P>
<P>
   Third, in a market economy, bankruptcy is the consequence of
mismanagement. Without companies and banks going out of business,
no valid threat exists to encourage prudent practices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this logic might not convince workers at failing
companies in Asia, particularly these days, when there are no other
jobs to be had and no safety net available. So in Japan, since the
failure of Hokkaido Takushoku, the government has suggested on
several occasions that no more big banks will be allowed to fail.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, the government not only declared a moratorium on
large-scale bankruptcies but also basically forced banks to throw
good money after bad to save some feeble conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   So workers are as busy as ever at Kia Motors, which officially
failed last fall, but was not put into bankruptcy. Earlier this
year, Kia introduced two new cars, including a van, called the
Carnival, which has become a national hit. It certainly did not
hurt sales that the company appealed to the patriotic spirit of
consumers in its advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The company, with assets worth more than $6 billion, keeps
making cars with support from its main banks and the government.
Kia is unusual in that it still has value, although an effort to
auction the company failed after the four bidders did not satisfy
the government's conditions for the sale.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Korea First Bank and Seoul Bank, both teetering, have been
judged too big to fail or to file for bankruptcy, so they, too, are
being supported by the government and put up for auction.
</P>
<P>
   One big problem in Asia is that bankruptcy rules are so harsh _
far harsher than in the United States _ that companies do anything
to avoid the process. In Japan and Korea, when a corporation files
for bankruptcy, the rules require that management be dismissed, the
court appoints a trustee management and there is no automatic
protection from creditors, so entrenched managements have little
interest in taking this route.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, since managers are allowed to stay, weak
companies often turn to bankruptcy to avoid creditors and regroup.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Asia is also facing challenges. While failed companies
may go out of business and dismiss employees, there is no smooth
procedure to protect creditors and iron out their claims or to
parcel out a bankrupt concern's remaining assets. All this
aggravates the bad-debt mess at the banks.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia and Thailand, banks have not disclosed the full
extent of their bad debts, making it hard to assess the risk of
their insolvency. Thailand, for instance, though it shut down most
of the country's rickety finance companies, nationalized four
commercial banks that were technically insolvent. Still, it is
trying to rejigger its bankruptcy rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankruptcy law is a big issue,'' said Peter Sikora, an analyst
at Standard &AMP; Poor's in Melbourne, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   One sticky issue is that in the West it is still generally
accepted that the rights of creditors and shareholders should
prevail. There is no such view in much of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Take Sanyo Securities, which in November filed for
reorganization, a last attempt to save the company and avoid
bankruptcy. Shareholders will be huge losers, but the
court-appointed trustee kept workers on the payroll and tried _
unsuccessfully _ to find a buyer so that the company could avoid
liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   So shareholders were watching as the company's brand name was
offered free, in hopes that a buyer would retain employees. As was
hoped, many workers found new jobs, so the number remaining has
fallen to 900 from 2,300.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanyo said on Aug. 31 that in September it would keep only
200 workers to help liquidate the company.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the government arranged for North Pacific Bank to
take over Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, often called Takugin, instead of
letting it go out of business, was to preserve the jobs of its
5,700 employees. The case offers insight into how failures are
likely to be handled in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking over most of Takugin's employees,'' said Masanao
Takei, president of North Pacific Bank. ``There will be no job
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Takugin failed because of a liquidity squeeze and because it
simply lost credibility in the interbank market, the lifeblood of
the financial system. While it never filed for bankruptcy _ the
Finance Ministry issued a one-page order to improve business _ the
failure provoked the collapse of some of Hokkaido's biggest
companies and helped sink the entire island's economy.
</P>
<P>
   So the government tried to save the pieces. On a breezy Saturday
last fall, Takei got an urgent call from the Finance Ministry.
Standing in the hall of The Hokkaido Daily newspaper, where he was
attending a seminar, Takei was asked for the first time if his tiny
bank would take over this city's largest, but sickest, private
institution, with 5,700 employees. And the official on the line
stressed that he would like an answer as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Takei left the newspaper building, rushed to his office and met
with two of his aides for nearly five hours to thrash out the risks
and opportunities and to formulate counterproposals and demands. He
could only guess at how bad the bank's problems were. (The Finance
Ministry ``wouldn't tell us,'' he said, adding, ``I don't think
they would tell us such matters until we answered yes.'')
</P>
<P>
   At about 7 o'clock that evening, Takei called in his decision:
Yes, but he would not take the bad loans. Two days later, the
Finance Ministry announced that Hokkaido Takushoku had failed, and
the banking system descended into a shaky meltdown for a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the decision to avoid chaos and confusion in the local
economy,'' Takei said. ``What we are doing now is a test case for
all of Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it has been. The tiny North Pacific, with only $15
billion in assets, will be swallowing Takugin, the nation's
20th-largest bank, with 10 trillion yen ($76 billion) in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the announcement that Takugin had failed suddenly
made it more reliable. Now customers are at least sure that a
healthy institution is taking it over and that its deposits are
guaranteed, while they have no such assurances about banks that
have not failed.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is still the local government's paying agent, and many
depositors, like Kazuko Horii, are rallying behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ordinary account here is just like my purse,'' said Mrs.
Horii, 61, who was visiting the bank with her friend Sachiko
Yoneta. ``Other banks are facing similar dangers, and the Japanese
government policy is that North Pacific Bank will take over this
bank. So, if you compare the two situations, I think this bank is
better.''

   ``There's a point on your shin where it works or doesn't work,''
and that's what every woman needs to know right now, fashion
publicist  &UR; Elizabeth Harrison &LR;   &LR; told the Wall Street Journal. The
issue is whether to wear long skirts.

<P>
   Meanwhile, a University of Michigan psychologist has found that
bimbos may, indeed, act dumb. According to  &UR; Barbara &LR;

so much effort thinking about it that their brains don't have the
capacity to do much else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't just clothes like bathing suits, that are revealing
or low-cut, that can have this effect,'' Frederickson said. ``Any
clothing or circumstances that make a woman feel self-conscious
about how she looks to others, even if she thinks she looks great,
might reduce the mental energy she brings to demanding tasks, like
solving advanced math problems.''

   By Alex Barnum 
   Chronicle Staff Writer 
   It is not an issue that normally commands the attention of
voters, like education and crime.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But in this year's race for governor, the environment has been
front and center, with the candidates debating such a politically
explosive issue as offshore oil drilling.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four years, California must deal with a wide range
of environmental concerns, including persistent air pollution,
shrinking open spaces and a growing population, thirsty for water.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to find another subject that reveals starker
contrasts between the two gubernatorial candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gray Davis has long impressed environmental groups with
his opposition to offshore oil drilling and has won praise for his
work on the State Lands Commission.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the state's water needs _ always a volatile
issue _ the lieutenant governor favors conservation over new dams
and reservoirs, and opposes a Peripheral Canal in the
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. And he pledges to be tough with
industry in meeting key environmental goals.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Dan Lungren has long argued that environmental
regulations are overly burdensome for business and property owners.
</P>
<P>
   As a congressmen in the 1980s, Lungren voted against some key
environmental laws, partly out of fiscal conservatism, but also
because of his belief that economic factors should be considered
when making environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
   For the state's environmental groups, there has never been any
question about which candidate to back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the easiest endorsements we've ever had to
make,'' said Sam Schuchat, executive director of the California
League of Conservation Voters, the political arm of the state's
environmental movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray had an excellent voting record in the state Assembly. He
did very well as a member of the State Lands Commission. He's just
been a good, consistent friend of the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Davis' greener record may appeal to liberal, urban
voters, particularly in Northern California, it may play less well
among more conservative voters in the Central Valley and Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmental issues are very tricky for a statewide candidate
in California,'' said Dan Schnur, a Republican consultant and
former aide to Governor Pete Wilson. ``On the one hand, you want to
come across as a defender (of the environment). On the other, you
don't want to look like an extremist.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every Sierra Club member who looks at this as a defining
issue, there are no small numbers of farmers and developers and
everyday citizens who see the environment debate in much different
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of his criticism of environmental regulations
and his support of new reservoirs to supply water to Central Valley
farms, Lungren has received the backing of the influential
California Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a philosophical difference between the two
candidates,'' said Bill Pauli, a winemaker near Ukiah and president
of the farm group. ``Davis is less receptive to ways of maintaining
agriculture and allowing us to stay in production.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's view of environmental policy, shared by the farming,
development and other industries, is that the existing regulations
already are hurting California businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to prove that you can be both pro-environment and
pro-jobs,'' Lungren said when asked about his top environmental
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will promote a regulatory environment that gives
California's business community the flexibility to meet strong
standards in the most efficient manner, and the proper incentives
to protect our environment and help our economy grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk sounds similar to what President Clinton and other
Democrats say about balancing jobs and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   But environmental groups say a look at Lungren's record in
Congress in the 1980s and as attorney general in the 1990s exposes
a philosophy that is out of step with the public's support for
tough environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Lungren was one of a handful of Republicans who
voted to curtail environmental protections during his tenure in
Congress. They point to votes against reauthorization of the Clean
Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike then-Senator Pete Wilson, Lungren opposed a moratorium on
offshore oil drilling. And he was one of only a few members of
Congress to vote against creating wilderness areas in California
and other states.
</P>
<P>
   During his congressional career, which stretched from 1979 to
1989, he received an average score of 27 on a scale of 100 in the
League of Conservation Voters' ``environmental scorecard.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But Lungren campaign officials say environmental groups have
distorted his record. While his votes were often in line with
President Reagan's agenda and reflected his own fiscal
conservatism, they were not nearly as bad as critics make them out
to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going off a different record,'' said Bob Brown, a
campaign spokesman. ``There are plenty of votes in Congress that
show him as someone who is ensuring that the environment is
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar debate occurs over Lungren's record as attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   According to Clifford Rechtschaffen, a deputy attorney general
in the environment section under Lungren and his predecessor, John
Van de Kamp, independent environmental enforcement actions by the
attorney general's office dropped 95 percent under Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren pursued just 10 independent enforcement actions to
protect the environment over the past four years, said
Rechtschaffen, who left the office in 1993. By comparison, Van de
Kamp intervened in at least 179 environmental cases during his
tenure as attorney general from 1986 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lungren has emasculated that part of the office,'' said
Rechtschaffen, now a law professor at Golden Gate University School
of Law in San Francisco. ``It's gone unnoticed because it's a lot
harder to draw attention to actions you don't take. But the effect
on the environment is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh  &LR; `Apples and Oranges'
</P>
<P>
   But officials in the attorney general's office dispute
Rechtschaffen's accusations, saying he is comparing ``apples and
oranges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are wildly inaccurate,'' said Staci Turner, a
spokeswoman in the attorney general's office. If actions on behalf
of government agencies are included, Lungren's office has filed
more than 2,000 environment cases since 1991, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Davis' campaign has targeted Lungren's
environmental record for attack. Davis has tried to highlight their
differences at debates by raising issues like offshore oil
drilling.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Davis has long opposed new offshore oil drilling.
As the state's controller and now as lieutenant governor, Davis
sits on the three-member State Lands Commission, which oversees oil
and gas development on state lands.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, he supported a permanent moratorium on new
offshore oil drilling in the state, a ban later enacted into state
law. And he recently called on Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to
reject any applications to allow drilling in existing undeveloped
federal oil leases off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, Davis also
co-authored legislation that became a sweeping oil spill prevention
law.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also has supported new national parks in the California
desert and, as a member of the State Lands Commission, filed
lawsuits against Los Angeles companies for dumping DDT and other
chemicals into Santa Monica Bay.
</P>
<P>
   In March, he announced he would push for a ban on the logging of
old-growth trees if he were elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also has won plaudits from environmental groups for his
innovative ``debt for nature'' swaps. As part of a settlement with
Bank of America over unclaimed bank accounts, for example, Davis
brokered a deal in which the state acquired a 37,000-acre cattle
ranch near Red Bluff.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Davis's green credentials, supporters acknowledge that
the challenge for his campaign will be keeping environmental issues
at the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment is Gray's issue in a sense,'' said Jerry
Meral, executive director of the Planning and Conservation League,
an environmental lobbying group. ``Davis has a very good record.
His opponent has a terrible record.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``people don't face environmental crises in
their day-to-day lives,'' Meral said. ``You have to remind them
that there's a problem.''

MODERN PRIMITIVES MAKE BURNING MAN HOTTEST EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM WHITING  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    GERLACH, Nev. _ Under a full desert moon, as many as 15,000
people paraded onto an ancient lakebed Sunday night to watch the
Burning Man go from pink and purple neon to hot, orange flames.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dragster with a V-8 engine parted the crowd and passed the
torch to a naked woman who lit a man in a flame-retardant suit. He
torched the pyre, and within 10 minutes, it toppled, bringing to a
ceremonial end the largest Burning Man festival in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the end of the world,'' said Jill Benjamin, who watched
from the shoulders of her boyfriend, Mark Ritchie.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie described the pyrotechnics as ``straight from the 14th
century. It's just biblical.''
</P>
<P>
   It was even more biblical on Saturday, when a desert sandstorm
was brought down to mud by the rain.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong arts festival, which ended Sunday, was the biggest
in the event's history. Fifteen thousand tickets were sold,
compared with 8,700 last year, according to Burning Man officials.
They wandered among 440 registered theme camps and all forms of art
installations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the week, a fully functioning city emerged from the desert
floor, complete with newspapers and radio stations, a police and
first-aid force, a few golf courses, dance halls and lounges, camel
rides and staged entertainment. Before he was to be burned to the
ground last night, the 50-foot-tall wooden Burning Man stood at the
end of a long promenade 2,000 feet from center camp.
</P>
<P>
   Black Rock City, as it is known, encompassed 14 million square
feet of desert floor controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management. Laid out on a half-circle grid with zoning, streets and
street signs, the city grew so much this year that it straddled two
counties _ Washoe and Pershing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People out here build whole worlds out of nothing, through
cooperating,'' said Burning Man founder and director Larry Harvey
during a Saturday afternoon speech. Harvey started the movement in
1986, with 20 people burning an eight-foot effigy on Baker Beach in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Burning Man's governing precept is ``no spectators.'' Everyone
is expected to participate. Some groups spend months building
elaborate structures hauled out in pieces and put together.
</P>
<P>
   For others, ``participation'' means stripping naked, painting
their bodies and rolling around in the sand, as a group was doing
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like being in the middle of a wacky movie set,'' said
Mr. Lucky, a San Francisco lounge performer who played a cocktail
party Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone out here can give it all away and live on the edge of
society,'' Harvey told the crowd. He encouraged the audience to
live each day of the year as if it were Burning Man, though it's
not clear how that might go over in other pockets of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Burning Man occupied more days than before, with
events running through the summer in San Francisco, highlighted by
a street party and monthlong display of the effigy, lit in neon in
the Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   The desert society was also expanded, from five days to eight.
Disciples didn't seem to mind the pricey tickets, $65-$80 per
person in advance, $100 at the gate. When the gates opened August
30, 2,000 people were waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought they'd trickle in. They just piled in,'' Harvey
said. ``In two days it was a city.'' In fact, there were so many
RVs that the desert looked like the lots at 3Com Park on a 49er
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   One group built a wooden Humvee. There was also a temple of
worship, with stained glass on all sides. Then there was ``Drano:
The Biggest Little Village in the World,'' a spoof on Reno,
complete with welcome arch. Among Drano's enticements was
``Stallion Ranch,'' a brothel staffed by men.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have built things much, much bigger than they ever have
before,'' said event manager Joegh Bullock, whose own camp burned
down last Sunday, before the festival began. When the flames went
up, people came running. ``They thought it was a performance
piece,'' said Bullock. The fire was put out in three minutes by
on-site firefighters. Bullock lost a tent but gained ``a lesson in
the wind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement problems during the festival focused, not
surprisingly, on drugs. There were several arrests for drug
dealing, according to Sergeant Scot Munns of the Washoe County
Sheriff's Department, and more than 10 overdoses, several of which
required evacuation by airlift.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, there were no discounted day passes. It was
$100 per person and $100 per dog. Some foreign tourists tried to
talk their way in, were rebuffed and left. Still, some 4,500
tickets were sold at the gate. Last year, bankruptcy loomed, but
this year Burning Man will end in the black, and there is talk of
renting a San Francisco office for the four full-time staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commerce is civilization. There's nothing wrong with
commerce,'' Harvey told the crowd Saturday. If anything, the steep
ticket prices helped with the bartering atmosphere. ``We're trying
to create a gift economy,'' Harvey said. ``Coming out here, you
embrace a kind of poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after his speech, the weather responded, kicking
up a sandstorm that made the desert look like the dust bowl during
the Great Depression. Tents flapped and tore loose. Wanderers
caught far from their camps leaned into the wind, questioning their
decisions to go out naked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elements don't daunt anybody, it's just one more
challenge'' was the message on Radio Free Black Rock.
</P>
<P>
   To meet it, Shane Chittenden, Reggie Reginella and a few other
med students from Philadelphia attempted a barbecue in extremely
difficult conditions. ``It's just a sensory overload,'' Reginella
marveled. ``The creativity is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   A calm in the windstorm came at 7:30 p.m. Bill Cagle and Joe
Mulholland of San Francisco emerged from their RV dressed in dinner
jackets, lavender and blue, and went off to attend a wedding at the
Burning Desire Wedding Chapel. They disappeared into another
windstorm, then a rainstorm. The pair never did find the wedding,
but they found welcome at the Lounge Lizard Cabaret.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it is on the playa at night. If people don't find
what they are looking for, they usually stumble upon something
better.
</P>
<P>
   And stumble they did. The rainstorm turned the roads into a
thick, sticky mud that caused the annual high opera, an elaborate
fully costumed and choreographed original production, to be
postponed from its usual show time of midnight Saturday to 3 a.m.
Sunday. It let out just in time for the crowd to get over to
Bianca's Smut Shack for grilled-cheese sandwiches and Ding Dongs.
</P>
<P>
   At Bianca's, everyone gets greeted at the door, there are 45
couches inside and out, and some hide-a-beds don't stay hidden for
long. There is also a constant disco beat, made all the better
Saturday night when the mud turned shoes into three-inch-high
platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the weather,'' said Harvey from the comfort of his
RV. ``For two years it's been like a climate-controlled room out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey is adamant that Burning Man is not just a carnival, nor
is it a haven for drugs and decadence.
</P>
<P>
   ``All over the country, people are coming back from Burning Man
and trying to live their lives like they do out here,'' he told the
crowd. ``If this is just entertainment, it doesn't mean a thing.'' &QL;

ASIAN MARKETS SURGE IN POWERFUL RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also ASIA-PROTECT, KOREA-ECON) 
(mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Stock markets surged from Singapore to Seoul Monday
in a powerful rally, fueled by a stronger Japanese yen and activist
government policies in Hong Kong and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest increases were in Malaysia and Hong Kong, a pattern
that dismayed some free-market advocates, since both recently
intervened in their markets. In Malaysia, the government imposed
sweeping capital controls.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than flee, investors bought heavily. Kuala Lumpur's stock
exchange rose a record 23 percent, to 443.59 points. By shielding
itself from the global market, Malaysia has been able to lower
interest rates, attracting local investors, particularly big
pension funds with ties to the government.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index soared 7.9 percent, to 8,076
points, as investors reacted enthusiastically to lower interest
rates and new government measures to police the market more
strictly. Those measures came in the aftermath of a $15 billion
government buying spree to prop up shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a technical rebound in these markets,'' said Miron
Mushkat, the director of strategy at Indocam Asia Asset Management.
``With the government policies, there is a greater desire to inject
liquidity into the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Mushkat drew a distinction between Malaysia, which has erected a
wall around its economy, and Hong Kong, which is trying to take the
sting out of its participation in the global economy by supporting
its stock market and devising new rules to ward off foreign
speculators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malaysia has closed the door; Hong Kong is repainting it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in both markets, it is government policy _ rather than
underlying optimism about the local or global economy _ that is
spurring investors to buy shares. If the Hong Kong and Malaysian
markets were functioning freely, interest rates would probably be
higher and shares would probably trade low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance of the markets doesn't alter our
uncertainty,'' said Jan Lee, chief economist of Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corp., which has been one of the main targets of
Hong Kong's buying spree.
</P>
<P>
   In other Asian markets, the reason for Monday's increase was
external _ the strengthening of the Japanese yen relative to the
U.S. dollar. Analysts attributed the strengthening of the yen to
speculation that the Federal Reserve Board may cut interest rates
in the United States to reduce the risk of a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks also rose in other markets. In London, the FTSE 100 index
closed 3.5 percent higher, a 180-point advance, its second-largest
point gain ever. German shares closed about 2 percent higher, and
in Paris, stocks rose slightly. In Mexico, stocks rose for the
first time in three days, closing 4.7 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   But in Russia, political and financial chaos continued. The
parliament refused to confirm acting premier Viktor Chernomyrdin,
the Central Bank president offered to resign and the ruble fell
further.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Hong Kong said Monday that their three-week-long
intervention had succeeded in driving foreign speculators out of
their market. The government had accused such speculators of
improperly manipulating Hong Kong's market in an effort to drive
down shares and futures contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made an incursion, and we want to leave as quickly as
possible,'' said Donald Tsang, financial secretary of Hong Kong.
``We are not in the business of making long-term investments in
commercial companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hong Kong is no longer buying shares, it has opened a
new front in its campaign against the speculators. On Monday, the
government announced a 30-point plan to tighten the securities and
futures markets. The new rules would stiffen penalties for
violations of securities laws, increase monitoring of short selling
and restrict the lending of shares for the purpose of short
selling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced a
package of seven measures designed to strengthen the link between
the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. The highly technical
regulations guarantee, among other things, that licensed Hong Kong
banks can convert Hong Kong dollars into U.S. dollars at a fixed
exchange rate of $7.75 to $1.
</P>
<P>
   Tsang reiterated the government's pledge to maintain the fixed
exchange rate. And he said Hong Kong had no plans to follow
Malaysia down the path of capital controls. ``We hate to be in the
market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Hong Kong is still espousing a free-market credo, Malaysia
has swung clearly to a government-dictated approach. Analysts said
Monday's increase on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange was driven by
institutional investors with ties to the government. Foreign
investors have effectively been frozen out of the market, since
Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, no longer trades outside the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analysts said another reason for the sharp rise in
Malaysia's market was that foreign investors are finding it hard to
sell their shares because they can no longer transfer their ringgit
holdings out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of Malaysia's new policy, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, named himself finance minister Monday, less than a week
after he dismissed Anwar Ibrahim, his reform-minded protege, who
had been both finance minister and deputy prime minister. Anwar's
opposition to closing off Malaysia's market had caused a bitter
rift between him and Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   As Mahathir tightens his grip on Malaysia's economy, Anwar is
battling charges of sexual misconduct and treason.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that shielding Malaysia from the ravages of the
global market could pay short-term dividends. The lower interest
rates, in addition to lifting shares, could jump-start Malaysia's
stalled economy. And the capital controls will insure that Malaysia
does not suffer any more painful devaluations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Malaysian experiment is successful, and other Asian
countries are still struggling a year from now, it could lead to
some disillusionment with naked capitalism and Anglo Saxon-style
markets,'' Mushkin said.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts warned that economic isolationism may give
Malaysia the excuse to put off necessary economic restructuring.
That is the same argument critics have used to fault Hong Kong's
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mobius, president of the Templeton Emerging Markets Fund,
said the fund would no longer invest in either Hong Kong or
Malaysia. Mobius said he was worried that Hong Kong's recent
actions raised questions about its commitment to the link between
its currency and the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   As for Malaysia, Mobius said the government's restrictions on
taking capital out of the country amounted to a ``theft of
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we allow this kind of thing to spread globally,'' Mobius
said, ``the whole financial system will freeze up.''

ISRAELI AIR FORCE SEEKING DOMINION OVER FOWL OF THE AIR
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KFAR RUPPIN, Israel _ Across northern Israel, spotters armed
with binoculars and telescopes keep watch for a periodic incursion
that has come to worry the country's air force as much as anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There!'' one of the spotters, Adrian White, shouted the other
day, sounding the alarm as he pointed to a speck in middle
distance. ``A stork!''
</P>
<P>
   It was a solitary creature, but there would be more to come in
what by mid-September becomes the peak of one of the world's
largest avian migrations. With it, new jitters arrive among those
who must share the skies.
</P>
<P>
   As they do every year in the spring and fall, as many as 500
million birds are expected to pass over Israel this season,
converging along its narrow spine on the way toward warmer winter
climes.
</P>
<P>
   At the intersection of three continents, Israel forms a land
bridge whose thermal air currents lure not only vast clouds of
songbirds, but also hawks, eagles, pelicans and storks by the many
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stunning natural spectacle, but it strikes less awe than
fear in Israeli pilots and their commanders. They are better
equipped for evading missiles than birds, who have become a far
more frequent peril in recent years. Since Israel began keeping
records on the problem in 1974, its military aircraft have slammed
into birds at least 3,000 times, sometimes with catastrophic
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's airspace is among the most crowded in the world,
because of its small size and active air force. A handful of pilots
have been killed, and the price tag has totaled hundreds of
millions of dollars in damage, including eight warplanes lost.
</P>
<P>
   When a plane is flying at more than 600 miles per hour, a
collision even with a much smaller object can generate lethal
force. Last year, for example, an F-16 streaking just 400 feet
above the floor of the Negev was unlucky enough to plow into a
honey buzzard. The plane plummeted to the desert, where it
shattered into small pieces. The trainee pilot and his navigator
had so little time to eject that the pilot lost his leg.
</P>
<P>
   So for more than a decade, the air force has relied for early
warning on birdwatchers like White, 49, a Briton eager to keep a
lookout for the very birds that pilots want at all costs to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very old-fashioned, but for now it's the best that we can
do,'' said a senior air force officer who oversees the program,
built around a few dozen volunteers who for weeks spend most of
their days gazing into the skies.
</P>
<P>
   Because birds are almost impossible to detect on ordinary radar,
the idea was to find another way to help planes avoid the flocks as
they passed through.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, first developed in 1984 by the air force and
Israel's Society for the Preservation of Nature, relies on alerts
and avoidance. As early as the beginning of August, the spotters
are arrayed in a line across northern Israel, keeping watch for
whatever might be making its way south.
</P>
<P>
   They relay reports by walkie-talkie to a supervisor, who passes
them on to a Tel Aviv command center. The center is in direct
contact with the air force, which uses the information to issue
warnings to air bases around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Once the birds are spotted, the steady pace and unvarying routes
of migration make predictions relatively easy. In the fall, for
example, when southbound storks are spotted near Kfar Ruppin, south
of the Sea of Galilee, it is almost certain that their path will
bring them several hours later to military training areas above the
Negev, so pilots there can be alerted to take precautions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the air force has mapped what it calls
``bird-plagued areas'' along two major migration routes. During the
seven months defined by the fall and spring migrations, it
generally prohibits its pilots from flying the kind of high-speed,
low-level missions that resulted in last year's crash and are a
favorite show of derring-do.
</P>
<P>
   When birds are spotted in exceptionally large numbers, a
nationwide prohibition is sometimes imposed on flights below 3,000
feet, in the zone where flocks are at their thickest and most
bird-plane collisions have taken place.
</P>
<P>
   That is a source of frustration for some commanders, who grouse
that pilots have a hard time rehearsing maneuvers that they may
need in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   But all available measures suggest that the program has been a
success. Compared with the decade before it was put into effect,
air force officials say, the number of bird-plane collisions has
plunged by 88 percent, saving an estimated $360 million in
shattered windscreens, ruined engines and mangled planes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That is a source of pride for the air force and for Dr. Yossi
Leshem, the ornithologist who was the architect of the program. Yet
even though the bird spotters play the instrumental role, such
statistics are of little interest to them. They say they are drawn
to Israel not by patriotic purpose, but by the giddy prospect of
seeing birds in numbers too great to count.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an F-16 crashes into a flock of storks, it kills 30 storks,
so why not think about it from that perspective?'' said Barak
Granit, 22, an Israeli who has supervised the spotting teams for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Recruited through advertisements in birding magazines, the
spotters must pay their own way to Israel, and some stay for as
long as three months at a time. They receive no salary, just bed
and board at a kibbutz, and spend most of their days alone, with a
tree for shelter and a clipboard to keep track of what passes
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   A highlight was a day like Sept. 6, 1997, when white storks and
honey buzzards were spotted by the tens of thousands, as many as
are usually seen all season. It was the next morning that the F-16
plowed into one of the huge birds.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a different kind of drama that spotters seek as they
scan the horizon. ``We qualify for a day off every week,'' said
Steve Mulkeen, 26, a Briton who is one of this year's contingent,
``but I think most of us are afraid to take it because we might
miss some really good birds.''

CHAIRMAN OF RUSSIA'S CENTRAL BANK RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: RUSSIA-POLITICS, RUSSIA-REDS.)

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Working for Russia's Central Bank has never been easy.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, a bomb has exploded at one office, an
auditor has had his hand broken and his dacha set on fire after
investigating a bank, and Sergei Dubinin, the chairman, has had
shots fired at his home twice. Dubinin, speaking on state
television last year, said the shots were a ``warning from powerful
structures,'' which he declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Russia's gyrating financial markets and economic
collapse, and Dubinin's erratic handling of those events, that were
ultimately responsible for his undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Dubinin, a former university chairman and commercial banker and
an alumnus of the vast energy conglomerate Gazprom, resigned
Monday, criticizing parliament's failure to act more quickly to
help resuscitate the prostrate economy.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation leaves a large gap at the top of Russia's
economic hierarchy at a time when it can least afford it. The
economy is collapsing, and the quality of life continues to fray.
The beleaguered ruble offers little hope of a revival.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in the ruble was halted Monday on the Moscow Interbank
Currency Exchange barely an hour after opening because no traders
were willing to sell dollars. One exchange official said that
during that hour, the ruble's value plunged to 2 cents, far below
the rate of 5 to 6 cents it has been fetching on the street and an
ominous sign that more dire economic times may lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, only weeks ago the ruble was trading at about 16 cents.
That was before the government announced a devaluation that it then
hoped would let the ruble fall no lower than 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruble crashed. In its wake the economy and the political
leadership have fallen into disarray, and there are renewed fears
that the government will default on about $133 billion owed to
foreign creditors. Private companies are said to owe $70 billion,
but that figure is not considered entirely reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks very likely that the government will default unless
something changes dramatically,'' said Peter Boone, an analyst with
Brunswick Warburg. ``The appointment of the next central banker is
going to be incredibly important.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dubinin and the Central Bank declined to comment on his
resignation, but speculation is already afoot about possible
replacements. Attention focused on two candidates, Viktor
Gerashchenko, a central banker from the Soviet era who is a
favorite of the Communists, and Aleksandr Shokhin, a moderate who
leads Viktor Chernomyrdin's faction in parliament. Sergei
Aleksashenko, Dubinin's former deputy, is now acting chairman of
the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Duma, the lower house of parliament, rejected
Chernomyrdin again as President Boris Yeltsin's choice to be prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Dubinin is well regarded by those who value his efforts to rein
in the money supply over in recent years, a policy that had kept
the ruble stable before the recent debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under my leadership, the Central Bank did not print worthless
money,'' Dubinin wrote in a letter quoted by a state news agency.
``Monetary policies cannot forever compensate for weaknesses in tax
collection and the management of national debt, both internal and
external.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian politicians are typically quick to allocate blame for
the country's ills, and lately it has been Dubinin's turn to play
sacrificial lamb. Weeks ago Chernomyrdin accused Dubinin of being
responsible for devaluing the ruble, even though a much broader and
more powerful cast of politicians, advisers, bankers and
international lending agencies seem to have had roles in the
decision _ and not with one voice.
</P>
<P>
   And Yeltsin, who hardly has been a model of alacrity during this
economic crisis, received the news of Dubinin's resignation coolly:
``The president said this decision should have been taken
earlier,'' said the Kremlin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there have been other, better-founded criticisms of
Dubinin's decisions in recent weeks. He was faulted for easing
reserve requirements for banks as their loans went sour, a move
many considered to be a signal that he was willing to bail out
banks rather than let them fail. He has also been chastised for not
defending the ruble early and consistently, and then for wasting
precious reserves and international financial assistance when he
belatedly decided to support the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank also failed to rigorously supervise the often
profligate bankers, who operated their companies more like
high-flying, speculative ventures than as institutions that could
have helped lay the groundwork for a modern economy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the banks ran up huge piles of bad loans to industrial
concerns in which they held interests and found themselves holding
piles of worthless securities. And because of bankers' political
influence, funds that could have been used to strengthen the
Central Bank's reserves were used to give life support to failing
banks.
</P>
<P>
   It is still uncertain whether any Russian central bankers can
effectively guide the economy when they are beholden to a
government that has been unable to collect taxes and relies on the
Central Bank to help pay off its debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Central Bank policy is completely confused,'' said
Margot Jacobs, a banking analyst here with United Financial Group.
``Dubinin didn't do a bad job of monetary policy for the past
couple of years, but he did a lousy job of preparing banks for what
they're going through now.''

MARKET PLACE: THE BUFFETT EFFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Skedded earlier as BERKSHIRE-STOCKS)  
(mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is well known that Warren Buffett is one of the world's
smartest investors and one of the world's richest men. It is also
well known that he did not get that way buying stocks at prices
well above their asset values.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is exactly where the stock in Buffett's holding
company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., now stands. In spite of a stock
market decline that has hammered many of the shares that Buffett
famously owns, including American Express, Coca-Cola, the Travelers
Group and Gillette, shares of Berkshire Hathaway have a gain for
the year. Indeed, Berkshire is up 30.4 percent even as its
portfolio of eight major stockholdings has lost 6 percent, net of
credits Buffett could use for taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Berkshire Hathaway has weakened in recent weeks with
the broad market. Its A shares closed Friday at $60,000, down 26
percent from their peak in April. The B shares, which were issued
two years ago at one-thirtieth of the A share value, fetched $1,990
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent outperformance of Berkshire Hathaway means that
its stock is now trading at 2.4 times the value of its eight
largest common-stock investments. At the end of last year,
Berkshire stock fetched 1.4 times the value of its top eight
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Buffett effect. Being able to invest alongside
Warren Buffett has made Berkshire a cult stock, an issue that
everybody wants to own and nobody wants to sell. Watching Berkshire
Hathaway's A and B shares scale ever-higher heights in recent years
has been a source of immense frustration to any investor who sold.
</P>
<P>
   Betting against Buffett and selling his stock is nobody's idea
of smart investing. Indeed, the company has raised its book value
an astonishing 25.5 percent in each of the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given that in his 1996 annual report, Buffett
characterized his Berkshire Hathaway stock as ``not undervalued,''
one might well wonder: What would he call it now?
</P>
<P>
   Buffett makes it a rule not to discuss his investing strategy
with reporters. So for his opinion, investors will probably have to
wait until next spring, when he issues another of his homespun
letters to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the outperformance of Berkshire Hathaway stock
compared with Buffett's eight favored stocks provides an intriguing
example of market inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Berkshire Hathaway is much more than just an
investment vehicle for Buffett. It is also a property-casualty
insurance company with interests in newspapers, candy manufacturing
and home-furnishing stores.
</P>
<P>
   But equities represent 65 percent of Berkshire's total assets,
and the eight big stocks account for nearly 90 percent of the
equity holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance dominates Berkshire Hathaway's operations. The Geico
subsidiary is one of the largest underwriters of auto insurance
nationwide; the recent acquisition of General Re bolsters Berkshire
Hathaway's reinsurance business, in which it shares exposure to
large risks with other companies. Last year, insurance premiums
accounted for 46 percent of the company's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that investors think Berkshire shares should trade
at a significantly higher premium to its stock portfolio because
the company's insurance business is growing astronomically?
Perhaps, but that would be in stark contrast to what Buffett's
expectations are for the insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   In his annual report last year, he said that while Geico's
performance was exceptional in 1997, its management expects the
company's profit margins to return to more normal levels ``as
losses increase faster than premiums.'' As for its other insurance
operations, specifically catastrophe reinsurance, Buffett said that
``eventually, a large catastrophe event will occur that will
produce a significant loss to the insurance group, although the
timing of the loss cannot be predicted.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the insurance business has enjoyed a period of strong
earnings and improving margins, which Buffett himself believes will
not continue. ``Our rate of progress in both investments and
operations is certain to fall in the future,'' he wrote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The decline in stock prices that Buffett predicted last spring
has occurred. The big-name stocks that he favors have remained in
the stratosphere much longer than the shares of small, lesser-known
companies. But even these stocks have recently been trounced. As of
last Friday, Coca-Cola is off 7 percent for the year; Gillette has
lost 18.5 percent; American Express is down 17.5 percent. Travelers
Group has fallen 27.6 percent; Wells Fargo has lost 13 percent, and
Walt Disney is down 15.3 percent so far in 1998. The only stock up
is that of Washington Post Co., which has risen 4.6 percent.
Freddie Mac is unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even at these shrunken prices, Buffett still has huge
gains in his stocks. His cost basis for the eight holdings is
roughly 20 percent of their current value.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the 36 percent premium between what Berkshire
Hathaway fetches and what Buffett's stocks are worth, investors
trying to mimic his results might be better off buying the stocks
than Berkshire. Taxes are another reason this makes sense.
Individuals pay taxes on long-term capital gains at a top rate of
20 percent, well below the estimated 35 percent corporate tax that
Buffett must pay on Berkshire Hathaway's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett has signaled for quite some time that stocks, including
his own, may be overvalued. In his last annual report he warned
that stock prices ``have materially eroded the `margin of safety'
that Ben Graham identified as the cornerstone of intelligent
investing.'' And it is not surprising to anyone that in his recent
acquisition of General Re, he used Berkshire Hathaway stock, not
cash, as the currency for the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it, Buffett is smart. His stock, however, may not
be.

 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ For the last few weeks, Bill Richardson has
been trying to do two apparently unreconcilable jobs as the Clinton
administration's new energy secretary and the government's
representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   That should end formally on Friday when Richardson _ a
politician turned diplomat who has been about the most relaxed and
genial envoy this diplomatic hothouse has seen in a generation _
resigns his U.N. assignment. But informally, he said over breakfast
early one morning before catching yet another shuttle, there is no
rupture involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major goals I have is to give the Energy Department
more international visibility,'' he said. ``I'm going to do a lot
of travel, a lot of retail energy diplomacy, beef up my
international department there.''
</P>
<P>
   He has new friends to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of issues in the energy area that involve the
Russians: plutonium disposition, uranium agreements and nuclear
safety, nuclear weapons safety,'' he said. ``A lot of the Energy
Department relationship is Russian, and I got to know a lot of the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years of experience _ on Iraq and the Persian Gulf area, the
source of much of the oil the United States uses; on the spread of
nuclear weapons; on reactor safety; on trying to bring North Korea
into an agreement on nuclear energy; on global climate _ can be
applied in his new job, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, diplomats who were initially frosty at
having a politician _ a former Democratic congressman from New
Mexico _ thrust on them by Washington seem to have come to
appreciate a style that is zany by U.N. standards.
</P>
<P>
   He's known to have referred to a distinguished diplomat as
``what's his name'' and to have worn khakis and a blazer into the
Security Council. At a dinner that he and his wife, Barbara, gave
for financier George Soros, Richardson began his toast by admitting
cheerfully that he had never met Soros before.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Madeleine Albright, who was rushed through the
corridors of the United Nations with an important-looking phalanx
of protective aides when she represented the United States here,
Bill Richardson ambles around, joking in English and Spanish with
reporters. The faces of other U.S. diplomats reveal a flicker of
panic when he steps up to a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight nations have lined up to give him farewell dinners.
He admits he gets a lot of attention because he is perceived as
being close to the president. Ambassadors also know he may be Al
Gore's running mate in two years. But people genuinely like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One should not confuse two things of a different nature,''
said Danilo Turk, Slovenia's representative who was president of
the Security Council during Richardson's last month here. ``For one
thing, Bill Richardson, everyone would agree, is a very good
communicator. He listens and understands. He remembers the subject
of a previous conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing is the variety of diplomatic initiatives _
that may or may not originate with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ``other thing'' department, Richardson has had a tough
tenure here. Respect for the United States, which is crippling the
organization by withholding its dues, is at an all-time low.
Americans are losing good positions within the organization, and
Washington may forfeit its General Assembly vote if it falls too
far behind in payments. Richardson's replacement, Richard
Holbrooke, has not yet been formally presented to the Senate by the
White House for confirmation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In this environment the administration, supersensitive to
political swings, has thrown proposals at the Security Council
without prior consultation and changed policies without warning,
most recently on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   John Weston, who retired this summer as Britain's
representative, pointed to a sudden announcement by Washington
early this year that the Security Council would be asked to set up
a Cambodian war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit silly to come out with this one fine day without
having thought through the idea,'' he said. ``This requires talking
in the corridors. Launching the idea cold is to court problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Weston also recalled the surprise of Richardson's trip to
Afghanistan in April, made at President Clinton's behest. It was a
critical moment for the United Nations in Afghanistan, the British
envoy said, and Richardson ``didn't tell anyone he was going.''
</P>
<P>
   For Europeans now trying to think as one within the European
Union, the Lone Ranger behavior of Washington is easier to
criticize. Europe's brightest diplomats are often steered into
careers in international organizations, and prime ambassadorial
assignments like the United Nations do not go to political
appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson says he understands and appreciates this after his
experiences here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States needs to better train its diplomats to
participate in multilateral fora,'' he said in diplomatese,
``because the multilateral fora for the challenges that lie ahead
for the United States are going to be very important: nuclear
proliferation, ethnic wars, international terrorism, the plight of
women, global climate change, refugees. It would make sense to give
American diplomats tours _ almost a requirement _ to serve in a
multilateral framework to learn the give and take of multilateral
diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he has enjoyed everything about U.N. life,
including nonstop dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.N. diplomats and U.N. Secretariat people are quality people,
good people,'' he said. ``This perception that the U.N. has a lot
of deadbeats is totally false. I've met some of the more talented,
intelligent and interesting people here.
</P>
<P>
   ``To achieve our objectives, you have to engage in the social
life of the U.N. That's why I spent a lot of time in the Delegates'
Lounge. That's why I spent a lot of time at the cafeteria. That's
why I spent a lot of time giving parties and attending parties,
because you get business done there.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who often seemed to other diplomats to be impatient
with the pace of Security Council work, said he liked a lot of it.
``I love Security Council meetings,'' he said. ``Not the big formal
ones but the internal ones, which you don't see. I love the give
and take, the fact that there the traditional postures of diplomacy
are put aside and personality politics dominates, and skill at
finding solutions or evading solutions by knowing U.N. rules comes
across, and where a weak country with a strong ambassador can many
times play a broker role.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he found that certain personal relationships were
crucial: with secretary-general Kofi Annan; with Richard Butler,
chairman of the disarmament commission for Iraq; and with the other
envoys of the five permanent members of the Security Council:
Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found Kofi to be one of the most skillful political animals
in the world,'' Richardson said. ``His ability to maneuver is
incredibly good. He always makes you leave your meeting with him
thinking that you've made your point. That's a master skill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Butler is a very independent, very proud, passionate person
who has to trust you,'' he said of the chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, who is now caught in a political battle in Washington
over how tough a policy the United States should have on Iraq.
``That was one of my more satisfying relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I particularly enjoyed my relationship with Lavrov,'' he said
of Sergey Lavrov, the Russian representative. ``It was one that
bordered on friendship, serious friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been many unpublicized compromises worked out behind
the scenes with the help of Lavrov. ``He uses his enormous
knowledge of the U.N., combined with personal charisma and his
strength within the Russian bureaucracy, to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he also leaves with warm feelings for Alain
Dejammet of France, an impassioned critic of U.S. policy in Africa
and Iraq. ``Dejammet and I have sort of a special relationship,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Chinese, against whom he has made at least two tough
speeches on human rights, they will be giving the first and one of
the largest farewell dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite policy differences at the U.N., you have to maintain
strong personal relationships,'' he said. ``Otherwise you can't do
business.''

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Robert Towne still recalls his fascination with
movies as a boy in the coastal town of San Pedro, and his yearning
to write screenplays _ so he could correct all the wrong things he
saw on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, it seemed wrong that anytime anybody pulled
up at the Waldorf-Astoria there was always a place to park,'' said
Towne, one of the most influential screenwriters in Hollywood. ``It
seemed wrong that nobody in a restaurant ever got change when they
paid the waiter. When my dad took us to dinner, he always counted
out the change. And it seemed wrong that married people slept in
twin beds and when the women woke up, their lipstick and hair were
perfect. I knew that wasn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I made up my mind that when I wrote movies, it was going to
be real,'' added Towne, 62, sitting in his rambling
English-country-style home in Pacific Palisades. His newest film,
``Without Limits,'' which he also directed, opens on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a sense of reality stamps the best Towne screenplays _
``Chinatown,'' for which he won an Academy Award, as well as ``The
Last Detail'' and ``Shampoo,'' which he wrote with Warren Beatty.
Towne has also been a highly paid script doctor for years, on films
ranging from ``Bonnie and Clyde'' and ``The Godfather'' to
``Crimson Tide'' and ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   His career and personal life stumbled in the 1980s: He had a
``hideous'' and very public custody battle with his first wife, and
he endured a series of studio battles over his first directorial
effort, ``Personal Best,'' and his script for ``Greystoke.'' But
Towne, through good films and bad, remains a screenwriter known for
his dazzling craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The new film, ``Without Limits,'' about the charismatic and
tragic track star Steve Prefontaine, has, like several of Towne's
other projects over the last three decades, consumed him for years.
The film was written with Kenny Moore, one of Prefontaine's close
friends and a world-class runner as well as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   The film, released by Warner Bros., is the second to be made
about Prefontaine, whose competitive ferocity and free-spirited
independence ignited crowds and turned him into a sports legend
before he was killed in a car accident in 1975 at the age of 24.
His early death turned him into a cult figure, somewhat like James
Dean. A Disney film, ``Prefontaine,'' which opened last year,
failed at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   The Towne film stars Billy Crudup as Prefontaine and Donald
Sutherland as his coach, Bill Bowerman. Initially, Tom Cruise, a
friend of Towne, wanted to play Prefontaine, and they worked on the
film off and on for years until Cruise dropped the idea of starring
in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally last year he said, `I'm 35 years old, I've got a wife
and two kids _ nobody's going to believe I'm 17 or 18,''' Towne
recalled. ``I was in despair. But Tom saw to it that we got the
movie made.'' ( Cruise and his partner, Paula Wagner, are the
film's producers.)
</P>
<P>
   Towne, who was an athlete at Pomona College and whose film
``Personal Best'' dealt with female track stars training for the
Olympics, said he became interested in Prefontaine as long as 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I came to realize was that in an insanely material time
now, when athletes are getting $20 million a year and are more
concerned about that than their performances, here was a guy who
was enormously appealing, who had a pure love for the sport, who
just wanted to shave a few seconds off the distance record,'' Towne
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Steve was not a classical distance runner _ he was
relatively short, built like a fireplug, and was capable of
dramatizing his feelings to the crowd and the world in virtually
every step he ran. In a word, he was a spectacular showman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in men who were obsessed by their
work, whose identity is shaped by what they do and how well they do
it,'' Towne added. ``I suppose I am obsessed too.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his life and career have been a bit turbulent, he is one
of only a handful of screenwriters whose past work has given them
statesman status among other writers.
</P>
<P>
   After growing up in San Pedro, where his father sold women's
dresses, Towne and his family moved to Los Angeles in the early
1950s. In the '60s he began writing for Roger Corman, the B-picture
director who played a role in training Francis Ford Coppola, Martin
Scorsese and Jack Nicholson. This led to Towne's career as a film
doctor, which in turn resulted in his writing ``Chinatown'' and his
other classics.
</P>
<P>
   Towne said that the notion that screenwriting is somehow an easy
process, in which one readily finds a pot of gold, was laughable.
``People see it as sort of the California lotto; everybody thinks
they can cash in,'' he said. ``Part of it is the fact that people
think screenwriting is just dialogue _ I can talk, I can write
dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   But dialogue, he said, is in some ways ``the least important
part'' of the screenplay. ``What makes screenplays difficult,'' he
said, ``are the things that require the most discipline and care
and are just not seen by most people. I'm talking about movement _
screenwriting is related to math and music, and if you zig here,
you know you have to zag there. It's like the descriptions for a
piece of music _ you go fast or slow or with feeling. It's the
same.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Towne said he doubted that ``Chinatown'' or
``The Last Detail'' or for that matter Scorsese's ``Taxi Driver''
would be made today by Hollywood studios. A portion of the blame
for this, he said, lies with the 1975 film ``Jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a superb film, but it made an irrevocable change in the
way movies were marketed,'' he said. The instant success of
``Jaws,'' he said, led studios to demand that films open big on
their first weekend, and this, in turn, led to the increased demand
for movie stars to sell the films. ``Everything is pinned to the
first throw of the dice, and if it doesn't go on that opening
weekend, it's gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An additional issue for writers now, he said, was that in the
1960s and '70s, screenwriters like him would write a movie and then
present it to a director or a star. To a degree, a screenwriter
like Towne had some control over the process. Nowadays, he said,
the situation is almost reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the packaging of films comes from the director and
star,'' he said. ``The screenplay is fitted to the elements, and
this runs the real risk of being more disjointed and less of a
piece than it was when someone had a clear idea of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Towne, whose other writing credits, either alone or with
partners, include ``Tequila Sunrise'' (which he also directed),
``Days of Thunder,'' ``The Two Jakes,'' ``The Firm'' and ``Mission
Impossible,'' had something of a personal meltdown in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   His first directorial effort, ``Personal Best,'' led to a bitter
conflict with the producer, David Geffen. He then worked for years
on the script that became ``Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord
of the Apes,'' but it was taken away from him. Then the prolonged
custody battle took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Towne has been married for 13 years to a former restaurateur,
Luisa Towne. (She was the basis for the Michelle Pfeiffer character
in ``Tequila Sunrise.'') They have a 7-year-old daughter, Chiara.
He also has a daughter from his first marriage, Katharine Towne,
19, who is an aspiring actress.
</P>
<P>
   Towne said he was now completing an untitled screenplay for
Cruise: ``an old-fashioned tale of love, revenge and high
adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Assessing his career, Towne said the most successful films were
those intertwined with the mood of the nation. Such dark films as
``Chinatown'' and ``Taxi Driver'' would probably meet studio
resistance now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the 1960s and '70s, there was a common assumption that
something was wrong in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate and
assassinations and riots _ and films like `Taxi Driver' and `The
Godfather' and `Chinatown' spoke to that,'' he said. ``But by the
'80s the feeling was that one almost felt impotent in the face of
what was wrong, and this gave rise to `Rambo' and Stallone and
Schwarzenegger, superheroes who were invulnerable, who wanted to
get the bad guys, because we couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, there seems to be a reaction to those 1980s films,
and heroes are becoming more human and less like supermen. ``Heroes
can partially succeed now and fail nobly and in some cases die,''
he said. ``Stories can unfold on a more human scale, and that's a
positive sign, isn't it?''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's Parliament again spurned President Boris
Yeltsin's choice for prime minister, as last-minute negotiations
between the Kremlin and a defiant Communist opposition broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin responded to the defeat by signaling that he planned to
renominate Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister, demanding a third
and final showdown over the appointment. That set the stage for
another debilitating round of political wrangling, as the economy
continued to reel out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Following mounting criticism of his role in managing Russia's
financial crisis, the beleaguered head of the Central Bank, Sergei
Dubinin, resigned Monday. Dubinin left behind a blistering letter
assailing the government for failing to collect taxes and maintain
financial discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the ruble, meanwhile, continued to fall, plummeting
at one point to 50 rubles to a dollar at the nation's currency
exchange before trading was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Moscow, many stores were picked clean by
shoppers who raided the capital's merchants as imports dried up.
Toothpaste, butter, toilet paper and soap powder have become hard
to find. Lines at gas stations grew as motorists raced to beat
price increases of as much as 40 per cent.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the nation was experiencing shortages and
skyrocketing prices, as well. In Omsk, Siberia, the price of
kielbasa, the spicy sausage that is a Russian staple, has doubled
since the crisis began two weeks ago. In Novgorod, 300 miles
northwest of Moscow, the cost of medicine soared. Some regional
governors are even attempting to institute price controls.
</P>
<P>
   As the panic grew, Chernomyrdin warned the Parliament Monday
that the nation was not merely approaching the danger zone. ``We
are already crossing it,'' he said. ``Russia has never been through
a crisis like this.''
</P>
<P>
   His appeal fell far short. Chernomyrdin needed 226 votes to win
approval. The vote was 278-138 against his nomination. Not even
Yeltsin's offer to install Chernomyrdin on a kind of six-month
probationary basis softened the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the opposition influenced by an offer from Boris
Fyodorov, the Kremlin's top economic strategist. Since the
Communists have been demanding that the government crank up the
presses to print rubles, he announced that the presses would be
turned on _ but not until Chernomyrdin was confirmed by the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition to Chernomyrdin, who has already served a
term as prime minister, came from the Communists, who dominate the
legislature along with their left-wing allies.
</P>
<P>
   Casting the crisis as a chance to take back power from the
executive branch, the Communists have demanded that Yeltsin agree
to share power and that Chernomyrdin's nomination be scratched.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Yabloko party, led by Grigory Yavlinsky, has broken
completely with Yeltsin. Yavlinsky Monday incongruously proposed
Yevgeni Primakov, the hard-line Russian foreign minister, for prime
minister. Yavlinsky appears to see a Primakov government as an
opportunity to finally gain a place for his party in a ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, however, stuck to his guns. A third rejection of
Chernomyrdin's nomination would lead to the dissolution of the
legislature and new parliamentary elections within three months.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibiting his own brand of defiance, the ailing president
signed a decree renominating Chernomyrdin even before Monday's vote
was conducted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Anticipating parliamentary elections, Yeltsin's Justice Ministry
has issued a new ruling that would block the Communists, Yabloko
and other political parties from taking part in a vote this year.
Individual candidates would be able to run on their own, but the
ruling would handicap the Communists' campaign efforts.
</P>
<P>
   As the infighting continued, Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist
leader, said Monday night that he planned to resume talks with
Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With its leaders preoccupied with political intrigue and with no
new government in place to deal with the collapsing economy, Russia
these days is like a storm-tossed boat whose captain and crew are
below deck and whose engine has just quit.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's parliamentary debate was punctuated with bitter
recriminations. A glum Chernomyrdin warned that a nuclear-armed
Russia would be engulfed in Indonesian-style riots if the crisis
continued to escalate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to your memory?'' he asked the Communists.
``Were shop counters full at the beginning of the 1990s? It took us
six years to land on our feet and now you want to throw it all
away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia reached the point where the country went up in
flames,'' Chernomyrdin added. ``Is this what you want?''
</P>
<P>
   The Communists and their left-wing allies were not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Yelena Panina, a deputy from the Power to the People Party, a
pro-Communist party, blamed Chernomyrdin for leading the nation
into the financial crisis during his first five-year term as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``When King Louis XIV wanted to know what people thought about
him, he disguised himself as a commoner and walked the streets of
Paris,'' she said. ``I suggest you try this and find out what
people say about you and your reforms in Moscow. But you better
disguise yourself really well. You'll be in trouble if they
recognize you.''
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling produced some bizarre role reversals.
</P>
<P>
   After the liberal Yavlinsky endorsed Primakov for prime
minister, the nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky delivered a tirade
against the Russian foreign minister, who has made his mark as a
bitter foe of NATO expansion and an opponent of American dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky charged that Primakov had encouraged the Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan in an earlier era. And he complained
that Yavlinsky has cut a cynical deal to support Primakov in return
for his appointment as top Kremlin aide in charge of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   There were few voices of moderation. As the acid debate
esclated, however, Galina Starovoytova, a liberal deputy, finally
burst in. She laid the blame for Russia's economic travails at the
feet of the Communists, who have repeatedly sought to frustrate the
government's market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would like to bring us back to the pre-Perestroika time,''
she said, referring to the reforms ushered in by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev. ``Congratulations. You managed to do it. Look at
the empty shop counters. It's the result of your activities. ``

IN SEARCH OF YOUNG VIEWERS, AND THE ADVERTISERS WHO LOVE THEM
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 BY LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One upstart network has made its name by appealing to teen-agers
with shows like ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' starring a sexy high
school misfit with supernatural powers, and ``Dawson's Creek,''
where teen-agers talk bluntly about masturbation and impotence and
one boy loses his virginity to his over-30 English teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The other is best known for ``Star Trek: Voyager,'' ``Love Boat:
The Next Wave'' and a declared mission to appeal to as broad a
swath of Middle America _ in age, geography and household income _
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Which is more likely to succeed?
</P>
<P>
   Logic might point to UPN, the one with the broader focus. But
the smart money's on the one with the teen-age target.
</P>
<P>
   The WB network, home of the sultry Buffy, the angst-filled
Dawson and the five rambunctious siblings of ``Seventh Heaven,''
was the only broadcast television network to show audience growth
last season. And it grew by about 20 percent, even as the general
defection of viewers to cable networks accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, my father told me, `Find a need and fill
it,''' Jamie Kellner, the president of WB, said in an interview.
``We saw other networks' shares were declining, at a fairly sharp
drop, among households with nonadults. And we saw a place to build
our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Build they did. WB has focused relentlessly on attracting people
ages 12 to 34. Though that audience may seem narrow, it is also
elusive, even fickle. Scores of shows will reach older viewers, but
relatively few can be counted upon to draw the under-30 crowd, so
advertisers will overpay to reach it. Advance bookings of
advertising time on WB for the fall season are double what they
were last year; more than two-thirds of that revenue, Kellner said,
came from advertisers seeking the 12-to-34-year-old audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another good thing about our audience is it replenishes
itself,'' Kellner said. ``Kids move into teens, teens move into
18-to-34s. We're focused on 12-to-34s, but with a big spillover
both up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   But detractors accuse WB of behaving like a cable network,
trolling for adolescents the way Nickelodeon does for children, and
in the process helping to fragment American families by inducing
children to watch different shows from their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly are not a teeny-bopper network, as some people
try to paint us,'' Kellner said. ``We are a family network. Our
definition of family is households with adults and nonadults
watching television, hopefully together. It doesn't mean G-rated
shows; a 14-year-old girl and her mom can have a great time
watching `Buffy' together, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he never lets his staff lose sight of their main target.
For example, a comedy being produced for midseason, ``Zoe Bean,''
is already being called ```Seinfeld' for teens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew `Seinfeld' was one of the top-rated shows with teens,
and we tried to analyze why,'' said Susanne Daniels, WB's executive
vice president for programming. ``The pacing, the kinds of stories,
not too emotional storytelling, very physical. Nobody's ever
worried about their finances; it's all fun. We thought we could
take that format and use younger characters. We decided to set it
in New York because New York's one of the few places where
teen-agers can get around and do things on their own without
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a show about the misadventures of fraternal twins,
a boy and a girl, and their best friends, also a boy and girl.
``Because they're teen-agers, it's a lttle less cynical than, say,
George Costanza is,'' she said, referring to the ``Seinfeld''
character. ``It has some of that cynicism, but not at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   For another new show, Ms. Daniels said, ``We asked Joe
Dougherty, `Can you write the kind of male relationships you wrote
on ``thirtysomething'' a little bit younger for us.''' The result
is ``Hyperion Bay,'' a show on the fall schedule about a small town
and two brothers, one who never left and one who has returned home
as a successful entrepreneur to try to revive the town's business
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Pop music plays a big role, both in the shows and in promoting
them. WB bought the rights to use Madonna's most recent single,
``Power of Goodbye,'' released on Aug. 25, in movie trailers and
television promotional spots for ``Felicity,'' a much-hyped new
show for fall about a vulnerable and beautiful college freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Many people dispute Kellner's contention that WB is a family
network and that adults will watch these adolescent shows with
their children the way they watched ``Ozzie and Harriet'' or,
later, ``The Cosby Show.'' But industry experts say most American
television households are fragmenting anyway, like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no longer a family television audience,'' said Gene
DeWitt, president of DeWitt Media, a major commercial-buying firm.
``Most homes have multiple sets, and most people watch their own
programs. The WB strategy is simply a recognition of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Valentine, the new president of the struggling UPN,
disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you extend the logic'' of narrowcasting to specific
audiences, Valentine said, ``you'll have 18-year-olds watching the
18-year-old network, 21-year-olds watching the 21-year-old network,
26-year-olds watching the 26-year-old network.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I also believe passionately in the role network television
plays in society. It has had a deep and important role in uniting a
country that doesn't have many things left uniting it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said broadcast networks could succeed with shows for a
broad age range and for childless adults as well as those with
families. And he refers not just to ``water-cooler'' hits _ shows
the whole country seems to talk about, like ``ER,'' ``Seinfeld''
or, in years gone by, ``Dallas'' or ``Cheers'' _ but also to
moderately popular shows like ``Touched by an Angel,'' ``Spin
City'' and ``3rd Rock from the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said UPN could succeed with ``shows that appeal to
adult, middle-class America, not just people in their 20s or 30s
who live in L.A. or Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   But many television experts say that in today's multi-channel
world, a new broadcast network has to forge a distinctive identity
to get the public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dean would be on a whole lot safer ground saying that if he
were running NBC,'' said Sandy Grushow, a former president of
entertainment for the Fox network and now president of a major
production studio, 20th Century Fox Television. ``The best way, if
not the only way, for a new upstart network to get into the game is
by targeting an underserved segment of the audience with an
alternative programming voice or point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Both UPN and WB started up in January 1995, with two nights a
week of network programs. Their affiliated stations filled the
other nights with syndicated shows, movies, sports and reruns. This
fall each will have five nights of network programs.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner and his two top programming executives, Garth Ancier and
Ms. Daniels, say they are using _ to a point _ a template they
learned at Fox, where they all worked until Kellner left to lead
the new WB. At Fox, the plan was to start by attracting young
viewers with a brash, slightly vulgar, clearly different tone and
later to broaden the reach.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Rupert Murdoch, president of News Corp., Fox's
parent company, Ms. Daniels recalled: ``Eventually Rupert actually
said: `We don't want be the fourth network any more. We want to
broaden our audience and take on NBC and ABC now.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Garth and Jamie have said the opposite: they want to keep this
network young. They're very happy with our median age being 25, and
they'd like to keep it 25, and they're sure we can can build a
successful network that way.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kellner and the other experts like Grushow are right, then
UPN is in a difficult position because there is no audience segment
left untargeted or underserved. Valentine and his colleagues almost
have no choice but to try a broad range of shows and hope that some
catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really all about putting on a hit show, not about
narrowcasting for buyers of commercials,'' Valentine said. ``People
want compelling stories.''
</P>
<P>
   But advertisers know that older people and middle-aged middle
Americans are already watching television in large numbers. The
people advertisers find hard to reach are the younger ones, those
who don't want to watch the same thing their parents watched and
who are quick to change to a cable channel, pop in a video or click
on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know who those advertisers are, and it helps us
tremendously on the program side, too,'' Kellner said. ``We know
this show isn't for us or this show is for us. Our casts should be
in this age range, not that age range. We don't do shows with Ted
Danson, we do them with Joshua Jackson or Sarah Michelle Gellar.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellner says the WB's target audience of 12-to-34-year-olds
constitutes more than 100 million people, ``a huge target,'' as he
put it.
</P>
<P>
   He noted with pleasure that many WB-affiliated stations had
bought the reruns of NBC's hit sitcom ``Friends'' and would use it
as early-evening fare, leading into WB's prime-time lineup. ``It'll
be like a rocket ship in terms of delivering more young adults and
teens and kids into our schedule,'' Kellner said.

   SHAREHOLDER-WORKERS (Menlo Park, Calif.) _ More than in almost
any other industry, stock options have fueled the boom in Silicon
Valley and in other regions of the country where high-tech and
Internet companies are congregated, allowing start-up companies to
pay smart, ambitious workers a relatively low base salary _ along
with the promise of great riches if their sweat and creativity help
the ventures to take off. Along the way, that phenomenon seems to
have sparked a unique brand of investment psychology that can be
gleaned from talks with employees like those at Onsale, each of

volatility that might be unimaginable to a more traditional

FRESHMEN ENROLLMENTS SURGE AT STATE UNIVERSITIES

<P>
   So many more freshmen than had originally been expected showed
up at the University of Maryland at College Park last month that
dozens were sent to spend the semester at the local Quality Inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have it better than the other freshmen,'' said
Carrie Smith, 17, settling herself on a Sesame Street blanket.
``They don't have air-conditioning or cable.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Delaware in Newark, some of the overflow
was happily camped in luxury apartments normally reserved for
university guests. At the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, Antony Zoeteman, 18, spent his first two weeks in
a dormitory study lounge with three other students, bunk beds and
several sofas.
</P>
<P>
   Large state universities across the United States are seeing
freshman enrollments surge this fall, forcing officials to scramble
to find beds, instructors, chairs and classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges usually offer admission to more applicants than they
expect to attend, to insure that dormitories and classroom seats
are full. But this year, several public institutions were caught by
surprise at the number that said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say students are opting for public institutions
because the big state universities are doing a better job of
marketing their strong points, because parents are worried about
the economy and want good value for money, and because some of the
more expensive private institutions have reached the limit in the
financial aid they can offer as their overall costs go up.
</P>
<P>
   Fall enrollment figures are still incomplete for many
universities, some of which will not start classes until late this
month, but one of the largest overflows so far occurred at the
College Station campus of Texas A&AMP;M University, where a freshman
class of 7,400 arrived last week _ 1,200 more students than
expected earlier this year when offers of admissions were sent out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I was told the estimate for the freshman class, it
kept getting bigger,'' said Ronald Douglas, executive vice
president and provost at Texas A&AMP;M, which has 34,000 undergraduates
at its College Station campus, one of seven.
</P>
<P>
   Huge freshman classes, with 200 to 500 more than anticipated,
have also arrived at the University of California at Berkeley,
Rutgers University, the University of Arizona, Oregon State
University and Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to tell who will be the enrollment losers _ if
anyone _ as large public schools get more crowded.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Delaware enrolled 270 more freshman than it
anticipated this fall. Larry Griffith, director of admissions, said
that the university had ``for a long time been a quietly excellent
place academically,'' but recently had been raising more money for
new buildings and had begun marketing itself more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the next group of `Public Ivies' is emerging and
that our experience at the University of Delaware is true of the
best public universities,'' Griffith said, ``which show well under
the increased scrutiny by parents, students and the ratings
guides.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers University had an overflow of 470 freshmen on its
campuses this fall. ``I believe more people are discovering us,''
said Diane Harris, associate director of undergraduate admissions.
For a total cost of $10,000 a year, she said, a New Jersey resident
``can get an excellent education at a research university. You get
a very good value. I don't know why they don't all come to the
university.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Saracino, assistant provost for enrollment at the
University of Notre Dame and a past president of the National
Association for College Admissions Counseling, agreed that
first-rate state universities ``are good buys. Kids can apply to
the privates, and if the financial aid isn't what they want, they
can rely on fine public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Private schools that have always counted on financial aid to
level the playing field may not be able to continue to pour the
money in,'' Saracino added, pointing to what he says is the growing
gap between college costs and what students and their families
actually pay. ``The discount rates have gotten way too high, 30 to
40 percent, and there has been a leveling off in many cases. It's
kind of a poker game in admissions offices across the country. Some
are saying `the pot is too rich for me, and I'm going to fold.
Enough is enough.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some private colleges and universities also report
significant increases in the percentage of freshmen who accepted
offers of admission this year. Alfred University in Alfred, N.Y.,
had an overflow of 50 freshman, part of the largest freshman class
in 25 years, and had to rent a dormitory from Alfred State College
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University also reported the highest percentage of
freshmen accepting offers of admission in 20 years: 80 percent.
Alex Huppe, director of the office of Public Affairs at Harvard,
said Harvard was able to hold its incoming freshman class to 1,650,
``right on target,'' because it keeps a waiting list. ``We are
often able to eliminate 50 to 100 people from the waiting list,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Public and private institutions alike may also be seeing the
first signs of a surge in the number of high school graduates,
which started to grow in 1995 after a long decline and is expected
to peak in 2008 at 2.9 million, above the all-time high of 2.8
million in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a baby boomlet that is just now starting to hit
higher education,'' said Robin Zuniga, a research associate at the
Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, a nonprofit
inter-government agency in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning of it, and it's a tidal wave,'' Ms.
Zuniga said. ``If the schools were surprised, they shouldn't be.
And if they're feeling pressure now, they're going to be feeling a
lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   One sign of that pressure, admissions officers at both private
and public institutions said, was the decline this year of what
they call the ``summer melt rate,'' the number of students who
accept an offer of college admission in the spring, and then write
or to say they have changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We typically lose 10 percent of our original enrollments
between May 1 and the beginning of classes in September as students
are taken off waiting lists at other colleges, change plans or
defer enrollment for a year,'' said Kent Jones, dean of enrollment
and college relations at Skidmore College, in Saratoga Springs,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, our summer attrition is 6 percent of our original
deposits _ unprecedented in our experience,'' Jones said. ``As a
result, we will open with a first year class of 597, which is 22
over our target of 575.''
</P>
<P>
   College admission is an inexact process, as university officials
readily acknowledge. When the percentage of candidates accepting
admission changes without warning, the results are significant at a
large university. This year's increase of 2 percent at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign resulted in a freshman
class of 6,464, the largest in the university's history and nearly
397 more than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, the university added to its teaching staff. The
English department, which this semester has 3,000 freshmen in class
sections limited to 22 students, exhausted its supply of teaching
assistants from its own graduate students and other departments and
turned to former graduate students, faculty spouses and writers
living in the community. Dennis Baron, the department head, said
the last teaching assistant was hired the day after classes began.
</P>
<P>
   Similar freshman enrollment shocks hit the University of
Wisconsin, the University of Washington and the University of
Michigan last fall. Each took steps this year to get the numbers
down, becoming more selective and making fewer offers of
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some students who are now sophomores have to go back and take
some required courses where there wasn't room for them last year as
freshmen,'' said Julie Peterson, a spokeswoman for the University
of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania State University has been trying to reduce the size
of its freshmen classes since 1995, when it was caught by surprise
by 760 extra freshmen at its main campus, an event that forced the
university to appeal for rooms in private homes.
</P>
<P>
   This year Penn State accepted 1,000 fewer freshmen, said John
Romano, vice provost for enrollment management and administration,
but more freshmen decided to enroll, so this year's class of 5,100
at University Park is just as big as in earlier year.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment at the University Park campus has grown to a record
high of 41,000 from 37,000 in 1995. The university has added 100
faculty members since then.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Delaware, which has 15,000 undergraduates,
Griffith said he did not see the boom coming. When applications
arrived, he said, ``we got the 15,000 we typically get,'' and after
making offers of admissions, expected a class of 3,350. ``For the
first time, we made the class before May 1, and I thought `Great!'
and then the deposits kept rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at each other and said, `It'll be OK, well, maybe a
little high,' and when the smoke cleared on May 10, we were just
below 3,800,'' Griffith said. ``I went on vacation and prayed for a
hot summer. We did have a nice melt, and we ended up at 3,620.''

ATLANTA RALLY AVOIDS CONFRONTATION, RHETORIC THAT PLAGUED HARLEM
EVENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two days after a rally in Harlem ended in a brief
skirmish with the police, black youths in Atlanta staged a sparsely
attended but far less tense gathering Monday on the street where
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born and is now entombed.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people came together on Auburn Avenue for a
daylong call to empowerment that was organized as the Million Youth
Movement and was supported by civil rights groups like the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Rainbow
Coalition/Operation PUSH, the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and the Nation of Islam. They heard speakers like the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, Kweisi Mfume, the NAACP president, and Martin
Luther King III, the president of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, denounce the social and political conditions afflicting
black youths while urging them to revive the marches and protests
that King led from his base here more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the Atlanta event, organizers had
taken pains to distinguish themselves from the so-called Million
Youth March in New York City, a rally that was led on Saturday by
Khallid Abdul Muhammad, a divisive figure among blacks because of
his history of anti-white and anti-Semitic speech.
</P>
<P>
   NAACP officials, for instance, pointed out that the Atlanta
organizers had rejected Muhammad's proposal to unify the two events
because of concerns about his exclusionary black nationalist
rhetoric. When they refused to join with Muhammad, he moved the
date of his rally to conflict with the Atlanta event and also
claimed the name Million Youth March, which the Atlanta organizers
had chosen for their event, said Jamal Bryant, director of the
youth and college division of the NAACP. The Atlanta organizers
then selected the name Million Youth Movement.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Jackson sought to play down
Muhammad's role in New York by saying that the two events had the
common thread of ``shared pain'' and that the media were making too
much of ``who the enumerators are.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Monday, many of the black leaders attending the
Atlanta event continued to deride Muhammad's approach. But they
also said that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the New York Police
Department had committed an egregious mistake when officers stormed
the stage in Harlem at the end of the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said on Sunday that the police had been provoked by
Muhammad's call for the crowd of 6,000 to ``riot and murder.'' One
civilian and about 15 police officers were hurt, none seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Giuliani did,'' Jackson said, ``was the most horrendous
thing I have seen since Mayor Daley in Chicago unleashed the police
on marchers in 1968. Giuliani seems to think he can gain
politically from these polarizing tactics. It's almost a
performance. He's really playing on people's fears in a volatile
and immature fashion.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, the former president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, joined several black leaders in
saying that the city's actions had only given Muhammad a more
visible platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I abhor his remarks, but his remarks would fall on deaf ears
if Giuliani didn't magnify them,'' Lowery said. ``Giuliani gave him
a bullhorn. The movement has always had to have a Bull Connor, and
Giuliani may become the Bull Connor of the new millennium.'' Eugene
Connor was the Birmingham police commissioner who ordered his
officers to use dogs and water hoses to attack peaceful black
protesters in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he was ``disappointed'' in Muhammad's
``anti-rhetoric,'' Mfume said ``there was a clear overreaction on
the part of the police department.'' And the Rev. Al Sharpton, who
spoke in Harlem as well as at the Atlanta rally, said it was now
important ``to keep the youth focused on the beauty of what they
did and not let Giuliani get them off their agenda.'' He added:
``It was not a hate march.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Atlanta rally, it was misnamed. Not only were there
not a million youths in attendance, there were barely 1,000 in the
area over the course of the sweltering Labor Day holiday. No more
than a few hundred gathered at any one time in front of the stage,
which was erected adjacent to Dr. King's Ebenezer Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond a call for voter registration, there was no clear agenda
for the Atlanta rally. Speakers addressed a hodgepodge of issues
ranging from the disproportionate impact of AIDS and infant
mortality on blacks to the values associated with rap and designer
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``From this day forward we're not going to let people prostitute
our community by bringing in Tommy Hilfiger and Donna Karan and
Ralph Lauren,'' said Bryant, in one of the day's most energetic
speeches. ``We're going to support black businesses that do
something for us. Today is the last day that we're going to allow
politicians to come into our communities to kiss our black babies
but not give us prenatal care and after-school programs and
scholarships to go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the civil rights veterans who spoke emphasized the need
for a new generation to step to the fore. ``It's your time now,''
Mfume said, ``your time to make a difference, your time to take
control, your time to lead.''

SOUTH KOREA'S SMALL BUSINESSES ARE DOWN BUT NOT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also ASIA-PROTECT)  
(js) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Last Dec. 2, as South Korea haggled with
the International Monetary Fund over the terms of a plan to save it
from default, Chang Jin Wook was also pleading with his lenders,
begging them not to push the company founded by his grandfather
into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   That night, South Korea won a $58 billion bailout, but Chang was
not so lucky. His bankers offered only 800 million won _ then about
$665 million _ forcing him to default on earlier loans that had
come due.
</P>
<P>
   Under South Korean law, his company, a wiring products maker
called Chang On, was bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty days later, Chang's grandfather died. ``He was severely
distressed because the company would not be passing on to the next
generation,'' Chang said. ``My father, too, feels a great amount of
guilt over that. We are all ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the lot of the South Korean small businessman in the era
of IMF-mandated economic change. Scores of small businesses fail
daily, accounting for the vast majority of newly jobless workers,
while the giant conglomerates that dominate South Korea's economy
limp along, staving off changes that threaten their powerful,
well-entrenched leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, an average of 83 small or midsized companies go belly
up in South Korea, compared with 50 a day in the year preceding the
agreement, which was itself a difficult year for small business
here.
</P>
<P>
   Korean laws enable businesses to continue operating while they
arrange to settle with their creditors. But times are already tough
for entrepreneurs, and bankruptcy now often means a shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Credit has become virtually impossible to obtain as the banks
themselves fight for their lives. Orders are few and far between in
an economy that shrank 6.6. percent in the second quarter. And
exports have dried up as customers in other Asian countries are
similarly strapped.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many of the small companies that are the backbone
of a sound economy are dying, taking with them the livelihoods of
hundreds of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that nearly all of the million-plus people who have
lost their jobs since last December were employed by small
companies, not by the top 30 conglomerates, or chaebol.
</P>
<P>
   The growing disparity between the economic fortunes of the
conglomerates and the country's small businesses is one that
development experts say could ultimately undermine South Korea's
efforts to dig itself out of the financial crisis that engulfed it
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is vital that Korea create an environment where small
companies come into existence, grow and flourish because going
forward the large employers, the chaebol, will be net job
reducers,'' said James Rooney, head of Ssangyong Templeton
Investment Trust Management here.
</P>
<P>
   Although they receive the lion's share of public attention, the
conglomerates already employ less than 30 percent of the nation's
workers. And their work forces are likely to shrink further even as
they pick up the pieces of the current economic disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Pong Sul Ahn, international secretary at the Federation of
Korean Trade Unions, the largest labor organization, said: ``The
government, the IMF, the press, everyone has been focusing on
policies affecting workers at big companies because the trade
unions are very powerful at big companies and everyone is worried
about strikes. Small companies and their workers are having many
difficult problems, but they have no voice.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some signs of change. When Secretary of the Treasury
Robert Rubin was here in June, he met not only with labor leaders
and heads of the country's five biggest conglomerates but also with
Park Sang Hee, president of the Korea Federation of Small Business,
and other small-business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand and agree that we have to restructure the
financial system and the business system,'' Park said in an
interview. ``But even promising small companies are going bankrupt,
and that's a problem for Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Just look at Hangul, a Korean-language computer programming
company that is under court administration because it defaulted on
a $180,000 promissory note in May. Widely regarded as a textbook
example of business innovation and venture investing, it could not
find a bank that would give it a break _ which provided Microsoft
an opening to swoop in with a rescue bid.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, Microsoft's plans were scotched by local investors
who wanted to keep the company in Korean hands. But the software
giant's attempt made it clear that there are diamonds in the rough
among small businesses in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Much as it resented Japanese occupation in World War II, South
Korea relied heavily on the postwar Japanese model in structuring
its economy. For the last 30 years, the government has used its
sway to ensure that banks channeled money to a few favored
companies, regardless of whether business fundamentals indicated
that such favor was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of raising money through bond and stock sales like large
companies in the West, South Korea's titans relied on the country's
banks for financing, crowding out smaller enterprises _ with
notably disastrous results, in time, for the banks.
</P>
<P>
   That system of ``crony capitalism,'' which lies at the core of
several of the Asian nations' economic crises, has stunted the
development of entrepreneurial ventures, which find that without
political connections, their sources of capital are limited.
</P>
<P>
   There are no true venture capitalists in South Korea, and
government support for small and midsized businesses comes with a
spider's web of strings attached. As innocuous an offense as
bouncing a check can land a businessman in jail and render him
ineligible for government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened to Juang Uen Ean, who spent six months in
jail for bouncing a check. His small auto-parts factory is up and
running only 12 to 15 days a month, compared with 20 before the
onset of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Juang's factory had nearly $2.5 million in sales and
employed as many as 25 workers. Now, with domestic auto production
down 35 percent in the first seven months of the year, his sales
have decelerated to an average of around $30,000 a month and he has
let half his employees go. ``There just aren't any orders,'' he
said.

   With credit from banks virtually gone, Juang and others like him
are forced to rely even more heavily on ``curb lenders,''
individuals who charge borrowers 5 percent or more for loans of
just two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot go to the government, either, because of his jail
record. Small and Medium Industry Promotion Corp., a government
agency that provides financial assistance to smaller businesses,
does not lend to anyone with a prison record or whose business has
gone bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankruptcy is implicitly a sign of a lack of competitiveness
and an unfortunate part of restructuring the economy,'' said Lee
Dong Kon, general manager of the agency's international cooperation
department. ``Businesses must come to us before they go bankrupt,
when they are still competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   But in South Korea, where a business can go bankrupt for being
as little as two days late in paying off a promissory note, many
small companies lack the time to go through the agency's formal
application process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Channels of communication between small businesses and the
government are almost nonexistent,'' said Kim Min Soo, whose
15-year-old company, which put 60 people to work making automated
systems for car companies, went bankrupt in February _ while still
operating at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kim's problems began last year with an order from the
Indonesian government for several automated production systems, an
order she said the South Korean Trade Ministry urged her to pursue.
But by the time the systems were manufactured and ready for
shipment, the companies seeking to import them could no longer
obtain letters of credit to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   To pay her creditors and employees, Mrs. Kim sought to withdraw
cash from her savings account with a balance equivalent to tens of
thousands of dollars. The bank refused, insisting that the money
was needed for collateral on a promissory note.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have since closed the bank, and Mrs. Kim's savings
account is in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   She is seeking to start another business, but getting credit is
impossible and finding investors, not much easier. ``The head of a
company that's gone bankrupt is stigmatized,'' she said. ``I've had
18 years' experience manufacturing and selling my products in
Korea. My company was turning a profit when it was forced to close,
but that doesn't help me at all. It counts for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for his creditors, Chang of Chang On would have found
himself in the same position. His grandfather's company, founded in
1951, had for years supplied construction companies' subsidiaries.
When the real estate market boomed in the early 1990s, however, the
conglomerates began to muscle in on Chang On's business. Big
business groups like LG and Anam &UR;  &LR; set up their own subsidiaries to
make the same kinds of electrical wiring products.
</P>
<P>
   Chang On sold its production plants near Seoul and moved farther
into the countryside, but its problems intensified. ``The biggest
cause of our problems was increased competition and the
consequential decrease in sales,'' Chang said. ``But it also stems
in large part from the collusive ties between big business and the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang On, however, got lucky. Its creditors banded together and
came up with an informal plan of reorganization for the company.
Twenty-two of Chang On's 140 employees agreed to continue working,
trusting the company to pay them when it could _ and in June, they
received their back pay, bonuses and other accrued benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an easy decision for anyone involved, according to
Hong Song Hi, whose company supplies Chang On with circuit breakers
and was owed $600,000 or so when its customer went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered suicide several times,'' Hong said, adding, ``In
Korea, small companies like mine can't get bank loans without
collateral, so my family, which had backed me with collateral,
stood to lose everything. I was going to deliver an awful lot of
pain to the people I love.''
</P>
<P>
   So he and some of Chang On's other creditors agreed to freeze
their claims until the wiring products maker could pay them in
stages. ``We have to help each other,'' Hong said, ``because
there's no one else to help us.''

   Besides ushering in the 35th anniversary season of Hartford
Stage on Thursday with a production of Tennessee Williams' Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``Streetcar Named Desire,'' Michael Wilson, the new
artistic director of the theater in Hartford, Conn., is planning
the Tennessee Williams Marathon. It is a multiyear retrospective of
Williams' 70 plays, 39 of them full length. Wilson plans to produce
at least one of the full-length plays each year, along with a
series of readings, symposiums and master classes. Among the stars
scheduled to take part in associated events this year, he said, are
Elizabeth Ashley on Saturday, Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson (Sept.
20), Ellen Burstyn and Polly Holliday (Sept. 21), Mary Beth Hurt
(Sept. 28), Kim Hunter (Oct. 4) and Harvey Fierstein (Oct. 5).

   In 1954, when Stephen Sondheim was 24, he was about to make his
professional debut on Broadway as the composer and lyricist of
``Saturday Night.'' With a book by Julius J. Epstein, the musical
related the adventures of a group of youngsters growing up in
Brooklyn in 1929 in the halcyon pre-Depression days of Coney
Island, the Brooklyn Dodgers and Sunday picnics in Prospect Park.
But the producer died, and the project was halted. Five years
later, a second attempt was made. This time, Sondheim called a
halt. But not so long ago, students of the University of Birmingham
presented excerpts from ``Saturday Night'' in a concert version at
the Bridewell Theater in London. During a question-and-answer
period afterward, a member of the audience asked if Sondheim would
allow the Bridewell to mount a full production. He agreed, and the
show opened last December. Now RCA Victor will release the London
cast recording. The compact disk goes on sale next Tuesday.

FOR THE UNFLAPPABLE OF SILICON VALLEY, STOCK OPTIONS MAY LEAD TO
RICHES

<P>
   MENLO PARK, Calif._ With all due respect to Main Street
investors who grew a bit faint when the Dow Jones average plunged
6.4 percent in a day last week, the young workers riding their
stock options on Silicon Valley's roller coaster have a message:
really, that's nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Onsale, Inc., an online auction house where, like many
ventures in the Internet field, virtually every employee has a
package of stock options that may (or may not) be a big part of
their net worth some day, wild swings in the company's stock price
go with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the year-and-a-half since the company went public, the
stock has been as low as $4 5/8 a share and as high as $36 13/16,
with plenty of dips and rises along the way. In the past week
alone, it careened from a low of $13 7/8 to a high of $21, finally
closing at $16 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get used to it after awhile,'' said 30-year-old Jack
Herndon, the director of installed base marketing at Onsale, a
cyber auction house that sells an eclectic array of goods, from
computer equipment to rattlesnake meat to a human-shaped inflatable
rubber device used for boxing practice known as the Slam Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here from a company that went from an all-time high to
an all-time low in a matter of months,'' Herndon said with a shrug.
``One day it went from 42 to 24 overnight, then down to 11. I
watched in 36 hours a significant amount of money not yet in my
wallet burn before my eyes. It happens.''
</P>
<P>
   More than in almost any other industry, stock options have
fueled the boom in Silicon Valley and in other regions of the
country where high-technology and Internet businesses are
congregated, allowing start-up companies to pay smart, ambitious
workers a relatively low salary _ along with the promise of great
riches if their sweat and creativity help these ventures succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, that phenomenon seems to have sparked a unique
brand of investment psychology that can be gleaned from talks with
employees like those at Onsale, each of whom describes his or her
own method of coping with the kind of volatility that might turn
the stomachs of the most hardened investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, OK, I do check the price at least once a day, just
to see where it is,'' said 29-year-old Debbie Rodriguez, a customer
service supervisor. ``But I don't calculate what it's all worth
when it goes down. I calculate it for its potential, what I think
it's really worth because I know how hard everybody at this company
is working, and that helps.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Stefanie Elkins, a manager of investor relations, also
29, ``The swings are all a part of the gamble, the whole Silicon
Valley mentality. I think there's a whole, almost pioneer attitude,
especially with Internet companies _ it's, `Let's try this, let's
see if we can get it to work, let's see if we can get it to a point
where the stock options are really worth something.' There's a
thrill in trying. If it doesn't work, you move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Petrossian, a vice president for engineering at Onsale,
said short-term swings in the stock market are not the best way to
measure the true value of a company in a fast-changing field such
as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being human, I do watch the stock price,'' said Petrossian.
``It's a way to see how other people value your work externally.
But I'm at this company for the long-term, and I have my own way of
valuing the stock. And from day one, in terms of the fundamentals,
nothing has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Many employees insisted that stock options were not the main
attraction that drew them to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roller coaster is fun and it's interesting, but it's
really not the reason I'm here,'' said John Dean, a 39-year-old
vice president in charge of a newly launched division offering
travel products, including bidding for weekly time-shares in a
Mexican beach condominium. Auctions at Onsale are carried on just
like more traditional ones, where bidders raise their hands. In
this case, though, bidders click on an icon to bid, or leave secret
instructions on how high they are willing to bid.)
</P>
<P>
   For Dean, the real thrill comes when he can watch a last-minute
bidding war erupt during Onsale's ``Going... going... gone''
feature, a fast-paced affair that means fast profits for the
company. ``When those bids go up,'' he said, ``It's exciting. It's
better than watching the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock options, which essentially represent an agreement by a
company to make shares available to an employee for a specified
price in the future, can yield great profits when the company's
stock soars, or be worth literally nothing if it plunges. While not
commonly offered across the work force in many industries, they are
virtually standard in places like Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet companies have grown up in an environment where
this idea is a part of the culture,'' said Matt Ward, chief
executive officer of WestWard Pay Strategies Inc., a San
Francisco-based firm that develops incentive compensation packages
for many Silicon Valley companies. ``I'm not sure you could even
get people to work in this field in a situation where you're not
giving them a piece of the action.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jerry Kaplan, a founder and chief executive officer of
Onsale: ``I like to say that Silicon Valley has perfected many of
the principles laid out by Karl Marx. In his terms, workers control
the means of production. In our terms, every employee is an owner
of the company.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Of course, low-level workers in the 200-employee company have
just a fraction of the share options of a founding executive like
Kaplan. Still, with even those employees generally having options
on at least a few thousand shares, the potential rewards for
everyone at the company are great, and many workers here say it
builds camaraderie that would not exist if everyone were on
straight salary.
</P>
<P>
   The fluctuations in stock price for Onsale are by no means
atypical, especially among Internet companies. But partly because
stock options take effect over a set period of time, typically four
years, worrying over today's price swings is a bit like worrying
about the weather. There's no point to jumping out of windows when
the stock plunges, or burning $1,000 bills when it soars _ what
really counts is what the stock will be worth the day an employee
decides to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, you don't hear employees talking a lot about changes
in the stock price, and you don't have a lot of people clicking the
refresh button on the browser all day to see what the latest trade
is,'' said Diane Hunt, a spokeswoman for Yahoo! Inc., the Santa
Clara, Calif.-based firm that markets a popular Internet search
engine.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Yahoo! stock has swayed from $17 1/16 a share
to $103 3/4. But, Ms. Hunt said: ``You don't focus on it. Everyone
here knows that if you run a good business, with sound
fundamentals, and you stick to your plan, the stock price will take
care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at Onsale, many people said outside shareholders seemed to
be more concerned about stock-price swings than those inside the
headquarters, a drab two-story building in an industrial stretch of
Menlo Park, where many workers are so busy with online projects
they lack time to even decorate their office wall.
</P>
<P>
   Anytime the stock drops, said Brian Fawkes, vice president for
corporate communications, ``I get dozens of calls from
shareholders, who want to know why is the stock going down and what
are you going to do to make it go up? But not once has an employee
come to me and asked why.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Fawkes and Kaplan say that such swings are common and that
the company and its workers remain focused on long-term growth.
Once in awhile, though, says the convivial Kaplan, author of
``Startup: A Silicon Valley Adventure,'' a book about a prior,
unsuccessful bid of his into pen-based computers, Onsale employees
cannot resist offering callers a more basic explanation for why the
stock price dropped: ``There were more sellers than buyers today.''
</P>
<P>
   Onsale is one of the main competitors in the burgeoning online
auction field, a sort of cyber bazaar in which visitors to the
company's Web site (onsale.com) are offered a chance to bid on
items (including, in a recent charity event, a date at Spago's in
Los Angeles with Ms. California) while online spectators
(``lurkers,'' in company lingo) watch the action. Many buyers type
in comments along with their bids. ``Stop bidding _ it's
refurbished!'' and ``Please, let me have it _ need to get this for
Grandma's birthday'' were two recent entries.
</P>
<P>
   While the company is both a pioneer and current leader in online
auctions, its product can hardly be patented, and how it will fare
in a competitive field where some experts expect annual sales to
climb to $1 billion remains unclear. But even that is part of the
appeal of working there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed to me like a lot of really exciting things were
happening with Internet companies,'' said Kristin Westland, 29, a
human resource manager, who came here two years ago after spending
several years as a struggling actress in Los Angeles (she did
manage to land a bit part in a ``Seinfeld'' episode).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very tired of LA, the insecurity of all that, the
multitude of jobs, never knowing if a break was going to happen,''
said Ms. Westland. So she gave it up for the insecurity and the
never-knowing if a break is going to happen of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Like many workers at the company, Ms. Westland has no children.
Even as she described the excitement of trying to help make Onsale
a dominant business in the auction field, she paused when asked
whether she would feel the same way if she had a family to support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids?'' she said. ``I don't know. Wow. You're really
mortgaging your future at that point. I don't know. Kids would make
it a whole new ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for now, Onsale's employees seem very happy to put in 12-
to 14-hour days for a lower salary than they might otherwise get _
as long as they retain the chance to strike it rich down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here, I was like, `Hey! Stock options!' ''
said Ms. Rodriguez, who came to Onsale from a job selling compact
discs and videos in a local store. ``This is new to me, this is a
first. I actually have stock options in something.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ Her mother died 30 years ago, but for
most of those years Rosario Ferre, one of Puerto Rico's leading
writers, found that event impossible to deal with in her work. It
was only when she began to write in English, Ms. Ferre says, that
she felt distant enough to explore in her fiction a subject that
had been taboo in her native Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   With English she discovered ``a psychological distance,'' she
said. ``It's as if another person were writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferre, 59, is one of those rare writers who are successful
in two languages. Her first novel in English, ``The House on the
Lagoon,'' was a National Book Award finalist in 1995. Her second,
``Eccentric Neighborhoods,'' was published this year to critical
praise. Both novels, published by Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, render a
historical portrait of 20th-century Puerto Rico through the
fortunes of several families, mostly from the island's upper class.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a feminist, satirist and literary critic, Ms. Ferre has
a bachelor's degree in English literature from Manhattanville
College in Purchase, N.Y., and a master's and doctorate in
Hispanic-American literature, from the University of Puerto Rico
and the University of Maryland respectively. She had published more
than a dozen books in Spanish, including novels, poems, essays,
short stories and children's works before she started on ``The
House on the Lagoon'' in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   She began learning English at 7 in a Roman Catholic school in
Puerto Rico and later honed her skill in the United States, where
she taught college and lived for years. But she began to write in
English purely for practical reasons, she said: to get better
distribution for her work and thus reach a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   What she did not bargain for, she said, was the change in the
creative process as she wrote, and often struggled, with her second
language. In Spanish, words came to her so quickly and in such
abundance that she could forget her point. English slowed her down,
forcing her to consult dictionaries and thesauruses to expand
vocabulary and giving her more time to figure out what her
characters would do next. She found she could concentrate better on
the story line and structure the plot more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get into Spanish, I go crazy with words,'' she said in
an interview. ``In English, I don't have the same linguistic
repertory. I have no choice but to wear blinders and go straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferre calls her Spanish prose baroque, its elaborate style
full of adjectives and complex syntax. In English, a more concise
language, her novels are 35 to 50 pages shorter. She has acquired
both brevity and a different sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go at different speeds,'' she said, comparing languages to
trains. ``You stop at different stops.''
</P>
<P>
   But she insists she remains the same writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think writing in English has changed me,'' she said.
``There isn't a different vision of the world. The message is the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, however, language interferes. Ms. Ferre, who
translated two of her Spanish books into English, one of them with
a collaborator _ ``Sweet Diamond Dust,'' a novella and three
stories, and ``The Youngest Doll,'' a short-story collection _ has
now translated her two English novels into Spanish herself. She
regards them as ``Spanish versions'' rather than literal
translations because she adds and takes out details, changes
metaphors and tinkers with her characters.
</P>
<P>
   Quintin Mendizabal, for example, the patriarch in ``The House on
the Lagoon,'' is ``less unpleasant, nicer and more human'' in
English, she said, whereas in Spanish, he is ``a scoundrel who is
not worthy of forgiveness.'' Ms. Ferre cannot quite explain why,
except that Spanish and English resonate differently.
Spanish-speaking ``Quintin'' may reflect machismo in Puerto Rican
society, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, her mother's long-held belief that Americans make
better husbands than Puerto Ricans may have subconsciously crept
into the shaping of the character, she said with a smile. (Thrice
married _ two husbands were Puerto Rican, one Mexican _ Ms. Ferre
said she had no way of knowing whether her mother was right.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Ferre, whose father, Luis Ferre, is a former governor of
Puerto Rico, comes from a wealthy family not unlike the
aristocratic sugar-plantation owners and cement tycoons she writes
about, although she stresses that her novels are strictly fiction.
Her brother publishes Puerto Rico's largest daily newspaper, El
Nuevo Dia.
</P>
<P>
   Although her family name is synonymous with the island's
statehood movement _ her father founded the pro-statehood New
Progressive Party _ Ms. Ferre, like many other Puerto Rican writers
and artists, embraced independence ideals and even voted for the
Puerto Rico Independence Party candidate who ran against her father
in the 1972 governor's election. But last March, she surprised and
angered many of her admirers when she wrote in an Op-Ed article in
The New York Times that she no longer favored independence and
would vote for statehood instead in the referendum scheduled for
December.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote that independence had once been ``the only honorable
solution,'' because under statehood, ``losing our language and
culture would have been a form of spiritual suicide.'' Language is
a crucial issue in the political debate over whether Puerto Rico
should choose statehood or independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But conditions have changed,'' she argued in the article,
noting that Hispanic people are the fastest growing minority in the
United States. ``Bilingualism and multiculturalism are vital
aspects of American society.''
</P>
<P>
   Her change of heart caused a bit of an uproar here. In a
sarcastic reply that appeared in her brother's newspaper, Ana Lydia
Vega, another Puerto Rican writer, dubbed Ms. Ferre's arguments ``a
sad apology for assimilation.'' Ms. Vega wrote that she was not as
indignant as she was disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferre responded with silence. She said she abhorred
political intransigence, adding that she did not want to get into a
public dispute. Still, she maintains that Puerto Rico's cultural
integrity need not be jeopardized as long as the United States
accepts Puerto Rico as it is. ``People are proud of who they are,''
she said. ``Why should they be maimed?''
</P>
<P>
   As a bilingual writer, Ms. Ferre, who also speaks French, sees
nothing but advantages to her command of languages. When she tours
the United States, she said, Hispanic readers thank her for writing
in English because they say they have long forgotten their Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   She admonishes them to hold on to their native tongue. English,
she said, has made her grow as a writer but could never be a
substitute for Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Language,'' Ms. Ferre said, ``is like your skin.''

RECORDER STOPPED WORKING SIX MINUTES BEFORE CRASH 
</HEADLINE>

   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ A preliminary examination of the flight
data recorder from Swissair Flight 111, indicates that it survived
the crash on Wednesday night but had stopped working about six
minutes before the MD-11 plunged into the sea off Nova Scotia, the
chief investigator said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Vic Gerden, said the finding was
disappointing, but added that that the data recorder should still
have preserved a huge volume of data on hundreds of aspects of the
plane's operation before it dipped below 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If indeed we have the flight data information down to 10,000
feet, we will have a lot of information,'' Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder appears to have quit when the plane
dipped below 10,000 feet, at about the time of the last radio
transmission from the crew, and about the time that the
transponder, a device that tells the ground-based radar the plane's
identity and altitude, also stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder is one of the two ``black boxes'' on
the plane. The other is the cockpit voice recorder, which has not
yet been retrieved. The cockpit voice recorder runs on the same
circuit as the data recorder, so it is also likely to be blank for
the last six minutes, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers on Monday homed in on the signal but failed to find
the precise location of the box before diving was halted for 36
hours because of sea swells reaching up to 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity to the recorders could have been cut off by a
malfunction, experts said, or if the pilots followed the standard
procedure for fighting on-board fires by sequentially shutting down
parts of the electric system.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft experts said the MD-11 has a three-position toggle
switch that allows the pilot to sequentially turn off a third of
the electric systems at a time. The procedure is to switch off one
of the three systems and wait up to one minute to see if the smoke
abates. If it does not, the switch is moved to another position,
restarting the first system and turning off the next one.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's two transponders, however, operate on two different
electrical circuits, so if the pilots had followed this toggle
procedure and nothing else was wrong, the transponder should not
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder is a very strong box packed with rows
of computer data storage chips, called ``nonvolatile storage,''
because unlike the memory chips in a desktop computer, they hold
their data when the power fails.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder on the MD-11 tracks 250 different parameters,
investigators said Monday. That makes it one of the most advanced
ever analyzed after a big crash; in contrast, TWA 800, an old
Boeing 747 that exploded off Long Island, N.Y., two years ago, had
17 parameters, and USAir 427, a Boeing 737 that crashed near
Pittsburgh two years before that, had 11.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic parameters measure such factors as the plane's
heading, air speed, vertical acceleration and engine function. More
advanced planes like the MD-11, with computerized cockpits, record
the functioning of dozens of other systems, showing what commands
were given in the cockpit and the position of the rudder, flaps and
other flight-control surfaces. It should record the functioning of
the cabin smoke alarm and lavatory smoke alarm, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in other recent crashes of computerized aircraft,
like the Boeing 767 that hit a mountain near Cali, Colombia,
several years ago, investigators have retrieved cockpit components
and extracted data from them _ for as long as they had electrical
power.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder could also show much about what the crew knew, and
when they knew it. ``Will the flight data recorder reveal a
steadily worsening situation that was somehow masked to the crew?''
said one investigator. If that is the case, said the investigator,
``by the time the crew realizes they can't fly the plane, the show
is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson for flight safety, he said, would be to set up
aircraft equipment or cockpit computers differently, to give
earlier warning, or more emphatic warning, of whatever doomed
Swissair 111.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police also have high hopes for the
flight data recorder. ``Our investigation is either going to
accelerate sharply or decline sharply on the basis of the box,''
said Chief Superintendent Stephen Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said engineers would have to translate the raw data of
the flight data recorder into knots, feet, angles and other usable
data. He would not say when he expected useful results.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board on
Monday sent its chief flight data recorder expert to Ottawa to
help. On Monday evening, the Canadian Navy was expecting the
arrival by plane of two U.S. Navy salvage experts, who are arriving
two days in advance of their ship, the Grapple, which is now
steaming up from Philadelphia. The Grapple was a mainstay of the
recovery of TWA 800 off Long Island two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This recovery effort may be quite different. The water is
substantially deeper, up to 190 feet vs. 120. On Monday, Capt. Phil
Webster of the Navy said that the two divers who picked up the
flight data recorder Sunday had had to surface in a rush, because
one of them had a leak in his suit; his partner managed to hold
onto the black box, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two were put in a decompression chamber and later taken to a
hospital overnight; they have been sent home and barred from diving
for two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary indications are that the debris field here is much
smaller than for TWA 800. Investigators hope that the black boxes
will tell them enough about the location of the problem that they
can pick and choose what parts of the plane to retrieve.
</P>
<P>
   But the human remains appear to be much more fragmented.
Maritime officials said they would soon begin towing subsurface
nets, like those used for fishing, to find human remains floating
beneath the surface; in the meantime, they have expanded their
shoreline search to a greater area, because of reports of debris
and remains washing ashore.
</P>
<P>
   At maximum landing weight, the MD-11 must fly at at least 165
knots, or nearly 190 mph, to stay aloft; this plane was
substantially heavier, and could easily have been flying at over
200 mph when it hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   The crew had radioed that there was smoke in the cockpit, and 10
minutes later declared an emergency, suggesting that whatever the
problem was, it was getting worse. The plane was circling to lose
altitude and dump fuel when it stopped communicating with air
traffic control, and then crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention centered Monday on whether the crew should have
attempted a direct landing from its cruise altitude of 33,000 feet,
even though the plane was 30 metric tons above maximum landing
weight. The plane can dump only a little over 2.5 tons per minute.
And it was only 30 miles from the runway; a normal descent from
33,000 feet begins more than 100 miles out.
</P>
<P>
   Some said that if the cockpit instruments were working, the
MD-11 would not be a bad choice for attempting such a landing. Its
computers automatically tell pilots how fast they must fly to stay
aloft, taking into account the fuel weight and the flaps' setting,
and the plane can decelerate and lose altitude rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   But such a landing risks causing structural damage to the plane
or making it run off the far end of the runway. Swissair executives
have said the plane could not have landed directly.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden, asked if the plane could theoretically have done so,
said, ``That calculation obviously is going to be made and it will
be considered.'' But, he said, the crew was busy trying to fight
smoke and prepare to land at an unexpected airport. ``It would be
misleading just to provide one simple piece of information like
that,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: THE RIGHT TO BE LEFT ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman struck a chord in the country
because of the way he criticized President Clinton's behavior. He
ground no political ax. He was not holier than thou. He gave us no
prurient sanctimony. Simply and directly, he expressed what most
people feel: sadness, outrage.
</P>
<P>
   But on one point he went too far: when he said that no president
today can have a private life. ``The reality is in 1998 that a
president's private life is public,'' Lieberman said.
``Contemporary news media standards will have it no other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Must every president from here on live with a press driven
downward by competition in morbid curiosity? Beyond that, can no
president ever again be assured of confidence in his talks with
advisers? Must every president look at his Secret Service guards as
potential witnesses?
</P>
<P>
   I cannot imagine any ordinary person wanting to live under such
conditions. Total exposure, or the fear of it, would put an
intolerable strain on us.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy is an essential ingredient of civilized human existence.
The reason was explained in a superb article last month in The
(London) Times Literary Supplement by Thomas Nagel, professor of
philosophy and law at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of our inner lives is such a jungle of thoughts,
feelings, fantasies and impulses,'' Nagel wrote, ``that
civilization would be impossible if we expressed them all, or if we
could all read each other's minds. ... Just as social life would be
impossible if we expressed all our lustful, aggressive, greedy,
anxious or self-obsessed feelings in ordinary public encounters, so
would inner life be impossible if we tried to become wholly persons
whose thoughts, feelings and private behavior could be safely
exposed to public view.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagel correctly saw the destruction of presidential privacy as
part of a larger trend, ``a disastrous erosion of the precious but
fragile conventions of personal privacy in the United States over
the past 10 or 20 years.'' We are in the age of letting it all hang
out _ and of rewards for exposing others.
</P>
<P>
   Two current books are nauseating examples. Joyce Maynard decided
to profit by writing about a long-ago affair with J.D. Salinger, a
man who treasures privacy. Paul Theroux decided to expose the great
writer who befriended him, V.S. Naipaul. Both will no doubt be
richly rewarded for betraying personal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such violations of intimacy, one would have to live
without love, without friendship. Is that what we want in political
leaders? All politicians, not just presidents, are now fair game
for the prying journalist, the obsessed prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't limit the choice of political figures to those whose
peculiar inner constitution enables them to withstand outrageous
exposure, or those whose sexual lives are simon-pure,'' Nagel
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to understand that the Clinton case is special.
Last February I wrote: ``President Clinton was on notice _ years of
notice _ that his sexual behavior was an issue. If he ignored the
warnings and then went on television to deny the truth, he will be
judged by the American people in those terms, and should be.''
</P>
<P>
   But in general we as a country are better off not knowing about
the private lives of our leaders, and not lusting to know. Would
America be a better place if the supposed sexual adventures of John
F. Kennedy, lately retailed, had been reported at the time? If the
press, which in those days was far more restrained, had published
the material leaked by J. Edgar Hoover about Dr. Martin Luther
King's sexual straying?
</P>
<P>
   The great Italian playwright Luigi Pirandello, in ``Right You
Are If You Think You Are,'' showed the price a community pays when
it is driven by gossips to find out The Truth about people's
private lives. It is not an accident that both Linda Tripp and
Kenneth Starr justify their relentless behavior as demanded by
``truth.''
</P>
<P>
   We should not ferret out the secrets of private lives; least of
all should we do so by the terrible power of the criminal law. My
hope and belief are that, however the Clinton story ends, the
country and Congress will see to it that never again will a
prosecutor thus damage the presidency. For the good of the country,
a president needs what Justice Brandeis called ``the right to be
let alone, ... the right most valued by civilized men.''

 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For nearly 30 years, American fashion designers have
presented their twice-yearly runway collections at the tail-end of
a month of shows in the fashion capitals of Europe. And for just as
long, American designers have groused about getting short shrift _
their creativity underappreciated by the Europeans, their
businesses thwarted by their last-to-the-market schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Now a revolution is taking place in the global fashion order.
Americans are preparing to stage their women's wear shows, which
showcase garments for retailers and the press, ahead of the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   A renegade band of New York-based designers led by Calvin Klein,
Donna Karan, Helmut Lang, Nicole Miller and Vivienne Tam will
present their spring 1999 collections in various locations around
the city starting Monday, getting a jump on the European
collections scheduled for later in the month in London, Milan and
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are serious about the business have wanted this
to happen for some time,'' Klein said. ``It's a great thing for
American fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans expect that the scrambling of the calender will
help them expand their businesses by allowing them to get their
clothes into stores more quickly. ``Everyone wants earlier and
earlier deliveries,'' Karan said. ``The old system wasn't making
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a significant intangible benefit to the move.
Americans _ often cast in the role of Rodney Dangerfields on the
global fashion stage, hungry for respect _ hope to prove once and
for all that they are creative leaders as adept at setting trends
as Europeans like Giorgio Armani and John Galliano. ``Certainly,
this will be a situation where they can't say that anymore _ that
Americans are copying,''' Ms. Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one can put a figure on how much money is likely to
flow from stores into designer's coffers as a result of the earlier
shows, retailers acknowledge the potential economic and psychic
benefits of being first on the global schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope it will prove is that Americans are creative on
their own and not look like they're copying Italians or the
French,'' said Peter Marx, vice president of Saks Jandel, which
owns five designer stores in the Washington D.C. area.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Stordahl, senior vice president for Neiman Marcus, said:
``Emotionally, it will be exciting to see the Americans go first.
But she added, ``if that's the impetus for doing this _ if it's ego
driven, that's discouraging. This is causing some very big changes
in how we organize our travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Many designers are unapologetic that the move will enhance
Americans' reputation as mavericks. Klein, Karan and Ralph Lauren
are among those who have been stung by criticism that their clothes
looked too derivative of Europeans. But designers play down the
move as a bid to establish creative supremacy; first and foremost,
they say, it is a necessary adjustment to a business that has
increasingly become global.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage is that we will be able to go into production
much earlier,'' Klein said. ``I as a designer who now has a global
business had to have collections ready earlier. It's from the
business point of view that this really makes sense. It gets
misinterpreted when people think it's designer egos. Egos are not
what it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen designers are preparing to present their spring
collections next week. A larger group, including Oscar de la Renta
and Lauren, who did not have time to adjust to the hastily
rearranged scheduled, will stage shows as originally planned after
the Europeans, from Oct. 30 to Nov. 6 in tents in Bryant Park,
under the aegis of Seventh on Sixth, the show production arm of the
Council of Fashion Designers of America. For the following season,
the entire slate of Americans will show in February, ahead of the
Europeans. The tentative dates are Feb. 14 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   This will mean a permanent calender of spring shows in September
instead of in early November, and fall shows in February rather
than in April.
</P>
<P>
   What do European designers make of this American revolt? Some
are reacting as if a global game of chicken has begun. Didier
Grumbach, president of the Federation de La Couture, the French
organization of designers, said he will urge young French designers
to present their fall 1999 collections in January, ahead of the new
New York shows. The move, he said, was already afoot. ``It will
happen because it's what all the young houses must do,'' Grumbach
said. ``The actual system is the worst of all. It kills the new
designers because no one knows who created what. The one who copied
delivers before the one who invents. The only way is to take their
orders in January.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the switch has sent a frisson of excitement and
jitters up the industry's glamorous spine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning I was a bit frightened,'' said Ms. Tam. ``I
said, `How am I going to get everything ready?' I'm going to work
late and make it happen because in the long run it will be good. It
will take one or two seasons to get it smooth.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   John Bartlett, who was in Italy this week preparing to show
there, plans to return his women's and men's collections to New
York in February. It was a blow to New York fashion when Bartlett,
one of the most exciting American designers of the last three
years, moved his shows to Milan after signing a partnership
agreement with Genny SpA, a large Italian fashion house. Bartlett
said orders from European and Asian retailers exploded after he
began introducing his line in Italy. He now gets 50 percent of his
orders from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   When he showed in New York, he said, too often retailers would
come to his showroom with empty pockets and flagging spirits
because they had already spent their money and enthusiasm in
Europe. When they did order, it was so late _ just three months
before the clothes were scheduled to hit the selling floor,
compared to four to five months for European orders _ that there
was a pell-mell rush to get clothes into stores. For stores, an
earlier runway date generally allows earlier deliveries, and
earlier deliveries mean a longer sales season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom-line is getting the clothes into stores early,''
Bartlett said. ``First in, first out.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, retailers aren't promising to open their wallets
wider just because they see Americans first; but most agree that
retail business could be spurred by earlier deliveries. ``I don't
know if I'll buy more,'' said Michael Gould, the chairman of
Bloomingdale's, which does about 70 percent of its business with
American designers. ``But if earlier shows help get the clothes
into the store on time _ say, by August 30th for fall merchandise,
it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of big stores and major designers, the earlier
schedule may actually have little impact on the size of orders.
Stores like Neiman Marcus sometimes write between 40 percent to 60
percent of their order a full two months before the show,
especially from names like Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Donna
Karan, said Ms. Stordahl of Neiman Marcus, who is senior vice
president and general merchandise manager for women's apparel. How
well a collection sold the previous year or season is as powerful a
factor in the size of an order as what a designer puts on the
runway, retailers said.
</P>
<P>
   Business considerations aside, switching to earlier show dates
presents Americans with a chance to throw off the yoke of appearing
unduly influenced by Europeans. Klein, in particular, has sometimes
been criticized for showing clothes that were overly derivative of
the minimalist stylings of Lang, an Austrian who moved his business
headquarters from Vienna to New York last January.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond to the criticism, Klein said: ``American
fashion has had an impact around the world and we don't get credit
for it because they show first. Now people will see the influence
of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it was Lang, the New York newcomer, who triggered
the schedule upheaval when he unilaterally announced this summer
that he would show his collection in September. Having staged his
runways shows in Paris for at least the last six years, Lang was
used to presenting his line earlier than the old American calender
allowed. He would likely have remained an aberration had Klein not
announced the very next day that he too would show in September.
Soon the situation snowballed, with more than a dozen designers
saying they, too, would show two months earlier. The unified shows
in Bryant Park were in danger of collapsing with some designers
showing in September and the remainder in November. Seventh on
Sixth polled designers to find out if they wanted to move dates.
The answer, while not unanimous, was yes.
</P>
<P>
   The reason why American designers continue to be viewed as
inferior by some retailers, journalists and customers is one of
fashion's great mysteries. Some 50 years ago, American stores and
designers did diligently and openly copy the French, then
considered global style leaders. But much has changed since then.
Many fashion insiders have long considered Americans leaders, not
imitators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny to me when people say Calvin is influenced by
someone else because no one has had more of an influence than
Calvin or Ralph Lauren, who influence everybody in the world,''
said Robert Duffy, business partner of the designer Marc Jacobs and
an executive at Louis Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   British editors travel to New York to see Tommy Hilfiger's show
and gather the latest information on sneakers; hip hop style is
considered cutting edge in major cities around the world, and the
idea of simple, comfortable dressing advanced by American life and
stores like the Gap are the template for modern dress.
</P>
<P>
   Some fashion insiders wonder if, by showing so much earlier,
American designers might unintentionally undermine the very respect
for creativity they crave. There is concern that designing clothes
almost a year before they are to be worn may stunt designers'
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier women's show schedule will have a domino effect on
the industry. The New York fall men's shows, typically held in
February, may now be moved earlier, said Fern Mallis, executive
director of Seventh on Sixth. This month designers must already
begin selecting fabrics, arranging production schedules and
sketching styles for next February _ tasks most are used to doing
in November. There will be no Christmas vacation in Cape Town this
year as Bartlett had planned.
</P>
<P>
   The change is particularly hard on American designers like
Bartlett, Jacobs, de la Renta and Michael Kors who design their own
collections as well as European lines. ``It's going to be a
nightmare from a design standpoint,'' said Duffy. ``For the design
staff there'll be no Christmas, no New Year. They won't be happy.
My production staff is delighted. They get more time to work on the
collection.''

IN BELLWEATHER OHIO DISTRICT, LEWINSKY ISSUE IS NOT YET MAJOR
CONCERN

 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, Ohio _ Rep. Ted Strickland sat in the back seat of
the Ford Explorer, with its air-conditioner set up high, waiting
for the start of the River Days parade, which has been the
highlight of the Labor Day weekend in this Ohio River town as long
as anyone can remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a normal year,'' he said, ``I would have had two or three
months of hand-to-hand combat by now, but so far this year, there's
been almost no campaign. I spent most of my time this summer doing
congressional work.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland, a 57-year-old Democrat, won his seat in 1992 on his
fourth try. He lost it in 1994, then took it back in 1996. Each of
the last three races has been a gasper, with the winner taking 51
percent, the loser 49, making this district, the Ohio Sixth,
something of a national bellwether. Presidential races have been
close, too, with George Bush winning by 2,720 votes in 1992 and
Bill Clinton by only 4,488 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This is precisely the kind of district that the Republicans
would like to take to pad their uncomfortably narrow majority of 21
in the House of Representatives, and the Democrats need to hold
onto if they are to have a chance of winning a majority of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   The race here has an additional significance as well. This is
also the kind of religious, straitlaced district both parties will
watch to measure the import of Clinton's relationship with the
former intern, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, there are few overt signs that the Lewinsky matter
will bedevil Strickland, although there is enough unease that he
and other Democrats are willing to openly scold a president of
their own party before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage in the campaign, at least, local issues are the
dominant concern. But the flames of partisan passion have not truly
begun burning here in the rolling hills of the Sixth, a lovely if
economically forlorn region stretching east along the river from
the exurbs of Cincinnati for more than 150 miles to Marietta, the
oldest town in the Midwest, which was founded in 1788. People are
talking about the heat _ it was over 100 degrees this weekend _ and
not about the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Nancy Hollister, 48, the Republican nominee, is a more
than presentable candidate, a moderate, a supporter of limited
abortion rights, with roots in the region. She served as Marietta's
mayor before moving to Columbus, and as director of the State
Office of Appalachia for three years beginning in 1991, she was in
charge of distributing tax dollars in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hollister had to fight a nasty primary against four more
socially conservative rivals, including Frank Cremeans, who beat
Strickland in 1994 and lost to him in 1996. That emptied her
campaign treasury. After a summer of fund-raising, she has only
about $200,000 on hand, but Strickland has more than twice that.
Cremeans has still made no move to help her restore party harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hollister trails in the polls, by as much as 10 points in
one, by a smaller margin in others. Both candidates expect a tight
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always run as if I'm a thousand votes behind,'' she said in
an interview on Sunday afternoon, sitting cross-legged on the floor
of her Marietta living room. ``All I have to do is convince people
that the less government, the better. My opponent tries to dip into
the federal goodies bag for the district, but I would deliver
federal dollars directly to the localities for them to spend.''
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates disagree on how to reform school financing
after a court decision declaring the present system
unconstitutional. They talk about jobs, which have been a problem
hereabouts for decades; Portsmouth alone has lost shoe factories
and a steel mill, and with them half its population. The median
family income is the lowest in the state, at $21,761 a year.
</P>
<P>
   And they talk about transportation, another perennial issue in a
district with no scheduled airline service, little rail passenger
service and links to the interstate highway network only on its
eastern and western fringes.
</P>
<P>
   But what of Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   Some Ohio Democrats, including Strickland, have openly
criticized the president. Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Toledo denounced him
in a speech last week for having dragged the nation and his family
through ``a year of deceitful melodrama'' and told The Cleveland
Plain Dealer that even resignation would not constitute adequate
atonement. More subtly, Mary Boyle, the party's Senate candidate,
produced a video that showed her with Hillary Rodham Clinton and
John H. Glenn Jr., whom she hopes to succeed, but not with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this man personally,'' Strickland said. ``I've
supported him on most issues. But not many people get to be
president, and not many people are as smart as he is. What a waste!
He has endangered everything he's worked for and I've worked for.
His presidency might actually end prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed and very sad and disappointed, like my
constituents, and angry, too. But peoples' anger is not out of
control yet and I don't think it will affect the way they vote this
fall. But it might, it could.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland, a former Methodist minister who still greets male
acquaintances with an evangelical ``how are you doing, my
brother?'' is also a graduate psychologist. In his former
occupation as a counselor at a local prison, he said, he had
``encountered all kinds of behavior.'' But he had nonetheless been
astounded, he added, ``by the risks the president took, the
repetition, even when his actions had already got him in trouble,
again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Hollister, she said Clinton had ``violated the code
of ethics and behavior you have to hold yourself to as a public
official.'' At the moment, the Lewinsky case is not entering into
many voting decisions here, she said, but by October, she
suggested, ``things may look different.''
</P>
<P>
   Debby Allard, the editor of The Portsmouth Times, said that
because Strickland had spoken out against Clinton's behavior, ``I
can't see many people at all around here punishing Strickland for
the president's sins.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation could have been worse for him if Cremeans had won
the Republican primary, local people say. In his two years in
Washington, he often got into trouble for impolitic remarks, like a
statement that ``the Greeks and Romans were homosexuals'' and had
been punished as a result. But he has a strong appeal to the
religious right _ indeed the former head of the Christian
Coalition, Ralph Reed, was an adviser for a time _ and he might
have been better able to stir up socially conservative voters on
the Clinton issue.
</P>
<P>
   This is an old-fashioned world with traditional values, less
inclined to live and let live than Cincinnati and other big Ohio
cities. The big River Days parade, for example, was a page from a
simpler past, with homemade costumes and floats, fire engines,
Model T Fords, Model A Fords, high school bands and an American
Legion honor guard. The one truly contemporary note was the names
of the cheerleaders who rode on long flatbed trucks _ Bethany and
Tiffany, Lindsay and Brittany, Courtney and Ashley, with nary a
Jane or a Mary in sight.
</P>
<P>
   What worries him, Strickland said, is a low turnout in November.
With most people prosperous, with continuing cynicism about
politics and with no crisis abroad, voters might stay at home, and
that would help Ms. Hollister, the congressman suggested. The best
solution, he said, would be ``for Clinton to go for broke, cast
aside this excessive caution, set inspiring goals.''
</P>
<P>
   But few in Washington see much chance of that, and many think
Strickland's fears of a low turnout will be realized. In a study
earlier this year, Curtis Gans of the Center for the Study of the
American Electorate predicted a ``sharply reduced'' turnout
compared with 1994, perhaps the lowest ever, and suggested it was
likely to hurt Democrats because of disproportionately heavy
participation by more highly paid voters, who tend to be
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland has done what he can to insulate himself against
adversity. He works hard at the minutiae of constituent service,
returning each weekend to the district, plying the byways of an
area without a city of more than 25,000 people. At this time of
year, tobacco hung in the barns to dry, carpets of black-eyed
Susans along the road and a covered bridge around every corner, a
romantic could convince himself nothing has changed since the Adena
Indians built the extraordinary Serpent Mountain near Chillicothe
almost 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Always a fairly centrist Democrat, Strickland has inched far
further to the right during the last two years. He was one of only
15 Democrats to vote to end the income tax by 2003; he backed a
constitutional amendment banning flag-burning, and he opposed the
president on several trade issues. That has led Ms. Hollister to
accuse him of lacking principle and bowing to electoral expediency.

SANTA MONICA SEEKS RETURN TO ONLINE CIVIC FORUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ When Santa Monica City Hall first offered
online forums nine years ago, the major topic in this upscale
community was the homeless. Donald Paschal, who was logging on from
a public terminal, offered advice from a unique perspective.
</P>
<P>
   He would like to get a job, Paschal wrote, but he was dirty, he
had nowhere to wash his clothes and nowhere to store his
belongings. He was, in fact, homeless. People were astonished. They
organized to help their online compatriot.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, they created a program called Swashlock, for showers,
washers and lockers.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1989. It was the first major civic initiative of the
online group, officially known as the Santa Monica Public
Electronic Network, or PEN. It was an experiment in electronic
democracy that after nine years has become a widely studied model
for scholars and municipal officials searching for ways to use
online tools to foster citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   PEN started as an electronic bulletin board, a pre-Internet
technology that allowed owners of computers with modems to read
material posted by others and to send and receive text messages.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid spread of the Internet since 1994 expanded those early
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, local officials are struggling to recapture
the enthusiasm that surrounded the network in its early days and to
stimulate dwindling online discussions.
</P>
<P>
   They have a strong incentive: Santa Monica lost a major public
forum last March, when the Copley Newspapers chain shut down The
Outlook, the only daily newspaper in this city of 90,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica, city officials say, is uniquely suited to fill
that void with online forums. Fifty percent of the households here
have Internet access, and nearly one in 10 residents is a
registered user of PEN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in Santa Monica politics got up first thing in the
morning and read The Outlook's letters to the editor,'' said City
Councilman Ken Genser.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion also faded in PEN partly because the city's forums
became plagued by personal attacks and ranting.
</P>
<P>
   City officials announced a test solution on Sept. 1. They said
the League of Women Voters had agreed to moderate the PEN forums on
candidates and issues through the November election. The next step,
city officials say, depends on what happens with the moderated
forums.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents say they hope that interest in the city election
will revive the online forum. Its early successes in creating equal
access to policy-makers online have not been forgotten, nor has the
homeless man who so influenced PEN's early days.
</P>
<P>
   Paschal left the city years ago and became a cable talk-show
host, but in 1995, he logged on and left a message on PEN for his
old friends in Santa Monica. ``Just call me EX-homeless,'' it said.

PARCELLS SEES THE GOOD, THE BAD, BUT MOSTLY THE UGLY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ A day after the Jets' agonizing 36-30 overtime
loss to the San Francisco 49ers, Bill Parcells responded like a
typical coach.
</P>
<P>
   He was disappointed. He said he didn't talk to anyone on the
five-hour plane ride home. After watching game tapes Monday
morning, he said he found a few good things but quickly found
negatives to offset them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to move the ball fairly well and we caught the
ball fairly well,'' Parcells said. ``But we've got to block better
on the run, for sure, and we've got to stop the run better. The
last play aside, we missed an awful lot of tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   The last play, of course, was Garrison Hearst's 96-yard run on a
trap play that gave the 49ers their winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed a tackle in the hole,'' Parcells said. ``We missed a
tackle 3 yards downfield. I couldn't count them after that. They
had already run that play three or four times in the game. We had
experienced players in there. We had about six chances to get the
guy down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very concerned to see a couple of things I don't like.
On the other hand, I did see some things I do like. But we are a
little too erratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells had to like his passing game. Glenn Foley, in his first
regular-season opener since becoming the starting quarterback,
posted better numbers than any other National Football League
quarterback Sunday _ 58 attempts, 30 completions, 415 yards. He
passed for three touchdowns and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   The wide receivers had big days. Keyshawn Johnson caught 9
passes for 126 yards and 2 touchdowns, Wayne Chrebet 6 for 125
yards and a touchdown, Dedric Ward 5 for 96 yards. That helped the
Jets amass 465 yards in total offense. (They yielded 557 to San
Francisco.) But Parcells indicated that the Jets' offensive
imbalance _ 58 passes and 24 runs _ was a one-time thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco was in dire straits for cornerbacks,'' Parcells
said. ``They were down to two, and they didn't have enough guys to
play. They were having problems covering as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet explained it by saying: ``We saw in tapes that if we
went to three wideouts, we would have had an advantage. We moved
the ball. I think we definitely have weapons on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said: ``I didn't know we would throw that much, and
maybe it was just for this game. In the next game, maybe we get 250
yards on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he hoped this game would serve as a springboard
for Ward, a second-year pro, who may be the fastest player on the
team.
</P>
<P>
   For Foley, the endless passing was a quarterback's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of fun, wide open, throwing the ball all over the
place,'' he said. ``That's what you play the game for. It was an
exciting game.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley had started only five games in his four previous pro
seasons. His teammates had high praise for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn was a great leader in the huddle,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet gave this example:
</P>
<P>
   ``On the last drive, he was very bossy. He wants it run this
way, run your route that way. You want that. He showed that he's a
big-time quarterback. He's the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, it was suggested to Foley, he had something to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said. ``I think everybody in this
locker room knows what we're capable of doing. We have a pretty
explosive offense.''
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, who played a game worthy of his idol, Jerry Rice of
the 49ers, Foley did prove something.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' Johnson said, ``Glenn proved his worth as a
quarterback.''

HUB RESIDENTS FEELING SAFER, SURVEY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ZACHARY R. DOWDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's been five years since some police officers dubbed
Boston ``Fear City,'' urging people to stay inside after 6 p.m. Now
a study reveals that in some neighborhoods, residents consider car
theft, car vandalism, and littered streets more significant
problems than gangs and guns.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Boston Public Safety Survey found that 76 percent of
residents feel somewhat to very safe out alone in their
neighborhoods at night _ up from 58 percent just two years earlier.
The next frontier for police, according to the survey, will be
curbing so-called nuisance crimes that cramp people's comfort
rather than jeopardize their safety.
</P>
<P>
   The survey offers a neighborhood-by-neighborhood glance at
Bostonians' fears of crime. Downtown and Back Bay yielded the
highest percentage of residents feeling safe; Roxbury, Mattapan,
and Dorchester ranked lowest _ but these neighborhoods also showed
the greatest increase in residents' sense of safety.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, only about 7 percent of residents in Area B-2
(Roxbury/Mission Hill) and in B-3 (Dorchester/Mattapan) felt very
safe in their neighborhoods alone during evening hours. By 1997,
these figures quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   ``These areas have the highest crime rate,'' said Luis Garcia,
director of the Office of Research and Evaluation of the Boston
Police Department. ``While they improved, they are still lower than
other areas; but if you look at how much of a gain they showed, you
see it's a great improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhaustive study, fast becoming the chief source for police
in crafting strategies to fight crime, offers the clearest
distinction yet between which issues are nuisances and which crimes
scare Bostonians most.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells us how we are performing with our customers,'' said
Boston Police Commissioner Paul F. Evans. ``This study goes beyond
the question of is crime up or down and says what we in the police
department should be concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   It also gauges people's fear of becoming victims, awareness of
crime around them, and willingness to help stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of respondents said they would be willing to
attend several meetings a year to help make the city safer.
</P>
<P>
   While the respondents were most fearful of the more violent
crimes such as murder, attack with a weapon, sexual assault, or
burglary, they felt that those events were very unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 percent said ``being murdered'' was very likely, but 73
percent said it was not at all likely. About 6 percent said ``being
mugged'' was very likely, but nearly 48 percent said it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Funded by the National Institute of Justice, the $69,000 study
is based on 45- to 50-minute telephone interviews with 3,000
residents from May through August 1997. The study was conducted by
Atlantic Marketing Research in Boston, and the results took a year
to compile.
</P>
<P>
   Residents answered dozens of questions about neighborhood
conditions, fear of crime, neighborhood cohesion, police-community
relations, and neighborhood policing.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of the study surveyed 1,400 of Boston's 2,100 police
officers on neighborhood policing, the quality of supervision and
training, and crime in Boston. Up to 74 percent of this sample said
serious crime has dipped.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few weeks, police researchers will begin
surveying the business community.
</P>
<P>
   Among citizens, fear may be dropping as quickly as crime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the last year such a study was conducted, 16 percent of
roughly 1,000 residents surveyed said they felt ``very safe'' at
night. In contrast, the new study showed that 35 percent of people
feel ``very safe,'' more than double the 1995 result.
</P>
<P>
   The study breaks down responses by neighborhood and the city's
12 police districts, creating a guide for precinct captains to
tackle problems their constituents care about most.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 37 percent of residents living in the area covered
by District E-5, which includes Hyde Park, Roslindale, and West
Roxbury, found ``cars being broken into'' a significant problem,
and of those residents, 34 and 31 percent found burglary and
vandalism, respectively, a significant problem.
</P>
<P>
   But of Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan residents in District
B-2, 10 percent of those surveyed said ``people selling and buying
drugs'' was a primary worry, followed by ``kids hanging around,''
and ``people high on drugs in public.''
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Collymore, 23, returning from his shift as a UPS package
deliverer one recent night, said he walks with less stress now
through Fields Corner, his home for the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see much (of concern) going on,'' he said. ``The
police can say crime is going down, but that's not the same as when
you see it. That's what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the point. That crime is down is not news. FBI statistics
have shown figures plummeting here since 1993, and Boston has
dipped to new lows in seven major crime categories: murder, rape,
robbery, aggravated assault, car theft, burglary, and larceny.
</P>
<P>
   But annual recitations of numbers had a cerebral quality that
failed to convince people who held fear in their hearts. Police
have sensed that that feeling was eroding over the past few years,
but they had no way to quantify it _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also pinpoints flaws in areas where police took their
effectiveness for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study is a wakeup call to us,'' said Captain Robert
Dunford, commander of Area C-11 in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   He said the report confirmed his precinct's studies showing that
the feeling of safety is contagious and that concerns for many have
shifted from fear of violent crime to so-called quality-of-life
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Captains may use the study to determine the success of programs
they started under the rubric of Neighborhood Policing, when
officials restructured the department and allowed captains greater
discretion over how to run their precincts.
</P>
<P>
   But Dunford was surprised and disappointed that so few people
surveyed know a police officer by name, which makes him think his
precinct must work harder at increasing visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on the streets, the sense of safety is palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, when Boston erupted with violence, Irene
Gonsalves's home was burglarized. And five years ago, a mugger
attacked her in the Fields Corner MBTA station.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gonsalves, 48, stood alone and worry-free before an
automated teller machine in a bank vestibule whose light, at 10:45
p.m., is among the few bright spots in Fields Corner. She explained
that it has been years since she really felt afraid in her
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime isn't much of a problem in Fields Corner,'' she said.

ART OF THE DEAL MEETS SCIENCE OF A MARKET SWOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's that time of year: The children are back in
school and Wall Street investment bankers have returned from a lazy
holiday weekend at their Hampton estates, now eager to do deals.
</P>
<P>
   But if the last two weeks are any guide, they may not see as
much action as they crave. As the lofty stock prices that buoyed
the merger wave this year have tumbled, many bankers are instead
soothing the frayed nerves of clients _ and worrying along with
them about which deals will fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to wait and see whether this is a fundamental
shift in the market psyche or just a temporary blip,'' said Steven
Koch, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse First
Boston. Still, he warned, ``I think it's more than a blip and could
be a change in the market mind-set.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that all deal making will come to a
screeching halt. But consider the fortunes last week of a small
telecommunications company that was in discussions to be acquired
by a larger rival.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, hours after the Dow Jones industrial average dropped
512 points, the chief executive of the large company called his
counterpart at the smaller company to say that the talks were off
until stock prices settled. The smaller company's market value had
slid in the decline, the caller said, making the earlier negotiated
price too rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to pay a 110 percent premium,'' a banker close
to the negotiations quoted the executive as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Events like that are increasingly common. So much so that Mark
Menell, co-head of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's West Coast
technology-mergers-and-acquisitions group, scrapped plans for a
pre-Labor Day holiday, staying behind to tend to the dozen or so
companies he is advising on potential transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Every day last week, Menell made the 15-minute commute to
Morgan's offices in Menlo Park, Calif., well before sunrise,
spending hours counseling executives, even canceling dinner plans
with friends to make sure two deals did not falter at the last
minute. ``We want to keep people focused on looking out the front
window instead of the rear-view mirror,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some negotiations have been delayed, including a
possible merger involving a company that wants to wait until its
intended partner announces earnings for the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Behind much of the turmoil is uncertainty over the short-term
effect that unstable world markets will have on domestic companies.
That, coupled with fluctuating stock prices in the United States,
makes pricing deals a treacherous exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still business as usual,'' said Peter Crnkovich, a
health-care banker at Morgan Stanley who spent most of last week on
the road visiting clients. ``But people aren't comfortable with
what things are worth right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just potential clients who need hand-holding, however.
Hal Ritch, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette, spent Friday morning mulling over an international deal
that has been plagued by currency fluctuations _ a problem that is
not addressed in the merger agreement.
</P>
<P>
   And that is only one deal on his mind. For days, teams of
bankers have stacked up outside his office waiting to discuss any
of the more than six deals in his shop affected by the market
turmoil. The persistent bull market lulled company executives and
their advisers into omitting terms that would have let them walk
away in the event of a sharp downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a long period of stability, people get a little
comfortable, '' he said. ``But these breaks in the market, when
they occur, have real-world consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   One banker who asked not to be identified recalled a recent
conversation with the treasurer of a Fortune 500 company whose
merger has not been approved by shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the two bantered about all the money to be made in
corporate takeovers. (In fact, many arbitragers are smarting from
losses they incurred after the merger agreement between Tellabs
Inc. and Ciena Corp. was renegotiated in August. And the market is
rife with rumors about which deals _ particularly in the
financial-services sector _ are next.)
</P>
<P>
   But when the conversation turned to his own company, the
treasurer was less sanguine, worrying that eroding investor
confidence could tarnish otherwise promising deals like his.
</P>
<P>
   He may have reason to fret. ``Things dried up for four months
after the crash of 1987,'' recalled Allen Finkelson, an attorney at
Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore. And last November _ after the stock
market's biggest point drop ever on Oct. 27 _ the total value of
announced domestic deals sank to $69 billion from $184 billion the
previous month, according to Securities Data Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be part psychological,'' said Steven Kaplan, a
professor of finance at the University of Chicago. ``Let's say your
company was trading at $120. Now you are at $100, and someone
offers you $120. You think: `No way. I was just worth that much.'''

</P>
<P>
   For all the uncertainty pervading big corporations and their
bankers and investors these days, some corners of Wall Street are
heartened by the stock market's swoon.
</P>
<P>
   For Michael Klein, head of the financial entrepreneurs group at
Salomon Smith Barney, this is an opportunity his clients have been
waiting for. He caters to leveraged-buyout firms that found few
domestic bargains the last few years and now have almost $100
billion on hand to snap up companies at reduced prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 days, Klein has marshaled 20 bankers who have
compiled a list of recently delayed initial public offerings and
capital-needy companies, including a $500 million public company he
has already introduced to possible buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, like Menell, was supposed to be on vacation last week.
Instead, he found himself busily rushing off to impromptu meetings
with financiers who live near his family's rented Long Island
summer home overlooking Shinnecock Bay. On Wednesday, for instance,
he said he spent the afternoon discussing ideas at the Southampton
home of the financier Leon Black of Apollo Management, whose house
is visible across the bay from Klein's back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we exuberant? Not quite,'' Klein said when asked in a
lunchtime interview on the sundeck of his cottage last Thursday how
he felt about business prospects. Looking almost boyish in
blue-and-green checkered shorts and Birkenstock sandals, Klein
casually flipped through a 61-page document of businesses for sale.
``But am I happy?'' he said. ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be some time, though, before he sees the payoff. For one
thing, the high-yield corporate bond market is moribund. And just
because a buyout firm wants to buy, that does not mean a target
company wants to sell. But if stock prices sink further, investors
like Black could reap rewards next year.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it, too, that bankers could be defending
more companies against unwelcome advances than they have in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies that were forced to approach another on a friendly
basis are more likely to consider hostile bids now,'' said Peter
Schoenfeld, head of the equity investment firm PSAM LLC. In
addition, he said, ``we are likely to see more of a willingness to
use cash instead of stock.'' If so, that could dampen Wall Street's
flirtation with megamergers, simply because few companies can
afford $50 billion all-cash offers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, any break in activity, while not welcome by Wall Street,
may give bankers a much-needed breather to take care of things they
had put off for months. Gregg Polle, co-head of mergers and
acquisitions at Salomon Smith Barney, for instance, finally served
his turn on jury duty last week after many postponements. ``I
picked this week because I thought activity would be slow,'' he
said. ``But I never hoped for this.''

LAW WOULD ALLOW MAINE, VERMONT TO BURY WASTE IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIERRA BLANCA, Texas _ For all its desolate beauty, this
tumbleweed town deep in the Chihuahua Desert of west Texas is vexed
by everyday villains, from chronic poverty to rattlesnakes.
</P>
<P>
   But looming in the dusty shadow of Devil's Ridge, a short hike
from the sun-scorched adobe homes in this scruffy village, is a new
threat involving two faraway foes, Maine and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a development with major consequences for
Sierra Blanca and possible implications for relations with Mexico
and the next US presidential campaign, is poised to sign a law
permitting Maine and Vermont to join Texas in burying tons of
low-level radioactive waste on a site selected by Texas
authorities: a former cattle ranch near the Rio Grande River in
Sierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts and other New England states also hope to use the
massive underground repository.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the pact last week, 78-15, and sent it to
Clinton for his signature, despite a warning from the Mexican
Congress that the Sierra Blanca dump site offends its ``national
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of environmental, religious, and Hispanic groups
also is rallying against the disposal site, saying Texas
authorities targeted Sierra Blanca because its poor, predominantly
Mexican-American population of fewer than 800 lacked the political
muscle to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are turning a poor, Hispanic town into New England's pay
toilet,'' said Bill Addington, a Sierra Blanca businessman and
leader of the local opposition. ``If there was ever a case of
environmental racism, Sierra Blanca is it.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue itself is important &UR;  &LR; for Texas Governor George W.
Bush, who would covet the Hispanic vote and mantle of environmental
defender if he seeks the Republican presidential nomination in
2000. Bush has tentatively endorsed the Sierra Blanca site, which
some of the town's residents support because of the
multimillion-dollar windfall it has already brought the
long-depressed area.
</P>
<P>
   The dump also could affect the Democratic field in 2000 if
Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, the project's leading
congressional foe, follows through on his vow to challenge Vice
President Al Gore for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has tried to position himself as a leader in protecting the
environment and defending communities against unwanted toxic waste.
But White House officials have said Clinton is unlikely to block
the dump pact because he lacks the votes to sustain a veto and does
not want to offend key senators from Maine and Vermont who pushed
for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The only New England senators who opposed the compact were
Democrats: Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry, both of
Massachusetts, and Jack Reed, of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the compact was too harsh in allowing Texas authorities
to impose a radioactive waste dump on an unwilling community,''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   When the House passed the measure in July, 305-117, 12 of New
England's 23 lawmakers voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Blanca already is home to the world's largest sewage
sludge dump, where 250 tons of waste from New York City are spread
daily over 91,000 acres of cattle pasture. The sludge arrives on a
train that some residents call the ``poo-poo choo-choo.''
</P>
<P>
   But many townspeople see little levity in the situation. And
they scoff at pledges from backers of the radioactive waste dump
that the material will be buried safely for all time.
</P>
<P>
   The low-level waste consists of contaminated material from
nuclear plants, military facilities, laboratories in hospitals and
universities, biotechnology firms, and other industries. More than
95 percent of the low-level material in Maine and Vermont is
generated by each state's nuclear power plant, Maine Yankee, in
Wiscasset, and Vermont Yankee, in Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we have to be the nation's dumping ground?'' said Ben
Cabana, who retired from the Army after serving in the Gulf War,
then returned home to Sierra Blanca. ``If this radioactive dump is
so safe, why don't they put it in Maine or Vermont?''
</P>
<P>
   At the dump site in Sierra Blanca, a 40-foot-deep trench carved
out of the parched earth, Julie D. Porter, a spokeswoman for the
Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority, said the
town's meager political clout had nothing to do with the location.
She said the site was deemed suitable after extensive geological,
hydrological, and metereological tests determined the dump would
not threaten the environment or public health.
</P>
<P>
   Although Texas has already spent more than $30 million
developing the Sierra Blanca dump, a panel of administrative judges
recently recommended rejecting the site because the state had not
adequately studied the socioeconomic impact on the region and the
potential for an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ruling is not binding and is considered unlikely to
block the dump's licensing and eventual operation, perhaps as early
as next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, there would have to be a castastrophe that
changed life on Earth as we know it to affect the safety of this
site,'' Porter said. ``There is a lot of misinformation out there
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sierra Blanca is bitterly split on the issue, and there
are few havens from the debate. One of the last refuges was lost
recently when a pastor at Our Lady of Miracles Church asked
parishioners to pray against the dump. The request shocked several
dump supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Even families are split on the issue. ``I'm for it, but my
husband's against it,'' Barbara Fulton said as she ate lunch with
her mother, Louise Isaacs, in the family's otherwise deserted Best
Cafe. ``We just can't talk about it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sierra Blanca's crumbling adobe courthouse, Hudspeth County
Judge James A. Peace, the dump's leading local supporter,
criticized foes for attacking the facility's safety. ``A little
knowledge is worse than none at all,'' he said. ``A lot of these
people think nuclear waste is going to eat them alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace said the town desperately needs the project's financial
benefits, of which $3.5 million has already been spent to build a
library, health clinic, community park, and a football field for
the Sierra Blanca Vaqueras (Cowboys).
</P>
<P>
   The town also has bought two new school buses, two fire trucks,
and two ambulances, which for the first time provide emergency
medical service around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   For many residents, the dump money is long overdue relief for
Sierra Blanca, which changed forever after Interstate 10, the major
freeway across south Texas, cut a swath through town 40 years ago.
The highway devastated downtown commerce, from the Chuck Wagon
Restaurant at one end of the town's only paved road to the Hole in
the Wall Cafe at the opposite end. The only movie house, still
known as the ``picture show,'' hung on until the 1980s, featuring
movies in English on Friday nights and in Spanish on Saturday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   Today, not a single doctor or lawyer lives in Hudspeth County,
which is the size of Connecticut. The median household income is
less than $8,000, and about 40 percent of Sierra Blanca's residents
live below the federal poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Under the dump pact, Sierra Blanca will receive an additional
$2.5 million each from Maine and Vermont, and 10 percent of all the
fees collected during the dump's 30-year life. Peace estimated the
town's share at about $1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year, we're going to spend about a million dollars to fix
up the courthouse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone marvels at the largesse. ``Sure, the dump's
going to be worth a lot of money one day,'' said a store owner who
asked not to be identified because she did not want to mix her
business with politics. ``But is money really everything?''

GIANTS STIFFEN DEFENSE AFTER AN EARLY LETDOWN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It was early in the second quarter on
Sunday, and the Washington Redskins' offense was pushing the
Giants' defense around, advancing down the field play after play.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Giants' 31-24 season-opening victory, it is
hard to remember the moments when a Giants victory hardly looked
assured, when the Giants' defense _ even its vaunted defensive line
_ was losing the battle.
</P>
<P>
   But it was happening. The Giants were trailing by 4 points and
on the verge of falling further behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on our heels,'' the Giants' defensive coordinator,
John Fox, said of the Redskins' second-quarter surge. ``They
suckered us a couple times. The coaches, we were on our heels, too.
There was some adversity there; you become a little out of sorts.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared to get worse when Washington quarterback Gus
Frerotte threw a touchdown pass to Michael Westbrook. Now,
Washington was an extra point away from going ahead by 14-3. But
the Westbrook touchdown was negated by a holding penalty, and on
the next play, defensive tackle Keith Hamilton sacked Frerotte.
Defensive end Chad Bratzke, whom the Redskins had run past three
times in the same drive for 18 yards, made it consecutive sacks of
Frerotte on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Redskins had gone from a potential 11-point lead
to a third-and-39 from their own 40-yard line. A punt followed.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the rest of the game, the Giants' defensive front
four controlled the line of scrimmage. Washington moved the
football, but only in spurts and usually when the Giants held a
two-touchdown lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a harassing Giants defense _ a trademark of the team
a year ago _ had left its imprint on another victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relentless,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said Monday.
``Hopefully, that will always be our signature. Those guys don't
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a dominant, confident and combative unit, one with a cocky
style of play and an even more cocksure operating philosophy. In
essence, the Giants' defense accepts that some success by the
opposing offense is inevitable. The Giants will wait for the
turnover that masks any of the blemishes exposed earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Giants once again had an edge in the biggest
statistic of most games: turnover ratio. The Giants forced two
interceptions and a fumble, while the offense turned the ball over
once.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said all summer that the 1998 Giants cannot
duplicate the performance of a year ago, when they forced 44
turnovers and had a turnover ratio of plus-25.
</P>
<P>
   But when your defensive line is combining for eight sacks, as
the Giants' line did Sunday, then turnovers will be an unavoidable
byproduct. Sacks cause fumbles, and they cause the quarterback to
pass in a hurry, which leads to interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   After one game, the Giants' turnover ratio is plus-2. It's an
excellent start, even if it didn't seem very likely early in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad things happen for you in every game,'' Fox said later,
recalling the defense's troublesome start in Sunday's game. ``You
just kind of hold your breath. You don't panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox also trusted a group that is young yet experienced and very
deep. The eight Giants sacks were spread among four players:
Bratzke, Hamilton and Michael Strahan had two each, while Christian
Peter and Robert Harris had one apiece. And on a hot day, being
able to rotate the tackles Peter and Bernard Holsey into the lineup
was of great value.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, there is linebacker Scott Galyon, who brings speed
and tackling ability in from the sideline. Safety Percy Ellsworth,
who plays in the team's nickel packages, is 6 feet 2 inches and 225
pounds and has a knack for finding the football.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get nervous,'' Bratzke said. ``We don't get caught up
in the moment. We just play.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Strahan said: ``We really don't get rattled. We just get
mad.''

 &HT;    USC quarterback in good form for upcoming game against Georgia
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ South Carolina quarterback Anthony Wright has
often been in the spotlight since he arrived in Columbia from tiny
Vanceboro, N.C., in 1994. But last week, shortly before the opening
game of his senior season, Wright dodged media requests.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the spring and summer, Wright had been one of the
most talked-about subjects in South Carolina. But the focus wasn't
on a Heisman Trophy campaign. Instead, it focused on Wright's
development in the weight room, where he was rehabilitating from
torn knee ligaments he suffered against Tennessee last Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the Gamecocks' opener, Wright turned
down interview requests because he said he was just too emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, I was a little nervous,'' Wright said after South
Carolina's 38-20 win over Ball State on Saturday. ``It was my first
game in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look like his first game in more than nine months, as
the 6-foot-2, 194-pounder completed 14 of 21 passes for 180 yards
and three touchdowns against the Cardinals. To make things easier,
the South Carolina coaching staff scripted the first 12 plays for
Wright, who was held out of all contact during preseason camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things that helped him was that he knew
exactly what was going to happen on the first few plays,''
first-year Gamecocks offensive coordinator Chuck Reedy said. ``We
went over everything play by play and gave Anthony a chance to go
through everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wright's instincts took over on South Carolina's first play
from scrimmage and he ditched the script. When he couldn't find an
open receiver, Wright tucked the football and rushed for seven
yards. Five plays later, he scrambled out of traffic for a
career-long 30-yard run. He completed all of eight of his pass
attempts in the first quarter for 85 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went out and focused on the game, not on my knee,''
Wright said. ``I did what I was coached to do and performed. I
didn't think I would come out and drag. I didn't think I would have
a bad game. This was supposed to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia coach Jim Donnan has seen plenty of Wright over the last
two seasons. In Donnan's second game with the Bulldogs in 1996,
Wright completed 18 of 29 passes for 224 yards and a touchdown. His
16-yard scramble on a critical third-down play late in the fourth
quarter kept alive an 84-yard scoring drive that buried the
mistake-prone Bulldogs, 23-14, in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, though, the Bulldogs held Wright in check for most of
the contest and sacked him four times. Wright completed 21 of 40
passes for 275 yards and two touchdowns, but he also threw two
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was one of the worst games I've had here,'' Wright
said. ``I've thought about it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright's recovery has Georgia thinking about him as well.

 &HT;    Decision day arrives for eager Browns fans
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NFL is expected to announce today the owner of the
resurrected Cleveland Browns franchise that will begin play next
season.
</P>
<P>
   The bid process continued Monday under a shroud of secrecy and
there were some reports that all candidates had submitted their
final proposals. Representatives from Goldman Sachs, the brokerage
house which has handled the bids for the league, consulted at least
once with members of the NFL's finance committee. It is unclear if
Goldman Sachs or the committee will make a recommendation to the
general membership at today's meeting in Chicago, but that was the
understanding of a few owners reached Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The league has been so clandestine in the closing stages of the
Browns auction that it remains unclear just how many candidates are
left. Three of the prospective owners _ Cleveland Indians owner
Richard Jacobs, Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs and toy
manufacturer Thomas Murdough _ removed themselves from
consideration last week.
</P>
<P>
   There are rumors that real estate developer Bart Wolstein also
has dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, it would leave only three groups which have
publicly acknowledged their candidacy: New York real estate tycoon
Howard Milstein, cable TV pioneers Larry and Charles Dolan, and
credit card magnate Al Lerner.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his Cleveland background and the presence of former
San Francisco 49ers president Carmen Policy in his group, Lerner,
who once owned 5 percent of the stock in the old Browns franchise,
is the unofficial favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The committee must present at least two finalists to the
membership, but that could be expanded. There are also reports that
there exists at least one candidate who has yet to be publicly
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that the franchise fee could approach $1 billion has
waned in recent days and the purchase price is now likely to be
between $550 million-$580 million.

 &HT;    Falcons spirits fly high after win against Panthers
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After further review, Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves on Monday
said that the 19-14 victory at Carolina was . . . still big.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the Falcons can and must play better against a
Philadelphia team that lost 38-0 at home against Seattle on Sunday.
The Falcons play the Eagles at 1 p.m. on Sunday in the Georgia
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   It might be impossible to overstate the Falcons' joy over
winning at Carolina, where they were 0-3, or the mental edge gained
by breaking an 11-year losing streak in road openers.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves and his staff find themselves in a position that has
been foreign to Falcon coaches during the years. They have to be
concerned about players taking the next opponent too lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest thing we have to concern ourselves with
this week,'' Reeves said. ``We have to get our feet back on the
ground, because there's not a team in this league that can't beat
you on a given Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the game and we feel really good about it, but
everything we accomplished on the road, if you lose a conference
game at home, is destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said offensive line coach Art Shell will continue to work
overtime with rookie right tackle Ephraim Salaam, who was involved
with Carolina linebacker Kevin Greene's three sacks. Part of the
problem came in poor communication along the line, and the Falcons
did a poor job picking up middle blitzes. Six of Carolina's sacks
came up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a really good job of hitting what we call the 'A
gap,' between the center and the guard,'' Reeves said. ``I'm sure
Philadelphia will see that on film, and even if they haven't tried
that before, they will now.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said he was pleased with the play of Falcons quarterback
Chris Chandler, who was named the overall MVP by the coaching
staff. Chandler completed 17-of-33 passes for 268 yards. He had
touchdown passes of 11 yards to Terance Mathis and 44 yards to Tim
Dwight. He was intercepted once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'd have a hard time making too big a deal out of
going into Carolina and winning,'' Chandler said. ``But whether
your next opponent is the defending Super Bowl champs or somebody
who didn't play as well as they would have liked, you always have
to guard against a letdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was not pleased with Atlanta's 11 penalties and three big
plays given up to the Carolina passing game.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have the opportunity on Sunday to get off to a 2-0
start for the first time since 1986. Atlanta was 4-0 12 years ago,
but won just three of 12, finishing 7-8-1, and missing the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The encouraging thing is we didn't play as well as we can, and
we won,'' Reeves said. ``But we've got to get better at some
things.''

TOURISM THRIVES, BUT PORTFOLIO JITTERS COULD QUIET THE BOOM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Mass., Md., Mich., Minn., Conn., N.C., S.C., Fla., Texas,
Nev., Hawaii, Calif.)   (jw) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The summer travel season ended Monday with expectations that it
had set another record and with forecasts of record tourism again
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit Travel Industry Association of America had
estimated that Americans would take 251 million trips this summer,
3 percent more than last year, and it has predicted a record 196
million travelers this fall, a 5 percent increase over last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But while the association's forecasts have generally been close,
since they take travel intentions as their measure of the
likelihood of travel, those intentions are unusually iffy now,
given the unpredictability of the economy, the unreliability of the
weather and the fickleness of would-be travelers.
</P>
<P>
   So projections for fall travel may be shaken by the same
uncertainty that bedeviled this summer's travel plans. Who, for
example, could have foreseen the Northwest Airlines strike, which
has affected about 150,000 passengers a day, including many
would-be tourists, since it began two weeks ago? Or who could have
predicted the recent stock market slide?
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street selloff could play a big role in fall travel.
Tourism in the autumn depends heavily on retirees and other older
people who prefer to travel then, when there are fewer crowds and
lower prices than in the summer, but who also pay particularly
close attention to swings in the market.
</P>
<P>
   While the Travel Industry Association has found a steady
increase over four years in the number of people who say they
intend to take children with them on vacation in the fall (40
percent this year), it has also found that travelers planning to
take the longest trips this fall will be ages 65 or older (15
nights average) and retired (14 nights).
</P>
<P>
   While 41 percent of respondents to the poll said they expected
to spend less than $500 each on fall pleasure trips, people on
their longest trips of the season planned to spend an average of
$871. But those averages appear likely to dwindle if travelers'
stock portfolios continue to decline.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, many cities and states had either a record or a robust
summer season, the result of a strong economy, low gasoline prices
and generally favorable weather.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Cod, for example, had a ``great summer,'' according to the
Falmouth Chamber of Commerce, helped by an influx of European
visitors. The $51 million in July room rental revenues in Ocean
City, Md., topped last year's July revenues by almost 10 percent
and exceeded the previous July record of $48 million, set in 1995.
Unseasonably warm weather beginning in April is expected to lead
Michigan to report a record number of summer visitors, while
similar good weather helped fill Minnesota's hotels, resorts and
campgrounds, and, tourism officials say, is likely to continue well
into the fall. Visitors to Connecticut this summer helped that
state take in $2.3 million more in hotel taxes than it collected
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Carolinas also attracted plenty of tourists this summer, at
least until Hurricane Bonnie forced the evacuation of visitors
along with residents late last month. An estimated 120,000 of the
200,000 people ordered to leave the coastal areas of Horry and
Georgetown counties in South Carolina were tourists, according to
Gov. David Beasley. North Carolina officials estimated that the
hurricane inflicted more than $1 billion in damage along the coast
and cost the state millions more in lost tourism revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hurricane Earl pounded Florida's Gulf Coast last week,
doing substantial damage, it departed before the crucial Labor Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Texas tourism, second in size only to that of California, had to
cope with sweltering heat in the Dallas area last month as well as
forest fires in Mexico earlier this summer that created smog
conditions and led to a statewide health alert.
</P>
<P>
   Like the smoke from Mexico's fires, the effects of Asia's
economic crisis were felt inside U.S. borders. Hardest hit was
Hawaii, which managed to attract 26,670 more visitors from the U.S.
mainland during June and July than it did in those months last
year, but lost 51,540 visitors from Asia (mostly Japan) over the
same months of comparison. August figures are not expected to show
any improvement.
</P>
<P>
   California also felt the effects of the Asian downturn, as did
even Las Vegas, Nev. _ although after it doubled its advertising
budget for the summer, to $5 million, the number of visitors in May
rose 1.3 percent over those last May, while June's visitor figures
rose 1.1 percent over those of the previous June. Preliminary
figures for July, which have not yet been compiled, indicate a
further gain over 1997, which itself saw a record 30.5 million
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were pretty modest increases,'' acknowledged Rob Powers,
public relations director for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors
Authority, ``but they marked a turnaround from the first quarter of
this year, when visitation was down a couple of percentage
points.'' His tone made it clear that in a city with 106,000 hotel
beds to fill each night, soon to rise to 126,000, even modest
increases are welcome.

 &HT;    King III, Jackson and Sharpton among speakers at Million Youth
rallyBy Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nowhere close to a million people, young or old,
showed up for Atlanta's first Million Youth Movement rally Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But it was quality, not quantity, organizers drew to an event
that often resembled a street party more than a political and
sociological movement.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the seven-block route along historic Auburn Avenue was
lined with vendors selling T-shirts, hair products and cold drinks
_ not demonstrators calling for economic, social and educational
equality.
</P>
<P>
   But the civil right leaders who preached hour after hour to the
crowd of 500 to 750 at the end of the block _ ``in the shadow of
Martin Luther King's grave'' _ were hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am inspired by the collective spirit of determination and
purpose that emanates throughout this gathering,'' said Martin
Luther King III, the oldest son of the slain civil rights leader
buried just a few yards away. ``I feel that tingling sense of
rejuvenation one feels when something great is about to happen.
Standing here with you right now, I feel the mighty blood of our
ancestors bonding with ours and bubbling up through the veins of
this collective body.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrap up event in Atlanta, fashioned after the Million Man
March and the Million Woman March, was a combination prayer
meeting, political rally and street party.
</P>
<P>
   At one end, speakers _ two as young at 9 and 11 years old _
rallied the audience, many of them crowding into small areas of
shade to escape the hot Labor Day sun radiating off the Auburn
Avenue blacktop.
</P>
<P>
   She was too short to see over the podium at a news conference
before the rally, just shyly telling reporters she was here for the
Million Youth Movement. But a few hours later, Illai Kenney, 9, of
Atlanta, boldly marched onto a stage in front of hundreds, stood in
a silent military salute for a few seconds before raising her fist
and repeatedly shouting ``Million Youth Movement!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a small soldier,'' Illai said.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the street, where the avenue passes under
the Downtown Connector, vendors stood behind tables of incense,
pie, jewelry, inspirational books, watermelon and Caribbean meat
pies.
</P>
<P>
   In between there were signs and T-shirts shouting messages of
anger and love or commemorating the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son of a field Negro,'' one T-shirt read. Nearby, another
T-shirt wearer suggested, ``Let God be your guide.'' A woman
carrying a jar of condoms wore a T-shirt proclaiming that
``stopping AIDS is my mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists with the Socialist Workers Campaign handed out
leaflets in front of a sign that urged people ``protest the U.S.
bombings in Afghanistan and Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   About 50 singing young people marched behind a banner announcing
the movement past a sign demanding ``stop police brutality. It's
all one attack. Refuse and resist.''
</P>
<P>
   While mothers, organizers and ``elders''_ veteran civil rights
leaders _ hoped the young people would get a deeper meaning out of
the day, many teenagers used the street gathering as an opportunity
to flirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids now have it so easy,'' said Tracy Marshall of Atlanta
as her 3-year-old decorated her ball cap with leaves she picked
from a tree. ``They don't know what kind of struggle we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to her 11-year-old daughter, Marshall said, ``I think
she'll remember that she marched, that this was her first actual
march for a cause. Normally, were' getting up on a holiday and
going to the park and cooking out. Not this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the violent clash that came between New York
City police and some attending a similar demonstration in Harlem
Saturday, The Rev. Jesse Jackson stressed the effectiveness of
non-violent protests much like the ones led by King in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're marching today, I urge you to be non-violent and
disciplined,'' said Jackson. ``Non-violence is a powerful tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the youths should be ``sober and sane,'' they
should turn away from drugs and become politically active by
registering and voting and forcing a change in Congress. He said
they should demand that lawmakers spend more money building schools
and less on prisons and focus on disparities in laws that seem to
punish black law-breakers more severely than white criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton continued that theme when he spoke. ``We
need to march until we all have jobs,'' he said. ``We need to move
from building prisons and closing schools to closing prisons and
building schools.''

 &HT;    Powerful Mott foundation, U.S. Sugar make odd partners
 &HT;    By Jennifer Peltz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEWISTON, Fla. _ Meet the United States Sugar Corp., the
small-town company that's one of America's biggest producers of
sugar and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the physical and spiritual heart of this city on
the southern end of Lake Okeechobee in Florida. Clewiston is glad
to be a company town: U.S. Sugar employs 3,100 people and pays an
average of $34,000 a year in a region where the land is rich but
many people are poor.
</P>
<P>
   Now meet U.S. Sugar's quiet but important partner, 1,100 miles
away in Flint, Mich., the home of General Motors Corp.'s Buick
division.
</P>
<P>
   People there measure prosperity not by the cars they drive but
by the cars they build. And much as nearly everything in Clewiston
bears the stamp of U.S. Sugar, nearly everything in Flint bears the
stamp of General Motors and an early G.M. investor named Charles
Stewart Mott.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Flint is the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation,
the country's 15th-largest enterprise of its kind as of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Mott foundation gives away up to $72 million a year, gets
the president's attention and sits on $58 million worth of U.S.
Sugar stock, making the charity one of the sugar company's biggest
stockholders. Those holdings also make the sugar company stock one
of the charity's biggest assets.
</P>
<P>
   The two entities even share a chairman. But at times, their
interests conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most curious relationships possible,'' says
Nathaniel Reed, a Florida environmental activist and former
assistant secretary of the interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can close your eyes and say, `For the greater good of our
foundation grants, I close my eyes' '' to the source of the money,
Reed said. ``And a lot of damage has been done to the world by
wonderful people who close their eyes for a variety of reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   While the foundation pledged $16.5 million this decade to
``prevention of toxic pollution,'' the company paid a record $3.7
million fine for dumping hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
   While the foundation put $630,000 into preserving South
America's Pantanal, the world's largest freshwater wetland, the
company put up $10 million to fight a proposed tax to preserve
Florida's great freshwater wetland, the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   While the foundation spent $180,000 to reduce pollution from
farms, the company balked at suggestions that farmers should pay
the bulk of the bill for cleaning up phosphorus pollution heading
to the Everglades. Scientists say the biggest source of the
phosphorus is the sugar-growing region south of Lake Okeechobee.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sugar says it's doing its best for the environment, adding
that it already has spent $31 million on Everglades restoration.
Still, the Everglades debate puts the company at odds with some of
the same organizations the Mott foundation supports.
</P>
<P>
   In a June letter to President Clinton, the Sierra Club's
executive director blasted the ``Mott family'' for U.S. Sugar's
position in the Everglades _ though the Mott foundation reports it
has given the Sierra Club $1.5 million during the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental activists have asked the foundation directly
for help with the Everglades; in part because of its business
interests, the foundation said no.
</P>
<P>
   All this puts William S. White in a rather hot seat, since he
both runs the Mott foundation and chairs U.S. Sugar's board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't be human,'' he said, ``if you didn't feel a
little anxiety when, on the one hand, you're funding someone and on
the next hand, another part of their organization is bopping you on
the head.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mott foundation has a fortune of more than $1.9 billion,
according to its latest annual report. Its beneficiaries range from
``an organization that explores the fundamental global issues of
our times'' to a ``fledgling network of 60 knitters.''
</P>
<P>
   A Senate committee has consulted its chairman on rebuilding
inner cities. Both former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and former
Vice President Dan Quayle were interviewed for its 1995 annual
report. This year, Clinton gave a press conference to announce the
foundation's ``astonishing'' $55 million pledge to improve
after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   This all stems from a struggling wire-wheel company in Utica,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stewart Mott was born in 1875 into the family
responsible for Mott's applesauce and apple juice, though those
ties have been severed.
</P>
<P>
   Mott became a mechanical engineer, joined his uncle's wheel
company and quickly started making axles for a promising new
product: automobiles. He moved the company to Flint to be closer to
his customers at Buick. Then he sold his axle business for stock in
a fledgling company called General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   By World War II, he was considered one of the richest men in
America, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. By the time he
died, at age 97, his fortune was estimated at $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he bought a bankrupt sugar-farming outfit deep in
Florida and turned it into U.S. Sugar, now a $430 million-a-year
business.
</P>
<P>
   He also created the Mott foundation and gave it much of his
fortune, including a 50 percent stake in U.S. Sugar, said White _
who also is C.S. Mott's grandson-in-law. He said the foundation
later sold some of its stock to the employee stock plan and gave
some to other charities, mostly the Mott Children's Health Center,
a Flint hospital that started as part of the foundation but became
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the foundation and the health center each own 15 to 20
percent of the company, White said. That puts them second only to
thousands of current and former workers who got stock through the
employee plan when the workers are counted as a group.
</P>
<P>
   The sugar stock was the foundation's most valuable asset as
recently as 1996, but White said it's now second to the
foundation's holdings in General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every man is in partnership with the rest of the human race in
the eternal conquest which we call civilization,'' Mott once
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the numbers, no one denies they add up to a significant
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. Sugar, the Mott stake means stockholders who ``bring
their values'' to the boardroom, Vice President Robert Buker said.
``They're concerned about the bottom line. But they'll say, `What
is our commitment to the community?' ''
</P>
<P>
   For the foundation, White said, it means a special concern for
the Glades.
</P>
<P>
   The Mott foundation spends more money on relieving poverty than
on anything else, its reports show. It makes a point of beginning
that charity at home in Flint, which has suffered alongside the
auto industry since the 1970s. The foundation has put nearly $82
million into Flint in this decade alone.
</P>
<P>
   In its 72 years, the foundation has spent a total of only $1.2
million in the Glades, where the 1990 Census found virtually the
same conditions as in Flint: About a third of the population lives
in poverty; 40 percent of the adults didn't finish high school; the
average household gets by on about $25,000 a year, a full quarter
less than the average for Palm Beach County. And in 1994, U.S.
Sugar's decision to stop vegetable farming in the Glades led to 40
percent unemployment in the already poor city of South Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Mott's $1.2 million went to the Glades Community Development
Corp., which aims to improve an area of 43,000 people, according to
the Census. The foundation spent about as much in three years in
one Flint neighborhood of 6,300.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can probably criticize us and say, `Why the hell haven't
you done more?' '' in the Glades, White acknowledged. ``It could
use more money.''
</P>
<P>
   But here's what else the Mott foundation has done for the
Glades, White said: build U.S. Sugar into a ``good corporate
citizen'' in the area where 85 percent of its workers live. The
company itself gave more than $1 million to schools, youth groups
and health care organizations, most of them local, in 1996, the
last year for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sugar also led its industry in improving working conditions
for the thousands of West Indians who used to cut Florida's sugar
cane by hand, agreeing in 1992 to make changes while other growers
kept fighting lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sugar officials say they've been leaders in the Everglades'
restoration. But there's some disagreement about that.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration aims to cut the phosphorus, a natural
fertilizer, coming into the Everglades. Government studies show the
bulk of it washes off the Glades farming region.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers say they're doing their part. They're paying at least
$233 million toward building $763 million worth of marshes to
filter the water, selling the government the land for the marshes
and limiting the phosphorus leaving their farms _ ahead of schedule
so far.
</P>
<P>
   At U.S. Sugar, ``we're in business to produce crops and make a
living, but we're also doing things to protect the environment,''
President J. Nelson Fairbanks said. ``We would do anything we
thought we could afford that we thought was necessary to save the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But some environmental activists say the growers need to do more
because the farms are responsible for so much of the phosphorus and
have drawn on South Florida's government-built canals for
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Mott foundation could come in, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Some activists _ including representatives of the Florida
Audobon Society, the World Wildlife Fund and Save Our Everglades _
say they and colleagues have asked the Mott foundation to try to
change U.S. Sugar's positions on sticking points in the Everglades
plans. Others say they've asked the foundation to give money to
Everglades efforts.
</P>
<P>
   All say they got nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, you'd think that someone who's made that much money
from the people and from the land would be willing to put some
money back into preserving the land,'' fumed Save Our Everglades
chief Mary Barley.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. Sugar's chairman, White says the company is trying its
best.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mott foundation's chairman, he says there's not much he
can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Give money? ``A lot of people would look at it as tainted money
or conflict of interest,'' he said. Besides, he noted, the money
promised so far hasn't stopped the battles.
</P>
<P>
   Change company positions? Even as chairman of the board, ``I
cannot tell (the management), `Go do this,' '' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Many foundation managers debate whether the way they earn their
money conflicts with the way they spend it, charity experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Some organizations decide only to invest in companies they
consider socially responsible or environmentally friendly. But many
others feel that just makes it harder to make the money they're
going to give away.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as Fairbanks, the U.S. Sugar president, puts it: ``If
it weren't for business and the profits of business, there would be
no charity.''

 &HT;    Eccentric Mott kept costs down
 &HT;    By Jennifer Peltz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Charles Stewart Mott once, the story
goes, changed a 30-watt refrigerator bulb to 15 watts to save
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   That might not have been unusual for someone who'd endured the
Great Depression. But Mott, creator of what became the country's
15th-largest charitable foundation, was then considered one of the
richest men in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he prized simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   He had left his father's cider business in 1900 to make one of
America's legendary automotive fortunes. But he made his own home a
working farm _ and insisted his family eat all the homegrown
produce before buying any.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this house wants yellow tomato juice, it had better make it
during the season,'' he once decreed, according to a family history
published by the University of Michigan at Flint.
</P>
<P>
   But C.S. Mott was as generous as he was thrifty _ and, perhaps
not surprising, thrifty about the business of being generous.
During his time, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation roosted in an
office with obviously patched carpet; the office manager had to buy
his own air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a fortune valued at $300 million, C.S. Mott left his
family a commitment to charity. His widow, his six children and
several of his grandchildren themselves became philanthropists.
</P>
<P>
   Their interests range but have common themes _ like promoting
peace and revitalizing Flint, said William White, C.S. Mott's
grandson-in-law and the current head of the Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation. It remains the largest of the family's philanthropies.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best known of C.S. Mott's descendants is son
Stewart Rawlings Mott. He considers himself the family's ``black
sheep, maverick, whatever you want to call it'' for his liberal
politics and flamboyant style. But in some ways, he didn't fall far
from the Mott family tree.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Mott has given away half his income for decades, but
he's been known to do it from an apartment with peeling paint and
rundown furniture. It was a Park Avenue penthouse, yes, but he grew
his own vegetables and raised his own chickens on the roof (to the
dismay of his neighbors, who eventually had a court order him to
stick to his own terrace. He moved.)
</P>
<P>
   His plunges into politics are not surprising for the son of a
three-time Flint mayor. But father and son were more than six
decades apart in age and just as far in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talked to (C.S. Mott), the veteran of the
Spanish-American War, about laying down our nuclear weapons with
the enemy, he thought I was wacko,'' Stewart Mott said. ``My father
just found me too argumentative.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so, he said, that he wasn't welcome at his father's
foundation. So he carved out his own brand of philanthropy: part
giving money, part raising it; part politics; and part just plain
party.
</P>
<P>
   He gave hefty donations to the presidential campaigns of Eugene
McCarthy, George McGovern and later, John Anderson. His $400,000
contribution made him McGovern's most generous supporter and earned
him a spot on the Nixon White House's enemies list. He mounted his
own campaign to stop the Vietnam War from Washington to the General
Motors Corp. boardroom, where he criticized the company that made
his fortune for not speaking out against the war.
</P>
<P>
   But ``I wasn't crusading against my father,'' Stewart Mott said.
``No way. I was just going a different path.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides high-profile work, there was high-profile play, like his
40th birthday party in New York in 1977, which he still talks
about. The former Columbia drama student asked his 680 guests to
dress in Medieval garb and staged his own script of a King Arthur
legend.
</P>
<P>
   For a 1983 party to celebrate his work in Washington, he urged
guests to ride an elephant on the sidewalk and wear gold sashes
emblazoned with a French saying that means, roughly, ``Shame on
those who think badly of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 61 and living mostly in North Salem, N.Y., Stewart Mott has
stayed largely out of the limelight in recent years. But he said he
still gives $750,000 to $800,000 a year to organizations promoting
peace, population control, government reform and civil rights.

 &HT;    Foundation has hand in Glades welfare work
 &HT;    By Jennifer Peltz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLE GLADE, Fla. _ In 62 years, the Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation has spent $1.1 million in the sugar-farming area that
provides much significant share of the foundation's money.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the $1.1 million went to an all-around-improvement
group called the Glades Community Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The community has obvious needs for affordable homes, jobs,
health care and encouragement for young people. But Unlike most
community development corporations, this one doesn't build
affordable housing. And it doesn't build business centers,
administer a health clinic or run an after-school program.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the GCDC deliberately doesn't run anything, organizers
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that it would limit us,'' board member Paul Allen
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it aims to marry homegrown plans to help the Glades
with the money and expertise to make the plans work, said Executive
Director Autrie Moore Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The organization bought a van for $120,000, for instance, so the
county health department could send doctors to people who couldn't
get to doctors' offices, Moore Williams said. It got started
getting Head Start instructors to show parents what children need
to know for kindergarten, then it helped Head Start get government
money to keep showing them. And it gave rehearsal space and support
, time and enthusiasm to a local history play.
</P>
<P>
   this spring that organizers hope to turn into an ongoing
theatrical attraction.
</P>
<P>
   For this, the 8-year-old GCDC has gotten at least $3.1 million
from Mott and other foundations, records and tax returns show. In
the past two years, the group has gotten 55 percent of all the
charitable money directed to the Glades, in the past two years,
according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
   But some question the organization's approach. The Hague-based
Bernard Van Leer Foundation stopped financing it. The Van Leer
Foundation had given $750,000 during the eight years but dropped
out partly because it wanted more programs to help children and
families, said Hubert Schruers, a Van Leer administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Not so at the Mott foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our money was well spent,'' said Jack Litzenberg, an
administrator. ``I don't care what their accomplishments are _ at
least they have a forum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mott foundation's only other gifts to the Glades were two
small grants, totaling $1,100, in Clewiston in the early 1970s. But
administrators say it has spent $7.6 million in Florida over the
years, including:
</P>
<P>
   $2.1 million since 1967 to create the Center for Community
Education and endow a professorship in the field at Florida
Atlantic University.in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   $100,000 last year to the Business &AMP; Economic Development &AMP;
Revitalization Corp., a Riviera Beach group.planning to manage a
complex of small businesses in the former Spanish Courts motel.
</P>
<P>
   $50,000 in 1985 to a garment-making cooperative in Indiantown.
</P>
<P>
   $45,000 to help get the Community Foundation of Palm Beach and
Martin Counties running in the mid-1980s.

 &HT;    Internet the latest frontier where candidates reach voters
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Used to be in Georgia politics, a stump speech from
the back of a flatbed truck was the preferred way to reach voters.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, candidates rely more on software platforms and Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's predicting the end of political TV ads anytime soon,
but strategists say the Internet is already an important campaign
tool, and they expect its role to expand in the future. In Georgia
this year, every major candidate for governor, lieutenant governor
and the U.S. Senate has a home on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed by how far it's come in two (election) cycles,''
said Tony Fabrizio, the pollster for Republican gubernatorial
candidate Guy Millner.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why candidates like the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional news coverage, the Internet allows candidates
to give their views in an unfiltered context, without having to
answer questions from reporters or voters. And the cost
considerations that limit TV commercials to 30 or 60 seconds don't
apply, so Web pages can include more detailed positions on issues.
</P>
<P>
   For voters, the Internet is a fast way to find out things that
candidates want them to know, although it provides no way to pin
candidates down on subjects they wish to avoid. So far, there is no
evidence that a significant number of voters are actually making up
their minds on the basis of campaign Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a persuasive medium in my opinion,'' said Raymond
Strother, a veteran media consultant who is working for Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Roy Barnes. ``I don't think anybody gets
any votes because of their Web content.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Strother's skepticism, the Barnes campaign has the most
comprehensive Web site of any Georgia candidate this year. In
addition to positions on issues and news clips, it allows surfers
with the proper technology to download copies of campaign TV
commercials. There's even a camera, stationed in the Barnes
campaign headquarters, that allows internet visitors to observe
staffers in action.
</P>
<P>
   Since the name of a candidate's campaign committee must be
featured in every TV and radio ad, Barnes named his committee after
his Web site. That way, when he gives the required information, he
is also plugging his site (barnesgovernor.org).
</P>
<P>
   The site is run by Barnes' 24-year-old son, Harlan, who holds a
degree in computer business from Furman University. ``This is a way
I can use my talents and help my dad,'' said Harlan Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   According to a counter on the site, more than 28,000 people have
visited the Barnes campaign page since it was started about a year
ago. While that number does not suggest the kind of traffic likely
to turn an election, Harlan Barnes said the site has been
especially valuable in keeping supporters informed about the
progress of the campaign, as if they were attending a virtual fish
fry every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very good tool for our campaign,'' admits Strother.
</P>
<P>
   Millner has had a Web address for months, but he recently hired
Intellimedia Commerce, a company that has designed sites for major
corporations like Value Jet and Heineken beer, to upgrade it. The
site (guymillner98.org) now boasts slick graphics, photos of
Millner on the campaign trail, and his positions on various issues.
</P>
<P>
   Millner's site does not have a counter, but Fabrizio believes
visits to all campaign sites will pick up between now and the Nov.
3 election.
</P>
<P>
   When Fabrizio worked for Republican Bob Dole's presidential
campaign in 1996, he advised Dole to recite his Web address during
a televised debate with President Clinton. In the next 24 hours,
Fabrizio said, the Dole Web page received ``several million'' hits,
causing several system crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Fabrizio believes younger voters are especially inclined to turn
to the Web for political information, just as they look there to
read movie reviews or purchase CDs. For that reason, he believes
the use of the Internet by campaigns will only increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole segment of the population, when they want to
get information, they get it instantaneously over the Web,''
Fabrizio said. ``You are communicating with them in their chosen
medium.''

SECURITY EXPERTS ASSESSING U.S. EMBASSIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alarmed by evidence that terrorists are planning
new attacks on U.S. embassies, the administration has dispatched
counterterrorism experts to diplomatic missions around the world to
determine if any are so vulnerable that they should be shuttered
immediately, administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The officials add that terrorists believed to be associated with
Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi accused of orchestrating the
bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa last month, are
surveying other embassies in preparation for a new round of
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The officials are convinced that terrorists allied with bin
Laden were prepared last month to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Tirana,
Albania. The embassy was hastily closed on Aug. 14 as a result of
intelligence reports showing that it had been selected by Muslim
fundamentalists for attack. The officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, say the attack was foiled with the help of Albanian
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the embassy in Kuwait warned Americans that terrorists
may be planning attacks there similar to the bombings on Aug. 7 in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. U.S. embassies in
Ghana and Togo were also temporarily closed last week in response
to perceived terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said that the White House and the
State Department are expected to submit a formal request to
Congress this week for between $1 billion and $3 billion to build
new embassies to replace those in Kenya and Tanzania, and to pay
for emergency security improvements at embassies around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. officials have publicly predicted that bin Laden
will try to retaliate for the U.S. air strike on what the
administration has described as his terrorist training camp in
Afghanistan. That attack and another in the Sudan were ordered by
President Clinton in response to the bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania, which he blamed on bin Laden and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can predict, with some certainty, that we will see
a reaction by bin Laden and his organization,'' FBI Director Louis
Freeh said last week. He termed the threat of attacks on Americans
by bin Laden's followers ``about as serious and imminent a threat
as I can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the State Department issued a ``worldwide caution'' to
U.S. travelers that ``terrorists, including Osama bin Laden,
continue their threats against the United States and have not
distinguished between military and civilian targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the East Africa bombings, the administration sent
counterterrorism specialists and other investigators from the State
Department, the Pentagon and the CIA to inspect embassies and
consulates around the world to determine which were most
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the specialists are expected to
report back to Washington shortly with suggestions on how to
tighten security _ in some cases by abandoning embassy buildings
that are considered especially dangerous and relocating employees.
</P>
<P>
   If an embassy is closed and no other suitable space is
available, they said, U.S. diplomats may be asked to work in mobile
metal-framed structures that can transported from the United States
aboard military cargo planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to repeat Nairobi,'' said a State Department
official.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy in Kenya was built in 1981 on a central thoroughfare
in the heart of the capital. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell had
considered the location so vulnerable that she had cabled the State
Department twice in the months before the bombing to request that
the embassy be relocated. The request was denied for budgetary
reasons.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The embassy in Tanzania had been considered less vulnerable,
both because it is situated outside the center city and because of
better design. Neither embassy, however, met current security
standards.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said the specialists sent abroad last
month would probably recommend that at least a handful of embassies
and consulates be relocated immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Such recommendations, they said, reflect a change in the
thinking of security experts within the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once upon a time, you wouldn't worry so much about embassy
security in a nation like Kenya, which has no history of
terrorism,'' an official said. ``You worried about places like
Beirut and Cairo. The bombings last month proved that we now have
to worry about security everywhere. And we do have some embassies
that are very exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials would not identify which embassies or
consulates might be shuttered, although several large embassies
around the world are well known among U.S. diplomats as especially
vulnerable because they are located close to the street, making
them easy targets for a car bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Other embassies are known to be at special risk because of their
proximity to power plants or gasoline stations.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for example, which was
shut down for routine operations last month because of a terrorist
threat, is next to a gasoline station. After the East Africa
bombings, the embassy paid the owner of the station to shut it
down. Malaysian newspapers reported that the gasoline and diesel
fuel stored in the station's underground tanks was drained out.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the State Department had not settled on a
final figure in the request to Congress for new construction and
security improvements, but that the total would come to between $1
billion and $3 billion. The money should allow security at some
embassies to be raised to the standards set by the State Department
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the department was given less than one-third of
the money needed to modify or build embassies meeting those
standards, which were recommended in 1985 by a panel led by Bobby
Inman, a retired admiral and the former deputy director of Central
Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was formed in response to the bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Beirut in 1984 and the bombing the year before of the
U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut; the two attacks killed more than
250 people.

PARLIAMENT AGAIN REJECTS YELTSIN PICK, SETTING UP SHOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With time running out as the Russian economy spins out
of control, political leaders clashed again Monday over a new
government, as parliament rejected President Boris N. Yeltsin's
choice for prime minister a second time.
</P>
<P>
   The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, shook off the
Kremlin's last-minute appeal, voting 273-138 against acting Prime
Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. The vote, the Duma's second
rejection of Chernomyrdin over the past week, sets up what is
likely to be a final showdown between Russia's warring political
factions.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble plummeted as low as 30 to the dollar before trading on
the Moscow currency exchange was canceled because no one wanted to
sell dollars. The Central Bank set an official rate of 18.9 rubles
to the dollar that is bound to fall as soon as trading resumes. The
Russian currency traded at 6.3 to the dollar before Aug. 17, when
the government abandoned its defense of the ruble and defaulted on
its payments to treasury bill holders.
</P>
<P>
   If Yeltsin asks the Duma to vote on Chernomyrdin a third time _
and all indications are that the aging but ever-combative Kremlin
chief will _ then after a third ``no'' vote, Yeltsin would dismiss
parliament and force early elections. As the Russian economy
rapidly implodes, few commentators dare predict what would happen
next. But with no government, and no parliament, it is unclear how
Russia would right its wobbly ship of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone clearly wants store shelves with nothing on them and
people massing in the streets,'' a visibly angry Chernomyrdin said
after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncertainty,'' acting deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov,
the author of Chernomyrdin's draft economic rescue package, told
the Globe when asked what he expected now. ``More weeks of
uncertainty. After that, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ruble has plunged, prices have soared and banks have all
but closed their doors, leaving angry depositors wondering if they
will ever see their money. A plan by the Central Bank to guarantee
people's deposits by transferring them to the state-owned savings
bank, Sberbank, has yielded even more panic and distrust.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Central Bank's chairman, Sergei Dubinin, who had
just months ago vowed that the ruble would remain stable, offered
to resign. Yeltsin, who had vowed the same thing but has refused
calls that he step down, indicated that Dubinin's resignation would
be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma's vote against Chernomyrdin followed last-minute
``round-table'' talks between Yeltsin and parliament leaders that
failed to yield a compromise. Duma leaders demanded that Yeltsin
name a candidate they found more acceptable, like Moscow Mayor Yury
Luzhkov or Acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov. Yeltsin
insisted that Chernomyrdin was his man. Neither side appeared ready
to budge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The table wasn't even round,'' quipped Ekho Radio political
commentator Andrei Cherkisov. ``It was square, with sharp edges.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Duma, Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister from 1992 to
this March and the man many Russians blame &UR;  &LR; for the current crisis,
pleaded with lawmakers that this was no time for political
struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all standing at the edge,'' the burly acting premier
said. ``It is time for action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't even understand the program he has proposed,''
countered Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin and Fyodorov have advocated printing money to pay
off the Russian government's debts to workers, investors, and
industry before streamlining taxes, bankrupting insolvent firms,
and switching to a tight-spending system in which a convertible
ruble would be pegged to the country's dollar and gold reserves.
The plan has been criticized by Russian and Western economists as a
political compromise aimed at wooing the Duma while reassuring
Western creditors that Russia is still heading toward a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with this Monday, Fyodorov said ``any sensible person
would understand that this is the only way out.''
</P>
<P>
   We may never know. The plan cannot go into effect until a new
government is approved.
</P>
<P>
   Past Duma history does offer one way out. In all its recent
votes on government in the past, the lower house has voted ``no''
twice then backed down, to avoid being dissolved. But there are
signs the Duma may not go that route this time. A committee is
preparing to formally open impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin,
charging that the Russian president broke the law when he helped
bring about the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, when he sent
tanks to force parliament into submission in 1993, and when he
ordered the army into the breakaway southern Russian region of
Chechnya in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's 1993 Constitution makes it hard for the Duma to impeach
Yeltsin, but once proceedings have begun, the president can no
longer dismiss the house.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawmakers want Yeltsin to back down on Chernomyrdin and
appoint Luzhkov, a tough-talking populist who has gained the
reputation among Muscovites, and some Western business executives,
as a man who gets things done. Others see Luzhkov as a dangerous
demogogue whose army of City Hall bureaucrats extract exorbitant
``fees'' from businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luzhkov has legalized racketeering in Moscow,'' said Masha
Gessen of Itogi magazine. ``The city has prospered despite its
mayor, rather than because of him.''
</P>
<P>
   At least, it was prospering, once. Moscow on Monday was a city
caught in a time warp between the consumerism of recent years and
the post-Communist shortages of the beginning of the decade.
Television advertisements pitched laundry detergents and women's
hygiene products that were missing from store shelves, the last
stocks having sold out in the panic-buying of the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely bargains appeared, and disappeared, as sellers tried to
adjust prices to the nosediving ruble. At one store, imported
toilet paper was more expensive than a jar of black caviar. Russian
car makers were slow to raise their ruble sticker prices, resulting
in a miniature auto-buying boom as Muscovites rushed to unload
their fast-devaluing rubles. Moskvich, makers of a car Russians
generally avoid and virtually bankrupt for most of the decade,
enjoyed brisk sales with their latest models priced to move at the
ruble equivalent of just over $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   But for most consumers, the ruble's inexorable plunge, and
prices' inevitable rise, was very bad news. The Interfax news
agency noted that the minimum wage of 83 rubles and 49 kopecks,
$4.42 at Tuesday's official exchange rate, buys just a quart of
cooking oil, two cans of stewed meat, and one loaf of white bread.
Many food prices have quadrupled to offset the fall of the ruble,
which has lost two-thirds of its value since Aug. 17, and staple
items are beginning to disappear from store shelves as Muscovites,
fearing shortages ahead, stock up.

 &HT;    The fun of pregnancy is long gone
 &HT;    By Maureen Downey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I once loved being pregnant. During my first two
pregnancies, I felt terrific, prancing through step aerobics until
month eight and never experiencing a moment of queasiness.
</P>
<P>
   That was before I became pregnant with twins, due at the end of
the year. Now, I'm cranky, nauseated, achy and out of breath after
a flight of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I complain about a new ailment, about every 30 seconds,
Bo reminds me, ``You love being pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   I feel guilty about griping because these babies are such a gift
after three pregnancy losses in three years. Twins are a bonus, a
tribute to the power of prayer and a good infertility specialist.
</P>
<P>
   So I confine the whining to Bo, who has soldiered through my
daily litany with good cheer. ``What's it today?'' he asks.
``Varicose veins or heartburn?''
</P>
<P>
   He's blown some crucial tests, though. When I mentioned my
desire for sherbet, he got some. A pint. To a woman eating for
three, a pint is not enough. A pint looks like what you get on a
little plastic spoon when they give you a free taste at Gorin's.
</P>
<P>
   The right to sherbet on demand is one of the few advantages that
this condition provides. I also get to retire to my bedroom when
it's time to wash dishes, feed cats, run baths and put the older
children to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Bo is already having a hard time managing himself and the
household, but I know he'll rise to the occasion when I follow
doctor's orders and get more bed rest _ at the Ritz-Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   Just count me among the happy
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes you get what you ask for. And sometimes God
sees you and raises you one.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted another child. We're getting twins.
</P>
<P>
   At my advanced age of 43 I'm going to be a father again. Twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe the lengths that you will go to just to get a
column,'' says one associate, overestimating how much I had to say
about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen is distressed by the changes in her body. ``Look at this
stomach!'' she complains. I try to reassure her. ``Look at that
bodacious balcony!'' I say. She's not comforted.
</P>
<P>
   What is there to say? I'm happily terrified, anticipating a 100
percent increase in noses to wipe and stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem out of the ordinary to be doubling our total
infant output. I'm one of five. (And I'm the Protestant in this
marriage.)
</P>
<P>
   But my parents had theirs all at once. Maureen and I have
followed a looser schedule. When my oldest is packing her bags for
college, the twins will be packing their X-Men lunch boxes. I'll be
hobbling into class to meet their first-grade teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter Molly, 10, has promised her full support. On a handmade
calendar, she is marking off each day as the due date approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Son Austin, 7, has announced firmly that he's not giving up his
room.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK, they can stay in my room for a while. I've been
blessed before, and I am blessed again. Any response from me is
inadequate to this situation.
</P>
<P>
   So I'll just say thank you, Maureen. Thank you, doctors. And
thank you, God.

 &HT;    More isn't Lear-y of 50ish women
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When More debuts today, the magazine aimed at women older than
40 will face more obstacles than overcrowded newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   The bimonthly from Ladies' Home Journal will have to convince
Madison Avenue to rethink its focus on 18- to 35-year-olds.
Advertisers' obsession with the youth market is one reason other
magazines for older women, such as Lear's and Moxie, failed and
Mirabella shifted to a younger format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lear's started 10 years too soon,'' says More's 50-something
editor in chief, Myrna Blyth. ``Baby boomers were not turning 50
every eight seconds the way they are now. By 2010, the largest
segment of the population will be between 45 and 64. These people
have always been self-indulgent, and there's no reason to think
they will change their spending habits.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why More ($2.95) is targeting affluent women of a certain
age with sophisticated tastes. The debut issue, with Cybill
Shepherd on the cover, features some of the same fashion, beauty
and health topics as Ladies' Home Journal. The difference is the
age of the women. No one in the magazine is younger than 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this magazine,'' says Blyth, who will also remain as editor
of Ladies' Home Journal, ``we're focusing on women who have adult
kids, who are looking for new relationships in their 40s and 50s.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the profile of Shepherd, More reports on the
shattered marriage of Georgia Ann Waller, ex-wife of the author of
``The Bridges of Madison County,'' and talks with Tipper Gore about
turning 50. Other articles include an update on Viagra users, an
advice column called ``Ask Mrs. Robinson'' and a fall fashion
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Other magazines for More's age group are in the planning stages
at Hearst and Time Inc., but testing is not expected to begin until
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a market there when you look at the
demographics,'' says Martin Walker, chairman of Walker
Communications, a New York magazine consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Walker attributes the failure of Lear's to an inexperienced
editor and blames Mirabella's problems on a lack of corporate
support.
</P>
<P>
   More has a good chance of success, Walker says, because of
Blyth's editorial experience and Meredith Corp.'s deep pockets. As
for advertisers, he says, there is no shortage of products for
women in their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   With a 400,000 initial press run, Blyth says response to test
issues has been encouraging. And, with Meredith's 16 million name
database, she says More has a leg up on other magazines that
started from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But will women older than 40 want to be reminded of their fading
youth? Blyth thinks attitudes have changed. ``These women used to
feel they had few options. Their attractiveness was going, their
fertility was gone. Now they know they have lots of choices. And
we're going to give them more.''

 &HT;    Singing sensation Usher discusses his life and his music in a
Teen People
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most young men look forward to their voices changing. Not Usher.
The 19-year-old Lilburn, Ga. entertainer tells Teen People ($2.99)
it was ``the most tragic thing that has ever happened to me.''
Usher had landed a record contract at 14, but halfway through the
recording of his debut album, he hit puberty, his voice deepened,
and his record producers began to doubt his abilities as a singer.
The record failed to do well on the charts, but Usher hired a
stylist and choreographer, worked out to shed his baby fat, and
gained confidence with his looks and moves. Now, with a
chart-topping album ``My Way,'' and a role in the upcoming sci-fi
film, ``The Faculty,'' he has become a hot star _ deep voice and
all.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE NEWS:
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the boys of summer a hot topic, so are the bears of
summer. Time ($2.95) questions whether the plummeting economies of
Asia and Russia will lead to a lenghty slump for U.S. markets. And,
in a 60-second symposium, Time asks a panel of baseball greats, who
they would least like to see coming to the plate _ Sammy Sosa or
Mark McGwire. Says Atlanta Brave John Smoltz: ``That is like
choosing your way to die. I would rather be trying to kick a 50-yd.
field goal.'' On a more serious question, the magazine polled
members of Congress to ask what action they would take against
President Clinton. Most were noncommital, but 57 Republicans said
Cliinton should resign.. . . In Newsweek ($2.95), the focus was on
Mark (McGwire), not Monica (Lewinsky). George Will praises this
baseball season as the best ever and Hank Aaron says he relates to
the pressure McGwire and Sosa are facing in their home run chase
for the record. But Aaron recalls a different type of pressure when
he was closing in on Babe Ruth's all-time home run record. ``I
received over 900,000 pieces of mail that year,''Aaron writes,
``much of it threatening and laced with the ugliest of epithets.''
</P>
<P>
   SMART SET:
</P>
<P>
   Americans seem obsessed with lists, even when they are
frivolous. Random House's recent selection of the 100 Greatest
Books of the Century was, well, random at best. But it still
generated a gusher of publicity for the publisher's Modern Library
series. Now Mirabella ($3) has compiled an arbitrary list of the 25
smartest women, from actress Jodie Foster to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. Others include Barbara Walters, singer Shawn
Colvin, author Doris Kearns Goodwin and New York Times book critic
Michiko Kakutani. As part of the feature, the magazine asked 50
prominent women if they would reveal their SAT scores. Only CNN's
Willow Bay agreed to tell hers: 710 math, 760 verbal.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN THE GARDEN PATH:
</P>
<P>
   There's good news for visitors to Callaway Gardens, Ga. In the
September issue of Southern Living ($4.95), Chairman Bo Callaway
explains that the Georgia resort is making changes to prevent
traffic jams caused by motorists stopping to view the sights. By
the year 2000, Callaway says, tourists can leave their cars at the
new Virginia Hand Callway Discovery Center and walk to the Azalea
Bowl and other sites. Bicycles, trolleys and boats will be
available for farther destinations.
</P>
<P>
   BIRDS OF PREY:
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Hitchcock to the contrary, bird watching is not
considered a dangerous sport. Well, it isn't as long as you don't
go to Colombia. In the September issue of Outside ($3.95), writer
Wade Graham spins a harrowing tale of four American birders who
survived a month as prisoners of a band of rebels while being
pursued by government troops. What's scarier, Graham writes, is
that this is not an isolated incident. More than 6,500 kidnappings
were reported in Latin America in 1995, and 50 of those were
foreign visitors. The problem is also severe in Mexico and
Guatemala, he says.

 &HT;    Let's worry, instead, about what our kids are really learning
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We keep going up, up, up. You get dizzy in such thin
air.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while the Dow was dropping like a coconut, Georgia's
SAT scores continued their determined climb. Another point.
</P>
<P>
   We're at 968, a full 4 points ahead of Washington D.C. and 17
ahead of South Carolina, this year's caboose.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth year in a row that Georgia's scores have _
well, ``risen'' isn't exactly the word. Changed imperceptibly is
more like it. You wish your grass grew like this.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, as anyone with the most meager grasp of statistics
could tell you, is that a point either way, up or down, is of no
significance whatever. Or 2 points. Or 3.
</P>
<P>
   But we keep talking about it and writing about it and wringing
our hands about it. And it's the same old story, year after year,
in Georgia and just about anywhere you turn. You wonder what the
point of it all is?
</P>
<P>
   I happened to notice, in last week's exhaustive report on SAT
scores, that North Carolina, at 982, stood about where it was when
I lived there five years ago. If I'm not mistaken, it stood about
where it was 20 years ago when Gov. Jim Hunt talked sonorously and
endlessly about education. (How well I remember those scintillating
press conferences.) He's still the governor and he's still talking
about it. Every governor talks about education, education,
education.
</P>
<P>
   It's the job of a governor, of any politician, to talk. It's the
job of parents and teachers to educate. Governors have next to
nothing to do with it; school superintendents have a tiny bit more
to do with it _ but not much. ``I'm pleased to see the trend is
still going up,'' said Georgia School Superintendent Linda
Schrenko. And then the obligatory vow of resolve: ``I'm not
satisfied with being where we are. I definitely want to move above
1,000 and even higher.''
</P>
<P>
   We'd better buckle our safety belts. The superintendent is going
to turn on the afterburners.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Isakson, the state school board chairman, wasn't quite so
reckless in his rhetoric. ``We're moving in the right direction,''
he said. But until we get to wherever it is we're headed _ he
didn't say where that was _ we should consider the whole thing ``a
work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. Another ``work in progress.'' That's what I tell my
wife when she asks when I'm going to clean the landfill I call my
office. I can't say tomorrow because I know it's not going to be
tomorrow. I can't say next week because it was supposed to be last
week. I say it's a work in progress. It's better than saying, ``One
of these days . . . who knows when?''
</P>
<P>
   Here's an idea: Let's stop talking about the SAT for at least 20
years. In the meantime, we might ask why it is that the schools are
doing remedial education in even the earliest grades.
</P>
<P>
   The impressions of an outsider can be illuminating. My friend
Golpar Ghassemian doesn't understand why much of her daughter's
third-grade class are doing second-grade work. Her child, along
with a handful of others, goes to another class to do third-grade
arithmetic and social studies. The others stay behind,
third-graders in name only.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're doing second-grade work, why are they in the third
grade?'' she asked me.
</P>
<P>
   I had no answer and said, lamely, that inevitably there would be
students who didn't learn everything they should have in the second
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then why are they in the third grade if they can't do
third-grade work?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you have the school do?'' I said. ``Flunk half the
class?''
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Call it naive, if you want, but she meant it. In many places in
the world it would have seemed the most obvious common sense. You
pass from the second grade to the third because you've shown you're
prepared for third-grade work.
</P>
<P>
   We do things differently here, of course, and when the results
disappoint us we wonder what the problem could be. One thing we can
be sure of: The problem isn't the SAT.

 &HT;    The Fox network's The 'King' of Tuesday TV
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's 10 a.m. Not the funniest hour of the day _
noon is funnier, 10 p.m. is funnier, every hour between midnight
and 5 a.m. is funnier _ but if things go the way they're supposed
to go this morning on the fourth floor of this Century City glass
tower, the hour won't matter.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big hour, as big hours go in the unordinary world of
``King of the Hill,'' Fox's animated sitcom about ordinary life in
the fictional suburb of Arlen, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``King'' is the most successful prime-time cartoon since ``The
Simpsons'' debuted nine years ago, and it's one of the few network
hits of any kind the last two seasons. It ranked 22nd last year in
overall ratings (``The Simpsons'' ranked 29th) and 10th in the
advertising-rich 18-49 age group.
</P>
<P>
   So this year's third-season debut, in which we will find out
whether lead character Hank Hill survived a propane explosion at a
mall opening, could represent the year's most significant torch
passing _ both for 'toondom and network viewing habits.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Fox once used ``The Simpsons'' to kick-start different
nights of programming on its crawl toward network legitimacy, it
has moved ``King'' from Sundays to Tuesdays in a bold attempt at
catching two wheezing network standbys, ``Home Improvement'' and
``Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a wonder. In a world where the dumbed-down maulings of
network marketeers are an industry instinct, the long process of
creating ``King of the Hill'' has much in common with the
drawn-out, undissembled nature of the place it animates. The show
is unflinching in what it is: dawdling, wary of jokes, a situation
comedy that emphasizes situation over comedy. Amid network TV's
bland geography, ``King of the Hill'' stands out; it's as
culturally separate from most network programming as Texas is from
the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy Griffith's back and he's (really mad),'' creator Mike
Judge has said in describing the sitcom's worldview _ underscored
inside the show's offices by a hallway Texas flag with the put-upon
head of Hank (``what you get when common sense, impatience and a
high school education collide'') drawn over the banner's lone star.
</P>
<P>
   On this Friday midmorning, the staff drips into a conference
room with the intense unfussiness of an independent study group _ a
thing smart kids might attend the summer between high school and
college. The show's creators, writers and voices look the part:
five T-shirts, three jerseys, two short-sleeve plaid shirts and one
denim shirt lounge around a long table. Other staffers _ and some
network guard dogs _ occupy chairs behind them.
</P>
<P>
   They're assembled for the weekly ``table read'': the first
out-loud measure of an episode's funny factor before the
characters' voices are recorded the following Wednesday. The table
isn't always this full. Judge often reads his roles as Hank and
Hank's speed-mumbling neighbor, Boomhauer, through a video computer
from his office in Austin, where he still lives.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge (T-shirt, jeans) is here today, while the voices of
Hank's wife, Peggy (Kathy Najimy), and son, Bobby (Pamela Segall),
arrive via speaker phone. The actors read through the script
nonstop, gauging it for laughs and timing it for length. If it
doesn't fly here, it won't fly on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know until you read it,'' says writer Johnny
Hardwick (snake farm T-shirt, jeans), voice of Hank's
conspiracy-addled neighbor, Dale. ``We've rewritten scripts
entirely. It's amazing the work that can be done between the Friday
table read and the Wednesday recording. Sometimes we're rewriting
at the recording.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects to rewrite today's script much. It's a beauty:
The creation of John Vitti, who's written for ``The Larry Sanders
Show'' and ``The Simpsons,'' the episode, which won't air until
April, revolves around the riding mower's hallowed station among
the good citizens of Arlen.
</P>
<P>
   Co-creator Greg Daniels, a mild-looking ``Simpsons'' and
``Seinfeld'' alum, welcomes everybody in the room _ then speeds
into the narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hank is organizing his immaculate garage. He puts on a pair of
safety goggles, then picks up a power drill, finds its place on his
pegboard and hangs it up. Then he takes off his safety goggles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, baby! Turn over!'' Dale exclaims in the hard Texas
drawl of Hardwick, an Austin comic before he wound up here. ``You
can do it! Turn over, baby! Come on come on come on . . . aaaah!''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels: ``Dale enters.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale: ``Hank, my mower won't start. Mind if I borrow yours?''
</P>
<P>
   Hank chuckles with a subversive catch that's more throttled than
Judge gave to the leads on ``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head,'' his first
animated show. ``Almost turned over, didn't she?''
</P>
<P>
   Dale: ``She was teasing me!''
</P>
<P>
   The room breaks into scattered laughter; Judge's shoulders
jiggle while he hunches over his script. Five years of ``Beavis &AMP;
Butt-head,'' a ``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head'' movie, three seasons of
``King,'' a $16 million development deal at Fox _ and he still gets
a bang out of this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on for half an hour: giggles, snorts, big laughs. But
it's a voice actor's little grunt or a slow ``mmm hmmm'' that gets
the hugest responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the smallness of it _ it doesn't panic, it doesn't rush
from joke to joke,'' writer Norm Hiscock, a Canadian who has
written for ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``Kids in the Hall,'' says
of the show's appeal to him. ``I'm not a big-joke guy.''
</P>
<P>
   When it's over, the room applauds itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hideously long,'' a pleased Daniels sums up the table read
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   It ran 31 minutes, 18 seconds; it needs to be trimmed more than
10 minutes before it can air. That means the 51-page script has to
lose about 12 pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple,'' says Daniels, seated on his cluttered office couch
next to Judge. With glass towers rising outside the window behind
them, the two look like suburban squatters in these corporate digs.
``We just have to cut a lot of humor out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut the humor. Not what you expect from a sitcom. A drama,
maybe. A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writers get mad,'' says Daniels. ``I'll say, 'It's too
funny here,' and they'll say, 'We're comedy writers.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have a theory I expound to them. I call it the steam
theory. When you tell a lot of little jokes, it's like you keep
letting the steam out. But if you save some of them up, you can
have a bigger joke. You get a bigger bang. It's combustible comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking out for the thing that makes it different than
other animated shows,'' Judge adds.
</P>
<P>
   Judge and, especially, Daniels are the show's gatekeepers. They
keep it's original vision original _ a rare thing in a ``by
committee'' industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's viewers are subjected to so many voices, it's
important to be distinctive,'' says Fox entertainment President
Peter Roth. ``Mike and Greg have a distinctive voice and a point of
view that can't be seen anywhere else. They have that magic formula
_ even though there is no magic formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge was producing ``Beavis'' and Daniels was at ``The
Simpsons'' when the two met at a comedy festival. Judge showed
Daniels his drawings for ``King,'' stalled at the time in
development, and Daniels joined him to rework it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left to my own devices, I would have made fun of the
characters too much and realized it too late,'' Judge says.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Judge nor Daniels wanted a hybrid of the hit cartoons
they'd already made. Judge wanted to capture the quirky realism of
his working-class Texas neighbors, but without the ``Beavis''
nihilism or the ``Simpsons'' clowning. So they came up with a
knee-walking, character-driven, largely jokeless cartoon that's as
smart as it is dumb, as hip as it is uncool, as easy to fall for as
it is to dismiss. You might have to stick with this one for a while
before you say, ``Oh, I get it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure how people were going to react,'' Judge says.
``Before the pilot came on, I wondered, 'Who . . . who is going to
like this show?''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knew for at least a year. A ``King of the Hill'' episode
takes nine months to make _ about eight months longer than a
live-action sitcom. After voices are recorded, most of the work
shifts to animators across town, then animators in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   If the writers' offices have the summer-break air of high school
_ the ``stress reduction center'' is a hallway basketball court
(``It keeps getting more aggressive,'' writer Alan Cohen says of
play there. ``It's like the evolution of society'') _ then the
animators' offices have the playschool atmosphere of kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   The show is animated at Film Roman studios, on the second floor
of a low-slung, down-scale office building in North Hollywood.
Offices that line the warrenlike hallways are filled with ``Star
Trek'' toys, fish tanks, cereal box collections, blinking Christmas
lights, Halloween skeletons. Still, these are grown-ups: A drawing
inside one office is titled ``Portrait of a Bitter Clown.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge's simple-seeming characters aren't that easy for the
show's 100 artists to animate. ``There are a lot of nooks and
crannies in their faces _ the characters have more . . .
character,'' says director Shaun Cashman, who worked on ``The
Simpsons,'' also animated here.
</P>
<P>
   It's one long, tedious process. Storyboards first depict the
script in panels, like a crude comic book, and are sent back to the
writers for notes. The pencil drawings are then animated, and
writers again check to see that characters ``act'' what's written;
to help with their drawings, animators often perform scenes in
their offices.
</P>
<P>
   The characters' main poses are then drawn precisely, timed to
the voices, and layered by a series of specialists: prop artists,
landscape artists, colorists. These are shipped to Korea, where the
jillions of frames needed between those poses are created for an
episode's 250 to 350 scenes. With about 100 frames required to get
an arm raised to shake a hand, cost of this labor-intensive work is
prohibitive in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed notes accompany Film Roman's drawings to Korea to avoid
mistakes caused by culture gaps. Nothing is taken for granted
anymore. School buses once came back blue instead of yellow.
They're blue in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Film Roman gets the completed film six weeks before an episode
airs. Mistakes are flagged and script changes are made (unlike with
live actors, dialogue can always be finessed in cartoon mouths).
</P>
<P>
   It never really ends. Daniels and his writers fiddle almost
until the airdate _ nine months after writers started scratching
out a script about, say, riding lawn mowers.
</P>
<P>
   In the perpetually paranoid world of series TV _ 31 of last
season's 37 new network series were canned _ the ``King'' staff
acts like it'll be around awhile. Writers are relaxed enough to try
things out and not take it so personally when they don't work.
Everybody knows what everybody else can do.The pressure of a hit
show is to perform more than to impress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like jazz,'' says Hardwick. ``You wait for your moment.
I've learned to throw material out there and let it have its own
life. You pitch a joke, but don't get attached to it. We're here to
serve the story and the character.'' ``It's good to be on a show
you can feel proud of,'' sums up Alan Feedland, a writer who's also
worked on ``The Nanny'' and ``Public Morals,'' a 1996 sitcom from
Steven Bochco that lasted one episode. ``Sometimes in this business
you work on shows that aren't your cup of tea or that you wouldn't
watch. There's very little that's good on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Is ``King'' good enough to work Tuesdays, without ``The
Simpsons'' and ``The X-Files'' cradling it? This crew isn't
worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late,'' Daniels says of any pressure to tweek the
show because of the schedule change. ``(Fox) told us a month ago.
We've already finished February.''

 &HT;    Doings at `Disney'
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris and Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC's ``Wonderful World of Disney'' _ one of the few recent
efforts by the network that's connected with audiences _ will
launch an ambitious slate of TV movies this season, sprinkled with
Disney theatrical films. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A Knight in Camelot'' stars Whoopi Goldberg in a
contemporary remake of Mark Twain's ``A Connecticut Yankee in King
Arthur's Court,'' with Michael York as Arthur. It airs Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``In Your Shoes'' is a gender-switching comedy, directed by
Peter Bogdanovich. David Alan Grier and Vivica A. Fox play the
married couple who switch personalities and live in each others'
bodies (see ``Freaky Friday,'' etc.). No date yet.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Noah'' stars Tony Danza, who found himself inexplicably
without a series this season, as a modern-day contractor who finds
himself instructed to build an ark. Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Sabrina Goes to Rome'' takes Melissa Joan Hart's series
character to Italy, where she co-stars with her real-life
boyfriend, James Fields. Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Disney also plans to rerun one of last season's best-loved
events, the remake of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ``Cinderella,''
with Brandy and Whitney Houston, but hasn't announced a date yet.
</P>
<P>
   Among the theatricals on ``WWD'': ``George of the Jungle''
(Sept. 27), ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' (Oct. 18), ``The
Baby-Sitters Club'' (Dec. 20).
</P>
<P>
   Mouth of South (Boston)
</P>
<P>
   Just one question after watching the pilot episode of Fox's
``Costello'' (8:30 tonight (4934)): Does the Irish-American
Anti-Defamation League know about this?
</P>
<P>
   A dizzying cocktail of tiresome Irish-Catholic stereotypes, this
dopey sitcom recalls the bad old days when telling ethnic jokes was
still considered socially acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The ``joke'' here is Sue Murphy (Sue Costello), a downwardly
mobile South Boston barmaid who starts seeing a therapist, breaks
up with her hunky boyfriend and peppers her family of blue-collar
chowderheads with psychobabble about being ``passive aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone drinks, everyone fights. When they're not boozin' or
brawlin', they're talking about it through bogus Boston accents.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Costello's'' sin isn't being politically incorrect _
Archie Bunker did it on ``All in the Family'' by making us laugh at
our petty prejudices. ``Costello'' is insulting and dumb, which
even Archie would find truly unforgivable.

20 QUESTIONS FOR MEDIA MOGULS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Minn., Mich., Tenn., Ill., Calif., Wash., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time again to ask 20 questions about advertising, marketing
and the media.
</P>
<P>
   _ Was it a sign to sell stocks to see an advertisement last
month in the restroom of a fast-food restaurant that read
``Sanitized by Swisher, a publicly traded company''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why is it that such advertisers as DirecTV and the Target unit
of the Dayton Hudson Corp. have simultaneously introduced campaigns
centered on the creepy gimmick of placing people inside shopping
carts as if they were groceries?
</P>
<P>
   _ Would the national news media pay more attention to the
effects of the strike against Northwest Airlines if the company's
flights were, say, the only way to get to and from the Hamptons?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is Pepsico Inc., which featured the Spice Girls in a campaign
for Pepsi-Cola, angry about a print ad from the Coca-Cola Co. that
carries this provocative headline: ``You wanna cook? You don't need
spice _ just the right recipe''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the renewed popularity of the film ``Grease'' inspire a
comeback for Ipana toothpaste and its mascot Bucky Beaver, which
are featured in a commercial shown during the slumber party scene?
</P>
<P>
   _ As delightful as it is to hear J.P. Richardson, aka the Big
Bopper, sing ``Chantilly Lace'' in a television commercial for the
Baby Ruth candy bar sold by Nestle, wouldn't it be more appropriate
if the song were ``A Rose and a Baby Ruth''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Was it the most efficient use of an ad budget to buy
commercial time during a rerun of ``Frasier'' to sell tickets for a
show by the country singer Shania Twain that was part of a
Budweiser beer concert series?
</P>
<P>
   _ Did anyone involved in the creation of the coming film
``Analyze This,'' a comedy about a hit man seeking help from a
therapist, recall a skit from ``Saturday Night Live'' in which John
Belushi played Vito Corleone seeking help from a therapist?
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that Stonyfield Farm has printed a sexual pun on the lids
of its yogurts, referring to the abundance of active cultures
inside the packages, has the company opened itself to critics who
will complain _ to paraphrase the old Star-Kist slogan _ that its
yogurts may taste good but are not in good taste?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is there a more telling reminder of how time flies on Madison
Avenue than to see Florence Henderson, who played the supermom
Carol Brady on ``The Brady Bunch,'' as the pitchwoman for the
Polident brand of denture cleanser sold by the Block Drug Co.?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the next episode of the CBS news magazine ``48 Hours
Mysteries,'' which consists of repackaged previous reports, be
devoted to why news magazines are doing so well in the ratings with
repackaged previous reports?
</P>
<P>
   _ How many times did the folks who produced a television
commercial for the Victoria's Secret retail unit of Intimate Brands
Inc., which shows sultry young women slinking across a stage in
derby hats, see the current Broadway revival of the musical
``Chicago''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will anyone from the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion
Board, which is sponsoring a ``Got milk?'' ad in the October issue
of Teen People magazine featuring the young actor Joshua Jackson
from ``Dawson's Creek,'' notice that in the ad he describes himself
as 6 feet 2 inches tall _ in part, he says, because of the calcium
in milk _ while in an article later in the magazine he describes
himself as 6 feet tall and ``built like a twig''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will social historians someday describe the novel ``Bridget
Jones' Diary'' as the ``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'' of the 1990s?
</P>
<P>
   _ Though people often misquote the remark Neil Armstrong made
when he set foot on the moon _ omitting the ``a'' in ``That's one
small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind'' _ wasn't it
surprising to find the mistake in an ad for the Boeing Co.?
</P>
<P>
   _ Isn't it funny how a campaign for Samsung products like
microwave ovens, which features sleek, attractive 20-something
models in poses that are evocative of fashion ads, has been
followed by a campaign for Krups products like toaster ovens that
features sleek, attractive 20-something models in poses that are
evocative of fashion ads?
</P>
<P>
   _ Can the media buyers for the new national anti-drug ad
campaign be reimbursed for a commercial appearing on VH1 that was
followed immediately by a commercial for Corona beer?
</P>
<P>
   _ Would ads for the Cheer detergent brand sold by the Procter &AMP;
Gamble Co. show children playing football in purple jerseys if the
Cheer agency, the Leo Burnett Co., were not based in Chicago, where
so many residents cheer for the purple-clad Wildcats of
Northwestern University?
</P>
<P>
   _ How many times did the folks who produce commercials for the
Romano's Macaroni Grill unit of Brinker International Inc., which
are centered on chefs who bicker in Italian-accented English, see
the film ``Big Night''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will those responsible for ads telling New York area residents
about flights on Continental Airlines to Orange County, Calif.,
from ``King's County'' tell an advertising columnist, ``You ask a
lot of questions for someone from Brooklyn''?

 MURDOCH REPORTED TO HAVE BID $950 MILLION FOR BRITAIN'S RICHEST
SOCCER CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Fresh from acquisitive forays into U.S. sports, Rupert
Murdoch is aiming at the richest stratum of British soccer with a
reported $950 million bid for the fabled Manchester United club
that would tighten his grip on televised sports in this country.
</P>
<P>
   B Sky B PLC, Murdoch's British satellite broadcasting unit,
confirmed in a statement Monday that it was ``in discussions which
may or may not lead to an offer being made for Manchester United.''
The team is the wealthiest British soccer club, with profits last
year approaching $45 million from merchandising, gate receipts and
broadcast fees.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver seemed to reflect acquisitions in the United
States, where Fox TV, controlled by Murdoch's News Corp., purchased
the Los Angeles Dodgers in March and has a stake in the New York
Knicks, in addition to options on stakes in the Los Angeles Lakers
and the Los Angeles Kings, an ice hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   News of the bid brought angry roars from some of Manchester
United's estimated 3 million fans and raised a possibility of
government regulators scrutinizing the deal.
</P>
<P>
   None of that worried investors: Manchester United stock, listed
since 1991, leaped more than one-third in early trading on the
London Stock Exchange, adding some $240 million in value. At one
point, the gains put the share price just below B Sky B's reported
offer of 225 pence a share; the shares fell back to around 207
pence, a 30 percent gain on the day. Other leading soccer teams
listed on the stock exchange notched up gains of around 12 percent
in anticipation of interest from other entertainment companies.
</P>
<P>
   B Sky B's negotiation also set loose a likely bidding war with
Enic PLC, the British leisure group that already has a stake in
several other European soccer clubs and which has a joint venture
with Time Warner in restaurants and retail trade. Enic executives
withheld comment on widespread news reports that the company was
planning a rival bid, hoping to benefit from the unpopularity of
Murdoch's move among supporters of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch once called televised sports the ``battering ram'' of
pay TV. The Evening Standard newspaper said, ``In Manchester
United, he could not have chosen a bigger weapon.'' But the bid
also raised hackles: Murdoch's B Sky B already has a monopoly in
broadcasting games played by British soccer's mass-audience Premier
League, in which Manchester United is a star attraction among the
20 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership of the club could give him an edge in renegotiating
exclusive broadcast rights when the current four-year Premier
League arrangement, valued at some $1.1 billion, expires in 2001.
``He wants to be around the negotiating table with the Premier
League clubs,'' said Vinay Bedi, a soccer industry analyst with the
brokerage firm Wise Speake in Newcastle in northeastern England. It
would also provide a hedge if British regulators end the rules
permitting exclusive broadcasting rights to the entire Premier
League.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   B Sky B has a stake in Manchester United's own television
station, MUTV, putting it in a strong position if British sports
television goes the way of Spain and Italy, permitting individual
clubs to control broadcast rights to their games.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Murdoch's control of Fox TV in the United States
and his Star TV in Asia offer the possibility of turning Manchester
United into a global attraction for paying viewers and advertisers
alike, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be seen as a stand-alone event but as part of the
broad strategy, which is to become the dominant global force in the
media and entertainment sphere,'' Eric Betts, an analyst with
Nomura Australia, told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's bid to acquire Manchester United has inspired worries
that his control of British sports is becoming all but
unassailable. Radio talk shows in the north of England, where
Manchester United has its core following, were deluged with hostile
calls. And Peter Mandelson, the trade and industry secretary, said
regulators would look at a bid by Murdoch for Manchester United
``very searchingly indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch has been a prime force behind the transformation of
British televised sports into a lucrative industry. Apart from B
Sky B's control of the Premier League in soccer, the venture also
has a lock on many major rugby and cricket tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   But Murdoch has trailed other European media concerns in moving
into the ownership of the clubs themselves. Enic, the leisure
company thought to be preparing a rival bid, owns soccer teams in
Italy, Greece and the Czech Republic and a one-quarter stake in the
Glasgow Rangers team in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   One question that lingers unanswered is why Manchester United is
offering itself for sale. Both the advent of pay-per-view
television sports and the talk of a possible European super league
were major attractions for B Sky B, Bedi, the soccer analyst, said.
``But,'' he added, ``one wonders why Manchester United would be
interested in selling when these pots of gold are waiting for
them.''

DOUGLAS JONES, 73, WRITER ON AMERICAN WEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Douglas Jones, a writer who chronicled the mythology of the
American West through fictional accounts of historic events, died
on Aug. 30 at his home in Fayetteville, Ark. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, after 25 years in the Army, Jones retired with the rank
of lieutenant colonel. He then embarked on a second career as a
writer, having already published a nonfiction work, ``The Treaty of
Medicine Lodge,'' in 1966, his master's degree thesis at the
University of Wisconsin, Madison, where he taught journalism from
1968 to 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Jones took his cue as a writer from his memories of growing up
in Fort Smith, Ark., close to what had once been Indian territory.
``I was captured by the idea of the Indian frontier then _ and I
still am today,'' he said in an interview in The New York Times in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   It was an intriguing parlor game of ``what if'' that he played
with his friend Benjamin Rush III that led him to first imagine the
consequences Gen. Custer would have faced had he survived the
Battle of Little Bighorn. The outcome was ``The Court-Martial of
George Armstrong Custer,'' a 1976 fictional reconstruction that
wove much of its substance from fact. The book was illustrated with
pen-and-ink drawings by Jones, who eventually showed his artwork
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Jones continued to conjure alternative histories in works like
``Arrest Sitting Bull'' in 1977; ``A Creek Called Wounded Knee'' in
1978, which, with ``Court-Martial'' formed a de facto trilogy, and
``The Barefoot Brigade,'' about the dirt-farm infantry of the
Confederate army.

CONGO PEACE TALKS FINISH ON HOPEFUL NOTE 
</HEADLINE>

   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe _ A daylong summit meeting of African
leaders seeking to negotiate a peace settlement for the Congo ended
on an optimistic note Monday when the chairman of the group
announced that all parties had agreed on ``what we intend to
achieve in the Congo.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, said a
document would be signed next morning, though he refused to give
details of any agreement, and how much had been resolved remained
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please take it that things have gone extremely well,'' Chiluba
said before adjourning for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, organized by President Robert Mugabe of Zambia,
seemed to have been more successful than four previous attempts to
negotiate an end to the crisis in Congo, if only because all
parties involved in the conflict showed up at the same location.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation representing the rebels, however, was kept at
arm's length throughout the day and at one point apparently
threatened to leave the talks, which were held in a luxury hotel
where vacationing tourists wandered the halls in Bermuda shorts.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting began without any sign of a cease-fire in Congo,
which has been at war since late July when rebels, backed by Uganda
and Rwanda, began an offensive against Laurent Kabila, who became
president of Congo barely 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though at one point in the battles Kabila appeared to be on the
verge of losing Congo's capital, Kinshasa, he has managed to retake
much of the western part of the country with the help of troops
from Zimbabwe and Angola. Reuters reported on Sunday that Congo
government forces had launched an air attack on several rebel
strongholds in a continued effort to push back the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe cleared the way for Monday's meeting during a summit
meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement last week in Durban, South
Africa, at which President Nelson Mandela appeared to bow out of
any effort to mediate the dispute. Mandela had failed in two
attempts to bring all parties to the table.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, a mixture of opposition politicians and disgruntled
soldiers who have accused Kabila of corruption, nepotism and
inciting ethnic hatred, were not even invited to the last talks. On
Monday they arrived late and were treated at the airport like any
other travelers. They were then kept in a room far from the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were intended to find a way to get the factions to
discuss a cease-fire, the withdrawal of foreign troops and the
establishment of a southern Africa peacekeeping force. Salim Ahmed
Salim, the secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity,
who also took part in the discussions, said what was needed was a
way to ensure the survival of Kabila's government while also
bringing about democratic reforms.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As they arrived, some of the negotiators seemed extremely
optimistic. ``This summit will bring a solution to the conflict,''
said President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola shortly after his
plane landed. But as the day wore on, others seemed to hint that
they were getting nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, however, after a final meeting of the presidents
involved in the conflict, Chiluba gave a brief news conference
hinting that there had been a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a very good meeting,'' Chiluba said. ``We all of
us have agreed on what we intend to achieve in the Congo.''

OFFICIALS DEFEND CREW'S TIMING ON FUEL DUMP

<P>
   BOSTON _ The MD-11 _ the type of wide-bodied jet that crashed
off Nova Scotia last week killing all 229 on board _ is one of the
most technologically advanced jetliners in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on-board computers perform functions ranging from
wind-shear detection to automated emergency checklists. As a
result, the aircraft, the second generation of the DC-10, went from
a crew of three to two _ something the industry has said is
perfectly safe.
</P>
<P>
   When smoke entered the cockpit of Swissair Flight 111, the
flight crew notified air traffic controllers and said they would
land in Boston. The controllers pointed out that Halifax was closer
and the crew quickly decided to land there. At that point the
airport was about 70 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   And Swissair could not have picked a better two-man crew for the
job. Flight 111 Captain Urs Zimmermann, 50, had been with with the
airline since 1970. Both he and his First Officer, Stephan Loew,
36, were flight instructors in the MD-11. Together, they had
amassed considerable experience with the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only when they were 30 miles away that the crew
realized they needed to dump fuel to make the plane light enough to
land. Why did it take the crew so long to realize they needed to
dump fuel?
</P>
<P>
   Swissair officials Monday defended the action of the crew. Using
information from Canadian investigators, the airline reconstructed
the final moments of the doomed flight. Flight 111 could not have
made a direct approach to Halifax from where it made the first
distress call because it was flying too high and was too heavy with
fuel, according to the airline's chief pilot, Rainer Hiltebrand.
</P>
<P>
   Several pilots say there is nothing worse than an onboard fire
and the only option is to land the plane as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice recorder should provide the definitive answer
to what the crew was doing, but pilots and accident investigators
say the first few minutes of going from a smooth flight to an
emergency situation is one of great confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is smoke in the cockpit, they are running through the
emergency procedures, they probably are telling the flight
attendants to clean up the cabin since they were serving drinks or
even dinner by then, and they are trying to figure out where the
smoke is coming from,'' said a veteran aviation accident
investigator who asked that his name not be used. ``If they forgot
(to dump fuel earlier), it is something any one of us could have
done; there was a lot going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the DC-10, or any other plane with a three-person crew,
one of the prime duties of the second officer is fuel management,
the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A third personality can make things more difficult, but I
would think a third person may have helped the situation,'' said a
veteran airline pilot who asked not to be identified. ``But I
stress may, because this is speculative and we just don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Under Federal Aviation Administration regulations, US airlines
that use two-person crews on overseas flight of eight hours or
longer must have a third pilot, known as a relief pilot, on board.
The relief pilot usually spells other crew members and, in the
event of a midflight emergency, could enter the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not regulate foreign carriers and they usually have some
rule which pretty much parallels ours,'' said FAA spokeswoman Diane
Spitaliere.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair did not have a relief pilot on Flight 111, nor does it
have one on any of its European flights from the East Coast of the
United States. An airline spokesman said Swissair does have some
relief crews on some flights, but there is no set time limit on
which a relief pilot must be added to a flight.

ANALYSIS: WORDS FROM GREENSPAN ARE OFTEN TAKEN FOR GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With markets tumbling and economies crumbling at an
alarming pace, investors and governments around the world were
looking for a lifeline from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
when he spoke in California on Friday night, and Greenspan gave it
to them.
</P>
<P>
   His suggestion that the Fed might have to consider cutting
interest rates if the global financial crisis continued to worsen _
as vague and conditional as his statement was _ was seized on by
investors in Asia, Europe and Latin America on Monday as a possible
sign that Greenspan was preparing to ride to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Although other reasons contributed to the rally by stocks
overseas Monday, Greenspan's remarks were considered an underlying
cause.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the stock market was up 5.3 percent Monday. In Hong
Kong, the rise was 7.9 percent. London stocks jumped 3.5 percent,
and in Latin America, where markets last week were almost in free
fall, stocks posted big gains in all the major markets that were
open, including Mexico's and Argentina's.
</P>
<P>
   The buying could well continue on Tuesday when Wall Street
returns to work after the three-day holiday weekend. Any rate cut
by the Fed, after all, would be protection against recession and a
downturn in corporate profits at home, and it would make stocks a
bit more attractive relative to bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But it is an open question whether Greenspan can halt or even
slow the spread of the crisis. With the domestic economy still
growing at a robust pace, there is no guarantee that the Fed will
reduce rates anytime soon. And even if the Fed does ease monetary
policy in the United States, it would not by itself solve the
problems underlying the global crisis, especially the lack of
political will in many countries to take the tough economic and
financial steps necessary to restore confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan may be the world's most influential economic policy
maker, but even he does not have the tools to solve single-handedly
a crisis that has spread from Thailand throughout Asia, into Russia
and in recent weeks into Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, just after speaking at the University of California at
Berkeley on Friday night, Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin tried over dinner in San Francisco _ with no apparent success
_ to impress upon Japan's new finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa,
the need for Japan to take quick, bold action to strengthen its
banking system and reawaken its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet markets around the world seemed to shrug that off, at least
for Monday. Japan's willingness to get its powerful economic
machine running again, however, is likely to prove far more
important in determining the course of Asia and the prospects for
global recession or recovery than any change in policy by the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why the markets' enthusiasm for the possibility
of a Fed easing would outweigh despair about the lack of immediate
urgency among Japanese policy makers,'' said Mickey Levy, chief
economist at Nationsbank Montgomery Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, the markets gave short shrift to the continuing
political turmoil in Russia, where the lower house of parliament
Monday again rejected President Boris Yeltsin's choice for prime
minister. Russia is not a global economic force, and many of its
problems are all its own, but more politicians in many countries
share, in varying degrees, its unwillingness to toe the line
dictated by the impersonal and unaccountable forces of market-based
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Even where governments have taken their medicine, like Thailand
or to a lesser extent South Korea, the process of rebuilding
banking systems and inefficient, uncompetitive industries will take
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed can't do anything for Russia,'' Levy said. ``It can't
do anything for Japan. It can soothe the markets, but it can't
address the underlying problems.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is not that a Fed easing of interest rates would not have
positive ramifications for economies struggling to keep the crisis
from swamping them. Reducing rates in the United States would help
nudge investors to think about sending their money elsewhere in
search of higher returns, perhaps helping to reverse the flood of
money that has swept into the United States in search of a safe
haven.
</P>
<P>
   A rate reduction by the Fed could also help persuade the
European central banks to join in with rate cuts of their own,
helping bring down the interest rate structure worldwide. Lower
rates around the globe would take some of the strain off the
growing number of governments that are straining to roll over
public debt, help banks and other financial institutions and
stimulate economies that have stalled or slipped into recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not underestimate the influence that Greenspan and the
Fed can have,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the
Institute for International Economics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bergsten said Greenspan could also assure the world that the
crisis was not unfolding in a total policy and political vacuum,
with governments seen as weak and international institutions like
the International Monetary Fund running out of money and under fire
as ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rate cut by the Fed could be fairly sizable,'' Bergsten
said. ``It might be magnified by concerted action from Europe. And
it signals that somebody is in charge and providing leadership,
which has been a sorely missed variable. It may be that leadership
has to come from the central banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, before cutting short-term interest rates by any
significant amount in the United States _ the federal funds target
rate has been 5.5 percent for nearly a year and a half _ members of
the Fed would have to agree that the domestic economy is threatened
by the global crisis so much so that inflation is no longer a
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan appeared to ally himself with those who think the
United States could feel the impact of the crisis more directly in
coming months, saying on Friday night that it is ``just not
credible that the United States can remain an oasis of
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   But a contingent within the central bank has been openly fretful
that wage and price pressure are building in the U.S. economy.
Although that contingent has given up pushing for a rate increase,
it is unclear whether Greenspan, who prefers to avoid splits within
the policy making Open Market Committee, has the ammunition or the
inclination to push through a rate increase at the next Fed
meeting, on Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech on Friday night, Greenspan mused at various points
on the various crosscurrents facing the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   He restated his belief that price stability, or at least
significant progress toward it, is necessary to bring down interest
rates and increase business and consumer confidence _ prerequisites
to investments that yield increased productivity and higher living
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also referred bluntly to fears of a general fall in asset
and product prices. ``Presumably, the onset of deflation, should it
occur, would increase uncertainty as much as a re-emergence of
inflation concerns,'' he said.

MCGWIRE'S 61ST, ON HIS FATHER'S BIRTHDAY, TIES MARIS MARK  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Punctuating history with yet another remarkable
coincidence, Mark McGwire tied Major League Baseball's storied home
run record Monday, smacking his 61st home run on his father's 61st
birthday. He needs to hit only one more home run in the St. Louis
Cardinals' remaining 19 games to surpass the mark set by Roger
Maris in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, a 34-year-old right-handed hitter with a huge body and
a deadly uppercut swing, matched Maris' 37-year-old mark in his
first time at bat against the Chicago Cubs, propelling a fastball
from Mike Morgan some 430 feet against the windows of the Busch
Stadium dining club above the lower deck of the left field stands.
</P>
<P>
   As a footnote to the history McGwire is making, Morgan ``shook
off,'' or rejected, the first two pitches the Cubs' catcher, Scott
Servais, called for, a split-fingered fastball and a slider.
Morgan, who has lost games with more teams than any pitcher in
history, opted instead to throw a fastball, and it catapulted him
into posterity with McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever let go of the moment,'' said McGwire,
who momentarily watched the ball soar toward the stands, then
lifted his massive arms triumphantly and exultantly as he began
trotting around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Across the outfield in right, Sammy Sosa of the Cubs applauded
the man who beat him to the record. Sosa has joined McGwire in a
remarkable contest of power-hitting skills and made the baseball
season as memorable as the sport has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited,'' said the amiable Sosa, who did not add to his
total of 58 home runs. ``This was the moment that everybody was
waiting for. He came through. He's the man. I always say that. I
was clapping when he hit the home run. It was a great moment. I'm
never going to forget the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will John McGwire, Mark's father, who as a scoreboard
message subsequently said, `is believe it or not celebrating his
61st birthday today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in fate; I believe that things happen for a
reason,'' said McGwire, who in recent days has also spoken of
talking with Ruth and Maris after he dies.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 250-pound first baseman cited as evidence of fate
his feat of hitting his 61st home run on his father's same-numbered
birthday and the ball he struck for his 60th home run that tied
Ruth's career-high season total. The balls being pitched to McGwire
and Sosa are specially coded so that baseball officials can tell
which are the legitimate ones hit into the stands. ''The other
day,'' McGwire said, ``when I hit a home run, it was a No. 3 ball.
No. 3 was Babe Ruth, I'm the third guy in the history of the game
to hit 60 home runs, I hit it on the third pitch. If that's not
fate, I don't know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   As McGwire went to the plate with two out in the first inning,
the home plate umpire, Gary Darling, threw one of the coded balls
into the game. Morgan and McGwire hadn't faced each other much in
their careers, but Morgan had fared well, holding McGwire to a
single in six times at bat.
</P>
<P>
   Acquired from the Minnesota Twins only two weeks ago, the
38-year-old Morgan, a right-handed veteran of 17 years in the major
leagues, threw a slider, and McGwire missed it. Then he threw a
fastball that stayed above the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself to just stay calm,'' McGwire later related. ``I
was very relaxed today. Sometimes you might get caught up in the
moment and you might be shaking a little bit. My heart was beating
a thousand miles a minute, and I just was telling myself get a good
pitch to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in right field, Sosa sensed that this could be the at-bat.
``He went to home plate with such concentration,'' Sosa said. ``I
could see he was ready to look for that pitch, to look for anything
in the strike zone. He was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Servais called for a split-fingered fastball, a pitch that would
approach the plate looking like a fastball but drop down as it
reached the plate. Morgan shook his head no. Servais signaled
slider, a pitch that would break late as it reached the plate.
Morgan shook his head no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go with my strength,'' Morgan said, exhibiting no
regrets. ``I went to what I felt I could control off the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Servais was not critical. ``That's the pitch he wanted to
throw,'' the catcher said. ``He just didn't put it where he wanted
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan wanted to keep the ball down and away from those huge
McGwire arms. But, he lamented, ``I got it up and down the middle
of the plate.''

FLIGHT RECORDER STOPPED OPERATING, INVESTIGATORS SAY

   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ The flight-data recorder aboard Swissair
111 stopped functioning below 10,000 feet, investigators said
Monday, suggesting that an electrical failure may have doomed the
pilots' efforts to make an emergency landing at Halifax
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong possibility that there weren't electrics on
the airplane'' under that altitude, said Vic Gerden, chief
investigator of the crash that killed 229 people last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Harris, another investigator with the safety board, said it
is too early to determine how extensive the power failure was, and
whether the pilots had to revert to manual operation of the
aircraft in a final, desperate attempt to land.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the electrical failure, discovered during initial
examination in Ottawa of the flight recorder, appears to correspond
to the plane's altitude when air-traffic controllers heard the
pilot's final transmission that ``we are declaring an emergency ...
we have to land immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerden has said that the MD-11 was flying at 9,700 feet when
ground personnel lost radio contact. Six minutes later, the plane
plunged into the waters off Peggy's Cove.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Canadian military personnel located the cockpit
voice recorder, another key piece of evidence. Rough seas, however,
prevented divers from bringing this second ``black box'' to the
surface. Diving was suspended Monday because of worsening weather
and might not resume until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said investigators do not know whether the cockpit voice
recorder was powered by the same circuit that served the
flight-data unit.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario, however, is that the plane was hit with a massive
power outage that plunged the smoky cockpit into darkness as the
pilots struggled with manual controls to right the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the finding that the flight-data recorder did not
monitor the plane's operating systems below 10,000 feet, the
Canadian Transportation Safety Board expects to retrieve a wealth
of information that may show what prompted the crew to issue a
distress call at 33,000 feet, 70 miles southwest of Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder was disassembled Monday in Ottawa, and data
recovery had begun. The so-called black box was recovered in good
condition. If the cockpit tape is also in good condition,
investigators will have crucial evidence of how the pilots assessed
the emergency and whether their response was proper.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments, more human remains have been found
farther away from the point of impact, driven on to the shore by
wind and current.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said that the recovery of human remains has now become
the top priority of Operation Persistance, as the effort has been
dubbed by the Canadian military. A mesh net will be dragged through
the ocean, away from the debris field, to collect remains.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed that an
undetermined number of bodies have been found among three large
pieces of the fuselage. Those remains have not been brought to the
surface yet.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Navy officers revealed dramatic details about
Sunday's retrieval of the data recorder. Captain Phil Webster said
one of the two divers developed a leak in his suit, and the pair
had to make an ascent _ clutching the black box _ much more rapidly
than normal.
</P>
<P>
   One of the divers became ill from the rapid change in pressure.
Both were put in a decompression chamber and taken to a hospital.
Both are recovering at home, Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the plane's manufacturer acknowledged that much of
the electrical wiring aboard the plane was insulated with aromatic
polyimide tape, known by the trade name Kapton, which has been
banned from use in US Navy planes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co. spokeswoman Susan Bradley said all the
general-purpose wiring aboard the plane was insulated with Kapton.
</P>
<P>
   The US Navy banned Kapton from its aircraft because of poor
performance, Air Safety Week, an industry newsletter, reported
Monday.

   ST. LOUIS _ The home-run record has been going down for weeks.
The only things missing were the details, like: Mark McGwire tied
Roger Maris with his 61st Monday, while Sammy Sosa stayed at 58.
</P>
<P>
   What was not immediately evident was the way Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa would welcome everybody on board with their big hugs and
their open smiles, the body language of two good human beings who
have found each other.
</P>
<P>
   The signals are that this is for everybody, for Mr. and Mrs.
America, for the people in the Caribbean, for the family of Roger
Maris, for the memory of Babe Ruth, for the people who buy tickets
and sweat in the stands, for anybody who admires grace under
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In Busch Stadium Monday, fans in red shirts cheered a player in
a blue-and-white uniform. It's almost as stupendous a development
as: ``I saw a man who danced with his wife in Chicago,'' as the
lyrics go.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of baseball stars who have a policy of not speaking,
and roid-rage football and in-your-face hockey and crotch-grabbing
for a basketball dunk worth 1/50th of his team's output for the
night, baseball has come up with two guys who give each other high
fives during a Frick-and-Frack press conference and hug each other
at first base during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him congratulations,'' said Sammy Sosa, from the
Dominican Republic, who is charming the baseball empire in his
second language, English. ``But I told him, `Now you've got to wait
for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even a few days ago, it seemed like a good smart-aleck crack for
crusty, cigar-chomping Jack McKeon, manager of the Reds, who said
he had been getting all these phone messages about not walking
McGwire, and how he wanted to ``heal America.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, when apprised of McKeon's quip, said, ``If only it was
that easy.'' And he's right about that. These multi-millionaires
are not exactly solving the skewed ratio of wealth and opportunity
in America. However, in the last couple of weeks, it has been
impossible to miss that McGwire, a very large, white dentist's son
from California, has been simpatico with Sosa, a wiry dark-skinned
man from the Dominican Republic, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You both come from such different backgrounds as children.
Did you ever envision yourself sitting in this setting?
</P>
<P>
   Sosa: Not really, but I have to say, ``Baseball been bery bery
good to me.'' (Laughter, as Sosa knowingly invoked the echoes of
Chico Escuela on the ancient ``Saturday Night Live'' shows.)
</P>
<P>
   McGwire: God Bless America.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa: What a country!
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sammy said you would hit 70 by the end of the year. How many
do you think he will hit?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire: Wouldn't it be great if we just ended up tied? I think
it would be beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What number?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire: Seventy is a good one. (Laughter).
</P>
<P>
   Sosa: I will take it.
</P>
<P>
   This was the repartee Monday when the two amigos held a joint
press conference before the game. What the official transcript
cannot possibly indicate is the comfort level between the men, the
way they look each other in the eye and laugh. They understand each
other the way Sally Ride understands John Glenn: they've both been
there.
</P>
<P>
   These guys have also praised the memory and the skills of Roger
Maris, who hit 61 homers in 1961 and never enjoyed it. On Sunday,
Maris' son Randy Maris said: ``I think if he would have had a stage
like this to handle all the questions, instead of having him sit at
his locker and answer questions, two hours before games and after
games, just questions over and over, it would have been a lot
easier for him. That was probably the toughest part.''
</P>
<P>
   The era of Roger Maris seems 37 decades away rather than 37
years. Maris and his friend, Mickey Mantle _ they shared an
apartment _ were unsophisticated country boys who had grown up
thinking that real men didn't share their feelings in public.
Mantle ranged from hilarious to vicious, depending on his mood;
Maris was far more consistent, in a testy but honest way. Sosa
seems genuinely open, at ease with himself; McGwire says he became
that way through therapy following a wrecked marriage. They both
grew up watching Felipe Alou and his baseball family, Steve Garvey,
Kirby Puckett and Tony Gwynn set standards for eloquence and
kindness in public. Sad to say, a lot of ball players today are
Class A louts. Fortunately, they do not have 61 and 58 homers, and
maybe there is a moral to that.
</P>
<P>
   The era of good feeling has even extended to the fans. The
Cardinals fans stood and applauded Sosa (and Gary Gaetti, a
Cardinal until recently). McGwire still talks with awe about the
standing ovation in Pittsburgh, and the fact that even the
fabulously abusive New York echo left him alone.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, another fan came up with a McGwire home-run ball and
immediately turned it over to McGwire for modest considerations _
some booty, some season tickets. The word from the tax lawyers is
that any poor soul who idealistically hands over a landmark
baseball to McGwire is liable for many thousands of dollars of gift
taxes, immediately. Up to edition time, Mike Davidson, age 28, from
St. Louis, had not yet been manacled and dragged off to jail by the
Internal Revenue Service. Maybe McGwire and Sosa really are healing
America.

CLINTON'S LAWYER ASKS FOR ADVANCE COPY OF STARR'S REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's private lawyer requested on
Monday that Kenneth Starr, the independent prosecutor, allow him to
review at least a week in advance the report Starr is preparing for
Congress, in a sign the White House is readying a defense against
possible impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The request came as Clinton, according to some of his advisers,
is facing wrenching decisions about how to reassure Democrats at a
time that criticism of his handling of the Lewinsky affair is
mounting within his own party. One option is for him to apologize
again for his conduct, an approach he seemed to be inching toward
in Ireland last week. Another would be to disclose embarrassing
information or perhaps answer questions about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   With the House of Representative coming back into session on
Wednesday and mid-term elections just two months away, the prospect
of Starr's report has electrified the political atmosphere here,
alarming congressional Democrats and causing some to distance
themselves from the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's aides say that they are are still scrambling for a
strategy to take the political initiative in the country and the
Congress against Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Outside advisers to the president said that the White House is
not yet running the kind of aggressive, coherent damage control
operation that Clinton made famous when he first battled
accusations of dishonesty and adultery during the 1992 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the prosecutors on Monday, David Kendall,
Clinton's attorney, wrote that out of ``fundamental fairness,''
Starr should let him and the White House counsel review any report
early enough to permit them ``one week to submit a written reply.''
That reply, together with the report, might then be given to Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson, who has been supervising the grand jury in
Starr's investigation, or sent straight to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall argued that Starr may transmit information he has
gathered to the Congress, but that is he not authorized by law to
prepare a report that summarizes or analyzes it. And Congress, he
wrote, has in the past expressed concern that judgments made in
such a report could intrude on its constitutional responsibilities
in weighing impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that fundamental fairness dictates that we have the
opportunity to review such a document and submit simultaneously any
reply we wish to make,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr had no comment on the letter, a spokesman said on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have argued that Starr, a Republican, will
not produce a balanced report on his seven-month inquiry into
Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Noting that Starr's
witnesses have not been cross-examined, they are eager to produce a
report or memorandum providing their own interpretation of the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr refuses to provide the advance copy, White House aides
will argue that he is acting unfairly, trying to sandbag the
president by surprising him with a report that they expect to read
like an indictment, according to one adviser to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After almost three weeks away, the Clintons came back over the
long weekend to a capital turned suddenly hostile. After taking a
pasting from Senate Democrats last week, the White House is bracing
for the possibility of more criticism from House members who have
gotten an earful from constituents.
</P>
<P>
   To remind the public and his party of his legislative goals, the
president plans a series of campaign-style appearances, beginning
Tuesday by promoting a school modernization plan.
</P>
<P>
   But, fatigued by weeks of domestic and foreign crises, the
president and his aides are also trying to develop a legal and
political strategy to deal with the expected report. The Clintons'
time away from Washington _ first on vacation and then in Russia
and Ireland _ has hampered internal planning about the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understandably _ but strategically _ don't have a lot of
fizz right now,'' said one of the president's outside advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Another ally of Clinton said that a critical speech last
Thursday by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., may have shaken the
White House out of a sense that Clinton high approval ratings in
public polls would protect him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House has relied on polling and missed the real
danger of the political slow burn that began moments after the
speech,'' this ally said. ``A lot of us are hoping Senator
Lieberman's speech is the real wake-up call, causing a major and
fundamental change in the president's approach to this issue, not
an incremental one or a strategic one.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Clinton delivered a full-throated apology, some of his aides
believe, he would by now have the high ground in criticizing Starr.
Instead, Democrats' aggravation with Clinton has grown since his
speech, said one Democratic consultant advising several members of
Congress. ``You do get a sense _ maybe just temporarily _ the sense
that people are sort of done with it,'' he said. ``They're done
with him. There's not another escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's aides believe that Democrats have been
criticizing him in part out of fear that he report will contain
damaging information not yet disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some Clinton advisers are pushing his legal team to
release all records relating to Ms. Lewinsky that Starr has
obtained, like the logs of her visits to the White House. Then,
they argue, the president should answer detailed questions from
journalists about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Davis, a former White House special counsel, urged that
strategy when Clinton was responding to accusations about his 1996
campaign finances. He said that the White House should now ``help
reporters write all of the details of this story prior to the Starr
report, because fundamentally, the only chance we have of a
balanced presentation is if we put this information out
ourselves.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the view of some Democratic strategists, the president's high
approval ratings mask a more complex reaction to his admission of a
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster,
convened a group of 12 residents of York, Pennsylvania, on Monday
night to discuss the matter, in a session scrutinized at the White
House and elsewhere here last week.
</P>
<P>
   At first, no one wanted to discuss the matter. Then, he said, as
they got started talking, they became animated, describing feelings
of disappointment and even disgust with Clinton, comparing him to
an adolescent boy.
</P>
<P>
   But when Hart raised the idea of resignation or impeachment, he
said, ``they sort of pulled back.'' But they did not rule it out.
``They're just not there,'' he said. ``They need much more
information, they need more time.'' That is essentially the
position taken by Lieberman and other congressional Democrats _
stated disappointment combined with a wait-and-see attitude toward
what steps should be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on Hart's results, one White House official argued this
week that the public is watching Clinton ``like a hawk'' because of
the scandal, and is ``more attuned to what he's saying, not less.''
As a result, he said, Clinton's planned events could benefit him.
Clinton is scheduled on Wednesday to travel to Florida to raise
money for the Democratic Gubernatorial candidate, Buddy MacKay, and
to promote school safety.
</P>
<P>
   He will follow that, his aides say, with a blitz of public
appearances to push new safety regulation and health care
legislation and to address international economic troubles. In
particular, Clinton will emphasize his economic stewardship, his
central political theme since he first ran for president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But not many issues have penetrated the furor over Ms. Lewinsky
since Clinton acknowledged their relationship last month, despite
some potent contenders that include the U.S. attacks on suspected
terrorist sites in Afghanistan and the Sudan as well as the sharp
stock market decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaign-style events, I don't know if those can change the
subject,'' a Democratic strategist said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``The problem is everyone really has got their ear to
the ground for the big shoe of the Starr report to drop.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it is far from certain that Congress will pass
even the budget legislation necessary to prevent a government
shutdown, let alone act on the president's broad agenda.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., who has been a close ally of the
White House in seeking to tighten campaign finance laws, said that
it was difficult for the president ``to talk about restoring
integrity to the political process right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials say that, away from the uproar,
work is getting done. ``In our area, I think he's going to have the
best year in his administration,'' predicted Andrew Cuomo, the
secretary of housing and urban development.

FOSTER TODDLER DIES IN POOL ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ 
AND KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRACUT, Mass. _ A 2-year-old boy wandered into the pool at his
foster home and drowned Monday, apparently while his foster mother
ducked inside to answer the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Dracut police said the boy's teenage foster sister called 911
just before noon, saying her little brother was floating in the
pool.
</P>
<P>
   The foster mother's brother-in-law, Eugene Baroyne, dived into
the pool and dragged the boy out, police said. As firefighters
arrived, Baroyne had been trying to resuscitate the boy for about
10 minutes. He was later pronounced dead on arrival at Saints
Memorial Hospital in Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point it looks like a very sad accident,'' said
Lorraine Carli, a spokeswoman for the Department of Social
Services, which places foster children.
</P>
<P>
   At the home, where two shriveled balloons drooped from the
mailbox as reminders of the boy's birthday just four days earlier,
his foster mother answered the door in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what it's like to lose a child?'' the woman,
Cheryl Lewellyn, asked, then buried her head into her
brother-in-law's shoulder and wailed, ``My baby, my baby's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewellyn told police she had been grilling on the deck of her
blue colonial, watching the boy play in the yard in an area
separate from the in-ground pool. She later told DSS caseworkers
that she had ducked inside to answer the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came out and couldn't find him,'' Carli said. ``It was
only a matter of a minute or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewellyn and her other children, some of them foster children,
began calling for the boy, who police identified as Mark Ramerez.
After a few minutes, they noticed the gate to the fenced-off pool
was open.
</P>
<P>
   They discovered the boy floating in the water, and the teenager
phoned police.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said that her little brother had walked into the pool area
and was floating,'' Police Chief Louis Panas said. ``And she didn't
know how long he was in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the hospital nor police filed a child abuse or neglect
report, which the state requires anyone who suspects neglect to do.
Police and DSS are treating the case as an accidental drowning
pending further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lewellyn and her husband, who police and DSS did not identify,
had been caring for five foster children, Carli said, including the
boy's 4- and 6-year old brothers. Police said there were four of
the couple's biological children living in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The DSS caseworkers and supervisor for the area said Monday that
they knew the family, but did not believe there had been any
problems in the home, Carli said. She said she would not be able to
check records to look for any past allegations of problems in the
home until this morning. But police said they had not been called
to the home or notified of any alleged abuse there in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Carli said DSS believed the boy's foster parents lived in the
Lowell area, and was trying to find them to notify them of their
son's death. She did not know how long the boy had been living with
Lewellyn, or the reasons he was removed from his birth parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foster mother is very upset right now and very excited and
it was difficult for us to talk to her,'' Panas, the police chief,
said. ``We're going to give her a period of time to calm down and
then we're going to talk to her again and try to find out what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor who has lived next door to Lewellyn in the rural part
of this North Shore town said Monday that she did not know the
family, but had sympathy for the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awful, just awful,'' the neighbor, Donna Baviello, said.
``You never know; it only takes a second.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy bursts a recent bubble of relatively positive press
for the state's child protection agency, which had been recovering
from a season of several years in which more than a dozen children
annually died in foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1985 and 1992, an average of 12.5 children each year
died in foster homes. The number of deaths dropped from 11 in 1995
to 3 in 1996, the latest year available Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The last death this year was in February, when a 16-month old
child died in a Sheffield foster home after being pinned beneath a
couch. The foster parents, who had taken custody of the boy only
five days earlier, were cleared in a DSS investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent good years, bad publicity over the past decade
has continued to exacerbate another chronic problem for DSS: the
lack of families willing to take on foster children.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 13,000 foster children in state custody, but
only about 6,600 foster families.
</P>
<P>
   DSS has been trying to recruit more professionals to become
foster and adoptive parents since 1995. But rather than gaining
more foster homes since then, it has lost about 800.

   ST. LOUIS _ Punctuating history with yet another remarkable
coincidence, Mark McGwire tied Major League Baseball's storied home
run record Monday, smacking his 61st home run on his father's 61st
birthday. He needs to hit only one more home run in the St. Louis
Cardinals' remaining 19 games to surpass the mark set by Roger
Maris in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, a 34-year-old right-handed hitter with a huge body and
a deadly uppercut swing, matched Maris' 37-year-old mark in his
first time at bat against the Chicago Cubs, propelling a fastball
from Mike Morgan some 430 feet against the windows of the Busch
Stadium dining club above the lower deck of the left field stands.
</P>
<P>
   As a footnote to the history McGwire is making, Morgan ``shook
off,'' or rejected, the first two pitches the Cubs' catcher, Scott
Servais, called for, a split-fingered fastball and a slider.
Morgan, who has lost games with more teams than any pitcher in
history, opted instead to throw a fastball, and it catapulted him
into posterity with McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever let go of the moment,'' said McGwire,
who momentarily watched the ball soar toward the stands, then
lifted his massive arms triumphantly and exultantly as he began
trotting around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Across the outfield in right, Sammy Sosa of the Cubs applauded
the man who beat him to the record. Sosa has joined McGwire in a
remarkable contest of power-hitting skills and made the baseball
season as memorable as the sport has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited,'' said the amiable Sosa, who did not add to his
total of 58 home runs. ``This was the moment that everybody was
waiting for. He came through. He's the man. I always say that. I
was clapping when he hit the home run. It was a great moment. I'm
never going to forget the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will John McGwire, Mark's father, who as a scoreboard
message subsequently said, `is believe it or not celebrating his
61st birthday today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in fate; I believe that things happen for a
reason,'' said McGwire, who in recent days has also spoken of
talking with Ruth and Maris after he dies.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 250-pound first baseman cited as evidence of fate
his feat of hitting his 61st home run on his father's same-numbered
birthday and the ball he struck for his 60th home run that tied
Ruth's career-high season total. The balls being pitched to McGwire
and Sosa are specially coded so that baseball officials can tell
which are the legitimate ones hit into the stands. ''The other
day,'' McGwire said, ``when I hit a home run, it was a No. 3 ball.
No. 3 was Babe Ruth, I'm the third guy in the history of the game
to hit 60 home runs, I hit it on the third pitch. If that's not
fate, I don't know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   As McGwire went to the plate with two out in the first inning,
the home plate umpire, Gary Darling, threw one of the coded balls
into the game. Morgan and McGwire hadn't faced each other much in
their careers, but Morgan had fared well, holding McGwire to a
single in six times at bat.
</P>
<P>
   Acquired from the Minnesota Twins only two weeks ago, the
38-year-old Morgan, a right-handed veteran of 17 years in the major
leagues, threw a slider, and McGwire missed it. Then he threw a
fastball that stayed above the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself to just stay calm,'' McGwire later related. ``I
was very relaxed today. Sometimes you might get caught up in the
moment and you might be shaking a little bit. My heart was beating
a thousand miles a minute, and I just was telling myself get a good
pitch to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in right field, Sosa sensed that this could be the at-bat.
``He went to home plate with such concentration,'' Sosa said. ``I
could see he was ready to look for that pitch, to look for anything
in the strike zone. He was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Servais called for a split-fingered fastball, a pitch that would
approach the plate looking like a fastball but drop down as it
reached the plate. Morgan shook his head no. Servais signaled
slider, a pitch that would break late as it reached the plate.
Morgan shook his head no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go with my strength,'' Morgan said, exhibiting no
regrets. ``I went to what I felt I could control off the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Servais was not critical. ``That's the pitch he wanted to
throw,'' the catcher said. ``He just didn't put it where he wanted
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan wanted to keep the ball down and away from those huge
McGwire arms. But, he lamented, ``I got it up and down the middle
of the plate.''

COMMENTARY: APOLOGY WITHOUT ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You may remember Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's exultant
leap for the benefit of photographers when he won re-election last
November. But a small wager says you have probably forgotten how
the mayor briefly tempered his joy with an uncharacteristic note of
contrition.
</P>
<P>
   He was well aware that for all the successes of his first term,
some New Yorkers were pained by a sense of having been left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do a better job of serving all of you,'' he said
that November night. ``We have to reach out to all of you. And if
we haven't, I apologize. I'm sorry, and it is my personal
commitment that we will try, endlessly and tirelessly, to bring all
of you into the kind of success and optimism we have in this
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's not waste time by pussyfooting about race. The ``we'' in
that room were whites, and the ``you'' were New York's blacks, who
voted against Giuliani by roughly 4-1 and who see precious few of
their own in the upper echelons of this City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ask them if they believe that the mayor has translated that
apology into action by working endlessly and tirelessly to make
them feel included. Ask that especially of people in Harlem after
the weekend debacle that many are now deriding as the Million Cop
March because of a police show of force along Malcolm X Boulevard
that some felt was wildly disproportionate.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, the rally dubbed the Million Youth March was a
flop. Only a few thousand demonstrators showed up. Most speeches
were predictable, from the hopeful to the hateful. As for the
violent mouthings of the chief organizer, Khallid Abdul Muhammad,
few sensible people would deem them anything but pathology
masquerading as thought.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important point is that whatever venom Muhammad was
selling, the people of Harlem were not buying. That has been lost
in the hurly-burly of the last few days, particularly by the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the verbiage from the speakers' platform, the people at
the rally were law abiding. They were mostly civil to police
officers guarding the endless barricades, and they were treated
respectfully back. In the run-up to the march, the mayor was
understandably concerned about public safety, given Muhammad's
record of hate. But reality proved different. Peace reigned on the
boulevard _ that is, until police officers were ordered to take a
war footing in riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   It explains why many in Harlem cannot understand the mayor's
persistent focus on the vile speechifying instead of the calm of
the rally-goers (who for the most part were supporting black unity,
not Muhammad). As they understand the First Amendment, even hateful
speech enjoys constitutional protection as long as public safety is
intact.
</P>
<P>
   It is why they cannot help wondering if a white neighborhood in
Giuliani's New York would be similarly turned into an armed
encampment during a peaceful demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   And it is why many blacks feel that the mayor, 10 months after
his apology, has not really reached out to them. Instead,
Harlemites feel caught in the middle of a personal joust between
Giuliani and Muhammad. They suspect that each man has his own
political agenda and that they are paying the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khallid Muhammad, Old Sourpuss, stood up on stage and said
take their guns _ if the cops rush the stage you rush them,'' the
Rev. Clinton Miller told Sunday morning worshipers at the
Abyssinian Baptist Church on West 138th Street. ``Our children are
used to that. They need to hear something different. We're all so
used to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   But like many in Harlem, Miller basically blamed the mayor and
the police commissioner for instigating the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Mayor,'' he said to applause from the congregation, ``you
can't go around picking fights with everybody like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that much has been changed by the unpleasant affair. New
York blacks who did not like Giuliani before still don't. And
Giuliani seems to feel that carefully picking his fights _ Khallid
Muhammad is a no-brainer of a target _ could pay off in places
important to an upwardly mobile mayor. Iowa and New Hampshire, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, leaving race out of it, this City Hall has little use
for contrarian views. What better sign than this recent remark from
one of its few high-ranking blacks, Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington:
``Never do we call people and ask for their advice and tell us what
to do.''

GOLDMAN STAFF TO DISCUSS STOCK MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. has told its 11,500 employees worldwide to
participate in a conference call early Tuesday morning in which
leaders of the fabled investment firm are expected to discuss
Goldman's planned offering of shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Corzine and Henry Paulson Jr., Goldman's co-chief executives
and co-chairmen, will review Goldman's performance in the third
quarter of this year, which, according to Goldman's fiscal
calendar, has just ended. Corzine and Paulson are also expected to
address the status of the firm's plan to end its private
partnership and sell shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman executives sometimes communicate with employees in
firm-wide conference calls. It is not viewed as extraordinary for
the firm to hold such sessions to discuss results or important
news, people who work there say.
</P>
<P>
   But this call comes amid extreme volatility in securities
markets around the world. Speculation has risen that Goldman, like
virtually all other Wall Street firms, has suffered trading losses
in emerging markets. Goldman officials, however, say that any
losses are minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The call also comes after the share prices of Goldman's main
rivals, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, have both
plunged by more than a third from their peaks in July, just after
Goldman partners voted to sell stock.
</P>
<P>
   Unless shares in those companies rise significantly in coming
weeks, banking analysts say they doubt that Goldman's offering _
scheduled for November _ will raise as much money or value the firm
as highly as bankers there expected a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few Goldman employees expect that the firm will delay or
cancel its public offering, at least at this stage. ``As far as I
can tell, it's still full steam ahead, and I would be surprised if
they tell us otherwise,'' one Goldman banker said Monday.

 &HT;    Lucky fan catches history when 61 reaches stands
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ He wasn't supposed to be at the game and had planned
to watch it on television.
</P>
<P>
   But 28-year-old Mike Davidson caught a piece of baseball
history.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, from St. Louis, was able to get to the ball that Mark
McGwire hit for his record-tying 61st home run on Monday. The home
run bounced off the club level facade into into the left field
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bounced of five people's hands, rolled underneath my seat.
I picked it up,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those fans who missed it was Rich Reichert, who cut one
of his fingers when he hit the concrete going for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know,'' Reichert said, ``is I got knocked down by about
10 guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson was quickly taken away by security and was interviewed
by ESPN, which was televising the game, and several other media
outlets. He then met after the game with the entire group of media
and turned the ball over to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted nothing for the ball, but came away with a few minutes
with McGwire, two signed balls and two bats. The ball McGwire hit
will go to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said he thought about the money he could have received
if he had put the ball up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure it would be more aggravating dealing with people who
come out of the woodwork when people win the lottery instead of
just giving the ball to Mark McGwire for him to appreciate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson got his tickets from a relative.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are my brother-in-law's season tickets,'' he said. ``He
had to work, so I got his tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 61 victim
</P>
<P>
   Cubs right-hander Mike Morgan will go down in the history books
as the pitcher who gave up the record-tying homer to McGwire. Of
course, that may be better than his current reputation. Morgan is
perhaps the most well-traveled player in the game, having played on
10 different teams including the Cubs twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know, he tied it, I am on the other end of it,''
Morgan said. ``I haven't given up too many homers over my career.
Never been a home run guy, but I do give them up. I'd like to have
the pitch back.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, by the way, gave up Carl Yastrzemski's 400th homer in
1979. Today, McGwire will try to hit the record-breaker against
Steve Trachsel, who has allowed 19 homers in 28 starts this season.
McGwire is 0-for-5 against Trachsel.
</P>
<P>
   More McGwire
</P>
<P>
   McGwire on the St. Louis fans giving Sammy Sosa a standing
ovation when he came up the plate in the first inning: ``Just
another example of the best fans in the country. I am not playing
into them. It's the truth.'' ... On what he said to the family of
Roger Maris after the game: ``They thanked me and gave me a hug and
I am sure if we were more private it would have been a little bit
more emotional. I would love to meet with them some day when this
is all over and talk to them. He is in my heart.'' ... On his first
at-bat, the one on which No. 61 came: ``I told myself to just stay
calm, stay clam and I was very relaxed today. Sometimes, you get
caught up in the moment, you might be shaking a little bit, my
heart was beating a thousand miles a minute, and I was just telling
myself to get a good pitch to hit.''

 &HT;    Mac grabs piece of history, with one more shot to go
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It was gone, no doubt about it. And when Mark
McGwire started his home run trot for the 61st time this season,
all he could think about was his family.
</P>
<P>
   There was his father, John, who turned 61 on Monday. ``The whole
time I thought what a great birthday present for my father,''
McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   And there was his 10-year-old son, Matt, who had arrived from
California just in time to serve as the St. Louis Cardinals'
batboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him when I went into the hole to get my bat,'' he said.
``I told him that I love him, gave him a kiss and saw him at home
plate. What a wonderful feeling for a father.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fabulous day for baseball. With one powerful swing,
McGwire tied a record for single-season home runs that has stood
since Roger Maris set the mark in 1961. It was a record that many
thought would never be approached.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, the Cardinals first baseman, has 18 more games to set a
new standard. His next chance comes tonight, when the Cubs and
Cardinals play at 8:10 p.m .
</P>
<P>
   But McGwire didn't want to talk about upcoming chances; he was
too wrapped up in what happened on Monday. He is a man with a
dream, one that is being pieced together game-by-game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was calm (today),'' he said. ``That was a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   And his swing was smooth. After a 30-minute press conference
with Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa, who trailed McGwire by two homers
entering the game, McGwire hit one homer after another in batting
practice, finishing with 13 as the crowd as Busch Stadium began
celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who did not hit a home run on Monday, popped out to
McGwire during his first at-bat. Some Cardinals fans actually booed
when the second pitched he received was a ball.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire got his chance in the bottom of the first. With none on
and two out, McGwire worked the count to 1-1 against Cubs
right-hander Mike Morgan, then looked for a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to throw him my best pitch, try to get him with a
fastball away,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   And away it went, heading down the left-field line toward the
foul pole. On Sunday, McGwire had hit a similar bomb that was foul.
But this blast never had time to hook. It hit the concrete on the
clubhouse facade and bounced into the first row of seats in the
outfield. The record had been tied.McGwire took off on his trot,
slapping hands with Mark Grace at first and Gary Gaetti, a former
teammate, at third. Third base coach Rene Lacheman, friends with
McGwire since the early days in Oakland, slapped him on the back,
and McGwire headed home.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, then jumped on homeplate with both feet, where his
son was waiting to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a little chuckle,'' McGwire said, when asked what was
said between the two. ``That is all. He didn't have to say
anything. His eyes said it all.''
</P>
<P>
   On-deck hitter Ray Lankford was the first to reach McGwire, who
then picked up his son and hugged him. Then came Ron Gant and the
rest of the Cardinals. McGwire pointed to his father, to the Maris
family in attendance and to the heavens. McGwire also hugged Tony
LaRussa, who managed McGwire in Oakland and was instrumental in
bringing him to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded me of when Hank Aaron rounded the bases and a few
of the Dodgers were shaking his hand,'' McGwire said. ``I remember
when I was a kid at home watching that. I will never let go of that
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 50,530 at Busch didn't want to let it go either.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely great for baseball,'' Hall of Famer Stan
Musial said. ``To be honest, for years, I never thought this could
happen. Never. But Mark is great.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire actually had a good chance of breaking the record on his
second at-bat. Morgan fell behind in the count and tried to work a
fastball inside. McGwire singled hard to left. He appeared
over-anxious on his next two swings, going after the first pitch in
the fifth and sending a lazy flyball to center. On his fourth
at-bat in the seventh, he flied out to center.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, McGwire met with his family. He cried when he
saw his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't call him today to say happy birthday, because I was
driving to the ballpark,'' he said. ``If this is meant to be ... to
give him the birthday present of the 61st home run on his 61st
birthday, so be it. It just happened to be; so happy birthday
dad.''

 &HT;    McGwire takes a ride with baseball gods
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service (Moore Tuesday column)
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ After Mark McGwire sent No. 61 Monday at Busch
Stadium to what St. Louis Cardinals announcer Jack Buck described
as ``Planet Maris,'' the moment was wrapped in brilliant sunshine,
eternal noise and absolute destiny. All Sammy Sosa could do in
right field for the Chicago Cubs was join the rest of Planet Earth
in ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to know that McGwire was only a swing away from
matching Roger Maris' 61 homers in '61. It's quite another to watch
history in the first inning for McGwire soar high and deep off a
window of the stadium club below the upper deck in left field.
</P>
<P>
   So there was Sosa, the fleshly part of McGwire's heavenly chase,
joining the rest of the 50,530 witnesses searching for their breath
after McGwire's rocket. ``The emotion right there was
unbelievable,'' said Sosa, a formidable challenger to McGwire with
58 homers. Sosa applauded in his glove as McGwire circled the bases
to a roar that wouldn't quit.
</P>
<P>
   The man of many moments was in a zone that matched the one he
enters during every plate appearance. Early during McGwire's
home-run trot, he was congratulated by Cubs first baseman Mark
Grace. ``It reminded me of when Hank Aaron rounded the bases (after
No. 715) and the Dodgers shook his hand,'' said McGwire, also
recalling how he became emotional after reaching third and seeing
coach Rene Lachemann from their Oakland days.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, those around here, along with millions watching
in the 212 countries televising this march toward No. 62, we're
witnessing a slugger and a prophet. Throughout his chase of the
Babe and then of Maris and always of Sosa, McGwire likes to say the
baseball gods are directing his path.
</P>
<P>
   There was Saturday, for instance, when Sosa matched Ruth's 60
homers in a season by slamming one of those specially marked balls
that baseball is using for the event into the stands in left. Out
of all the possible combinations, the ball was No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's number? Three.
</P>
<P>
   As for McGwire's date with Maris, McGwire drove to the ballpark
Monday wishing to homer on his father's birthday. You know the
rest. Said McGwire, shaking his head, ``Maris set his record in
1961, and this was my father's 61st birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, McGwire wondered if the baseball gods were out of
miracles when he didn't see his 10-year-old son, Matthew, after the
first pitch. Matthew was flying from California to serve as a
batboy for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to get my bat in the first inning, and there he was in
the tunnel,'' McGwire said, eyes sparkling. ``I told him that I
loved him, gave him a kiss, and the next time I saw him was at home
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   There, with Maris officially caught, father grabbed son in a hug
and carried him toward the dugout. Then the drama grew. McGwire
pointed toward the heavens. Then he saluted his father in the
stands. Then, after entering the dugout to acknowledge the delirium
of Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa, along with coaches and
teammates, McGwire quickly returned to the field and looked at the
Maris family in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pointed upstairs, and then I pointed to my heart that Roger
is with me,'' said McGwire, telling absolutely the truth.

 &HT;    Latest swoon leaves Cox miffed
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It had an end-of-the-world feel to it. No, not the
thunderstorm storm that plunged Shea Stadium into mid-day darkness.
Another apocalyptic ending for the Braves, one that left Bobby Cox
seething.
</P>
<P>
   ``You fight back all day long and you get two outs and you walk
a guy,'' he seethed. ``And the next guy hits a home run. We did it
twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice in one weekend, both times in the eighth inning, each time
fatal. On Saturday, Rudy Seanez issued the two-out walk, then gave
up a game-winning homer to Tony Phillips. On Monday, John Rocker
walked Phillips, then disdained his fastball for a hanging, 3-2
slider to Edgardo Alfonzo. His home run gave the Mets an 8-7 win
and Atlanta its third one-run loss of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played like crap the whole series,'' Chipper Jones said.
``The same things happen game after game. If we can't beat the
Mets, how can we beat anybody else? How are we going to beat
Houston? San Diego? The Yankees? There's no way.''
</P>
<P>
   Having lost two of three at home to the Astros, then three of
four here, the Braves open a three-game series tonight in Montreal.
If they enhance the NL's best record and their postseason
positioning, it will come at the expense of the lowly Expos. As
Jones knows, ``We seem to be losing an awful lot of series to the
guys we might play (in October).''
</P>
<P>
   This loss ruined a fine comeback. With Denny Neagle scratched
due to stiffness in his pitching shoulder, Bruce Chen made his
big-league debut and gave up two homers and four runs in three
innings. Then the storm hit. After an hour-and-48-minute rain
delay, Atlanta jumped on a parade of Mets relievers.
</P>
<P>
   They scored twice in the fourth. When the Mets answered with two
runs in the fifth, Atlanta erupted for a two-out, five-run rally in
the sixth that included Andruw Jones' 28th homer and Gerald
Williams' two-run triple. After superb relief from Odaliz Perez,
Rocker entered in the eighth. He got two quick outs and was one
strike from retiring Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get ahead 1-2 and nobody on and two out, you gotta get
him,'' said Cox. ``And we walked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker fell behind 3-1 to Alfonzo, threw a strike, then a
fastball Alfonzo fouled back. Then, Cox said, ``He hung him a
slider. That's not his best . . . pitch. In that situation, it's a
get-me-over pitch. And those are the kind that go out of the
ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him a fastball (Friday, when Rocker fanned Alfonzo),''
said Rocker. ``I figured he'd be thinking he'd get one again. I
figured a mediocre slider would do it. And it was very mediocre.''
And very costly.

 &HT;    Sosa to McGwire: 'Congratulations...now wait for me'
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It had been a tough day for Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   With his team hanging on to a slim lead in the wildcard race, he
had walked up to the plate in the ninth inning, the tying run at
third and two outs. A hit and it was extra innings. A home run and
if the Cubs hold on in the bottom of the inning, they would remain
one game ahead of the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to hit a home run,'' Sosa said. ``Just trying
to get that run home.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa struck out, the Cubs losing 3-2 to the Cardinals but
afterwards the popular outfielder now chasing both Roger Maris and
Mark McGwire couldn't feel too badly.
</P>
<P>
   His friend McGwire had hit his 61st homer, and Sosa was happy
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you that he would be the man,'' said Sosa, who remained
stuck on 58 homers. ``I am glad for him, very glad. He deserves
it.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has done throughout this chase, Sosa continues to handle
himself with so much class. And through it all he continues to
smile, continues to have good things to say about McGwire and
continues to applaud his buddy.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire hit his 61st homer on Monday, the television
cameras panned to Sosa in right field. He was smiling, patting his
glove in appreciation. Then in the eighth Sosa singled and got a
chance to talk to McGwire at first base. They hugged and said Sosa,
``I told him congratulations, now you have to wait for me, don't go
too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Sosa, ``How can you not be happy for him. Look at what he
has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's day at the plate started in the first. He received a
standing ovation from Cardinals fans and with a runner at first and
two outs, he fouled out to McGwire. He came up in the third with
runners at second and third and two outs. But he watched an inside
fastball from Darren Oliver get called a strike. Sosa came back out
in the sixth inning with one out and no one on and again watched a
third strike. He singled in the eighth and would score before
striking out to end the game. Combined with the Mets beating the
Braves in New York, Sosa's Cubs now find themselves tied in the
wildcard race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is really what I am thinking about, trying to get this
team into the playoffs,'' Sosa said. ``The home runs are great, but
the big thing is winning the wildcard.''

TROJANS' RUNNING GAME IMPROVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when USC's running game was the subject of ridicule a
year ago?
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans ranked 111th out of 112 Division I-A teams in
rushing yardage just two weeks into the season, having gained 56
yards in 61 carries. USC rushed for only three first downs in the
first two games and averaged 0.9 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that embarrassment already appears in no danger of
repeating this year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the current NCAA statistics, USC ranks 69th
overall, tied with Penn State and East Carolina. The Trojans gained
168 yards in their opener against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said he intends to use as many as four
tailbacks against San Diego State this week: Chad Morton, Petros
Papadakis, Frank Strong and Jabari Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had intended to go as deep as four against Purdue,''
Hackett said. ``But the biggest problem is we had no plays. We only
had 64 plays in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Denmon, Douglas expected back: Offensive linemen Eric Denmon and
Rome Douglas are both supposed to be back with the team today.
</P>
<P>
   Denmon flew to Texas for a few days to be with his grandfather,
who is seriously ill. Douglas had a ``personal issue'' to deal
with, according to Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Night practice: USC got acclimated to night football Sunday by
holding a workout from 8:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. at Howard Jones Field.
The Trojans' game against San Diego State will start at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Touchdown for Youth: The Los Angeles Sports Council will help
sponsor the Touchdown for Youth promotion, which will allow about
2,000 disadvantaged children to attend the game. Organizers are
seeking additional contributions of $25 for a game ticket and
refreshment for each child.
</P>
<P>
   Return to Long Beach: San Diego State coach Ted Tollner, who
lived in Long Beach while coaching USC from 1983-87, has chosen to
have the Aztecs stay there for this weekend's game.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the course of an afternoon, Al Goldstein has his
secretary book a prostitute as his dinner companion at Nobu, a chic
downtown restaurant, and, for his cable television show, ``Midnight
Blue,'' he tapes a vicious attack on New York magazine for leaving
him out of its 30th-anniversary issue.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, as a father, Al has to brag.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son, Jordan, I'm so proud, he starts Harvard Law School
today,'' the publisher of Screw magazine is saying. ``What's the
Jewish word? I'm kvelling. He graduated No. 1 in his class in
Georgetown out of 781 students. When I met the president of
Georgetown he couldn't believe he was standing next to America's
No. 1 pornographer, that I was the father. My son is embarrassed by
me on occasion, but he loves me. He came to me a year ago and said,
`Dad, I can go to NYU free, or I can go to Harvard.' I said,
`Jordan, I live for you to go to Harvard. The money isn't a
problem.' But I was so moved he asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Screw celebrates its 30th year this fall. It may, as Al likes to
point out, be fighting for freedom of the press for everyone, but
the fights have not been pretty. When a federal judge, Kimba Wood,
ruled against Screw in a libel suit some years ago, Al ran
composite photos purporting to depict the judge in sex acts.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, based in New York, is mostly escort-service ads
and pornography. If you think you've seen the pictures before, you
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid $1 a picture back in the '60s,'' says Al, who has a $3
million home in Florida but loves a bargain. ``They've been in the
paper hundreds of times. Those women are so old they're in nursing
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Al _ how can you call a man who wore a ``Death Before Marriage''
T-shirt to a divorce hearing by anything other than his first name?
_ is a compendium of traits rarely found in the same body:
insightful, irrational, generous, self-absorbed, vindictive, funny,
obnoxious, eloquent. None of these qualities are repressed.
</P>
<P>
   Al rages against what used to be called the Establishment but
complains that he has never been invited to appear on ``Good
Morning America.'' He has appeared in pornographic movies but is
reluctant to divulge his weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, all right, you shamed me into it. Close to 300 _ 286,''
says Al, finally. The number looks low.
</P>
<P>
   Puffing on a Cuban cigar, surrounded by young staffers he
alternately jokes with and bullies, Al is videotaping what you
would diplomatically call editorials for the X-rated ``Midnight
Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to Nobu tonight,'' Al calls out to his secretary
between takes. ``Is the girl joining me?''
</P>
<P>
   Then it's back to what's eating him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not take rejection well. And New York magazine in their
anniversary issue never once mentioned Screw. And we are, truly,
the most extraordinary chronicle of sexual change, but their
editors'' _ and here he launches into an obscene attack on women.
</P>
<P>
   Why these attacks?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mean,'' says Al, who has had 35 years of psychoanalysis
and has apparently come to accept his flaws. ``I love my hatreds.
When I go to my shrink, I feel good.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Goldstein resume: 62 years old; raised in Brooklyn; grew up
a fat kid. First sexual experience at 16, when his mother tells
Al's uncle to take him to a prostitute. Nineteen arrests at Screw,
mostly for obscenity; sued for libel ``probably 10 or 15 times.'' A
six-year relationship with a 51-year-old lawyer named Rosie. One
son, who, Al has stated in his will, is not to inherit the
business. Four marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call my last wife an Irish cleaning lady,'' Al says. ``That
is what she really was. My limousine would take her to jobs. It
cost $40 an hour and she was making $8. She'd written me a letter.
My mother was dying; I was very lonely. I wanted to be like the
professor in `Pygmalion.'''
</P>
<P>
   Marriage is high among Al's hatreds, but the list is long. If Al
is not happy, he attacks. Often he attacks himself. ``I'm a Jew
boy, I cannot pay retail,'' Al says on ``Midnight Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, Al is asked again, with all his analysis and his obvious
insight, give vent to such ugliness?
</P>
<P>
   ``So I should be a nice, reasonable human being like all the
other human beings who have ulcers and boil inside? My father
worked for The Daily Mirror. He was a timid little man who said
`sir' to elevator operators. I was humiliated by his fear. My
rebellion is not to be my father. When I was 14 years old, my
mother tells me she's having an adulterous relationship with my
diet doctor. Many years ago, I did the Tom Snyder show on network
TV and my mother said, `Your dad isn't much of a lover.' I was
mortified.''
</P>
<P>
   Al talks a lot about freedom of speech, regardless of the
consequences. Didn't his mother have a right to exercise hers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't question it, but I could react to it,'' Al says.
</P>
<P>
   One hears the echo of analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never validated,'' Al says. ``Think psychic abuse. There
had to be a precursor. Why else would I be such a crazy human
being? My father beat me. I stuttered till I was 15. I was a
bed-wetter. You know what it is, the feeling of powerlessness when
you're 13 and you can't go to another house, the sense of
impotence? One of my great fears is not having an erection. New
York magazine was despicable in making me invisible. My father was
despicable in his indifference. My mother was insensitive and
hurtful. You ask me why I do what I do. Because I can.''

TV SPORTS: LITTLE TIME TO SPEAK AS NO. 61 LEAVES LIKE A BULLET

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire slugged his 61st home run with such ferocity Sunday
that Jon Miller of ESPN could not muster a classic call. Miller was
jolted out of a discussion of Roger Maris' family and the health
woes that prevented Maris' widow, Pat, from attending the game when
McGwire unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ball is gone if it's fair,'' Miller said, providing the
basics. ``It is a home run. No. 61. He has tied Maris.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller then said nothing for 1 minute 45 seconds as a montage of
25 images rolled by _ from McGwire picking up his son, Matt, to
McGwire's parents embracing to the Cubs' Sammy Sosa applauding in
right field _ before he added, ``Ray Lankford is the hitter,
although I don't think anyone has noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   On KMOX-AM, Jack Buck set up the count and the matchup between
McGwire and Cubs pitcher Mike Morgan, then said: ``Lookit there.
Lookit there. Lookit there. McGwire's No. 61. Flight 61, headed for
Planet Maris. History. Bedlam. What a moment. Pardon me while I
stand to applaud.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, to call McGwire's 60th home run, Buck also made
sure his words would enliven eternity's highlight reel, saying:
``Wake up, Babe Ruth, you're about to have company. And his name is
Mark McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   That call echoed Milo Hamilton's of Hank Aaron's 715th home run:
``There's a new home run champion of all time, and his name is
Henry Aaron.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fox made McGwire the undisputed centerpiece of its telecasts.
And rightly so. Who else cared Saturday or Sunday about a
Reds-Cardinals game? Why else would Fox lobby for Sunday's game,
then switch its start time from 2 to 4 p.m.?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think the first three innings of this game have had a
slant toward Mark McGwire,'' Joe Buck, Jack's son, said on Sunday,
``you're right.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Fox spent 26 minutes 53 seconds focused on McGwire _
Fox's cameras found him 132 times _ in the St. Louis dugout, the
on-deck circle, at first base, running the bases, at bat.
</P>
<P>
   Consequential time was spent with a camera lingering almost
longingly on shots of McGwire's back, mostly as he stood at the
Cardinals' helmet rack.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, with the story line McGwire and his 60 home runs vs.
Sosa and his 58, ESPN put McGwire in a far brighter spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's first-inning home run made ESPN's choice easy, but
ESPN almost froze out Sosa. McGwire would naturally get more time,
largely because there are many more plays at first base than in
right field. But ESPN favored McGwire with many more long dugout
and on-deck shots, and many more of his reactions to Sosa's at-bats
than Sosa's expressions when McGwire was batting.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN simply seemed to have better camera angles for McGwire than
for Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's cameras cut to McGwire 180 times, totaling 26:55, nearly
twice Sosa's 14:49, in 64 sightings.
</P>
<P>
   Both networks were in excellent form. Joe Buck enhanced his
standing as the best play-by-play announcer after Vin Scully, and
ESPN's Joe Morgan keeps battling Tim McCarver for analytic
supremacy. Morgan aptly used his memory of standing at second base
when Hank Aaron hit his 714th home run, while McCarver argued
vociferously for his friend Maris' induction into the Hall of Fame.
</P>

ASIDE FROM REJECTING CHERNOMYRDIN AGAIN, COMMUNISTS AGREE ON
LITTLE

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Monday might be one of those rare heady days for
Russia's post-Soviet communists, if only someone could say what a
post-Soviet communist is.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party in Russia's parliament, the legislature's
biggest, used to crumple under President Boris Yeltsin's glare.
Monday it contemptuously threw back his choice of Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister for the second time, demanding the
restoration of part of its old power and threatening to block a new
government _ and risk bringing Russia to its knees _ if need be.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, it is not clear even to Communists what is to
be done. Some unreconstructed radicals yearn to oust Yeltsin's
regime and restore the monopolistic control of Soviet days. Some
want state control of major industries and banks, but would leave
part of the private sector untouched. Some are so house-trained
that Yeltsin long ago invited them to join his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Even the party leader in the lower house of parliament, Gennady
Zyuganov, spoke approvingly in a radio interview last month of the
anti-crisis program once mounted by Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're struggling between two major ambitions,'' said Boris
Makarenko, deputy director of the Center for Political
Technologies, a research organization in Moscow. ``One is to become
a legitimate part of this political regime and play by the
constitutional rules. And the second ambition is to undo this
regime and restore the Soviet Communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only a division between factions or fragments of
the party,'' he said, ``but inside the soul of each of the
members.''
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, they do not seem right now to have much
of a choice. The Communist Party holds more than 30 percent of the
seats in the Duma, twice that of its closest rival, but virtually
nobody believes it could win a majority in a presidential election
or restore Soviet rule by force. Seventy-four years of misrule left
the party with a besmirched name among average citizens that not
even the current disastrous situation has erased. Its base is
middle-aged or elderly, party members of habit rather than
ideology, who are dying off in greater numbers with each passing
day.
</P>
<P>
   The party casts itself as the voice of the disenfranchised _
Russia's boom market, for sure _ but even there, strongmen like
Aleksandr Lebed, the former Army general and Siberian governor, and
the mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, have siphoned away loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves playing by the constitution, and for the moment, the
party is holding a strong hand. Besides a choice of several cabinet
ministers and a voice in economic policy, the Communists' principal
demand in the present standoff with Yeltsin is a rewrite of the
Russian constitution, shifting the nation away from an all-powerful
president toward parliamentary democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In a parliamentary democracy, the largest political party has
the greatest sway over policy. And for all their faults, the
Communists have the largest and deepest political organization in
all of Russia, with branches in the smallest towns, unions and
factories.
</P>
<P>
   That backdoor approach to regaining authority could give the
Communists real authority in setting Russian policy. On the other
hand, this week's brinksmanship could also prove disastrous for the
party, if Yeltsin dissolves the parliament and forces elections
that reduce the Communists' plurality _ something experts say is
entirely possible.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Communists gain new influence, the question that not
even they seem able to answer is what they would do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The party's official program, published on a World Wide Web that
Leonid Brezhnev would never have tolerated, states in unambiguously
Soviet terms that ``the principal struggle between capitalism and
socialism under whose mark the 20th century progressed is not
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Aleksandr Kuvayev, a Communist deputy from Moscow,
sounded Tuesday more like a Chamber of Commerce initiate. ``They
say we'll nationalize all private property. That's not true. We'll
only nationalize that which was illegally privatized,'' he said.
``We won't touch apartments, garden plots, small business. Small
business must develop.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zyuganov, the Communist leader in the lower parliament, or Duma,
first seemed to sign off on Chernomyrdin's appointment, then
denounced it, then seemed open to compromise and, Sunday, said that
Chernomyrdin ``spits at all the Soviet history'' and accused him of
seeking his own interests instead of the state's.
</P>
<P>
   Russian experts say his back-and-forth only mirrors the party's
own confusion. Far from the look-alike visages of the Khruschev and
Brezhnev eras, the Russian Communists in parliament Sunday count
among their ranks a millionaire banker, three cosmonauts, a leading
film actor and an instigator of treason charges against the former
Communist leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov, who is generally seen as pragmatic, spends much of his
time trying to juggle their interests. In particular, he has to
tend to the needs of the party's hard core of Soviet holdovers
while working closely enough with the government to maintain at
least some influence.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy balancing act. Communists in some other
countries like Poland have shifted rightward, leaving their
radicals to form smaller, less important parties, and some have
even regained power by democratic means.
</P>
<P>
   Some Communists say they are being true to the faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The backbone of the ideology has remained the Communist one,
and all attempts to impose a social democratic ideology are not
acceptable,'' said Yuri Chunkov, a Communist deputy from the
depressed coal-mining region of Kemerov in south-central Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   For Russian Communists, however, being one of the elite carries
its own political perils.
</P>
<P>
   Only three weeks ago, the leader of Russia's independent trade
unions said his workers would not unite with Zyuganov in calling
for a national day of protest on Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deputies failed to adopt a single socially significant law in
the interests of workers,'' the head of the unions, Andrei Isayev,
told the Interfax news service, suggesting an odd dissonance
between workers and the Communists.

CLINTON'S LAWYER ASKS FOR ADVANCE COPY OF STARR'S REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 7th graf to correct wording in first sentence) (sw) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's private lawyer requested on
Monday that Kenneth Starr, the independent prosecutor, allow him to
review at least a week in advance the report Starr is preparing for
Congress, in a sign the White House is readying a defense against
possible impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The request came as Clinton, according to some of his advisers,
is facing wrenching decisions about how to reassure Democrats at a
time that criticism of his handling of the Lewinsky affair is
mounting within his own party. One option is for him to apologize
again for his conduct, an approach he seemed to be inching toward
in Ireland last week. Another would be to disclose embarrassing
information or perhaps answer questions about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   With the House of Representative coming back into session on
Wednesday and mid-term elections just two months away, the prospect
of Starr's report has electrified the political atmosphere here,
alarming congressional Democrats and causing some to distance
themselves from the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's aides say that they are are still scrambling for a
strategy to take the political initiative in the country and the
Congress against Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Outside advisers to the president said that the White House is
not yet running the kind of aggressive, coherent damage control
operation that Clinton made famous when he first battled
accusations of dishonesty and adultery during the 1992 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the prosecutors on Monday, David Kendall,
Clinton's attorney, wrote that out of ``fundamental fairness,''
Starr should let him and the White House counsel review any report
early enough to permit them ``one week to submit a written reply.''
That reply, together with the report, might then be given to Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson, who has been supervising the grand jury in
Starr's investigation, or sent straight to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall argued that Starr may transmit information he has
gathered to the Congress, but that he is not authorized by law to
prepare a report that summarizes or analyzes it. And Congress, he
wrote, has in the past expressed concern that judgments made in
such a report could intrude on its constitutional responsibilities
in weighing impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that fundamental fairness dictates that we have the
opportunity to review such a document and submit simultaneously any
reply we wish to make,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr had no comment on the letter, a spokesman said on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have argued that Starr, a Republican, will
not produce a balanced report on his seven-month inquiry into
Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Noting that Starr's
witnesses have not been cross-examined, they are eager to produce a
report or memorandum providing their own interpretation of the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr refuses to provide the advance copy, White House aides
will argue that he is acting unfairly, trying to sandbag the
president by surprising him with a report that they expect to read
like an indictment, according to one adviser to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After almost three weeks away, the Clintons came back over the
long weekend to a capital turned suddenly hostile. After taking a
pasting from Senate Democrats last week, the White House is bracing
for the possibility of more criticism from House members who have
gotten an earful from constituents.
</P>
<P>
   To remind the public and his party of his legislative goals, the
president plans a series of campaign-style appearances, beginning
Tuesday by promoting a school modernization plan.
</P>
<P>
   But, fatigued by weeks of domestic and foreign crises, the
president and his aides are also trying to develop a legal and
political strategy to deal with the expected report. The Clintons'
time away from Washington _ first on vacation and then in Russia
and Ireland _ has hampered internal planning about the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understandably _ but strategically _ don't have a lot of
fizz right now,'' said one of the president's outside advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Another ally of Clinton said that a critical speech last
Thursday by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., may have shaken the
White House out of a sense that Clinton high approval ratings in
public polls would protect him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House has relied on polling and missed the real
danger of the political slow burn that began moments after the
speech,'' this ally said. ``A lot of us are hoping Senator
Lieberman's speech is the real wake-up call, causing a major and
fundamental change in the president's approach to this issue, not
an incremental one or a strategic one.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Clinton delivered a full-throated apology, some of his aides
believe, he would by now have the high ground in criticizing Starr.
Instead, Democrats' aggravation with Clinton has grown since his
speech, said one Democratic consultant advising several members of
Congress. ``You do get a sense _ maybe just temporarily _ the sense
that people are sort of done with it,'' he said. ``They're done
with him. There's not another escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's aides believe that Democrats have been
criticizing him in part out of fear that he report will contain
damaging information not yet disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some Clinton advisers are pushing his legal team to
release all records relating to Ms. Lewinsky that Starr has
obtained, like the logs of her visits to the White House. Then,
they argue, the president should answer detailed questions from
journalists about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Davis, a former White House special counsel, urged that
strategy when Clinton was responding to accusations about his 1996
campaign finances. He said that the White House should now ``help
reporters write all of the details of this story prior to the Starr
report, because fundamentally, the only chance we have of a
balanced presentation is if we put this information out
ourselves.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the view of some Democratic strategists, the president's high
approval ratings mask a more complex reaction to his admission of a
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster,
convened a group of 12 residents of York, Pennsylvania, on Monday
night to discuss the matter, in a session scrutinized at the White
House and elsewhere here last week.
</P>
<P>
   At first, no one wanted to discuss the matter. Then, he said, as
they got started talking, they became animated, describing feelings
of disappointment and even disgust with Clinton, comparing him to
an adolescent boy.
</P>
<P>
   But when Hart raised the idea of resignation or impeachment, he
said, ``they sort of pulled back.'' But they did not rule it out.
``They're just not there,'' he said. ``They need much more
information, they need more time.'' That is essentially the
position taken by Lieberman and other congressional Democrats _
stated disappointment combined with a wait-and-see attitude toward
what steps should be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on Hart's results, one White House official argued this
week that the public is watching Clinton ``like a hawk'' because of
the scandal, and is ``more attuned to what he's saying, not less.''
As a result, he said, Clinton's planned events could benefit him.
Clinton is scheduled on Wednesday to travel to Florida to raise
money for the Democratic Gubernatorial candidate, Buddy MacKay, and
to promote school safety.
</P>
<P>
   He will follow that, his aides say, with a blitz of public
appearances to push new safety regulation and health care
legislation and to address international economic troubles. In
particular, Clinton will emphasize his economic stewardship, his
central political theme since he first ran for president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But not many issues have penetrated the furor over Ms. Lewinsky
since Clinton acknowledged their relationship last month, despite
some potent contenders that include the U.S. attacks on suspected
terrorist sites in Afghanistan and the Sudan as well as the sharp
stock market decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaign-style events, I don't know if those can change the
subject,'' a Democratic strategist said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``The problem is everyone really has got their ear to
the ground for the big shoe of the Starr report to drop.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it is far from certain that Congress will pass
even the budget legislation necessary to prevent a government
shutdown, let alone act on the president's broad agenda.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., who has been a close ally of the
White House in seeking to tighten campaign finance laws, said that
it was difficult for the president ``to talk about restoring
integrity to the political process right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials say that, away from the uproar,
work is getting done. ``In our area, I think he's going to have the
best year in his administration,'' predicted Andrew Cuomo, the
secretary of housing and urban development.

3 KILLED AS STORMS BATTER N.Y. STATE AND CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Punishing thunderstorms and brutal hurricane-force
winds wrought destruction across a broad area of upstate New York
and around New York City Monday, battering houses, toppling power
lines, capsizing boats and causing at least three deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, a 19-year-old woman was killed when high winds
sent a tree branch crashing down on her head as she attended a
Labor Day barbecue in the courtyard of a housing project,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Authority officers at the Edenwald Houses, on East 229th
Street at Baychester Avenue, said the woman, whom officials
identified as Iesamama Neal, was sitting at a concrete chess table
with her 2-year-old brother when the branch plummeted. ``She was
able to push the 2-year-old under the table, which saved him,''
said Rosa Morales, the first Housing Authority officer to arrive on
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, two men were killed on the New York State Fair Grounds
in Syracuse shortly after 1 a.m., when winds gusting more than 75
miles an hour ripped the roofs from several buildings and branches
from trees and hurled the debris on top of the structures in which
the men were sleeping, according to state police and fair
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere around the city and state, the storms disrupted the
Labor Day holiday in ways both large and small, life-threatening
and pleasure-spoiling.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses lost power; in the
Syracuse and Rochester areas, utility company officials said
electricity might not be restored to some customers for as long as
a week. Fallen trees left many upstate roads impassable, and fallen
power lines rendered them perilous, prompting several counties,
cities and towns to prohibit any traffic other than emergency
vehicles and repair crews.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York City area, sudden torrential downpours between 2
p.m. and 4 p.m. sent spectators at the U.S. Open tennis tournament
in Flushing, Queens, and the West Indian American Day Carnival
parade in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, scurrying for shelter. And the
rains and winds stranded some boaters off the coasts of Long Island
and New Jersey, forcing the U.S. Coast Guard to conduct water and
air rescues.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service officials said that although the storm
systems that hit different areas of New York state were not
identical, they were born of the same conditions: the violent
collision of a late-summer heat wave with the leading edge of a
cold front auguring autumn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What energizes weather systems in general is strong
temperature contrasts,'' Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at
Pennsylvania State University, explained Monday afternoon. ``And
this morning, just ahead of this cold front, it was in the low
90s.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, temperatures may drop into the low 70s and even the
60s for the rest of the week, Gadomski and other meteorologists
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although people reported tornadoes in Syracuse, Bethpage and
Great Neck on Long Island, and in Rahway, N.J., National Weather
Service officials said Monday evening that they could not
definitively confirm that tornadoes had touched down in those
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people caught in the storms, which in some areas
included rapid-fire lightning and balls of hail, said they had
seldom witnessed anything like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a state of disbelief,'' said Terry Kennedy of Dewitt,
a suburb of Syracuse. One tree had fallen into Kennedy's roof,
another had flattened his daughter's car, and yet another had ended
up in a neighbor's swimming pool. But Kennedy, his wife and their
children expressed something akin to relief. ``Everybody's happy
that we're alive,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Syracuse and Rochester areas were perhaps the hardest hit.
Gov. George Pataki declared nine counties in that region to be in
states of emergency, which meant that the state would provide
financial and other resources to those counties if help was
requested.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Michalski, a spokesman for the New York State Emergency
Management Office, estimated that about 300,000 homes and
residences along a geographic band between Buffalo and Albany had
lost electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Utility company officials said that some might not regain power
for many days, and a few upstate school districts said that the
start of the school year, scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday, might
have to be postponed for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of people had to seek refuge at temporary shelters
because of damage to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Fair, which was supposed to be open for its
12th and last day Monday, had to remain closed because of damage to
the fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Michalski said that in addition to the deaths at the fairgrounds
of John Perry, 43, of Silver Creek, and Beryl Stone, 61, of Central
Square, more than a dozen other upstate residents were injured,
none critically.

<P>
   MENLO PARK, Calif._ With all due respect to Main Street
investors who grew a bit faint when the Dow Jones average plunged
6.4 percent in a day last week, the young workers riding their
stock options on Silicon Valley's roller coaster have a message:
really, that's nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Onsale, Inc., an online auction house where, like many
ventures in the Internet field, virtually every employee has a
package of stock options that may (or may not) be a big part of
their net worth some day, wild swings in the company's stock price
go with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the year-and-a-half since the company went public, the
stock has been as low as $4 5/8 a share and as high as $36 13/16,
with plenty of dips and rises along the way. In the past week
alone, it careened from a low of $13 7/8 to a high of $21, finally
closing at $16 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get used to it after awhile,'' said 30-year-old Jack
Herndon, the director of installed base marketing at Onsale, a
cyber auction house that sells an eclectic array of goods, from
computer equipment to rattlesnake meat to a human-shaped inflatable
rubber device used for boxing practice known as the Slam Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here from a company that went from an all-time high to
an all-time low in a matter of months,'' Herndon said with a shrug.
``One day it went from 42 to 24 overnight, then down to 11. I
watched in 36 hours a significant amount of money not yet in my
wallet burn before my eyes. It happens.''
</P>
<P>
   More than in almost any other industry, stock options have
fueled the boom in Silicon Valley and in other regions of the
country where high-technology and Internet businesses are
congregated, allowing start-up companies to pay smart, ambitious
workers a relatively low salary _ along with the promise of great
riches if their sweat and creativity help these ventures succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, that phenomenon seems to have sparked a unique
brand of investment psychology that can be gleaned from talks with
employees like those at Onsale, each of whom describes his or her
own method of coping with the kind of volatility that might turn
the stomachs of the most hardened investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, OK, I do check the price at least once a day, just
to see where it is,'' said 29-year-old Debbie Rodriguez, a customer
service supervisor. ``But I don't calculate what it's all worth
when it goes down. I calculate it for its potential, what I think
it's really worth because I know how hard everybody at this company
is working, and that helps.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Stefanie Elkins, a manager of investor relations, also
29, ``The swings are all a part of the gamble, the whole Silicon
Valley mentality. I think there's a whole, almost pioneer attitude,
especially with Internet companies _ it's, `Let's try this, let's
see if we can get it to work, let's see if we can get it to a point
where the stock options are really worth something.' There's a
thrill in trying. If it doesn't work, you move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Petrossian, a vice president for engineering at Onsale,
said short-term swings in the stock market are not the best way to
measure the true value of a company in a fast-changing field such
as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being human, I do watch the stock price,'' said Petrossian.
``It's a way to see how other people value your work externally.
But I'm at this company for the long-term, and I have my own way of
valuing the stock. And from day one, in terms of the fundamentals,
nothing has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Many employees insisted that stock options were not the main
attraction that drew them to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roller coaster is fun and it's interesting, but it's
really not the reason I'm here,'' said John Dean, a 39-year-old
vice president in charge of a newly launched division offering
travel products, including bidding for weekly time-shares in a
Mexican beach condominium. Auctions at Onsale are carried on just
like more traditional ones, where bidders raise their hands. In
this case, though, bidders click on an icon to bid, or leave secret
instructions on how high they are willing to bid.)
</P>
<P>
   For Dean, the real thrill comes when he can watch a last-minute
bidding war erupt during Onsale's ``Going... going... gone''
feature, a fast-paced affair that means fast profits for the
company. ``When those bids go up,'' he said, ``It's exciting. It's
better than watching the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock options, which essentially represent an agreement by a
company to make shares available to an employee for a specified
price in the future, can yield great profits when the company's
stock soars, or be worth literally nothing if it plunges. While not
commonly offered across the work force in many industries, they are
virtually standard in places like Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet companies have grown up in an environment where
this idea is a part of the culture,'' said Matt Ward, chief
executive officer of WestWard Pay Strategies Inc., a San
Francisco-based firm that develops incentive compensation packages
for many Silicon Valley companies. ``I'm not sure you could even
get people to work in this field in a situation where you're not
giving them a piece of the action.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jerry Kaplan, a founder and chief executive officer of
Onsale: ``I like to say that Silicon Valley has perfected many of
the principles laid out by Karl Marx. In his terms, workers control
the means of production. In our terms, every employee is an owner
of the company.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Of course, low-level workers in the 200-employee company have
just a fraction of the share options of a founding executive like
Kaplan. Still, with even those employees generally having options
on at least a few thousand shares, the potential rewards for
everyone at the company are great, and many workers here say it
builds camaraderie that would not exist if everyone were on
straight salary.
</P>
<P>
   The fluctuations in stock price for Onsale are by no means
atypical, especially among Internet companies. But partly because
stock options take effect over a set period of time, typically four
years, worrying over today's price swings is a bit like worrying
about the weather. There's no point to jumping out of windows when
the stock plunges, or burning $1,000 bills when it soars _ what
really counts is what the stock will be worth the day an employee
decides to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, you don't hear employees talking a lot about changes
in the stock price, and you don't have a lot of people clicking the
refresh button on the browser all day to see what the latest trade
is,'' said Diane Hunt, a spokeswoman for Yahoo! Inc., the Santa
Clara, Calif.-based firm that markets a popular Internet search
engine.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Yahoo! stock has swayed from $17 1/16 a share
to $103 3/4. But, Ms. Hunt said: ``You don't focus on it. Everyone
here knows that if you run a good business, with sound
fundamentals, and you stick to your plan, the stock price will take
care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at Onsale, many people said outside shareholders seemed to
be more concerned about stock-price swings than those inside the
headquarters, a drab two-story building in an industrial stretch of
Menlo Park, where many workers are so busy with online projects
they lack time to even decorate their office wall.
</P>
<P>
   Anytime the stock drops, said Brian Fawkes, vice president for
corporate communications, ``I get dozens of calls from
shareholders, who want to know why is the stock going down and what
are you going to do to make it go up? But not once has an employee
come to me and asked why.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Fawkes and Kaplan say that such swings are common and that
the company and its workers remain focused on long-term growth.
Once in awhile, though, says the convivial Kaplan, author of
``Startup: A Silicon Valley Adventure,'' a book about a prior,
unsuccessful bid of his into pen-based computers, Onsale employees
cannot resist offering callers a more basic explanation for why the
stock price dropped: ``There were more sellers than buyers today.''
</P>
<P>
   Onsale is one of the main competitors in the burgeoning online
auction field, a sort of cyber bazaar in which visitors to the
company's Web site (onsale.com) are offered a chance to bid on
items (including, in a recent charity event, a date at Spago's in
Los Angeles with Ms. California) while online spectators
(``lurkers,'' in company lingo) watch the action. Many buyers type
in comments along with their bids. ``Stop bidding _ it's
refurbished!'' and ``Please, let me have it _ need to get this for
Grandma's birthday'' were two recent entries.
</P>
<P>
   While the company is both a pioneer and current leader in online
auctions, its product can hardly be patented, and how it will fare
in a competitive field where some experts expect annual sales to
climb to $1 billion remains unclear. But even that is part of the
appeal of working there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed to me like a lot of really exciting things were
happening with Internet companies,'' said Kristin Westland, 29, a
human resource manager, who came here two years ago after spending
several years as a struggling actress in Los Angeles (she did
manage to land a bit part in a ``Seinfeld'' episode).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very tired of LA, the insecurity of all that, the
multitude of jobs, never knowing if a break was going to happen,''
said Ms. Westland. So she gave it up for the insecurity and the
never-knowing if a break is going to happen of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Like many workers at the company, Ms. Westland has no children.
Even as she described the excitement of trying to help make Onsale
a dominant business in the auction field, she paused when asked
whether she would feel the same way if she had a family to support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids?'' she said. ``I don't know. Wow. You're really
mortgaging your future at that point. I don't know. Kids would make
it a whole new ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for now, Onsale's employees seem very happy to put in 12-
to 14-hour days for a lower salary than they might otherwise get _
as long as they retain the chance to strike it rich down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here, I was like, `Hey! Stock options!' ''
said Ms. Rodriguez, who came to Onsale from a job selling compact
discs and videos in a local store. ``This is new to me, this is a
first. I actually have stock options in something.''

A MUSICIAN'S LIFE, NOW IN PAPERBACK 
AS THE SONG GOES, `THINK PINK'
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHARLES STRUM with Joyce Wadler   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles Michener was watching a violent thunderstorm
blow through Litchfield County, Conn., Sunday afternoon and talking
about his friend Peter Duchin, whose autobiography, ``Ghost of a
Chance'' (Random House), he helped write two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the book was written, he had a hard time being alone,''
said Michener, now a senior editor at The New Yorker. ``Since then,
he's developed that capacity. It also brought him much closer to
his children. He was discovering himself as he wrote it.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, just released in paperback, is the story of a poor
little rich boy, the son of the bandleader Eddy Duchin and his
vivacious wife, a member of Newport and New York society, Marjorie
Oelrichs, who died just days after giving birth, in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   The peripatetic father leaves him in the care of friends, Marie
and Averell Harriman, in their many homes from Sun Valley, Idaho,
to Hobe Sound, Fla. His companions were gardeners, gamekeepers and
maids.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't running into Joe DiMaggio at the Broadway
restaurant of his father's pal Toots Shor, he was hobnobbing at
parties with Fred Astaire or dancing the night away with Kim Novak,
who played his mother in the film ``The Eddy Duchin Story.''
</P>
<P>
   And as soon as he was old enough, he was sent to boarding school
_ first Eaglebrook, then Hotchkiss and on to Yale, where he was
Class of '59 and Michener was Class of '62.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie Onassis made the original contact,'' Michener recalled.
``She said: `You should do Peter's book. It's a very amazing kind
of fairy tale, a strange story.''' Michener said that after the
book was written, Mrs. Onassis offered to be a kind of ``ghost
editor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a day with her,'' Michener said. ``She was very
candid about the similarities with her own life,'' referring to the
feeling that as a Roman Catholic and a child of divorce, she was
somehow an outsider in her own circle.
</P>
<P>
   Duchin still travels a good deal and maintains a hectic schedule
of orchestra bookings, but this weekend even Michener couldn't
track him down, not in Newport at a cotillion or at the Whitneys in
Saratoga. He was at the wedding of his daughter Courtnay, in
Montana, where Duchin, an expert fly-fisherman, is more likely to
be found in waders than in a dinner jacket.
</P>
<P>
   As the Song Goes, `Think Pink'
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The lights on 14 of the city's most famous buildings
will go pink this week in honor of the fight against breast cancer
and the coming New York Race for the Cure.
</P>
<P>
   The fellow who figuratively _ and at times literally _ changes
the fixtures is Scott Thurm, the 40-year-old president of Universe
Lighting. The longtime lighting consultant for the Empire State
Building, the first building to go pink, back in '94, Thurm helped
devise the pink glow of the Lincoln Center fountain and brought in
his own crew to do the lights on the Chrysler Building, when it was
bankrupt last year. (This year, with new owners, things are easier,
Thurm reports.)
</P>
<P>
   This season's most difficult site?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crown Building,'' Thurm said. ``They have high-pressure
sodium fixtures that produce yellow lights. I'm not saying it's
brain surgery to make the color pink come out of yellow light, but
there's quite a bit of testing and sampling.''
</P>
<P>
   And how did the Empire State Building happen to go pink?
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Ruth, the spokeswoman for the building, said: ``I lost my
mother to breast cancer when I was 22. I also almost lost a best
friend. So many people look at the building as a barometer for
what's going on in the city. I thought, what better way to bring
attention to breast cancer research.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ruth's mother was Patricia Ruth of Harrisburg, Pa. ``She was
tall, with black hair,'' Ms. Ruth said. ``She played the piano,
painted and wrote poetry. When she was younger, people compared her
to Hedy Lamarr. She lived one year after they discovered the cancer
and died Nov. 8, 1969. Some dates you don't forget.''

<P>
   SANDIA, N.M. _ Rising 10,378 feet into the desert air, Sandia
Mountain is more than a picturesque backdrop to Albuquerque, a city
of more than 400,000 people. It is an escape valve for a booming
Sunbelt city.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Forest Service, the mountain, 15 minutes
from downtown Albuquerque, plays host annually to 1 million hikers
and picnickers, 275,000 cable-car riders, 50,000 bird watchers,
10,000 rock climbers and 10,000 hang gliders.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with shock that Albuquerque residents learned in
August that a federal judge in Washington had ordered the federal
government to transfer ownership of the mountain's western face,
9,400 acres of wilderness in the Cibola National Forest, to Sandia
Pueblo, an American Indian tribe with 481 enrolled members. The
judge based his decision on 18th-century land grant documents.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Lujan, the governor of Sandia Pueblo, on the city's
northern edge, quickly promised to keep open ``hiking trails and
other recreational uses'' in the area. Lujan also said the tribe
would allow access to three privately owned white neighborhoods,
which would be surrounded by pueblo land.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is considering an appeal and has until
Sept. 15 to file it. But in the meantime, residents are becoming
gloomy about the outcome and fearful that the promises of access
might not be kept.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Pletta, owner of the Stone Age Climbing Gym, an
Albuquerque business, said he did not believe Lujan's promises that
rock climbing would be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the pueblo claims it will maintain public access
to the mountain, just about all the rock climbing areas on pueblo
lands in New Mexico have been shut,'' Pletta said. ``There are
countless areas in the state that historically have been climbed
that are now shut down. There is no place that I know of where I
can climb on Indian land.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is not an isolated one. Land-use conflicts between
American Indians and whites are becoming increasingly common in the
West.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, for example, the Tigua Tribe is seeking to win
ownership of Hueco Tanks State Park, a favorite destination for
hikers and climbers from El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, the Tohono O'odham Tribe is seeking, through a
congressional bill, to win ownership of the eastern half of
Baboquivari Mountain, which is in a national wildlife refuge near
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, the Washoe Tribe is pressuring the Forest Service to
ban climbing on Cave Rock, a sacred lava plug overlooking Lake
Tahoe.
</P>
<P>
   In Wyoming, a federal judge upheld this spring what the National
Park Service called a ``voluntary ban'' on climbing Devils Tower in
June, a month when American Indians from 20 tribes gather there to
perform religious ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandia is part of a trend,'' said William Pendley, president
of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, a Denver law firm that
lost the challenge to the June climbing ban at Devils Tower. ``But
what makes Sandia pop up on the radar screen is that you have all
those city folks in Albuquerque screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the ruling in the Sandia Mountain case, by Judge Harold
Greene of U.S. District Court, stepped on some of the biggest toes
in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico owns a house in one of the three
enclaves, Sandia Heights North, a neighborhood of $1-million houses
and three-car garages.
</P>
<P>
   ``My house is up against the edge of the National Forest,'' said
the governor, a Republican, who currently lives in an official
residence in Santa Fe. ``If this decision is upheld, that land
could be developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, saying that he had been a contributor to the Sandia
Mountain Coalition, asserted, ``It was my understanding that the
issue was killed and dead and buried.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, when Pete Domenici of New Mexico was a freshman
senator, he sponsored legislation that protected as wilderness 94
percent of the mountain land that now is to be transferred to
Sandia Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the judge did this right,'' Domenici, a
Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee, said recently.
Referring to the tribe, the senator said, ``From the research I
have done, I never thought it owned that whole mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the advent of casino gambling on the pueblo three years
ago, the Indian-white political equation changed. Today, this tiny
tribe shows no signs of being cowed. It is using its casino profits
to advance its land case, hiring an anthropologist, a Washington
lobbyist and three law firms _ one in Albuquerque and two in
Washington. Since Greene's decision became public, Lujan has
shuttled between here and Washington, meeting White House
officials, congressmen, and high-ranking federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been lobbying various agencies to try to avoid an
appeal,'' Lujan said.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The dispute dates to 1748, when Spain's colonial governor
vaguely defined the pueblo's eastern, or mountain border. Today,
250 years later, documents interpreting the pueblo's boundaries
have resulted in dueling reports from two former New Mexico state
historians.
</P>
<P>
   One, Stanley Hordes, said in a study for the Forest Service that
Spanish colonial authorities granted Sandia Indians a standard
four-square-league area. He insisted that the grant extended one
league _ 2.6 miles _ from the pueblo's church to the foothills of
Sandia Mountain, covering an area of about 27 square miles. He
added, ``There is nothing ambiguous about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hordes, a specialist in colonial Mexican history, further
asserted that in the 1850s when the new U.S. authorities were
resurveying Spanish land grants, the pueblo was given more land
than it was entitled to have. Hordes said that a U.S. government
translator, suspicious of what he called the ``evil disposed
Mexicans,'' expanded pueblo land by nearly 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The other former state historian, Myra Ellen Jenkins, who
prepared a report for the pueblo, had a different interpretation of
the original grant. Saying that the pueblo's land extended to the
crest of Sandia Mountain, Ms. Jenkins wrote, ``The language was
equally clear that the Sandia range itself was intended as the east
boundary.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene's ruling, which added the west flank of Sandia Mountain
to the pueblo land, followed Ms. Jenkins' interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   If the ruling stands, Hordes said, the small tribe would end up
with nearly twice the area granted by Spain. It would control 53
square miles adjacent to the most densely populated part of New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Hill, a University of New Mexico anthropology professor,
conceded that ``there is a little ambiguity.'' But he argued:
``When in doubt, we should be a little generous with native claims.
Native peoples went through massacres.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, soon after Spain colonized New Mexico in 1598, Spanish
governors imposed taxes, forced labor and religious conversion on
the Sandia Indians. After a pueblo revolt in 1680, Spanish
commanders looted and burned the pueblo twice, forcing surviving
Indians to flee west, taking refuge in Hopi villages.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the 20th century, Albuquerque homeowners and
hang gliders show little interest in atoning for the sins of
17th-century Spanish soldiers. They say that after 150 years of
U.S. rule here, it is too late to start redrawing boundaries,
whether for legal or religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we so self-deceived we presume the tribes `know' what
sacred is, and we do not?'' asked Tom Stribling, a resident of
Evergreen Hills, one of the three white neighborhoods. Residents
there make do with solar power, propane gas and cellular phones
because they say the pueblo has refused to allow utilities to cross
its land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking this public resource solely for their private religion
diminishes and deprives us all of something sacred,'' Stribling
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lujan denies the pueblo blocked the extension of utilities.
</P>
<P>
   And Montoya, the pueblo land official, retorted: ``We are not
going to prevent ambulances from going in, we are not going to cut
off utilities, we are not going to cut off roads.''
</P>
<P>
   For 25 years, Mark Mocho has been running along the crest of
Sandia Peak and then jumping off, sometimes soaring halfway to
Texas on his hang glider. Now, he is afraid that his club, the
Sandia Soaring Association, could lose access to what he calls
``one of the best flying sites in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through this once before,'' Mocho said, recounting a
1983 transfer of Forest Service land to the Cochiti Pueblo, about
35 miles north of here. Under the transfer, he said, existing-use
permits were to be honored for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weekend after the transfer went through, they built a
fence across the access, and told us we couldn't fly there,'' said
Mocho, a computer programmer. ``There was no way we could sue a
sovereign entity. It has happened to us once before. We are afraid
it could happen to us once again.''

POLLING CONFIRMS IT: FRITZ IS STILL FIRST

<P>
   &UR; POLLING CONFIRMS IT: FRITZ IS STILL FIRST &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the main worries that Democrats have about heading off
further Republican gains in the Senate this fall is Ernest F.
Hollings of South Carolina. Hailing from a state that has been
turning more Republican with each election, Hollings, a moderate
Democrat in his fourth decade in the Senate, only narrowly won
re-election in 1992 and this year faces an even tougher challenger,
Rep. Bob Inglis, a hard-right conservative from Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   But a new Mason-Dixon poll offers some fresh hope for the
senator. Conducted at the end of August for The Charleston Post and
Courier, it found Hollings, commonly known as Fritz, leading Inglis
by 48 percent to 40 percent, a slight increase over the 47-to-42
lead the senator held in June.
</P>
<P>
   While the increase may be small, political analysts say it looms
large, because it indicates that the momentum Inglis built earlier
in the year is slowing. The analysts also note that the gain came,
significantly, after Hollings had opened a major television and
radio advertising campaign and at a time when Democratic candidates
everywhere were trying to duck fallout from the Clinton-Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd figure that with everything going on with Bill Clinton,
and South Carolina being an increasingly conservative Republican
state, it would have been the opposite,'' Del Ali, the director of
the poll, told The Post and Courier.
</P>
<P>
   The senator attributes his larger lead to an increasing
awareness among voters that he can bring home the bacon, whereas
Inglis, he contends, has a habit _ one he boasts about _ of voting
against most federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis, a three-term member of the House, counters by saying the
senator is a ``slow-moving 32-year incumbent who's limping.'' He
predicts he will soon overtake Hollings, having saved most of his
energy and money for a final dash to November. Perhaps. But in the
most recent campaign finance reports, Hollings had $1.78 million in
the bank, Inglis only $440,000.
</P>
<P>
   There is other good news in the new poll for Hollings, and it
may be even more important in the long run. In the June survey, the
senator's favorability rating was 49 percent; in the new poll, it
had increased to 53 percent. Similarly, in the June survey Inglis'
unfavorability rating stood at 8 percent; by the end of August, it
had jumped to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the new poll, which surveyed 806 voters and had a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points,
found that blacks preferred the senator over Inglis by 76 percent
to 7 percent. In a state whose population is almost one-third black
and whose Democratic Party membership is considerably more than
one-third black, heavy black turnout in November would clearly be a
boon to the incumbent.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A FAVORITE SON: IN NEVADA, `NONE'  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   How turned off is the American voter this year?
</P>
<P>
   If turnout is any measure, there is a lot of ``disaffection,
disinterest and disengagement'' out there, says Curtis Gans,
director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.
</P>
<P>
   When Gans took a look at turnout in the first 16 states to hold
primaries this year, he found that only 17 percent of all citizens
old enough to vote had shown up at the polls. Ten of the 16 states
had record lows, with Texas the lowest of all at 7.6 percent. If
that trend continues, Gans says, 1998 will end up being the worst
year ever for voter participation.
</P>
<P>
   But turnout is not the only measure of turnoff.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the primaries held last Tuesday in Nevada, a state that
has a ballot line like no other. Since 1975, it has offered any
voter willing to turn out the option of choosing ``none of these
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 33 actual candidates for statewide office last Tuesday,
17 finished behind ``none.'' And while ``none'' never came up a
winner, it did come up with a solid 24 percent of the vote in the
Democratic primary for lieutenant governor, enough for a
second-place finish behind Rose McKinney-James, who won with 49
percent. The third-place candidate captured only 16 percent, and
the fourth-place finisher 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``None'' finished third in four other Nevada primaries, some of
them with half a dozen or more contenders, getting 16 percent of
the vote in the Republican race for comptroller, 15 percent in the
Republican race for state treasurer, 12 percent in the Democratic
race for governor and 11 percent in the Republican race for
lieutenant governor. In none of those races did ``none'' trail the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Nevada law that established the ``none'' ballot line
(all efforts to repeal it have failed ), votes for ``none'' are
counted only as expressions of dissatisfaction: should ``none'' run
first, victory goes to the second-place finisher.
</P>
<P>
   So while ``none'' has actually finished first in some minor
races over the years, under the law ``none'' can never be a winner
_ except with the dissatisfied.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   When Sen. Fred Thompson was on ``Larry King Live'' the other
night, King asked him whether he planned to run for president in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' the Tennessee Republican replied in his
gravelly drawl. ``Haven't had a chance to give it much thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is the place to recall that besides being a
politician, Thompson is an actor. He does mainly movies, but in
this run-up to Election 2000, any stage will do.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 18 months, the senator has made appearances in no
fewer than 25 states, prominent among them presidential campaign
hot spots like Iowa and California. And in coming months, aides
say, he plans even more appearances around the country, including
several return trips to California, followed by stops in Virginia,
Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, Maryland, Kentucky and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   He's thinking about something.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the testing-the-waters process, of course. And
Thompson is just one of some two dozen who are now doing it,
insisting all the while, in most cases, that they're not truly
concentrating on it, not yet, not really, not seriously.
</P>
<P>
   So when will Thompson get serious?
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the year,'' he told King, ``after these next
campaigns _ first of next year _ I'll sit down and take a look at
it.''  &QL;

GEORGE H. BUCHI, 77, ORGANIC CHEMIST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Mass., N.H. Ill.)   (jw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON

<P>
   George Hermann Buchi, an organic chemist who laid the groundwork
for what became modern organic photochemistry, died on Aug. 28
while hiking with his wife in his native Switzerland, according to
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was 77 and lived in
Cambridge, Mass., and Jackson, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Buchi retired from MIT as the Dreyfus professor of chemistry
emeritus in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   His research contributed to organic chemistry and its myriad
industrial applications. His work in the 1950s on the effects of
light on reactions among carbon-based compounds helped convert the
largely barren field of organic photochemistry into a fruitful area
of research.
</P>
<P>
   Buchi determined the structure of some 55 natural substances and
the synthesis of more than 75 complex natural products. Many of the
syntheses covered in his more than 200 scientific papers produced
quantities of a compound in just a few simple steps.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a productive teacher. During his tenure at MIT,
Buchi trained 70 Ph.D.'s and more than 100 postdoctoral students,
many of whom rose to leadership positions in academia and industry
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, MIT gave him its prestigious James R. Killian Jr. Award
and Lecture, saying: ``His contributions in research and education
have added to the quality of life globally, and his colleagues and
students have derived direct benefit from his wisdom, dedication to
excellence and friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Baden, Switzerland, George Buchi graduated in chemical
engineering from the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich in
1945 and earned a doctorate in organic chemistry there two years
later.
</P>
<P>
   He was a Firestone postdoctoral fellow at the University of
Chicago before accepting a faculty appointment at MIT in 1951. He
advanced to full professor in 1958 and was named Dreyfus professor
in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The recipient of many awards and honorary doctorates, he was
elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1965. He was a
consultant to chemical companies in the United States and
Switzerland and held more than 30 U.S. patents.
</P>
<P>
   Buchi is survived by his wife of 43 years, Anne Barkman Buchi,
and a brother, Heinrich, of Bern.

RECORDER STOPPED WORKING SIX MINUTES BEFORE CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite from 11th graf onward.)  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ A preliminary examination of the flight
data recorder from Swissair Flight 111, indicates that it survived
the crash on Wednesday night but had stopped working about six
minutes before the MD-11 plunged into the sea off Nova Scotia, the
chief investigator said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Vic Gerden, said the finding was
disappointing, but added that that the data recorder should still
have preserved a huge volume of data on hundreds of aspects of the
plane's operation before it dipped below 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If indeed we have the flight data information down to 10,000
feet, we will have a lot of information,'' Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder appears to have quit when the plane
dipped below 10,000 feet, at about the time of the last radio
transmission from the crew, and about the time that the
transponder, a device that tells the ground-based radar the plane's
identity and altitude, also stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder is one of the two ``black boxes'' on
the plane. The other is the cockpit voice recorder, which has not
yet been retrieved. The cockpit voice recorder runs on the same
circuit as the data recorder, so it is also likely to be blank for
the last six minutes, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers on Monday homed in on the signal but failed to find
the precise location of the box before diving was halted for 36
hours because of sea swells reaching up to 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity to the recorders could have been cut off by a
malfunction, experts said, or if the pilots followed the standard
procedure for fighting on-board fires by sequentially shutting down
parts of the electric system.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft experts said the MD-11 has a three-position toggle
switch that allows the pilot to sequentially turn off a third of
the electric systems at a time. The procedure is to switch off one
of the three systems and wait up to one minute to see if the smoke
abates. If it does not, the switch is moved to another position,
restarting the first system and turning off the next one.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's two transponders, however, operate on two different
electrical circuits, so if the pilots had followed this toggle
procedure and nothing else was wrong, the transponder should not
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder is a very strong box packed with rows
of computer data storage chips, called ``nonvolatile storage,''
because unlike the memory chips in a desktop computer, they hold
their data when the power fails.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder on this MD-11 tracks 250 different parameters, or
aspects of the flight, investigators said Monday. That makes it one
of the most advanced ever analyzed after a big crash. By contrast,
Trans World Airlines Flight 800, an older Boeing 747 that exploded
off Long Island, N.Y., two years ago, had 17 parameters, and USAir
427, a Boeing 737 that crashed near Pittsburgh four years ago, had
11.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic parameters measure such factors as the plane's
heading, air speed, vertical acceleration and engine function. More
advanced planes like the MD-11, with computerized cockpits, record
the functioning of dozens of other systems, showing what commands
were given in the cockpit and the position of the rudder, flaps and
other flight-control surfaces. It should record the functioning of
the cabin smoke alarm and lavatory smoke alarm, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in other recent crashes of computerized aircraft,
like the Boeing 767 that hit a mountain near Cali, Colombia, in
December 1995, investigators have retrieved cockpit components and
extracted data from them _ for as long as they had electrical
power.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder could also show much about what the crew knew, and
when they knew it. ``Will the flight data recorder reveal a
steadily worsening situation that was somehow masked to the crew?''
said one investigator. If that is the case, said the investigator,
``by the time the crew realizes they can't fly the plane, the show
is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson for flight safety, he said, would be to set up
aircraft equipment or cockpit computers differently, to give
earlier warning, or more emphatic warning, of whatever doomed
Swissair 111.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police also have high hopes for the
information on the flight data recorder. ``Our investigation is
either going to accelerate sharply or decline sharply on the basis
of the box,'' said Chief Superintendent Stephen Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden, the chief investigator, said engineers would have to
translate the raw data of the flight data recorder into usable
data. He would not say when he expected results.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board on
Monday sent its chief flight data recorder expert to Ottawa to
help. On Monday evening, the Canadian Navy was expecting the
arrival by plane of two U.S. Navy salvage experts, who are arriving
two days in advance of their ship, the Grapple, which is on its
from Philadelphia. The Grapple was a mainstay of the recovery
operation of TWA 800 off Long Island two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This recovery effort may be quite different. The water is
substantially deeper, up to 190 feet vs. 120 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Phil Webster of the Navy said that the two divers who
picked up the flight data recorder Sunday had had to surface
quickly, because one of them had a leak in his suit; his partner
managed to hold onto the black box, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two were put in a decompression chamber and later taken to a
hospital overnight; they have been sent home and barred from diving
for two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary indications are that the debris field here is much
smaller than in the TWA investigation. Investigators hope that the
black boxes will tell them enough about the location of the problem
that they can pick and choose what parts of the plane to retrieve.
</P>
<P>
   But the human remains appear to be much more fragmented.
Maritime officials said they would soon begin towing subsurface
nets, like those used for fishing, to find human remains floating
beneath the surface; in the meantime, they have expanded their
shoreline search to a greater area, because of reports of debris
and remains washing ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention centered Monday on whether the crew should have
attempted a direct landing from its cruise altitude of 33,000 feet,
even though the plane was 30 metric tons above maximum landing
weight. The plane can dump only a little over 2.5 tons per minute.
And it was only 30 miles from the runway; a normal descent from
33,000 feet begins more than 100 miles out.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair executives have said the plane could not have landed
directly.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden, asked if the plane could theoretically have done so,
said, ``That calculation obviously is going to be made and it will
be considered.'' But, he said, the crew was busy trying to fight
smoke and prepare to land at an unexpected airport. ``It would be
misleading just to provide one simple piece of information like
that,'' he said.

CANDIDATES TRY TO ENLIVEN N.Y. PRIMARY CAMPAIGNS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Entering the final week of the Democratic primary
campaign, candidates marched through rain-drenched parades, crowded
picnic areas, television studios and shopping malls on Monday,
using Labor Day to try to turn attention to low-voltage contests
that appear to have done little to engage Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   As candidates seized on what traditionally has been the start of
fall campaigns in New York, several Democrats said they were
concerned that the pressure to avoid a replay of the fractious 1992
Democratic Senate primary had produced a race this year so
somnolent that it was in danger of being missed by most of the
public.
</P>
<P>
   There was increasing evidence Sunday of frustration at the lack
of attention, particularly in the contests for Senate and governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attention TV stations: The election is exactly one week from
tomorrow,'' announced a sarcastic advisory that went to television
news directors from the headquarters of one Senate candidate, Mark
Green, New York City's Public Advocate. ``If you plan on covering
the primary, it's probably advisable for you to start soon.''
</P>
<P>
   To depress matters some more, a squall of thunderstorms that cut
across New York at the peak of the campaign day forced candidates
to scrap parts of their schedules or improvise in their efforts to
turn the tide of the races.
</P>
<P>
   Another Senate candidate, former congresswoman Geraldine
Ferraro, spent the afternoon eating an Italian lunch with aides at
a Staten Island restaurant after the storm rained out the Staten
Island Fair and toppled a tree atop the trunk of her silver Lincoln
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, a candidate for governor, drove
up and down the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway as her aides worked
the cell phones, looking for an indoor venue where she might be
allowed to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, another candidate for Senate, and City
Council Speaker Peter Vallone, who is running for governor, joined
almost all the other candidates at the West Indian American Day
Carnival Parade in Brooklyn. The rain forced Vallone to put off one
stop, shaking hands at a pool in the Bronx, and it prompted Schumer
to give up for the day and head home.
</P>
<P>
   The day's events _ or lack thereof _ neatly summarized two races
that have proved far more orderly than had been expected just four
months ago. The main contests involve coming up with candidates to
challenge Gov. George Pataki and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, both
Republicans seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much less interest in it than we all expected,'' said
Mario Cuomo, the former Democratic governor.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo suggested that activity might pick up this week,
particularly in the Senate race, which polls and political analysts
suggest appears more competitive than the race for governor.
However, the Senate candidates and their aides all pronounced
themselves satisfied with their campaigns to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``My campaign started from the beginning saying we are going to
talk about my ideas, we're going to talk about my record,'' Schumer
said at a breakfast before the parade. ``I've said, stick to my
record, stick to my ideas, and it has been working, so why change
course?''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats offered a number of explanations for what seems to be
a quiet denouement of the Senate campaign. More than anything,
memories of the quarrelsome 1992 Democratic Senate primary, which
many Democrats believe accounted for D'Amato's 1-percentage-point
victory, produced pressure on the candidates to limit their
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Only Green has pushed the boundary so far, though his attempts
to draw differences on positions between himself and Schumer have
not come close to resembling the attacks on Ms. Ferraro's business
dealings that characterized the last race.
</P>
<P>
   The other two candidates for governor are Brooklyn District
Attorney Charles Hynes and James Larocca, a former state
transportation commissioner. Hynes marched in the Brooklyn parade,
but Larocca spent much of his day at home on Long Island, where, he
said, he did television interviews.

 DARK SKIES BUT GRAND TOTALS ON SPA'S CLOSING DAY

<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ After six weeks of sunny weather, the
Saratoga season ended in rain on Monday. But it could not put a
damper on the booming business of the 130th racing season here: an
increase of 7.4 percent in attendance and 5.6 percent in betting at
a time when the racing industry is searching for good omens in the
face of widespread decline.
</P>
<P>
   The wet weather turned the track sloppy and caused many
scratches, including Distorted Humor, one of the favorites for the
Forego Handicap, the closing-day feature. The 3-5 favorite in the
race, Wild Rush, ran fourth and last, while Affirmed Success was
gliding over the mud and winning by eight lengths in front of
14,812 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for seasonal honors, John Velazquez rode three
winners to edge the injured Mike Smith, 31-30, as the leading rider
at the meet, and Todd Pletcher won by a wide margin as the leading
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   But not even heavy skies could darken the otherwise bright news.
Attendance at Saratoga rose by about 1,700 spectators a day to an
average of 24,660, extending last year's gain of 6.6 percent. The
betting handle rose to a daily average of $2.9 million, checking a
slight decline registered last year. And the total handle,
including simulcasts, reached $13.5 million a day, a gain of 5
percent and a record for North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a tough meet to surpass from a business
perspective,'' said Terry Meyocks, president of the New York Racing
Association. ``We couldn't have hoped for any better weather. It's
been a great season of racing. And we hope that will carry over to
the Belmont fall meet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont Park fall meet will open Friday for 33 racing days,
and is already the destination for horses from around the country
aiming for the Woodward on Sept. 19 and the Jockey Club Gold Cup on
Oct. 10.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Skip Away, with a winning streak of eight, has been stabled at
Belmont since last Thursday waiting for the Woodward. From the West
Coast, Free House and Gentlemen were flying into New York on Monday
to join him. And the top 3-year-old, Coronado's Quest, was expected
to take the long step and face older horses in the Woodward in his
quest for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   The race for leading jockey came down to the final day, with
five riders in pursuit of Smith, who was sidelined, perhaps for
four months, when he broke two vertebrae in a spill last Monday. He
had 30 winners at the time, but Velazquez passed Jerry Bailey
Monday and then passed Smith when he won the ninth race aboard
Clever Actor.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of performance that brought back memories of
Velazquez's friend and agent, Angel Cordero Jr., who was called the
king of Saratoga when he was the leading jockey in this town for 11
straight years.
</P>
<P>
   The race for leading trainer thrust a new star onto the stage:
Pletcher, 31, a former student of D. Wayne Lukas. He has been
training on his own only since December 1995. He rushed to the top
of his profession this year, though, and saddled 20 winners at
Saratoga, replacing Bill Mott, who had won the title in four of the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went out on my own, I didn't know what to expect,''
Pletcher said. ``I only had seven horses in December of '95. Now I
have 80 between here and Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35th and final stakes of the meet, the Forego, proved a
runaway success for Affirmed Success, the 4-year-old son of
Affirmed trained by Richie Schosberg. He ran the seven furlongs in
1:21 4/5 under Jorge Chavez, paid $4.90 for a $2 bet to win, and
won by eight lengths over Receiver, who had seven on Purple Passion
and two more on Wild Rush.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Russia has had more than its share of malevolent or inept
political leaders over the years, but the latest Kremlin cast is
setting a new standard for incompetence and self-absorption. With
the country in an economic meltdown, the lower house of parliament
on Monday once again rejected President Boris Yeltsin's choice for
prime minister, leaving the nation without a working government.
With the ruble's purchasing power tumbling and shortages of food
and other vital commodities developing, Russia is rapidly slipping
into conditions that breed unrest and demagogy.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Chernomyrdin may not be the ideal choice for prime
minister, but at this moment of political and economic peril he
would be better than the volatile vacuum of power that now exists.
His rejection for a third and final time in the days ahead would
most likely lead Yeltsin to dissolve parliament and call new
elections later this year. Given Yeltsin's unsteady leadership,
Russia cannot afford several more months of political paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists and their allies may be bluffing, since many
members of parliament fear the loss of their seats and the
privileges that come with them. But unlike earlier confrontations
with Yeltsin, when the Communists backed down, this time they may
sense electoral advantage in the growing economic turmoil and
Yeltsin's unpopularity. It would not be the first time that the
Communist Party tried to exploit economic hardship for its own
advantage. Lenin perfected the strategy in 1917.

 &HT;    Neagle skips start with bum shoulder
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was, Denny Neagle and Bobby Cox agreed, strictly a
precautionary measure. When Neagle went to his manager Monday
morning and said his pitching shoulder was stiff again.
</P>
<P>
   Cox quickly scratched Neagle. Instead, Bruce Chen made his
major-league debut on a couple of hours notice in an 8-7 loss to
the Mets, while Neagle was flying home to Atlanta to have his left
shoulder examined by team orthopedist Joe Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``My head was smarter than my heart this time,'' said Neagle,
who may need a cortisone shot but doesn't expect to miss his next
scheduled start Saturday against Florida. Indeed, Neagle told Cox
he could pitch Monday despite stiffness in the side of his left
shoulder. But Cox quickly scratched Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to start, he could start but there's no reason to do
it,'' Cox said. ``He's more or less fine, but he's stiff. He was
stiff (Sunday) when he played catch. I thought it best to skip an
entire (turn in the) rotation with him and give Chen a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been one of those things where it's been nagging,'' said
Neagle, who began experiencing the stiffness a couple of weeks ago.
``I'd get my treatment, I'm ready to pitch, you fill your tank up
and then you're down to empty again. I'm getting tired of that,
where it takes five days to get it back to where I can pitch
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Neagle will skip a start and see Chandler. ``I'm sure
he's going to say I've got some inflammation,'' Neagle said.
``Hopefully, I won't need the (cortisone) shot, just take
anti-inflammatory pills.''
</P>
<P>
   And then take his regular turn Saturday. Or as Neagle said,
``Miss this start, get myself a good nine days of treatment and
I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so bad,'' Chen said of his big-league debut, in
which he allowed six hits (two homers) and four earned runs in
three innings before a rain delay ended his day. ``At first, I was
struggling with some pitches. But I think I can pitch in this
league. I have the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen, 21, was recalled from Class AAA Richmond last Tuesday,
after going 2-1 with a 1.88 in four starts there and 29 strikeouts
in 24 innings. He fanned five Monday, walked two and learned this:
``If you fall behind and you can't throw your off-speed (pitches)
for strikes, you're in trouble. But it feels great. When I got out
there, I didn't feel anything (nervous). I just went out and
pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the Braves recalled Adam Butler from Richmond for the
second time this year. The left-handed reliever, who'd been
optioned Aug. 21, started the sixth and worked two-thirds of an
inning with a walk, a strikeout and a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Catch this
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Perez caught Monday, but won't work tonight in Montreal
with Greg Maddux, as he usually does. For the second straight time,
Javy Lopez will catch Maddux. A postseason preview. ``It's what I
(ITAL)might(END ITAL) do,'' said Cox. ``I just want him to get used
to (Maddux) again.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones' 27th homer Sunday was also the 50th of his career.
At 21 years, four months, he becomes the third-youngest player in
big-league history to reach 50 homers. Mel Ott was the youngest at
20 years, four months, and Tony Conigliaro second at 20 years,
seven months. Jones, who hit another one Monday, has now homered in
four of the last five games and seven of the last 15, also stole
his 24th base Monday. He needs two more homers and six steals to
become the youngest 30-30 player in major-league history. Seattle's
Alex Rodriguez (23 years, two days) established that mark last
month. ... The Mets lead the majors with 32 one-run victories
(32-23).

FEW TEACHER VACANCIES AS NEW YORK CITY SCHOOLS HIRE 5,000 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After years of chronic difficulty attracting
qualified teachers to the nation's largest school system, New York
City education officials say they have hired 5,000 new teachers in
one of the most competitive hiring seasons in recent memory _
enough to fill virtually all classrooms when the city's 1,100
public schools open on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its widely publicized hiring of two dozen math and
science teachers from Austria, the Board of Education started
recruiting earlier and more aggressively, drawing not only from
teachers' colleges in the city itself, but from state university
campuses throughout New York, as well as Massachusetts, Spain and
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education recruiters said that by Friday, they had
hired 5,249 teachers, leaving only about 200 vacancies in a
teaching force of 72,000. Last year, in contrast, schools had
nearly 3,000 vacancies the week before they opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to open fully staffed for only the second time this
decade,'' said Askia Davis, superintendent of District 5 in Harlem,
which hired 70 new teachers this year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, officials say, the early recruiting paid off in better
credentials among those hired: about three-quarters of the new
teachers hold state and city certification, reflecting steady
improvement from 10 years ago when only about half were fully
certified. Then as now, new teachers have to pass three
state-administered written exams and a far simpler half-hour, oral
city exam.
</P>
<P>
   But as it fills the final vacancies, the school system is
struggling to address stubborn teacher shortages in math, science
and bilingual education. Late last week, the board's hiring center
buzzed with a flurry of last-minute hiring in those areas and to
fill surprise openings created by city teachers who had bolted for
more lucrative suburban jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that about half the new teachers are white in
a school system that is 83 percent black, Hispanic and Asian. Most
have no classroom experience, yet they are older than previous
groups of new recruits, with the average age now 28, up from from
24 several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The higher age is due mainly to the rise in people like Mary
Jean Walsh, who opted for teaching as a second career.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walsh, 46, who rose from bank teller to a vice presidency
during 26 years at Chase Manhattan, will leave cubicle-lined
offices in Brooklyn for the classrooms of Thurgood Marshall Academy
for Learning and Social Change in Harlem. There she will teach
social studies to seventh- and eighth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Like her, most of the new teachers have never held teaching jobs
beyond their year of student teaching required for certification.
That means the system continues its struggle for a more seasoned
staff; the median number of years of experience is 13 in the city
but 16 statewide, according to the state Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   Another neophyte is Bayana Charles, 22, a graduate of Brooklyn
College who has never instructed a class but, after a five-day
seminar put on by her school, is preparing for her first day as a
biology teacher at George W. Wingate High School in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to stare at 30 pairs of eyes and I'm going
to be really nervous,'' said Ms. Charles, a biology major still
seeking certification. She decided to go into teaching late in her
studies at Brooklyn College, so she missed her student teaching
stint.

<P>
   By and large, say people inside and outside the system, the
recruiting process worked better this year. Instead of waiting
until August, when most qualified prospects already had jobs in
other districts, the board began searching in the spring, holding
job fairs and sending recruiters to campuses. The board's human
resources division also sought to streamline an infamously confused
and frustrating hiring process that one recruit, according to a
1995 report by a school watchdog group, likened to ``the Motor
Vehicles Department times 10.''
</P>
<P>
   In 11 districts the board identifies as ``hard to staff'' _
generally those in low-income areas with low-performing schools _
satellite offices were set up to handle hiring. That and the early
recruiting, said Gary Barton, who oversees hiring for the board,
eliminated the late-August cattle call in which overflow crowds
filled the downtown Brooklyn building as the board sought someone,
anyone, for thousands of positions. The scene scared hundreds of
recruits away, said the 1995 report by the Education Priorities
Panel, an independent monitoring group.
</P>
<P>
   New recruits remain disproportionately white, like the teaching
force itself, where two-thirds are white. In 1997, 50 percent of
the new employees were white, 17 percent Hispanic, 26 percent
black, 5 percent Asian-American and 2 percent American Indian.
</P>
<P>
   The board advertises in Spanish-language newspapers and recruits
at colleges with many minority students but so far to little avail.
``We have not seen the rewards of that yet,'' Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors keep New York City at a disadvantage in the
competition for teachers, officials said, notably the starting
salary of $29,640, which is often $10,000 lower than nearby
suburban districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have got to raise salaries,'' said Norm Fruchter,
director of New York University's Institute for Education and
Social Policy. ``Unless you are committed to teaching in New York
City, you go to a suburban district that pays more, where the class
sizes are smaller and the maintenance and general conditions of the
buildings are better.''
</P>
<P>
   J.D. LaRock, a spokesman for schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, said
the chancellor decided to first improve recruiting before
considering signing bonuses or other perks, which have been used by
cities like Baltimore and Dallas to attract teachers. LaRock said
the chancellor had neither ruled them out nor pushed them. Teaching
salaries are set by contract between the city and the United
Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Caryl Cohen, the head recruiter for the district, said
prospective teachers are also put off by the school system's and
New York City's reputation for violence. And while upstate campuses
can send student teachers to New York City _ a virtual job tryout _
some do not because their students cannot afford housing.
</P>
<P>
   Barton said recruiters would continue to be more aggressive,
seeking out math and science majors in their freshman years of
college to plant the idea of teaching. The board is also
considering trips to California this year to recruit bilingual
teachers, now that California has voted to eliminate bilingual
education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the board makes forays to Puerto Rico, where this year
it netted Mona Lisa Tello, a bilingual science teacher, and about
two dozen other bilingual teachers. Ms. Tello, who will teach
biology at the High School for the Humanities in Manhattan,
graduated from Universidad Interamericana in Puerto Rico in 1975
with a bachelor of science degree in biology, but raised a family
and opened a photo business before turning to teaching about five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She said teaching in New York allowed her to pursue a dream of
earning a master's degree at New York University while helping
Spanish-speaking students learn science and English. ``This is what
America is all about,'' she said.

CANDIDATES FOR SCHUMER'S SEAT TRY TO SET THEMSELVES APART

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a debate in a Brooklyn elementary school
auditorium last week, Assemblyman Daniel Feldman told the audience
about his authorship of more than 125 bills during his 18 years in
the State Legislature. Noach Dear, a City Councilman from Brooklyn,
told that same gathering of his attentiveness to the nitty-gritty
of serving constituents, from repaving streets to installing
traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Katz, who represents Forest Hills, Queens, in the
Assembly, described her experience and advocacy of health care
legislation. And Anthony Weiner, a city councilman from Brooklyn,
talked repeatedly of his years of close affiliation with Rep.
Charles Schumer, whom each of the four hopes to succeed in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the final week of campaigning before the Democratic primary
next Tuesday, the four candidates for the congressional seat being
vacated by Schumer, who is running for the Senate, are working
exhaustively to set themselves apart from their rivals in a race in
which a large number of voters are still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   While each of the candidates has a following, none is considered
sufficiently well known to have an upper hand in the 9th
Congressional District, which is split almost evenly between
Brooklyn and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of them can state a plausible argument on how they could
get elected,'' said Michael Nieves, a political consultant who
works with Democratic candidates throughout the city and is not
affiliated with any in this race.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves and other analysts suggested that the race will be won by
the candidate with the most formidable grass-roots organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have different things going for them in this
campaign,'' Nieves said. ``But what's going to make the difference
is the troops they have out working for them and getting their
people to the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the candidates are campaigning with a frenzy throughout
the district, from a carnival in the Breezy Point section of Queens
to appearances in Brooklyn at subway stations near Prospect Park
and at diners in the Kings Highway section. The district stretches
from Forest Hills and Middle Village in Queens through Park Slope
and Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn, through the Rockaway Peninsula in
Queens.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Feldman, 49, has the longest career in elective office and
emphasizes his 18 years of experience in the Assembly representing
Sheepshead Bay. In his campaign appearances, he portrays himself as
an effective legislator, frequently citing a law he wrote that
allows communities to track the whereabouts of released sex
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman is supported by the Democratic Party organization in
Brooklyn. He has also been endorsed by Rep. Jerrold Nadler of
Manhattan and Brooklyn and several members of the state Legislature
from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not good with sound bites, and I'm not cute,'' Feldman
said in an interview. ``But if people want to pick a congressman on
the basis of qualifications, why is this race so close? My
qualifications are a lot stronger than my opponents'.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Katz, 33, is the only woman in the primary and the only
candidate from Queens. A protege of City Comptroller Alan Hevesi,
Ms. Katz was elected to the Assembly in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have focused on health care since I've been in the
Assembly,'' Ms. Katz said. ``The first law I passed was a direct
access law that provided care for women from gynecologists and
obstetricians without first seeking permission from their HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiner, 34, a city councilman since 1991, worked for six years
as an aide to Schumer and is closely associated with the
congressman. Weiner is hoping to capitalize on that association and
on the popularity of Schumer, who last week stood in front of Shea
Stadium to endorse him as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people will come out to the polls to get Chuck
elected to the Senate,'' Weiner said. ``And they are likely to be
persuaded by this endorsement. I think everyone would agree that
Chuck Schumer's endorsement is by far the most important one in
this race.''
</P>
<P>
   In his years on the council, Weiner has developed a reputation
as a skilled debater, with a particularly glib touch. Colleagues
widely acknowledge that he has particular expertise in public
safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dear, 44, has, by far, exceeded all of his rivals combined in
raising money, having amassed more than $1.5 million. He has spent
$700,000 on a television advertising campaign and a 10-minute
videotaped campaign advertisement that was mailed to about 20,000
likely voters in the congressional district. Dear is also by far
the most conservative candidate _ the only one who opposes abortion
and who opposed a gay-rights measure in the City Council in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign appearances, he seldom mentions his legislative
record, but focuses on his one-on-one work with constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to work with people to help them solve their problems,''
he said, while campaigning in front of a Brooklyn supermarket last
week. ``That's why I have a 24-hour hot line. That's why people
identify with me.''

WEST INDIAN PARADE IS AN INVITATION TO DANCE AND DON COSTUMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Normally, Marjorie Smith, 50, is a manager of the
administrative staff at the World Bank in Washington, an office
where people are not known for excessive dress.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday Ms. Smith, who was born in Trinidad, got herself
into an enormous blue-and-white feathered costume, had her face
painted to match, then danced down Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn.
``This is my stress-buster,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the theme of the 31st annual West Indian
American Day Carnival, a pageant that has surpassed the
Thanksgiving and St. Patrick's Day parades as the largest and most
elaborate in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, an estimated 2 million people jammed the two-mile route
stretching along Eastern Parkway from Utica Avenue to Grand Army
Plaza, in Brooklyn's Caribbean heart. They ate jerk chicken,
curried goat and black pudding, dressed up in thongs and as
peacocks, and danced to a throbbing calypso beat on trucks
advertising Guinness stout and Hennessey cognac.
</P>
<P>
   The day was stifling until showers cooled things off. The mood
was an island sultriness combined with aggressive New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buy six beers, and I'll get you a free face painting,'' said a
vendor, Jerry Vento, 27, of Canarsie, as a woman passed by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six beers _ you can paint my body, baby,'' the woman shot
back.
</P>
<P>
   The parade is the biggest event of the year for New York's
burgeoning West Indian community, whose numbers are estimated at
600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wait for this,'' said Reshonah Bennett, 22, a student at
Manhattan's Fashion Institute of Technology. ``Fall is coming, so
it's like a brand new start.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bennett was born in the United States, but her parents were
born in Trinidad, and on Monday she and four other families from
the second floor of her Eastern Parkway apartment building were
selling food and drinks along the parade route. They hoped to make
$3,000, and expected to be out there until 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Baker, 39, of the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, was
selling jerk chicken on the parade route for a Flatbush catering
service called Goodies, and dancing at the same time. She came to
New York from Jamaica two years ago, and misses home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not often you get the chance to get the spirit of the old
things,'' she said. ``And you can behave in a way that people don't
think is strange. It gives us a chance to be Jamaican.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Baker works part-time as a nanny on Long Island, which has
made her wonder about why people here work so hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though you see the wealth, the people don't act like
there's wealth,'' she said. ``People get up in the morning and go
to work and then they come home late at night. But at home, we have
a lifestyle. You go to work, you leave, and you might call your
friends up. We have a lot of entertainment places along the
beaches. Or you might meet at a pool. It's definitely less
stress.''
</P>
<P>
   The usual clutch of politicians made pilgrimages to the parade
site. Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn, who is running for the U.S.
Senate, turned up in a coat and tie, but was later spotted in a
``Taste of the Tropics'' T-shirt as he waved from the top of a
double-decker bus and swayed gingerly to the calypso beat.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, who is running for governor, wore
a blue business suit and blue pumps and danced down the street with
the Mystic Promise band. ``We're teaching her,'' said Tessa Caesar,
24, a member of the band.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot for sale, like pina coladas served in
pineapples, dolls, jewelry, wood carvings, and clothes. Among the
T-shirt slogans: ``When I Die &AMP; Heaven Doesn't Want Me, Take Me
Straight to Trinidad''; ``Trini to the Last Drop'' and ``Every
Sister Should Have a BMW _ Black Man Working!''
</P>
<P>
   The skies above the parade darkened ominously at 2:30 p.m., and
soon after that, they opened, sending some people screaming for the
subways. Others ran for cover under the nearest food stall tent,
which created some interesting groupings.
</P>
<P>
   Up near the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Patricia Brown found herself
covering up the carrot cake she was selling and standing in her
tent next to Sonya Smith, 29, a woman who calls people who have not
paid their Bell Atlantic phone bills; Ms. Smith's son, Deshawn, 9;
a man without a shirt who would not tell anyone his name; and a
newspaper reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said she led spiritual and holistic retreats back home
to Jamaica, and loved the West Indian parade.
</P>
<P>
   As it rained, the man who would not give his name made a garbage
bag raincoat for Deshawn, who was cold. ``That's $500, custom,''
the man said. ``This is an original. Stop shivering.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he inexplicably started haranguing the group about Monica
Lewinsky. Ms. Smith rolled her eyes. ``Wrong event,'' she said.

 &HT;    Experimental care not covered, insurer said
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) General News and (f) Financial categories.)
 &HT;    By Mary Warejcka
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, FLA. _ Jupiter, Fla. resident Lise Greene's
fight with her HMO is nothing unusual in the insurance world.
</P>
<P>
   What is different is a judge forced her managed-care insurance
company, Well Care HMO, to pay for her hyperbaric oxygen therapy
for bladder damage. Well Care argued that the procedure is
experimental.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only known injunction of its kind in Florida, and it
could lead to more people seeking similar judgments in the future,
say Greene's lawyer, Gary M. Farmer Jr. of Fort Lauderdale, and a
lawyer who specializes in health-care law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news for patients. . . . It's not so good for
HMOs,'' said Jeff Cohen, a Delray Beach lawyer and former chairman
of managed-care law for the Florida Bar.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's problems began in March 1997 when she was diagnosed
with uterine cancer. The radiation treatment damaged her bladder,
and by Christmas she developed persistent hemorrhagic cystitis,
which results in bleeding and the inability to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a car ride and having to really go to the bathroom and
magnify that 10 or 20 times,'' Farmer says.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO said it would pay for a treatment that required Greene
to have surgery so she could again go to the bathroom. Using this
treatment, she said her doctors told her, eventually her bladder
would shrink to nothing. From March to June this year, Greene had
six surgeries costing from about $12,000 to $32,000. The total bill
far exceeds the cost of the hyperbaric oxygen treatment Greene's
doctors had recommended. They estimate she will need about 40
treatments at a cost of $1,100 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very upsetting really because we had a solution to
everything,'' Greene says. ``We would not have had to go through
all this (surgery), and they would have saved a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer said maybe Well Care didn't want to pay for Greene's
hyperbaric treatment because then it would have to pay for it in
other cases where alternative treatments might cost less. In court
documents Well Care's attorney, Thomas S. Rutherford of Tampa,
pointed out Well Care was willing to pay for all Greene's other
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The hyperbaric oxygen chamber is commonly known for treating the
bends in scuba divers. However, it is used for everything from
healing wounds to radiation damage in the jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how it heals is not known, but anecdotal evidence is it
works, says Dr. Roy Duke, one of three doctors who work with the
chambers at St. Mary's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   When Greene enters a chamber at St. Mary's, a hood is placed on
her, and she breathes 100 percent oxygen while the air in the
chamber is as if she were about 40 feet below sea level, forcing
more oxygen into her system. At intervals, the hood is taken off so
the patient can take a break, Duke said.
</P>
<P>
   Well Care argued that it didn't have to pay for the hyperbaric
treatments because they were considered experimental and thus not
covered under Greene's insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Farmer argued that the treatments for Greene's condition
have been effectively used since the early 1980s and couldn't be
excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's arguments prevailed with Circuit Judge Edward Fine, who
granted a preliminary injunction forcing Well Care to pay for the
treatments while the company appealed the decision. Greene posted a
$1,000 bond in case she lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court finds that plaintiff has shown a substantial
likelihood that she will prevail on the merits of her claim for
health insurance coverage,'' Fine wrote in his July 2 opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, patients are forced to pay for their treatment while
they appeal HMO decisions. They usually only sue after the fact for
repayment. But Greene could not even do that, Farmer said. Even
though Greene said she would pay for the treatments herself, the
hospital wanted proof of insurance coverage because the treatments
are so expensive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well Care appealed, but has since withdrawn the appeal, Farmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put my client through six months of entirely unnecessary
physical suffering and mental strain,'' he said.

 &HT;    Experimental care not covered, insurer said

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, FLA. _ Jupiter, Fla. resident Lise Greene's
fight with her HMO is nothing unusual in the insurance world.
</P>
<P>
   What is different is a judge forced her managed-care insurance
company, Well Care HMO, to pay for her hyperbaric oxygen therapy
for bladder damage. Well Care argued that the procedure is
experimental.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only known injunction of its kind in Florida, and it
could lead to more people seeking similar judgments in the future,
say Greene's lawyer, Gary M. Farmer Jr. of Fort Lauderdale, and a
lawyer who specializes in health-care law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news for patients. . . . It's not so good for
HMOs,'' said Jeff Cohen, a Delray Beach lawyer and former chairman
of managed-care law for the Florida Bar.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's problems began in March 1997 when she was diagnosed
with uterine cancer. The radiation treatment damaged her bladder,
and by Christmas she developed persistent hemorrhagic cystitis,
which results in bleeding and the inability to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a car ride and having to really go to the bathroom and
magnify that 10 or 20 times,'' Farmer says.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO said it would pay for a treatment that required Greene
to have surgery so she could again go to the bathroom. Using this
treatment, she said her doctors told her, eventually her bladder
would shrink to nothing. From March to June this year, Greene had
six surgeries costing from about $12,000 to $32,000. The total bill
far exceeds the cost of the hyperbaric oxygen treatment Greene's
doctors had recommended. They estimate she will need about 40
treatments at a cost of $1,100 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very upsetting really because we had a solution to
everything,'' Greene says. ``We would not have had to go through
all this (surgery), and they would have saved a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer said maybe Well Care didn't want to pay for Greene's
hyperbaric treatment because then it would have to pay for it in
other cases where alternative treatments might cost less. In court
documents Well Care's attorney, Thomas S. Rutherford of Tampa,
pointed out Well Care was willing to pay for all Greene's other
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The hyperbaric oxygen chamber is commonly known for treating the
bends in scuba divers. However, it is used for everything from
healing wounds to radiation damage in the jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how it heals is not known, but anecdotal evidence is it
works, says Dr. Roy Duke, one of three doctors who work with the
chambers at St. Mary's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   When Greene enters a chamber at St. Mary's, a hood is placed on
her, and she breathes 100 percent oxygen while the air in the
chamber is as if she were about 40 feet below sea level, forcing
more oxygen into her system. At intervals, the hood is taken off so
the patient can take a break, Duke said.
</P>
<P>
   Well Care argued that it didn't have to pay for the hyperbaric
treatments because they were considered experimental and thus not
covered under Greene's insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Farmer argued that the treatments for Greene's condition
have been effectively used since the early 1980s and couldn't be
excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's arguments prevailed with Circuit Judge Edward Fine, who
granted a preliminary injunction forcing Well Care to pay for the
treatments while the company appealed the decision. Greene posted a
$1,000 bond in case she lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court finds that plaintiff has shown a substantial
likelihood that she will prevail on the merits of her claim for
health insurance coverage,'' Fine wrote in his July 2 opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, patients are forced to pay for their treatment while
they appeal HMO decisions. They usually only sue after the fact for
repayment. But Greene could not even do that, Farmer said. Even
though Greene said she would pay for the treatments herself, the
hospital wanted proof of insurance coverage because the treatments
are so expensive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well Care appealed, but has since withdrawn the appeal, Farmer
said.

HUNDLEY STILL OUT OF METS' LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Todd Hundley is unlikely to rejoin the New York Mets'
regular lineup this year despite regaining his hitting stroke in
the minor leagues, Manager Bobby Valentine indicated on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In eight games in his second rehabilitation this year, Hundley
batted .500 with three home runs while playing left field and
catcher for Class AAA Norfolk. He had hit just .161 with the Mets
in part of July and August.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was asked whether this resurgence might be enough to
put Hundley back in left field when he comes off the disabled list
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think so,'' Valentine said. ``I saw my left
fielder today take a key walk and hit a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was referring to Tony Phillips, who has often been in
left since the Mets and Hundley agreed last month that the
Hundley-in-left-field experiment wasn't working, partly because of
his defensive struggles, partly because he wasn't hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard when Todd left was that he wasn't going to be a
scapegoat,'' Valentine said, referring to Hundley's statements last
month when he came out of the lineup and then went on the disabled
list. ``The team is doing pretty well right now. I would love him
to contribute in any way he can. But it won't be in a situation
where he feels he's been set up to fail. At least that's the way I
feel right now.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he might put Hundley behind the plate, where he
could give Mike Piazza a breather for a game or two down the
stretch, Valentine also said the situation would put too much
pressure on Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   But if Valentine doesn't want to put Hundley in the lineup, that
leaves only pinch-hitting duties, and the Mets then have to decide
if that is enough to be part of a post-season roster, should they
win the National League wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make a post-season roster when you make the post-season,''
Valentine said. ``But let's put it this way _ I don't think we need
a catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine also seemed a little annoyed that Hundley remained the
subject of so many questions. ``Since November of last year, I've
been answering hypotheticals about Todd Hundley,'' Valentine said.

   Three Marketers Select Agencies &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Three marketers have made decisions on their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Cars.com, an Internet automotive information and data-base
service, named Stein Rogan &AMP; Partners in New York as the first
agency to handle its online and traditional advertising account.
Billings were estimated at $26 million for 18 months. Cars.com, a
unit of Classified Ventures LLC in Chicago, made the decision
without a formal review.
</P>
<P>
   Weight Watchers International, a unit of H.J. Heinz Co. in
Woodbury, N.Y., formally named Seiden Group in New York to handle
the account of its weight-loss centers, which Seiden had handled on
a project basis. Billings were estimated at $25 million. Lowe &AMP;
Partners/SMS in New York, which once handled those duties,
continues to handle media planning and buying; Lowe is part of the
Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texas Department of Economic Development in Austin,
Texas, selected McCann-Erickson Southwest in Houston to handle its
Texas tourism account, which had been handled by GSD&AMP;M in Austin
for more than a decade. Billings for the five-year contract were
estimated at $12 million a year. The decision came after a
two-month review that had been narrowed to McCann Southwest, which
is part of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising unit of
Interpublic, and GSD&AMP;M, a unit of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   Executives Depart From Three Agencies
</P>
<P>
   Senior executives at three agencies are leaving.
</P>
<P>
   At BBDO Worldwide, part of Omnicom Group, David Wheldon,
president of BBDO Europe in London since January 1997, resigned,
the agency said in a terse statement. Wheldon, 42, was traveling
and could not be reached for comment on his future plans.
Jean-Michel Goudard, 58, president for international at BBDO
Worldwide in New York and Paris, will also assume Wheldon's duties
as chairman of BBDO Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Wheldon joined BBDO, a leading agency for Pepsico Inc., from
Coca-Cola Co., where he had been a top executive for four years;
before that he worked at agencies such as the Lowe Howard-Spink
unit of Lowe Group in London, part of the Interpublic Group of Cos.
Wheldon's departure from BBDO came after trade publications
reported friction between him and longtime BBDO executives.
</P>
<P>
   At Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Atlanta, part of WPP Group PLC, Neill
Cameron, president, said he would retire in December to become vice
president for advancement at Clemson University in Clemson, S.C.
Ian Latham, executive creative director at Ogilvy Atlanta, will
assume Cameron's duties and take the title of managing director.
Cameron, 51, and Latham, 49, opened Ogilvy Atlanta in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   And David Clauson, senior vice president and worldwide account
director at the San Francisco office of Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding, a
unit of True North Communications, is leaving to join Ixl Inc., an
Internet services company in Atlanta, in the new position of
executive vice president for worldwide marketing. Clauson, 42, the
chairman of the technology committee of the American Association of
Advertising Agencies, founded the Foote, Cone technology division
in 1991; he also worked for agencies such as Lord Einstein O'Neill
&AMP; Partners and the J. Walter Thompson Co. unit of WPP Group.

 &HT;    Longhorns make changes
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ UCLA, which plays for the first time this year
on Saturday against No. 23 Texas, has a first-year defensive
coordinator, a new defensive scheme and plenty of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Texas will have several questions for the Bruins, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go into the game not knowing how they'll line up,''
Longhorns Coach Mack Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown will know as much about his defense, and not much more.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy with the Longhorns' second-half ineffectiveness against
New Mexico State in the season opener, Brown and coordinator Carl
Reese have shuffled the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Brown announced these moves on Monday:
</P>
<P>
   _J.J. Kelly will move into the starting spot at right end,
replacing Chris Smith, who will move to a backup spot with Damon
Luckett. Smith had four tackles, including three solo, one tackle
for loss and two quarterback pressures against New Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   _Freshman Jermain Anderson moved up to second team at left end,
jumping ahead of Luckett.
</P>
<P>
   _Sophomore Aaron Colvin will get playing time in a three-man
rotation at backup defensive tackle, along with Brandon Nava and
Shaun Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   _Anthony Hicks flipped from strongside linebacker to weakside
linebacker, where he'll replace Cedric Mitchell as the back-up to
De'Andre Lewis. Freshman Everick Rawls, who did not play Saturday,
will debut on special teams and as a backup to strongside starter
Aaron Babino.
</P>
<P>
   Rawls would become the ninth of the 19 freshmen to see action,
joining offensive linemen Antwan Kirk-Hughes and Mike Williams,
running back Chris Robertson, receiver Montrell Flowers, Anderson,
linebacker Marcus Wilkins, safeties Tyrone Jones and Jon Wyndham
and cornerback Ervis Hill. Brown indicated that other freshmen also
could play.
</P>
<P>
   Though he wasn't specific, Brown said there could be a shakeup
in the secondary. One possible scenario has Tony Holmes moving back
to strong safety, with Jeremy Jones or Chris Butcher taking over
the left cornerback spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had people covered, but let them catch the ball,''
he said. ``We may move some people around, but we don't have many
options.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown also announced an offensive change _ backup split end
Bryan White has a hamstring pull and will be replaced by Jamel
Thompson as the first backup to Wane McGarity. Backup quarterback
Major Applewhite will replace White as the holder on placekicks.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-ranked UCLA has seven starters back on offense _ including
quarterback Cade McNown, a preseason Heisman Trophy candidate _ but
lost its top receiver and top running back from last season. The
Bruins have an All-America kicker and punter in senior Chris
Sailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the wrong week to build confidence, but we don't have
any choice,'' Brown said. Defensively, the Bruins turn to
first-year coordinator Nick Allioti _ who had success building the
Oregon ``Gang Green'' defense of 1994 _ and a new 3-4 alignment.
The defense is young up front, but the Bruins have an experienced
secondary led by safety Larry Atkins, one of six semifinalists for
last year's Jim Thorpe Award, presented to the nation's top
defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very young and inexperienced and incorporating a new
scheme,'' said UCLA Coach Bob Toledo. ``We have to wait and see
Saturday afternoon where we're at.

 &HT;    Bush's campaigners chant mantra: `Take nothing for granted'
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Tilting his head toward his left
shoulder, an almost-shy smile crosses Jeb Bush's face as he reaches
out to shake the bartender's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pay for a drink here, Mr. Bush,'' the bartender says
as he hands Bush a glass of Glenlivit single malt scotch over ice
with a splash.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of a typical 12-hour campaign day and as Bush
walks away, the bartender says to no one in particular, ``I know
he'll be a good governor.'' He says it as if the election were
over. Wherever Bush goes the reaction is much the same. Some have
even taken to calling him ``Governor,'' a presumption that makes
the Republican nominee flinch.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers 1994, when after two years of nonstop campaigning,
including abstinence from alcohol, Bush lost one of the closest
elections in Florida history. Gov. Lawton Chiles, after being
behind in the polls for months, won by 64,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   While the struggling campaign of Democratic Lt. Gov. Buddy
MacKay is dogged by questions about whether MacKay can win, Bush's
campaign worries that the heady assumption Bush will win could cost
him the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never become complacent,'' says Bush. ``This race is
going to tighten up considerably. I think by the time we reach
October and the polls begin to close, people are going to
understand that we can't afford to take anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly no evidence his campaign is doing that. Even
MacKay's staff grudgingly admits they are impressed with the Bush
campaign apparatus. Bush's campaign arsenal is so formidable that
one senior MacKay adviser said the best thing going for MacKay may
be that his lack of resources may force him to run a more
aggressive, guerrilla campaign in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can run a disorganized, negative campaign and still get
elected. Lawton Chiles proved that in 1994,'' says Sally Harrell,
Bush's campaign manager then and now. ``We have to be ready for
anything, and I think we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Low turnout a high fear
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign is a political consultant's dream. There is more
than enough money, a large and talented campaign staff, party
unity, an eager and hardworking candidate and a comfortable
12-point lead in the polls with the election less than two months
away.
</P>
<P>
   Making the consultant's dream all the more perfect would be
Democrat Party turmoil capped with two more defections to Bush _
Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford and state Rep. Rudy Bradley
of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Bush campaign is worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terrified of low turnout,'' says Harrell. ``I worry about
getting people fired up and going to the polls. We have to make
sure that people remember it's always possible to lose no matter
how good things look now.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things going for Bush has been party unity.
MacKay just barely avoided a primary battle. Bush, with the help of
GOP state Chairman Tom Slade, managed to persuade potential primary
opponents to stay out of the race. Anyone who thought they would be
able to knock Bush off in the primary only had to look at his
stunning 1994 primary victory over four challengers.
</P>
<P>
   With his party behind him, Bush has spent much of his time
courting black, elderly and Jewish voters who have made up the core
of the Democratic base. It is an effort to shave off just enough
votes not only to decrease MacKay's votes but to force him to
campaign among groups that in the past would have been
automatically his.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is an example of the strategy. A black lawmaker who
tends to be conservative, Bradley says he likes Bush's ideas for
working the black community and the disadvantaged. One of Bush's
early black converts was West Palm Beach Commissioner Mary Hooks,
who is actively campaigning for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Surprises along the trail
</P>
<P>
   Picking off Crawford, one of three elected Democrats on the
state Cabinet, was a major coup. A senior adviser to the Bush
campaign says they are counting on other elected Democrats
endorsing Bush, ``now that Crawford has given them a certain
comfort level to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowing not only about picking up the Crawford endorsement but
also their success at keeping the defection a secret until the last
minute, the Bush campaign believes MacKay fails to understand what
the 1998 campaign will be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the MacKay campaign underestimates our strategic
ability to be unpredictable,'' Harrell says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have a certain arrogance about them that makes
them think we're not capable of meeting them head-on. I think we're
going to surprise them.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the surprises, Bush hopes, is his new media consultant,
Mike Murphy. Four years ago, Bush's campaign was slow to respond at
critical moments in the final weeks of the campaign. When Chiles
hit Bush with a series of hard-hitting ads, Bush's campaign went
limp.
</P>
<P>
   Bush eager to debate
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``quick response'' has become a campaign mantra. Murphy,
who worked for the presidential campaign of Lamar Alexander and New
Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, is known for his often-humorous
but biting television and radio ads. It will be his job to pounce
on any attack by MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign is also more mature. While Bush tossed out
several key members of his staff, he kept a core group that, as
Harrell put it, ``doesn't wig out over every little thing like some
did last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Bush campaign lost momentum during a
statewide television debate when Chiles, dubbing himself the
``he-coon,'' threw Bush off stride. Harrell, who has been
negotiating debates with MacKay campaign consultant Doug Heyl, says
Bush is eager to debate and is hoping to have three to five
debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can have all the money and staff they want but they still
have a flawed candidate,'' says Robin Rorapaugh, MacKay's campaign
manager. ``We're going to remind people who Bush is, and when they
see the comparison between him and Buddy MacKay, we'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay will portray Bush as an extremist who will support a
right-wing agenda that will destroy public schools, take away a
woman's abortion rights and favor insurance companies or the rights
of individuals. Finally, MacKay will say Bush is inexperienced and
someone who cannot be trusted with Florida government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to go after him very hard,'' Rorapaugh says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you expect?'' says Harrell. ``They have no agenda of
their own except to attack Jeb. They may have gotten away with that
four years ago, but voters know Jeb better now and, frankly, they
don't know very much about Buddy MacKay.''
</P>
<P>
   Because many voters know little about MacKay, Bush's campaign
believes he will have a harder time making his charges against Bush
stick. They also believe MacKay has made the mistake of letting the
Bush campaign define him as a liberal tax lover who wants big
government to solve everyone's problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy MacKay is not Lawton Chiles,'' Harrell says. ``I grossly
underestimated Lawton Chiles' residual goodwill with voters. Buddy
MacKay doesn't have that. Instead of talking about himself and
telling people who he is, he attacks us. The fact is, though, he's
not well-known and that is going to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Bush campaign can seem cocky. But they are haunted
by what happened four years ago, which is why until the votes are
counted on Nov. 3, Bush will continue to squirm a little when
someone calls him ``Governor.''

McGWIRE TIES MARIS WITH NO. 61 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ With a clap of thunder and another spectacular
swing, Mark McGwire has pushed himself to the brink of baseball
immortality. He needs one more home run to push aside Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, fulfilling the extraordinary expectations he has
carried from the beginning of spring training, hit his 61st home
run Sunday at Busch Stadium to tie the single-season record set by
Maris in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The homer, which put the St. Louis Cardinals first baseman one
ahead of Babe Ruth, came at 1:22 (CDT) in the first inning, a
430-foot shot off Chicago Cubs pitcher Mike Morgan. McGwire,
swinging at a 1-1 fastball, smashed a vicious high drive to left
field and raised both arms over his head as soon as he hit it.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment McGwire thought it might go foul, then punched the
air high in exultation when the ball stayed fair and crashed off a
window of a luxury suite underneath the second deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a feeling that was,'' McGwire said. ``I don't think I'll
ever let go of the moment. How can you let it go? What I've done is
fabulous. I know that I'm one swing away.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a savage scramble for the ball when it caromed into
the lower deck, and it was retrieved by Mike Davidson, 28, a St.
Louis catering manager. The rest of the 50,530 in attendance joined
McGwire in a stadium-rocking celebration. Cubs first baseman Mark
Grace and third baseman Gary Gaetti were among those caught up in
the moment and gave McGwire high fives as he circled the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember throwing my arms up and screaming and not being
able to hear myself because everybody was yelling,'' Cardinals
catcher Tom Lampkin said.
</P>
<P>
   One of McGwire's first moves after crossing the plate was to
give a massive bearhug to his son Matt, 10, who had flown in from
California to serve as a Cardinals batboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a wonderful feeling a father could have,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for John McGwire, Mark's father, who was at the
game. In one of those eerie quirks of fate, John McGwire was
celebrating his 61st birthday Sunday. McGwire saluted his father
twice while acknowledging the tremendous ovation from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole time I just thought what a great birthday present
for my father,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely thrilled,'' John McGwire said. ``Adjectives
can't describe how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire also saluted Maris' four sons, who were in attendance.
He tried to salute Sammy Sosa, the Cubs' outfielder who has been
his closest pursuer, but Sosa had his head down in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to point to everybody in the whole world right now,''
McGwire said. ``But what a great, great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals started to give McGwire their high-fist and
stomach-punch routine but the record-tying home run called for more
than that. They mobbed him instead with a jubilant group hug
outside the Cardinals' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it was like a ton of weight had been taken off our
shoulders,'' outfielder Ray Lankford said. ``I'm sure there's a ton
of weight off Mark's shoulders. There's been a lot of pressure on
him. This game is stressful as it is, but the expectations for Mark
have been incredible. But he's handled it well and got the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lankford, as he has done most of the season, had the task of
batting after McGwire, and the fans were still on their feet
screaming when he faced Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty much used to that,'' Lankford said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said that in coming to the ballpark Sunday, ``I felt
very calm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good sign,'' he said. ``Sometimes when you get caught
up in things you just try to tell yourself to sit back and relax,
and sometimes it's hard to do. I'm a human being, and I have
emotions just like everybody else. But today coming to the
ballpark, I felt very, very calm.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire singled and flied out to center field twice in his final
three at-bats of the Cardinals' 3-2 victory. He has 19 games
remaining to break the record, add to it and hold off the challenge
of Sosa, who has 58 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race is on,'' St. Louis manager Tony La Russa said. ``But
there ain't nobody like Mark.''

 &HT;    Shotgun hits its target in opener
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It was no coincidence that Troy Aikman's running
and passing game came together Sunday with the advent of the
shotgun offense.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the shotgun has been part of the Cowboys playbook for
decades. During Aikman's 10 years in the NFL, though, the shotgun
has been stored in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   In a 38-10 victory over Arizona, Aikman threw two touchdown
passes and ran for two more. In his first start using Gailey's
imaginative offense, the 31-year-old quarterback had one of his
best games in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Execution is what it's all about,'' Gailey said Monday.
``Everybody has a different idea of what's good. That's why
Baskin-Robbins stays in business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had been accused of having a vanilla offense before
Gailey was hired to replace Barry Switzer in February. One of his
first moves was to convince Aikman that an offensive shakeup is
something the Cowboys needed to shake up last year's 6-10 season.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, Aikman never suggested the shotgun
wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Aikman) actually made the first comment about it,'' Gailey
recalled. ``He told me there were stories that he didn't care for
it, but Troy told me those stories weren't true.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Sunday's opener as a barometer, Aikman and the entire
offense has embraced the shotgun offense. The Cowboys amassed 439
yards in total offense, which included 256 passing yards from
Aikman. The offensive line did not allow a sack.
</P>
<P>
   What did the shotgun provide?
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the offense gives Aikman a few extra seconds to read
the defense. The quarterback had extra time to pass and more
chances to run. For the first time in his career, he rushed for two
touchdowns in a game.
</P>
<P>
   When Aikman was asked the last time that happened, he said,
``Well, considering this is the first time I've ever ran for two
touchdowns in a single season ...''
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless first quarter, the Cowboys erupted for two
touchdowns in the second quarter. Aikman scored on a quarterback
sneak and threw a 30-yard touchdown pass to Ernie Mills, a
forgotten man in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Mills, a former Pittsburgh Steeler, did not surprise
any of the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was coming,'' Gailey said. ``I didn't know when and
where, but I knew it would happen. We just had to let it happen.
You can't force things to happen. When you do that, you make
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys made mistakes Sunday, but they hid them by scoring
enough touchdowns to win. Gailey was upset when offensive lineman
Erik Williams was thrown out of the game for fighting with
Arizona's Eric Swann, and the coach was concerned about David
LaFleur's lack of concentration.
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur's afternoon included a dropped pass, a fumble and two
holding penalties. This follows a summer of lapses for the
second-year tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Said Gailey, ``(LaFleur) has to work to get better. Have we lost
confidence in him? No. Is he in the doghouse? No. Does he need to
get better? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williams incident was more sensitive. Williams and Swann
were ejected for fighting in the second quarter, and the Cowboys
were forced to use rookie Flozell Adams at Williams' spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope we would handle ourselves and hold our composure
at all times, no matter what the situation is,'' Gailey said. ``I'm
not going to say there is never a reason for it. But I'd say 99
percent of the time I'd hope we'd keep our composure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboysplay Denver, the defending Super Bowl champion, on
Sunday. After the victory over the Cardinals, Gailey told his
players it's too early to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he said something about that, but he didn't really have
to,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Cowboys beat Pittsburgh 37-7 in the opener but
lost 10 of their last 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey reported no major injuries Monday.

 &HT;    Bush's campaigners chant mantra: `Take nothing for granted'
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Tilting his head toward his left
shoulder, an almost-shy smile crosses Jeb Bush's face as he reaches
out to shake the bartender's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pay for a drink here, Mr. Bush,'' the bartender says
as he hands Bush a glass of Glenlivit single malt scotch over ice
with a splash.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of a typical 12-hour campaign day and as Bush
walks away, the bartender says to no one in particular, ``I know
he'll be a good governor.'' He says it as if the election were
over. Wherever Bush goes the reaction is much the same. Some have
even taken to calling him ``Governor,'' a presumption that makes
the Republican nominee flinch.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers 1994, when after two years of nonstop campaigning,
including abstinence from alcohol, Bush lost one of the closest
elections in Florida history. Gov. Lawton Chiles, after being
behind in the polls for months, won by 64,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   While the struggling campaign of Democratic Lt. Gov. Buddy
MacKay is dogged by questions about whether MacKay can win, Bush's
campaign worries that the heady assumption Bush will win could cost
him the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never become complacent,'' says Bush. ``This race is
going to tighten up considerably. I think by the time we reach
October and the polls begin to close, people are going to
understand that we can't afford to take anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly no evidence his campaign is doing that. Even
MacKay's staff grudgingly admits they are impressed with the Bush
campaign apparatus. Bush's campaign arsenal is so formidable that
one senior MacKay adviser said the best thing going for MacKay may
be that his lack of resources may force him to run a more
aggressive, guerrilla campaign in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can run a disorganized, negative campaign and still get
elected. Lawton Chiles proved that in 1994,'' says Sally Harrell,
Bush's campaign manager then and now. ``We have to be ready for
anything, and I think we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Low turnout a high fear
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign is a political consultant's dream. There is more
than enough money, a large and talented campaign staff, party
unity, an eager and hardworking candidate and a comfortable
12-point lead in the polls with the election less than two months
away.
</P>
<P>
   Making the consultant's dream all the more perfect would be
Democrat Party turmoil capped with two more defections to Bush _
Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford and state Rep. Rudy Bradley
of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Bush campaign is worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terrified of low turnout,'' says Harrell. ``I worry about
getting people fired up and going to the polls. We have to make
sure that people remember it's always possible to lose no matter
how good things look now.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things going for Bush has been party unity.
MacKay just barely avoided a primary battle. Bush, with the help of
GOP state Chairman Tom Slade, managed to persuade potential primary
opponents to stay out of the race. Anyone who thought they would be
able to knock Bush off in the primary only had to look at his
stunning 1994 primary victory over four challengers.
</P>
<P>
   With his party behind him, Bush has spent much of his time
courting black, elderly and Jewish voters who have made up the core
of the Democratic base. It is an effort to shave off just enough
votes not only to decrease MacKay's votes but to force him to
campaign among groups that in the past would have been
automatically his.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is an example of the strategy. A black lawmaker who
tends to be conservative, Bradley says he likes Bush's ideas for
working the black community and the disadvantaged. One of Bush's
early black converts was West Palm Beach Commissioner Mary Hooks,
who is actively campaigning for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Surprises along the trail
</P>
<P>
   Picking off Crawford, one of three elected Democrats on the
state Cabinet, was a major coup. A senior adviser to the Bush
campaign says they are counting on other elected Democrats
endorsing Bush, ``now that Crawford has given them a certain
comfort level to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowing not only about picking up the Crawford endorsement but
also their success at keeping the defection a secret until the last
minute, the Bush campaign believes MacKay fails to understand what
the 1998 campaign will be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the MacKay campaign underestimates our strategic
ability to be unpredictable,'' Harrell says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have a certain arrogance about them that makes
them think we're not capable of meeting them head-on. I think we're
going to surprise them.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the surprises, Bush hopes, is his new media consultant,
Mike Murphy. Four years ago, Bush's campaign was slow to respond at
critical moments in the final weeks of the campaign. When Chiles
hit Bush with a series of hard-hitting ads, Bush's campaign went
limp.
</P>
<P>
   Bush eager to debate
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``quick response'' has become a campaign mantra. Murphy,
who worked for the presidential campaign of Lamar Alexander and New
Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, is known for his often-humorous
but biting television and radio ads. It will be his job to pounce
on any attack by MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign is also more mature. While Bush tossed out
several key members of his staff, he kept a core group that, as
Harrell put it, ``doesn't wig out over every little thing like some
did last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Bush campaign lost momentum during a
statewide television debate when Chiles, dubbing himself the
``he-coon,'' threw Bush off stride. Harrell, who has been
negotiating debates with MacKay campaign consultant Doug Heyl, says
Bush is eager to debate and is hoping to have three to five
debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can have all the money and staff they want but they still
have a flawed candidate,'' says Robin Rorapaugh, MacKay's campaign
manager. ``We're going to remind people who Bush is, and when they
see the comparison between him and Buddy MacKay, we'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay will portray Bush as an extremist who will support a
right-wing agenda that will destroy public schools, take away a
woman's abortion rights and favor insurance companies or the rights
of individuals. Finally, MacKay will say Bush is inexperienced and
someone who cannot be trusted with Florida government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to go after him very hard,'' Rorapaugh says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you expect?'' says Harrell. ``They have no agenda of
their own except to attack Jeb. They may have gotten away with that
four years ago, but voters know Jeb better now and, frankly, they
don't know very much about Buddy MacKay.''
</P>
<P>
   Because many voters know little about MacKay, Bush's campaign
believes he will have a harder time making his charges against Bush
stick. They also believe MacKay has made the mistake of letting the
Bush campaign define him as a liberal tax lover who wants big
government to solve everyone's problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy MacKay is not Lawton Chiles,'' Harrell says. ``I grossly
underestimated Lawton Chiles' residual goodwill with voters. Buddy
MacKay doesn't have that. Instead of talking about himself and
telling people who he is, he attacks us. The fact is, though, he's
not well-known and that is going to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Bush campaign can seem cocky. But they are haunted
by what happened four years ago, which is why until the votes are
counted on Nov. 3, Bush will continue to squirm a little when
someone calls him ``Governor.''

TENNIS COLUMN: MEN'S GAME DISPLAYS A ONE-NAME MARQUEE 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ The storm came. The storm passed, much like the
unfocused lightning in Marat Safin's racket. Pete Sampras weathered
the wave of humidity, and a touch of tension, posed by an
18-year-old with a future which, for the sake of men's tennis,
can't come soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, though, it was business as usual at the U.S.
Open on Monday. Sampras took care of the rookie Safin in the Round
of 16, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2, and then went home to wait for Andre Agassi,
which he has been doing for most of his professional tennis life.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi had a date with Karol Kucera of Slovakia on Monday night,
the Open hoping for a surge of electricity from an Agassi-Sampras
quarterfinal on Wednesday, though that in itself would not make
this tournament, any more than it saved a decade devoid of a single
great men's rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen with one match,'' said Sampras, never
happy when people fail to appreciate the effort it takes to carry
his sport, year after year.
</P>
<P>
   It was unfair to expect heavy lifting from Safin, the latest
tennis teen-age titan, as even he had predicted the other day that
he had ``no chance'' against the world's No. 1. Sampras again
demonstrated that he is unimpressed by raw power. If you want to
push him on the hardcourts of the Open, you'd better be able to
keep the ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   Safin had a few moments, in the form of two early service games,
when he forcefully announced himself from Russia, at love. Then, as
the sky darkened in biblical proportions over Arthur Ashe Stadium,
Sampras broke Safin at 15 in the 10th game with a reflex volley
forehand to win the first set. By the time they returned, two hours
later, Safin might as well have been back in Moscow, 12 years old
and unable to beat Anna Kournikova, the reigning kid queen of his
club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first set, I couldn't believe the pace of his serve,''
Sampras said, referring to the 130 mph blurs. ``I heard from other
players he had a big game. But you need to find that medium game.
If I were coaching him, he doesn't have to hit the ball so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   While Safin and a few others learn the difference between touch
and go, the men's game will continue in its holding pattern,
waiting for someone with Sampras-like talent to show up and stick
around at the top. That's where Agassi was supposed to be,
challenging Sampras' serve-and-volley precision with his baseline
power. Beyond one glorious year, when he was No. 1, Agassi has
proved most adept at making the art of reinvention routine.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi has taken too much grief for this, for not having
Sampras' resolve. The truth is that Agassi has been more the rule
than the exception, since the big money came into tennis and
allowed the best players a lifestyle cushion when they began to
mentally flab out in their tennis middle age.
</P>
<P>
   The Bjorn Borg-John McEnroe rivalry lasted only until Borg
realized right here at the Open that he couldn't beat McEnroe, and
then he slipped into a limousine and into retirement. When McEnroe,
in turn, surrendered the hill to Ivan Lendl a few years later, his
passions soon turned to music and art. Boris Becker said goodbye
last year at Wimbledon, the lawn he loved most, by shaking the hand
of the new champ, Sampras, and wishing him well.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras doesn't win every Grand Slam, and he could very well
lose on Wednesday if he has to face Kucera, who hammered him in
January at the Australian Open. He actually twice fell to No. 2, on
computer points, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But this is how serious the sport is about Marcelo Rios, who
briefly displaced Sampras in the ranking and was seeded second
here: While Rios was facing elimination in the fifth set against
Magnus Larsson on Sunday night, the USA Network broadcasting team,
starring Mad Dog McEnroe, was fielding phone calls from fans.
</P>
<P>
   With Safin a memory, with Agassi possibly in over his
hair-starved head against Kucera, someone wanted to know if Sampras
thought the defending champion, Patrick Rafter, had achieved
superstar status. Sampras' smile almost turned to laughter. ``To do
it for many, many years is a true sign,'' he said, diplomatically.
``That's the way I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has always saved most of his compliments for Agassi, his Nike
compatriot, who proved in 1995 that he had the style and talent to
be No. 1. Agassi just never had what it took to stay in focus, in
position. No one but Sampras has, and it remains to be seen if
anyone else soon will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, very tough, I think I can't play this game,'' Safin said,
when asked if he had his sights set on Sampras. ``To be half of
Pete Sampras is enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Men's tennis, unfortunately, needs more than that.

SHADOW OF HARLEM RALLY LEADS TO COOL RECEPTION FOR GIULIANI

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Mayor Rudolph Giuliani walked for 13 blocks at the
head of the West Indian American Day Carnival Monday, he was
greeted with boos and catcalls, dozens of signs blasting his
handling of Saturday's youth rally in Harlem and a man on a bicycle
who tried to ride into the middle of his entourage.
</P>
<P>
   The Harlem rally was also invoked after a man grabbed a police
officer's gun and a bullet grazed the officer's leg when the gun
discharged. Police Commissioner Howard Safir later seized on the
incident, saying it seemed ``inspired'' by the inflammatory words
of a black nationalist who spoke at Saturday's youth rally.
</P>
<P>
   But Safir's spokeswoman said later that there was no evidence
available to explain Monday's attack, or to connect it to the
so-called Million Youth March in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was unfazed by his reception at the annual parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been to one of these before?'' Giuliani asked a
reporter who questioned him afterward about the heckling. ``This
wasn't as bad as last year. Everything is relative. The amount of
booing last year was greater. There was more cheering this year.''
</P>
<P>
   A cool response at the West Indian parade is indeed nothing new
for the mayor. He was roundly booed last year in the wake of
charges that Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, was brutally
assaulted by police officers in the 70th Precinct station house. He
was booed at the 1995 parade, two weeks after 28 churchgoers, many
of them immigrants from the Caribbean region, were hurt in a clash
with the police at a church in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the parade watchers ignored the mayor. Giuliani
frequently spoke with onlookers along the parade route, but even
some people who shook his hand expressed reservations afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a good job,'' said Mark Evelyn, an accountant from
Barbados who has lived in East New York for 13 years and who shook
the mayor's hand, earning dirty looks from people on either side of
him. ``I feel a lot safer now, but I think he overreacted a little
bit in Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn's remarks echoed the views of many West Indian Americans,
who have generally supported the mayor for his stands in favor of
immigrants but have often bridled at his administration's treatment
of black people.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's parliament again spurned President Boris
Yeltsin's choice for prime minister Monday after last-minute
negotiations between the Kremlin and a defiant Communist opposition
broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin gave no signs of backing down Monday night over his
nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister. That set the
stage for another debilitating round of political wrangling as the
economy continued to reel out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Dubinin, the beleaguered chairman of the central bank,
resigned Monday after increasing criticism of his role in managing
Russia's financial crisis. His parting shot was a blistering letter
assailing the government for failing to collect taxes and maintain
financial discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The going rate for dollars at local exchange counters hovered
around 20 rubles, and the value of the ruble fell much more at the
national currency exchange before trading was suspended, an ominous
sign that the currency may be in for another round of devaluation.
A month ago, a dollar bought about six rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Many stores in Moscow were virtually picked clean by shoppers
who raided the merchants as imports dried up. Toothpaste, butter,
toilet paper and soap powder have become hard to find. Lines at gas
stations grew as motorists raced to beat price increases of as much
as 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the capital there were shortages and skyrocketing prices
as well. In the Siberian city of Omsk, the price of kielbasa, the
spicy sausage that is a Russian staple, has doubled since the
crisis began two weeks ago. In Novgorod, 300 miles northwest of
Moscow, the cost of medicine soared. Some regional governors are
trying to institute price controls.
</P>
<P>
   As the panic has spread, Chernomyrdin warned parliament Monday
that the country was not merely approaching the danger zone. ``We
are already crossing it,'' he said. ``Russia has never been through
a crisis like this.''
</P>
<P>
   His appeal fell far short. Chernomyrdin needed 226 votes to win
approval. The vote was 278-138 against his nomination. Not even
Yeltsin's offer to install Chernomyrdin on a kind of six-month
probation softened the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the opposition influenced by an offer from Boris
Fyodorov, the Kremlin's top economic strategist. Since the
Communists have been demanding that the government crank up the
presses to print rubles, he announced that the presses would be
turned on _ but not until Chernomyrdin, who has been acting prime
minister since Aug. 23, was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition to Chernomyrdin, who has already served a
term as Yeltsin's prime minister, came from the Communists, who
dominate the legislature along with their leftist allies.
</P>
<P>
   Casting the crisis as a chance to take power back from the
executive branch, the Communists have demanded that Yeltsin agree
to a new plan to share power with Parliament and that he scrap
Chernomyrdin's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Yabloko party, led by Grigory Yavlinsky, has broken
completely with Yeltsin. Yavlinsky Monday incongruously proposed
Yevgeny Primakov, the hard-line foreign minister, for prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky, who broached the idea with Yeltsin Monday, appears to
see a Primakov government as an opportunity to gain a place for
himself in a governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's name was not the only one bandied about. Opposition
members of Parliament have also talked about Yegor Stroyev, the
head of the upper house, and Yuri Luzhkov, the pugnacious mayor of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin supporters insisted that Yeltsin was determined to
stick to his guns and would renominate Chernomyrdin on Tuesday,
paving the way for a third and final showdown with parliament.
</P>
<P>
   A third rejection of Chernomyrdin's nomination would lead to the
dissolution of the legislature and new parliamentary elections
within three months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Anticipating possible parliamentary elections, Yeltsin's Justice
Ministry has issued a ruling that would block the Communists,
Yabloko and other political parties from taking part in a vote this
year. The ministry acted on procedural grounds relating to when
parties can get on the ballot under a 1997 right-to-vote law. But
individual Communists would be able to run on their own.
</P>
<P>
   As the infighting continued, Gennadi Zyuganov, the Communist
leader, said Monday night that he planned to resume talks with
Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With its leaders preoccupied with political intrigue and with no
new government in place to deal with the collapsing economy, Russia
these days is like a storm-tossed boat whose captain and crew are
below deck and whose engine has just quit.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary debate was punctuated with bitter
recriminations. A glum Chernomyrdin warned that a nuclear-armed
Russia would be engulfed in Indonesian-style riots if the crisis
continued to intensify.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to your memory?'' he asked the Communists.
``Were shop counters full at the beginning of the 1990s? It took us
six years to land on our feet, and now you want to throw it all
away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia reached the point where the country went up in
flames,'' Chernomyrdin added. ``Is this what you want?''
</P>
<P>
   The Communists and their leftist allies were not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Yelena Panina, a member of the pro-Communist Power to the People
Party, blamed Chernomyrdin for leading the country into the
financial crisis during his first term as prime minister, from
December 1992 to March of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When King Louis XIV wanted to know what people thought about
him, he disguised himself as a commoner and walked the streets of
Paris,'' she said. ``I suggest you try this and find out about what
people say about you and your reforms in Moscow. But you'd better
disguise yourself really well. You'll be in trouble if they
recognize you.''
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling produced some bizarre role reversals.
</P>
<P>
   After the liberal Yavlinsky endorsed Primakov for prime
minister, the ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky delivered a
tirade against the foreign minister, who has made his mark as a
bitter foe of NATO expansion and an opponent of American dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky charged that Primakov had encouraged the Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan in an earlier era. And he complained
that Yavlinsky had cut a cynical deal to support Primakov in return
for appointment as the top Kremlin aide in charge of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   There were few voices of moderation. But as the acid debate
intensified, Galina Starovoytova, a liberal legislator, finally
burst in. She laid the blame for Russia's travails at the feet of
the Communists, who have repeatedly sought to frustrate the
government's market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would like to bring us back to the pre-perestroika time,''
she said, referring to the reforms ushered in by the last Soviet
leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. ``Congratulations. You managed to do it.
Look at the empty shop counters. It's the result of your
activities.''

ANALYSIS: CLASH SUSTAINS MAYOR'S IMAGE AS PUGNACIOUS LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To hear Mayor Rudolph Giuliani tell it Monday, the
largest and best Police Department in the country simply had to
storm a stage at a Harlem youth rally on Saturday. The concluding
speech of its chief organizer, a peripheral preacher of hate named
Khallid Abdul Muhammad, was so inflammatory _ ``telling people to
shoot and kill police officers'' _ that the riot police had no
recourse but to slap down their face guards and seize the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Very few have dared to champion the words and actions of
Muhammad, who has vanished in a puff of anti-Semitic exhaust. But
that has not absolved Giuliani from criticism. Some believe that
the mayor's defense Monday _ which also included a now customary
attack on the news media _ obfuscates what they say is at the root
of the rally's ugly denouement: the imposition of Giuliani's will
upon any activity that he finds distasteful or not in keeping with
his quality-of-life vision for New York City.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that the city's abrupt ending of the rally _ so
startling that it prompted several minutes of minor violence _ did
not occur in a vacuum. Since the mayor began his second term in
January, a growing number of judges and constitutional lawyers have
complained that his policies infringe on First Amendment rights;
this latest event seemed to be only one in a series. And given the
taunts that Muhammad gleefully directed at Giuliani in recent
weeks, particularly after a federal appeals court upheld his right
to hold the rally, few expected the mayor to cede to him the last
angry word.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Celli, a civil rights lawyer, called it ``classic
Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   But others use the phrase ``classic Giuliani'' as a compliment.
Polls indicate that the mayor remains very popular, suggesting a
public validation of those aggressive policies that civil
libertarians find so troubling. Although the public's reaction to
the police action Saturday has not yet been measured, one frequent
critic, City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, said that the mayor had
responded properly to a dangerous situation. And, as the mayor
points out, for all the angry words not one person was seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
   For several months preceding the rally _ billed as the Million
Youth March _ the Giuliani administration sought to block it, if
not from the city entirely, then at least from Harlem, and at least
from taking place on Labor Day weekend. The administration's
primary argument was that there were not enough officers on a
holiday to handle an event that its organizers said would take up
12 hours and 29 city blocks (estimates that later proved
ridiculously out of whack). At the same time, the administration
was fighting, and often losing, assorted other free-speech battles.
</P>
<P>
   It blocked taxi drivers from crossing the 59th Street Bridge on
the pretext that they planned to bring city traffic to a halt, then
refused to allow more than 20 drivers to assemble for a protest of
stricter taxi regulations _ all in violation of constitutional
rights, a federal judge later ruled. It imposed licensing
regulations on sidewalk artists and on newsstands that federal
judges found to be too broad. It barred city employees from talking
to reporters, which a federal appellate court ruled infringed on
the First Amendment rights of the employees. And it set crowd
limits for events on the steps of City Hall, limits that critics
say were selectively enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Taken individually, the incidents might have represented nothing
more than different interpretations of law and municipal
governance. Taken collectively, the mayor's critics say, they
suggest systematic suppression.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if to punctuate the point, there came a phalanx of
police officers on Saturday to storm a stage at a rally that until
then had been so peaceful that no arrests had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's consistent with his myopic and vindictive, restrictive
view of the First Amendment,'' said Norman Siegel, who as director
of the New York Civil Liberties Union is rarely in the good graces
of City Hall. ``He's now not just complaining about New York
magazine doing a satire of him, or cabbies coming over the 59th
Street Bridge, or people gathering on the steps of City Hall. He's
now trying to trample on traditional First Amendment rights to
protest.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Siegel is a familiar critic of the mayor's. But he was
particularly exercised by Saturday's scuffle because, like
reporters covering the rally, he was less than 100 feet from the
stage when Muhammad was ending the rally with his melange of love
and hate, peace and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the mayor's version of those final moments, Muhammad
did not tell people to ``shoot and kill police officers.'' Instead,
he demonstrated his rich experience as a hatemonger by cleverly
urging retaliation only if provoked _ a fine point to some, an
essential point in the arena of protected free speech. Pointing out
the cocoon of police surrounding the event, he turned the officers
into props for his disturbing soliloquy. ``If anyone attacks you,''
he said at one point, ``already decide who will be the ones to
disconnect the railing where you are and beat the hell out of them
with the railing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was rhetoric like this that Giuliani later said prompted the
police to mount the stage _ only seconds after Muhammad had ended
his tirade with the oddly paternal ``Go home to your families'' _
and pull the plug, prompting a melee that, while brief, will long
linger in the communal memory of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police handled it superbly,'' Giuliani maintained Monday.
``They couldn't possibly have done a better job. The lack of
violence is really truly attributable only to the police, given the
invocations to violence, the fact that it ended in the last 10
minutes with a call to kill police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   There is healthy debate among former police officials and
crowd-control experts as to whether the police acted properly,
given their extensive training to deflate, rather than inflate,
confrontations, and to ignore taunts, no matter how hateful. There
is also debate as to whether Muhammad's words were akin to yelling
``Fire!'' in a movie theater. No one expects such a shout in a
theater; everyone expected Muhammad to talk trash, just as they
would expect Carol Channing to belt out ``Hello, Dolly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a lot of people knew that Muhammad and some of
the other leaders were going for gross exaggeration,'' said Sheldon
Leffler, chairman of the City Council's Public Safety Committee.
``I don't think the comments he made at close to 4 o'clock were
sufficient grounds for the police to move forth.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. David Paterson of Harlem said that while Muhammad
should be charged with inciting to riot _ putting at risk the very
youth he said he wanted to help _ the Giuliani administration is
also to blame for underestimating the people of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when Muhammad exhorted the crowd to violence, some
cheered but all ignored him,'' he said. ``This did not deserve a
police deployment as though a riot was already in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   According to accounts by witnesses, this much is true: the
throwing of chairs, bottles and fists happened only after the
police took the stage and pulled the plug. That thought left Celli
wondering about timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would have happened if the police had not reacted 30
seconds after the deadline?'' he asked. ``If they had waited 30
minutes, Khallid Muhammad would have looked like just another
insane soapbox speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Giuliani only bolstered his image as a
``classic'' _ however you want to take that.

SAMPRAS KEEPS THE FUTURE IN ITS PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the sky went from gray to green to black on
Monday, Pete Sampras looked up, registered the appropriate
apprehension and played on. After all, the spotlights were in
working order inside the Arthur Ashe Stadium and he was scant
serves away from taking a 6-4, 2-1 lead over Marat Safin in a
routine rout that eventually landed the four-time champion in the
quarterfinals, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. So Sampras, with his tunnel vision
intact, wasn't budging until he had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a scary sight,'' he said. ``Really, it was like green
out there. It was. Maybe it was going to rain money.'' And maybe it
was going to rain cats and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The harried tournament officials at the Open, warned by their
in-house radar that a storm on the scale of the humdinger that sent
Dorothy to Oz was right on the doorstep, had already shut down the
matches on a dozen courts, including the stadium where the
fifth-seeded Venus Williams, last year's runner-up, was halfway
through a 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) victory over 12th-seeded Mary Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   But the one court they had not yet evacuated was their biggest,
the Ashe Stadium, and their frantic signals there from the
sidelines to Sampras on the service line went ignored until he'd
secured his 2-1 lead and headed for his changeover chair.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the loudspeaker ordered spectators to do what the
electronic message on the scoreboard had been suggesting for 45
minutes: leave their seats and seek shelter from a hard-driving
thunderstorm that was just five minutes from striking the USTA
National Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation went smoothly with the exception of minor
injuries sustained by two spectators who disobeyed orders to stay
put and take shelter. They ventured outside brandishing umbrellas
in the gale-force wind and lightning and wound up slipping and
falling on the rain-slicked pavement.
</P>
<P>
   The players all repaired to their respective locker rooms while
a horizontal rain bent the saplings double out on the concourse,
but 125 minutes later, all was calm. The squeegee patrol had done
its duty drying off the well-washed hardcourts, and Sampras, Safin,
and the rest were back in business.
</P>
<P>
   But the top-seeded Sampras and Russia's 60th-ranked Safin, the
18-year-old sensation whose talents are the envy of junior
development programs of every nation, didn't take long to bring
official closure to the pecking order that established itself early
in their encounter. Sampras, who spewed 18 aces to just 10 by his
outclassed challenger, needed only one hour 17 minutes to send the
teenager back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to improve many things to be like Pete,'' said Safin.
``He played tennis perfect, almost perfect. He has unbelievable
serve; he put many pressures all the time because he's moving to
the net all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Davis Cup debut this spring, Safin took Jim Courier to
five sets in the fifth and deciding match, and a month later he
defeated Andre Agassi and Gustavo Kuerten at the French Open, but
Safin described Sampras as an opponent from a superior planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the summer I play against the guys who are more or less my
level; this unbelievable level is No. 1 in the world. It was
impossible to break him,'' said Safin. ``To be half of Pete Sampras
is enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sampras, Safin is already a better player at 18
than he remembers himself being: ``I was pretty flaky; I'm not
really sure at that point what I really wanted from tennis. I was
still trying to make my mark, still trying to break into the top
50, the top 20, and I did that just about when I turned 19 and won
here,'' Sampras said of his first Slam title.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras said the scouting report on Safin revolved around the
word ``big'': a big guy with big shots who's prone to taking big
chances and making big mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll learn how to tone his shots down a little bit; he's very
talented, but also very young,'' said Sampras. ``First set, I
couldn't believe the pace of his serves. As the match went on, I
started to pick it off a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Sampras left himself three rounds from a fifth
Open championship, an achievement that would tie him with Jimmy
Connors for the Open record and tie him with Roy Emerson for the
all-time lead in Slam titles with 12. Sampras refused to admit that
his flirtation with the record books is causing him undue stress
here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Wimbledon was a huge confidence booster,'' said Sampras, who
tied Bjorn Borg's record five titles there by defending his 1997
title and defeating Goran Ivanisevic in the final. ``I feel pretty
relaxed. Now at 27, I've been through enough situations to
hopefully handle it. Whoever I play, I feel like I'm ready,'' he
said, referring to either the 8th-seeded Andre Agassi or the
9th-seeded Karol Kucera, the player who dethroned him at the
Australian Open earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kucera really picked me apart quite a bit in Australia,'' said
Sampras, whose fourth-round loss there to the Slovak provoked him
to embark on a major fitness campaign because it left him feeling
``wimpy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sucking wind,'' he said. ``And when I thought about it
afterwards, I realized I was taking too many shortcuts with my
fitness, wasn't paying the price in training. And that match made
it show.''
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Spain's fourth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the reigning
French Open champion and the Open's 1994 champion, eliminated
15th-seeded Anna Kournikova 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 in a match that was
delayed by the rain and moved to the Grandstand court because of a
weather-related schedule shuffle. ... In a minor fourth-round upset
on the women's side, South Africa's 13th-seeded Amanda Coetzer
outlasted No. 7 Conchita Martinez, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, in a balloon-ball
filled encounter that took two hours 38 minutes to reach a
resolution. Martinez, who complained of chronic neck pain during
and after the match, had beaten Coetzer in 12 of their 13 previous
meetings. Coetzer's quarterfinal opponent is second-seeded Lindsay
Davenport, a 6-4, 6-1 winner against 10th-seeded Nathalie Tauziat.
... The men's doubles event, already devoid of its top seeds
because of Jacco Eltingh's withdrawal to attend the birth of his
first child, also lost the second-seeded team of Todd Woodbridge
and Mark Woodforde: Australia's Woodies, owners of nine slam
crowns, were upended 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 by Sandon Stolle and Cyril Suk.

RECORDER STOPPED WORKING SIX MINUTES BEFORE CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Inserts new 4th graf.)  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD

<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ A preliminary examination of the flight
data recorder from Swissair Flight 111, indicates that it survived
the crash on Wednesday night but had stopped working about six
minutes before the MD-11 plunged into the sea off Nova Scotia, the
chief investigator said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Vic Gerden, said the finding was
disappointing, but added that that the data recorder should still
have preserved a huge volume of data on hundreds of aspects of the
plane's operation before it dipped below 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If indeed we have the flight data information down to 10,000
feet, we will have a lot of information,'' Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board of
Canada, which is in charge of the investigation, said Monday that
searchers had gathered debris showing signs of smoke damage. But
the debris came off the shoreline of the rugged coast here, and
technicians had yet to ascertain that the material came from the
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder appears to have quit when the plane
dipped below 10,000 feet, at about the time of the last radio
transmission from the crew, and about the time that the
transponder, a device that tells the ground-based radar the plane's
identity and altitude, also stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder is one of the two ``black boxes'' on
the plane. The other is the cockpit voice recorder, which has not
yet been retrieved. The cockpit voice recorder runs on the same
circuit as the data recorder, so it is also likely to be blank for
the last six minutes, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers on Monday homed in on the signal but failed to find
the precise location of the box before diving was halted for 36
hours because of sea swells reaching up to 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity to the recorders could have been cut off by a
malfunction, experts said, or if the pilots followed the standard
procedure for fighting on-board fires by sequentially shutting down
parts of the electric system.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft experts said the MD-11 has a three-position toggle
switch that allows the pilot to sequentially turn off a third of
the electric systems at a time. The procedure is to switch off one
of the three systems and wait up to one minute to see if the smoke
abates. If it does not, the switch is moved to another position,
restarting the first system and turning off the next one.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's two transponders, however, operate on two different
electrical circuits, so if the pilots had followed this toggle
procedure and nothing else was wrong, the transponder should not
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder is a very strong box packed with rows
of computer data storage chips, called ``nonvolatile storage,''
because unlike the memory chips in a desktop computer, they hold
their data when the power fails.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder on this MD-11 tracks 250 different parameters, or
aspects of the flight, investigators said Monday. That makes it one
of the most advanced ever analyzed after a big crash. By contrast,
Trans World Airlines Flight 800, an older Boeing 747 that exploded
off Long Island, N.Y., two years ago, had 17 parameters, and USAir
427, a Boeing 737 that crashed near Pittsburgh four years ago, had
11.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic parameters measure such factors as the plane's
heading, air speed, vertical acceleration and engine function. More
advanced planes like the MD-11, with computerized cockpits, record
the functioning of dozens of other systems, showing what commands
were given in the cockpit and the position of the rudder, flaps and
other flight-control surfaces. It should record the functioning of
the cabin smoke alarm and lavatory smoke alarm, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in other recent crashes of computerized aircraft,
like the Boeing 767 that hit a mountain near Cali, Colombia, in
December 1995, investigators have retrieved cockpit components and
extracted data from them _ for as long as they had electrical
power.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder could also show much about what the crew knew, and
when they knew it. ``Will the flight data recorder reveal a
steadily worsening situation that was somehow masked to the crew?''
said one investigator. If that is the case, said the investigator,
``by the time the crew realizes they can't fly the plane, the show
is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson for flight safety, he said, would be to set up
aircraft equipment or cockpit computers differently, to give
earlier warning, or more emphatic warning, of whatever doomed
Swissair 111.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police also have high hopes for the
information on the flight data recorder. ``Our investigation is
either going to accelerate sharply or decline sharply on the basis
of the box,'' said Chief Superintendent Stephen Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden, the chief investigator, said engineers would have to
translate the raw data of the flight data recorder into usable
data. He would not say when he expected results.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   In Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board on
Monday sent its chief flight data recorder expert to Ottawa to
help. On Monday evening, the Canadian Navy was expecting the
arrival by plane of two U.S. Navy salvage experts, who are arriving
two days in advance of their ship, the Grapple, which is on its
from Philadelphia. The Grapple was a mainstay of the recovery
operation of TWA 800 off Long Island two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This recovery effort may be quite different. The water is
substantially deeper, up to 190 feet vs. 120 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Phil Webster of the Navy said that the two divers who
picked up the flight data recorder Sunday had had to surface
quickly, because one of them had a leak in his suit; his partner
managed to hold onto the black box, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two were put in a decompression chamber and later taken to a
hospital overnight; they have been sent home and barred from diving
for two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary indications are that the debris field here is much
smaller than in the TWA investigation. Investigators hope that the
black boxes will tell them enough about the location of the problem
that they can pick and choose what parts of the plane to retrieve.
</P>
<P>
   But the human remains appear to be much more fragmented.
Maritime officials said they would soon begin towing subsurface
nets, like those used for fishing, to find human remains floating
beneath the surface; in the meantime, they have expanded their
shoreline search to a greater area, because of reports of debris
and remains washing ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention centered Monday on whether the crew should have
attempted a direct landing from its cruise altitude of 33,000 feet,
even though the plane was 30 metric tons above maximum landing
weight. The plane can dump only a little over 2.5 tons per minute.
And it was only 30 miles from the runway; a normal descent from
33,000 feet begins more than 100 miles out.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair executives have said the plane could not have landed
directly.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden, asked if the plane could theoretically have done so,
said, ``That calculation obviously is going to be made and it will
be considered.'' But, he said, the crew was busy trying to fight
smoke and prepare to land at an unexpected airport. ``It would be
misleading just to provide one simple piece of information like
that,'' he said.

VALENTINE GOES TO THE MAT IN METS' 8-7 WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sight of Bobby Valentine and his coaching staff
sprawled on their hands and knees on the protective tarp at Shea
Stadium in the midst of a maelstrom _ which the eventual winning
pitcher, Greg McMichael, later described as akin to a typhoon _ was
surreal enough.
</P>
<P>
   But it clearly showed exactly how far the Mets' manager would go
to ensure that Monday's wet and wild 8-7 victory over the Atlanta
Braves _ a game won on Edgardo Alfonzo's eighth-inning two-run home
run after the Mets had blown a pair of four-run leads _ would not
be postponed because of a severe thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he was only trying to help the grounds crew,
which was having a tough time putting the tarp down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have been kites,'' Valentine said of the stadium
employees, who were being blown around the infield like the flag in
center field.
</P>
<P>
   Some might argue that Valentine was also desperately trying to
protect the 4-0 lead the Mets had when the rain began after three
innings, especially with everyone in the stadium aware that the
Cubs were losing in St. Louis after the crowd of 22,953 had saluted
a replay of Mark McGwire's 61st homer with a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful what you wish for. Because after the tarp endured a
fierce 1-hour-48-minute rain delay, the Braves rallied twice to
take a 7-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Atlanta's runs came in the sixth-inning rally that saw
center fielder Brian McRae nearly become the goat. McRae had failed
to make sure that right fielder Lenny Harris shifted left with him
just before Gerald Williams tied the score at 6-6 with a two-run
triple to right-center that dropped between McRae and Harris, both
of whom gave up on the ball. And the Braves later took a one-run
edge in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But then Alfonzo delivered another huge hit late in the game in
what has become more than a month full of them. The Mets' third
baseman followed a two-out walk in the eighth to Tony Phillips, who
had fallen behind 0-2 in the count, with a full-count home run to
left off the Atlanta left-hander John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo's career-high 16th homer of the year led to a victory
that was secured only after John Franco set the heart of the
Atlanta lineup down in order in the ninth for his 33rd save.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in the last 10 days, twice on drives by
Alfonzo and once on a homer by Phillips, the Mets had rallied from
one run down in the eighth or ninth inning with a home run that put
them one run up in a game they would win. And for the first time in
a week, the Mets (80-64) were once again tied with the Cubs for the
National League wild-card lead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The tarp's not the story,'' Valentine would later say.
``Fonzie is. And John Franco.''
</P>
<P>
   And Phillips. And Luis Lopez, for that matter. Lopez had driven
in four of the Mets' first six runs to tie his career high.
Phillips (with his second homer in three days) and McRae had driven
in the others.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Mets could not slither out of the top of the sixth
until they had surrendered the lead. All five of the Braves' runs
in the inning came with two outs. Andruw Jones blasted his 28th
homer, off Rigo Beltran. Eddie Perez doubled inside third. Ozzie
Guillen walked as Beltran was nearly tossed for the way he was
reacting to calls by the home plate umpire, Mark Hirschbeck.
</P>
<P>
   On came Turk Wendell. But pinch-hitter Greg Colbrunn delivered a
run-scoring single to left. And it was 6-4. On a full count,
Williams followed with his two-run triple on a ball that McRae
should probably have caught. And now it was 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have moved Lenny over a little bit more,'' McRae
said. ``But I thought he had the better shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graffanino then blooped a single to right-center to score
Williams for a one-run Atlanta lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets seem to thrive on adversity, not to mention one-run
games, in which they lead the majors with 32 victories. ``When the
lead was blown away, I thought it was plenty early for us to come
back,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever go up to get a walk,'' Phillips said. ``But any
time I can get on base in front of Alfonzo is big, because he can
flat-out hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo faced Rocker and worked the count full. Alfonzo had
beaten the Dodgers in Los Angeles on Aug. 29 with a two-out,
two-strike homer in the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to put the ball in play,'' said Alfonzo, who
tied his career high with his 72nd RBI. ``I know I've got a little
power. But at 3-2, I was just trying to get on base because John
Olerud and Mike Piazza were behind me. I was just trying to protect
the plate. And it went out.''

3 KILLED AS STORMS BATTER N.Y. STATE AND CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to expand last 3 grafs to 5 grafs, with additional
reporting)  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Punishing thunderstorms and brutal hurricane-force
winds wrought destruction across a broad area of upstate New York
and around New York City Monday, battering houses, toppling power
lines, capsizing boats and causing at least three deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, a 19-year-old woman was killed when high winds
sent a tree branch crashing down on her head as she attended a
Labor Day barbecue in the courtyard of a housing project,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Authority officers at the Edenwald Houses, on East 229th
Street at Baychester Avenue, said the woman, whom officials
identified as Iesamama Neal, was sitting at a concrete chess table
with her 2-year-old brother when the branch plummeted. ``She was
able to push the 2-year-old under the table, which saved him,''
said Rosa Morales, the first Housing Authority officer to arrive on
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, two men were killed on the New York State Fair Grounds
in Syracuse shortly after 1 a.m., when winds gusting more than 75
miles an hour ripped the roofs from several buildings and branches
from trees and hurled the debris on top of the structures in which
the men were sleeping, according to state police and fair
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere around the city and state, the storms disrupted the
Labor Day holiday in ways both large and small, life-threatening
and pleasure-spoiling.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses lost power; in the
Syracuse and Rochester areas, utility company officials said
electricity might not be restored to some customers for as long as
a week. Fallen trees left many upstate roads impassable, and fallen
power lines rendered them perilous, prompting several counties,
cities and towns to prohibit any traffic other than emergency
vehicles and repair crews.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York City area, sudden torrential downpours between 2
p.m. and 4 p.m. sent spectators at the U.S. Open tennis tournament
in Flushing, Queens, and the West Indian American Day Carnival
parade in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, scurrying for shelter. And the
rains and winds stranded some boaters off the coasts of Long Island
and New Jersey, forcing the U.S. Coast Guard to conduct water and
air rescues.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service officials said that although the storm
systems that hit different areas of New York state were not
identical, they were born of the same conditions: the violent
collision of a late-summer heat wave with the leading edge of a
cold front auguring autumn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What energizes weather systems in general is strong
temperature contrasts,'' Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at
Pennsylvania State University, explained Monday afternoon. ``And
this morning, just ahead of this cold front, it was in the low
90s.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, temperatures may drop into the low 70s and even the
60s for the rest of the week, Gadomski and other meteorologists
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although people reported tornadoes in Syracuse, Bethpage and
Great Neck on Long Island, and in Rahway, N.J., National Weather
Service officials said Monday evening that they could not
definitively confirm that tornadoes had touched down in those
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people caught in the storms, which in some areas
included rapid-fire lightning and balls of hail, said they had
seldom witnessed anything like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a state of disbelief,'' said Terry Kennedy of Dewitt,
a suburb of Syracuse. One tree had fallen into Kennedy's roof,
another had flattened his daughter's car, and yet another had ended
up in a neighbor's swimming pool. But Kennedy, his wife and their
children expressed something akin to relief. ``Everybody's happy
that we're alive,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Syracuse and Rochester areas were perhaps the hardest hit.
Gov. George Pataki declared nine counties in that region to be in
states of emergency, which meant that the state would provide
financial and other resources to those counties if help was
requested.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Michalski, a spokesman for the New York State Emergency
Management Office, estimated that about 300,000 homes and
residences along a geographic band between Buffalo and Albany had
lost electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Utility company officials said that some might not regain power
for many days, and a few upstate school districts said that the
start of the school year, scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday, might
have to be postponed for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of people had to seek refuge at temporary shelters
because of damage to their homes, and signs of property destruction
were abundant in and around Syracuse, where a prominent Catholic
church, St. Lucy's in downtown Syracuse, lost one of its steeples.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Fair, which was supposed to be open for its
12th and last day Monday, had to remain closed because of damage to
the fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Michalski said that in addition to the deaths at the fairgrounds
of John Perry, 43, of Silver Creek, and Beryl Stone, 61, of Central
Square, more than a dozen other upstate residents were injured,
none critically.
</P>
<P>
   There were additional reports of people with storm-related
injuries around New York City, including a man who was parasailing
on Barnegat Bay at the Jersey Shore when he was trapped in the
winds. Local law enforcement officials did not identify him but
said that he had fractured his skull and was in guarded condition
at Atlantic City Medical Center Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials for utility companies around New York
City, about 34,500 customers in the city and Westchester County
lost power, along with roughly 110,000 on Long Island; 60,000 in
New Jersey, and 10,000 in southern Connecticut. Many had power back
by Monday night.

A FAMILY CELEBRATION FOR A HISTORIC MOMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Seconds after Mark McGwire's 61st homer was safely
tucked in Section 281 in the left-field loge area at Busch Stadium,
he focused on his faith and his family during his most memorable
trot of the year. McGwire raised his finger to the sky, pointed
behind home to his giddy father, and then touched the plate, lifted
his 10-year-old son, Matthew, and gave the boy a bearhug.
</P>
<P>
   It was a priceless slice of history, because of what McGwire
accomplished _ tying Roger Maris' single-season home run record _
and because it was fraught with the disparate feelings of an epic
event and a family picnic. There were 50,530 fans watching the
first-inning blast off Chicago's Mike Morgan, but if McGwire had
closed his eyes, he could have been smacking a ball over the fence
in his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   His father was here. His mother was in the next seat. His son
was waiting for him. It could have been a dream, but it was not. It
was as real as McGwire's storybook season, which continued to
unreel like a movie, one that could star Kevin Costner or Robert
Redford.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's son did not arrive from California until 30 minutes
before the game, and Sunday was also the 61st birthday of McGwire's
father. Is there such a thing as fate? The McGwire family thinks
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I will ever let go of the moment,'' said
McGwire, his face as red as his hair. ``I don't know if I will ever
be here again. So how can you let it go? What I have done is
fabulous. I am going to enjoy it right now. I know that I am one
swing away. You know, the whole time I just thought what a great
birthday present for my father.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire actually pointed to his father a second time, in case
John McGwire had missed the first one. But John, who leaped out of
his seat and screamed, ``That's it,'' as the baseball zoomed down
the left-field line, memorized every step and every motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that he was going to hit 61 for my birthday,'' said
the elder McGwire Asked whether he believed his son, he said:
``Yes. I know he's a man of his word.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris' four sons and one of his two daughters were seated beside
the Cardinals' dugout, and McGwire, so focused on family, did not
forget the family of the man he will be linked with forever. Once
he returned to the dugout, he pointed to the heavens, pointed to
his heart to let the Marises know their father was with him and
blew them a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to meet with them someday when this is all over
and to talk to them and basically tell them the feeling, what their
father was going through at that time, because it is an amazing
feeling,'' McGwire said. ``I mean, what can I say? Thank you for
being here and watching this and, believe me, he is in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Mark McGwire is also a man who is poised to shatter Maris'
37-year-old record.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until McGwire went to retrieve his 33-ounce bat from beneath the
dugout in the bottom of the first inning, he did not know that
Matthew had made it and was outfitted in a Cardinal uniform, ready
to serve as bat boy and good luck charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I loved him, I gave him a kiss, and the next thing
I knew I see him at home plate,'' McGwire said. ``And what a
wonderful feeling a father could have.''
</P>
<P>
   For the father who hit the home run, and for the father who
watched his son hit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adjectives are hard to come by,'' said John McGwire, who wore
a Cardinals cap and sat beside his wife, Ginger, outside the St.
Louis clubhouse. ``It was a supreme feeling. I'm just so happy for
Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew was standing near his father's locker when reporters
asked him about the homer. The boy, who has been instructed not to
do interviews, hunched his shoulders and scurried away. All Matthew
did was giggle when his father wrapped him up following the homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have to say anything,'' McGwire said. ``His eyes
said it all.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 8:
</P>
<P>
   In a gain for cleaner politics, Senate Republicans have dropped
their effort to oust a top official at the Federal Election
Commission who has been a vigorous foe of campaign fund-raising
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, at least for now, Lawrence Noble, the commission's
general counsel, will be able to continue his outstanding work
trying to end the practice of using unregulated ``soft money''
raised by the national political parties for costly ad campaigns
for candidates in clear violation of the election laws.
</P>
<P>
   The attempted lynching of Noble was mounted by Sen. Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, who argues that lawmakers have a
constitutional right to take money from special interests,
especially the tobacco industry. This summer, he attached a measure
cutting off Noble's term to a Treasury spending bill. On Thursday,
however, he accepted a deal in which term limits would apply to
future general counsels, with Noble keeping his job until 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The latest word on Capitol Hill is that McConnell may now try to
cheat the reformers of their victory with another sneak attack as
early as this week. He has not ruled out working with like-minded
Republicans to get the Noble ouster put back on the Treasury
measure in conference with the House, even though it was never in
the House version. That move would betray the spirit of last week's
deal. Proponents of clean elections must do all they can to stop
it.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: AGENT ORANGE IN VIETNAM, 30 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PHILIP M. BOFFEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Le Cao Dai, one of Vietnam's top experts on the health
effects of Agent Orange, first encountered American military
herbicides when he ran a field hospital for the North Vietnamese
army along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. American planes would fly low
over the forest canopy and release a cloud of chemicals. Within
days, the leaves would begin to fall, forcing Dai to move his
hospital deeper into the forest for concealment. Only later did he
come to believe that the spraying had done long-term health damage
to Vietnamese soldiers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   That belief is shared by leading Vietnamese doctors who were
interviewed on a recent trip through Vietnam. None would hazard a
guess to this writer as to how extensive the damage had been, but
one was later quoted in the Vietnamese press as asserting that some
70,000 Vietnamese are now suffering from illnesses caused by Agent
Orange.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence to support these beliefs is weak, for it is a sad
irony of the Vietnam War that those most likely to have been
affected by the spraying _ the Vietnamese themselves _ have been
the least effectively studied. The United States has put enormous
effort into assessing possible harm to American soldiers but found
only limited damage, perhaps because most soldiers had relatively
little contact with the chemicals during their short tours of duty.
Meanwhile, the Vietnamese troops directly under the spray and
civilians who lived in the sprayed areas for years or moved in
later, have been studied primarily by Vietnamese scientists whose
results are not generally accepted by scientists from more advanced
nations.
</P>
<P>
   American herbicides, of which the most prominent was Agent
Orange, were widely dispersed to defoliate trees over supply
routes, clear away brush from roadsides, riverbanks and base camps,
and kill food crops that sustained guerrilla bands. More than 10
percent of the land area of South Vietnam was sprayed at least
once, and some areas were sprayed repeatedly. The herbicides
themselves would generally dissipate within weeks but would leave
behind a toxic contaminant, dioxin, that was inadvertently created
during the manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists who inquire about Agent Orange are routinely taken
to ``peace villages'' to see malformed children, to an exhibit on
health consequences at the medical school in Hanoi or to a
collection of malformed fetuses at an obstetrical hospital in Ho
Chi Minh City. All three sites make a powerful case that there is
appalling illness in Vietnam, but all fall short of demonstrating
that Agent Orange was the culprit. The birth defects, cancers and
other illnesses that the Vietnamese attribute to Agent Orange can
be caused by a wide range of factors, and Agent Orange may not be
prominent among them.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemiological and laboratory studies that offer the best
hope of teasing out answers are difficult for even the most
advanced scientific countries to perform. Vietnamese studies that
purport to find excess cancers, birth defects and other illnesses
in soldiers and civilians from areas that were sprayed are
discounted by Western experts for lack of stringent methodology.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese and American scientists once started a collaborative
research effort, but it fell apart three years ago when Vietnamese
authorities confiscated research samples before they could leave
the country. Now, however, the Vietnamese and the American Embassy
in Hanoi are both suggesting a joint study of the effects of the
herbicides. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has been asked to
consider whether it is feasible to do a study so long after the
spraying, in a nation where health records and disease measures are
notoriously incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   The research seems well worth doing, if it is technically
feasible. An authoritative study would add to the growing
literature on the health effects of herbicides and dioxin, could
help the Vietnamese decide how to allocate scarce health resources
and might shed additional light on the effects of Agent Orange in
American veterans. Most compelling of all, it might finally close
one of the festering wounds from the Vietnam War.

EDITORIAL: A NOMINATION FOR GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 8:
</P>
<P>
   It is important that the Democratic Party pick a credible
candidate to run for governor of New York this fall. Of the four
people seeking the nomination, our preference is for City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone. Running the state of New York requires the
ability to lead and compromise, in equal measure. Vallone has
proved in recent years that he can do both.
</P>
<P>
   In his 12 years as head of the Council, Vallone has turned what
used to be a legislative joke into a far more serious body. A new
charter gave the Council additional power, but it did not change
the culture of what had always been a largely mediocre group of
lawmakers with extremely parochial views. Vallone made it a
responsible decision-maker that can serve as a counterbalance to
the city's strong mayor. Vallone has shown good judgment in his
staff appointments, and over the years he has proved himself an
advocate of campaign finance reform, a sensible moderate in budget
matters and a consumer advocate. He also has a right to take some
credit for the city's drop in crime, having joined with former
Mayor David Dinkins to champion the Safe Streets program, which
dramatically increased money available for law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Although her campaign seems to be in shambles after the
spectacle of her husband withdrawing his financial support, Lt.
Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross remains the candidate with the best name
recognition in this field. Ms. Ross, who started this term as Gov.
George Pataki's running mate, has no administrative experience and
a history that suggests she has little ability to handle staff. Her
credibility problems extend far beyond the question of whether she
will have any money for advertisements. While Ms. Ross' knowledge
of policy is strong in many areas, she has never given anything
close to a clear explanation for her rapid party switches and
shifting alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the other Democratic candidates, former State
Transportation Commissioner James Larocca of Long Island and
Charles Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, have experience and
positions on the issues that make them much more attractive
candidates. Larocca's ideas are particularly impressive, and we
would not preclude supporting either in the final election if
Vallone should fail to win the primary. But one of the most
important criteria in picking a nominee is the ability to mount a
strong campaign in the general election, and on that count Vallone
seems a better choice. It is extremely important for the state that
the race for governor be competitive and focused. New York is
facing too many challenges to pass up this opportunity for debating
them.
</P>
<P>
   Our endorsement of Vallone should not be read as an indication
that we have committed to support him over Pataki in November. We
are eager to watch the campaign and make a judgment later, and most
voters undoubtedly feel the same.
</P>
<P>
   For Lieutenant Governor
</P>
<P>
   Vallone is running as a team with Clyde Rabideau, the mayor of
Plattsburgh, who is a candidate for lieutenant governor. There are
two other attractive candidates for the second slot, Sandra
Frankel, the supervisor of Brighton, a town in upstate New York,
and Charles King, a party official from Manhattan. But Vallone
seems to have made a good choice. Rabideau is well versed in both
state issues and the problems of local government.

DRUGS TAINT ANNUAL GAY REVELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., La., Calif., Fla., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It began in the early stages of the AIDS epidemic as
a relatively modest affair, a respite for the living and
remembrance of the dead that was held in daylight, so that even the
ill might be able to go, and it was given a double-edged title
resonant of grief.
</P>
<P>
   A decade and a half later, the Morning Party has evolved into a
glamorous social event that attracts hordes of gay men to Fire
Island and reliably raises enormous sums of money for Gay Men's
Health Crisis, perhaps the United States' most respected AIDS
service organization.
</P>
<P>
   This year's gathering, on Aug. 16, was no different. About 4,500
men went, $450,000 was raised and a good time was had by many.
</P>
<P>
   But the hangover has been formidable, underlining the way the
event has become an albatross around the health group's neck and a
flash point in an increasingly bitter debate over the alliances
between AIDS service organizations and a network of dance-oriented
fund-raisers at which a substantial number of participants are high
on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the predawn hours leading up to this year's Morning Party, a
35-year-old man from Bronxville overdosed and died.
</P>
<P>
   In the three weeks since, many gay men are again questioning the
propriety of the group's endorsement of a party that seems to
inspire the kind of drug consumption widely thought to increase the
likelihood of unsafe sexual behavior and the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the organization not only money but future clients,''
said Troy Masters, the publisher of LGNY, a twice-monthly newspaper
for lesbians and gay men in New York. ``In a way, it's like a
self-perpetuating machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of this kind has been aimed at Gay Men's Health Crisis
for several years. In 1996, a man was evacuated by helicopter from
the Morning Party after slipping into a drug-induced coma.
</P>
<P>
   But the complaints seem to be taking on a heightened urgency
with the proliferation around the country of other large-scale gay
dance events, some of which funnel part of their profits to AIDS
service organizations.
</P>
<P>
   These events have come to be known as ``circuit parties''
because they are linked by similar music and because some of them
attract the same core crowd, lavishly muscled and wealthy enough to
buy plane tickets and plenty of drugs like cocaine, Ecstasy and
ketamine, or ``special K.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the chemicals taken by a few of the men who attend
circuit parties has expanded recently to include a liquid
anesthetic, gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, that has been implicated
in a string of medical emergencies at circuit parties this year.
GHB is extolled by some as an aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk County law-enforcement officials said that GHB appeared
to have caused the death of Frank Giordano, 35, at the Pines on
Fire Island around 4 a.m. on Aug. 16, seven hours before the
Morning Party officially began on a stretch of beach nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Three other men at the Pines who apparently took the same batch
of GHB were taken to hospitals on Long Island, treated and
released, law-enforcement officials said. Several people who
attended the Morning Party said that one of the three men made it
back to the Pines in time to join the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are partying harder than ever with substances that are
more volatile than ever,'' said Alan Brown, a management consultant
from New Haven, Conn., who annually attends about two dozen circuit
parties, from Montreal to Miami, and recently sat on a panel at a
gay physicians' conference in Chicago to discuss health issues
relating to the events. ``People have been leaving parties in
ambulances routinely for three years now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and other gay men familiar with circuit parties emphasized
that many men who attend the events use illegal drugs infrequently,
if ever, and that the vast majority of gay men have never been to
any of the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Gay Men's Health Crisis, which stages (and profits
from) the Morning Party, said that educating the minority of gay
men involved in the party circuit about the perils of drugs is a
principal reason the organization remains committed to the event,
which they said would occur with or without the group's
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Soref, who was president of the board when the organization
began to assume full responsibility for coordinating the event in
the early 1990s, said, ``GMHC does need to be involved in harm
reduction, and it does need to be where the community is.''
</P>
<P>
   Others stressed that during recent years the organization had
intensified its efforts to rid the Morning Party of illegal drugs,
distributing written warnings. Many people who attended the Morning
Party this year said that drug use was noticeably less prevalent
and conspicuous than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Johnson, the organization's managing director for public
policy, said that linking the GHB overdoses that occurred more than
eight hours earlier to the event was gratuitous.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said that the Morning Party, like other circuit
events, has spawned several days of revelry around it, and cannot
divorce itself from those often reckless festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If GMHC officials don't think they have some responsibility
for the overdoses, they're kidding themselves,'' said Michael
Trovato, 41, who spends summer weekends on Fire Island.
</P>
<P>
   Many gay men said the organization could do prevention work at
the party without sponsoring it. Several said they had stopped
donating money to the organization because of its affiliation with
the gathering. Johnson said he had seen no evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   The circuit embraces New York; New Orleans; Palm Springs,
Calif.; and Pensacola, Fla., though many events have no connection
to AIDS organizations. It usually features shirtless men dancing
all through the night, their energy and euphoria often enhanced by
powders or pills.
</P>
<P>
   But what most alarms many gay men and public-health experts is
not the drug use itself but the implications for responsible
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extent to which gay men use drugs is a strong, significant
predictor of becoming HIV-positive,'' said Ron Stall, a professor
of epidemiology at the University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Others said that some circuit parties even feature darkened back
rooms, and that a few men who flock to circuit extravaganzas also
attend sex parties before or after the main event and may not
adhere to precautions against HIV transmission.
</P>
<P>
   That has provoked critics into greater anger at AIDS service
organizations around the country for staging circuit parties or
signing on as beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Circuit parties got the imprimatur of their local AIDS
organizations and, bingo, instant, total respectability,'' said
Gabriel Rotello, author of ``Sexual Ecology: AIDS and the Destiny
of Gay Men'' (Dutton, 1997). ``And the irony of that is just so
awesome.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To varying degrees, officials with AIDS service organizations
that are involved in circuit parties are wrestling with that
accusation, a process complicated by their difficulty raising money
in other ways. They said that sunny news reports about better
treatments for AIDS have left many individual donors with the
mistaken impression that the epidemic is waning and have
discouraged them from giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more dependent than ever on special-events fund
raising,'' said Bryan Delowery, the events coordinator for the AIDS
Information Network in Philadelphia, which stages a circuit party
every January. The event, called the Blue Ball, raises $125,000,
more than 10 percent of the group's annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   Profits from the Morning Party, for which tickets cost $100
apiece, account for a much smaller percentage of GMHC's annual
budget of $25 million. But proponents of circuit parties said the
case for them transcends the economic vitality of AIDS service
organizations that do crucial work.
</P>
<P>
   They said that many gay men attend the events not to indulge
chemical or sexual appetites but simply to bask in an environment
free of the bigotry they face elsewhere in society.
</P>
<P>
   Critics counter that circuit parties have an impact beyond their
perimeters, idealizing dangerous habits in a manner that has
particular influence over young gay men.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Jeffrey W. supports that viewpoint. He said
that when he moved to Manhattan after graduating from college a few
years ago, he ``had no desire to be part of a drug and intense sex
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said conversations with other gay men and glossy ads in
some periodicals piqued his curiosity, and even left him with the
impression that the circuit scene was the very definition of gay
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if there were 5,000 other men who are considered the
upper crust in the gay world doing this, it must be all right and
it must be the norm,'' said Jeffrey, who spoke on the condition
that his last name not be used. ``I experimented quite heavily with
drugs, and I began to be unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   One such moment occurred in December. Several months later,
Jeffrey said, he tested positive for HIV.

PORTENGA WINS STREET RACE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Steve Portenga proved he is ready to make the jump
from the rookie-level NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series to the
prestigious Winston Cup Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks, Nevada resident took the checkered flag in the
Kragen Z-One 200, defeating a field loaded with Winston cup stars
brought in for promotional appearances for the featured event of
the Ford Los Angeles Street Race Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Organizer Bill Burke, though, who has put on the L.A. Marathon
for the last 14 years, has no intentions of turning his two-year
old project into a Winston Cup event in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have discussed the possibility of moving up the food chain
but my attitude is I way to stay where I am because I am,'' Burke
said. ``In the marathon, I always look for the young guys who are
just on the edge of making the big time. I think this tour has the
future stars of the Winston Cup. I am proud to be a part of being
of being a part of where they are going to be someday. I want the
hallmark to be big crowds and star building.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no official attendance figures but an estimated
105,000 were on hand at Exposition Park according to Burke, about
three times larger than on Saturday and Sunday. The big draw for
Monday was a chance to catch a glimpse of the trio of Winston Cup
drivers along the 1.4-mile course which snaked past the Coliseum,
USC and the L.A. County Natural Museum of History.
</P>
<P>
   The event was the first street race in Los Angeles in NASCAR's
50-year history and the first time Exposition Park had been closed
for an event since the 1984 Olympics opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The course, which forced closure of surface streets through the
Labor Day weekend, was built over the last month with 10 million
pounds of concrete embankments and 9 miles of fencing, and caused
havoc with neighboring business. Other than bumpy conditions, there
were few complaints from drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a lot of difference than a road course other than
I could look up and see traffic signals and stop signs,'' Portenga
said. ``When I saw all those yellow lines, there were times when I
thought I should have put my turn signal on''
</P>
<P>
   Portenga might have made the most surprising move in the 89-lap,
124.6 mile race after he overtook Mark Martin, the runner-up on the
Winston Cup Tour to Jeff Gordon on the 65th lap.
</P>
<P>
   Portenga, the Southwest Series season points leader, had been
shadowing the Winston Cup star when Martin crashed into a wall on a
turn near the Coliseum and was forced to drop out because of
suspension problems. Fellow Winston Cup competitors Chad Little and
Kenny Schraeder also failed to finish because of engine problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The street course was a little bit of a challenge for me,''
Martin said. ``I'm not to use having the walls. I am used to being
able to get right on the edge of the track. We tried everything we
could do to win this thing. I wound up being the one making the
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Portenga first-place prize of $17,225 was a small change
compared compared to Martin's multi-million winnings but part of a
$153,300 purse, the largest in Southwest Series history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was sitting behind Mark Martin in the drivers' meeting,
I stared at his head,'' Portenga said. ``I said I could be a
Winston Cup driver too. They look just like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up Boris Said of Carlsbad echoed Portenga's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me racing is racing, no matter what I am racing,'' Said
said.

TEXAS TRASH TALK REACHES BRUINS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When UCLA's offensive linemen arrived for practice
Monday afternoon, they found the following comment from Texas
defensive end Aaron Humphrey tacked to their lockers:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cade is a dead man.''
</P>
<P>
   It's believed to be the first piece of trash talk in NCAA
history from a team that lost by 63 points the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we, in high school?'' answered Bruins quarterback
Cade McNown, who passed for five touchdowns against the Longhorns
in UCLA's 66-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey plays left end, meaning he'll face UCLA right tackle
Brian Polak and reserve James Ghezzi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous,'' Polak said. ``But that's the way he feels,
and it's only more incentive for me. To a point, I take it
personally. All the linemen do, because it's our job to protect
Cade. But they're upset about last year, and they're going to use
the revenge factor to motivate themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment appeared in story called ``California Dreamin','' in
an unknown Texas publication. Calls to the author were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Tussle in Tempe: Bruins coach Bob Toledo cancelled Saturday's
scrimmage and gave everyone the day off.
</P>
<P>
   How did he spend it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I tailgated on my couch for 13 hours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many players and coaches watched Washington's dramatic victory
at Arizona State. The outcome catapulted Washington and Oregon into
the thick of the Rose Bowl race _ the Ducks play Washington, ASU
and USC in Eugene _ while forcing Arizona State to play from
behind.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone spent the day on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, you can't watch games as a fan. You watch them as
a competitor and think, `What would we be doing?''' McNown said.
</P>
<P>
   How did he spend the day?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going stir-crazy,'' he said. ``I tried to relax but I
couldn't. I just bashed my head into the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving up: Michigan's loss to Notre Dame elevated the Bruins to
sixth in the latest polls _ their highest regular-season ranking
since they opened the 1989 season sixth. Those Bruins lost the
opener to unranked Tennessee, 24-6, and finished 3-7-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to work your way up if you're No. 6 rather than
No. 56,'' McNown said. ``Now we have to show we're worthy of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: McNown and safety Larry Atkins were named
captains for the season. Kicker Chris Sailer and center Shawn
Stuart are captains for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Craig Walendy (allergic reaction to bug bites) won't
play against Texas, making Durell Price a starter for the first
time in his career. Nose guard Ken Kocher is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find out in the next couple days how ready he is,''
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Arrive early: A crowd of at least 75,000 is expected for the
12:30 p.m. kickoff. The first 10,000 fans entering through tunnels
on the east (sun) side will receive a visor and bottle of water.
</P>
<P>
   Parking is available outside the Arroyo at the Parsons
Engineering Building in Pasadena (shuttle service to the stadium)
and inside the Arroyo at the Brookside Golf Course.

   SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic _ Sammy Sosa was a hero
here in his baseball-crazed homeland long before he and Mark
McGwire began their pursuit of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris. So when
the Cubs and the Cardinals squared off Sunday afternoon in St.
Louis with Maris' major league home run record up for grabs, it was
as if 8 million people had dropped whatever they were doing to root
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streets are almost as empty as when the government decrees
a curfew,'' said Gerardo Mota, a hotel maintenance worker here who
had shuffled his work schedule to watch the game at a bar and
betting parlor in the same neighborhood where Sosa grew up.
``Everybody is watching, either in their homes or in places like
this, because we all want Sammy to break that record.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter that by the end of the day, Sosa's chances of getting
there ahead of McGwire had nearly disappeared; McGwire hit his 61st
home run, tying Maris' record, while Sosa remained stuck on 58.
Their faith unshaken, Sosa's friends and neighbors began looking
for new ways to frame the remarkable achievements of their idol,
who grew up poor but talented in a town that boasts that it has
produced more major league players per capita than any place in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if McGwire gets 62 first, Sammy is going to be the first
dark-skinned player to hit 60 home runs in a season, and that's a
real distinction,'' said Kelvin Garcia, a 16-year-old shortstop who
had attended an Atlanta Braves tryout earlier in the day. ``Hank
Aaron never homered 60 times in a season, and neither did Orlando
Cepeda, Tony Perez, Roberto Clemente, Tony Armas or anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's countrymen have followed his exploits intently ever since
he signed his first contract as a 16-year-old with the Texas
Rangers, and they were thrilled when he agreed to a $42.5 million
deal with the Cubs two years ago. But it was only after he hit his
48th homer on Aug. 19 off Kent Bottenfield of the Cardinals,
breaking the single-season record for most home runs by a Latin
American player, that the whole country dared to dream that Maris
might be next.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the Latin American record fell, Dominican
newspapers put Sosa's feat on their front pages, where it competed
with Fidel Castro's impending arrival for a Caribbean summit, the
Cuban leader's first visit here in four years. The record Sosa
broke had been held by another native of San Pedro de Macoris,
George Bell of the Toronto Blue Jays, but that did not seem to
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing to me just how happy and enthusiastic people
have been over the last month,'' Sonia Sosa, the slugger's older
sister, said during an interview this morning at the boutique she
runs at the 30-30 Plaza, a shopping mall the slugger built after
hitting 33 homers and stealing 36 bases in 1993. ``I walk down the
street, and people run out of their houses or drive by on their
motorbikes and yell, `He's got 57, and we're all pulling for
him!'''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Caribbean, the attitude has been much the same.
For a month now, newspapers in Panama, Venezuela, Puerto Rico,
Nicaragua and Mexico have been publishing boxes with Sosa's and
McGwire's daily home run tally, while radio stations have been
breaking in on their regular programs every time Sosa hits a home
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sosa is carrying the flag for all of us in Latin America,''
Luis Pimentel Escobar, a parking attendant in Panama, said last
week. ``Every time he hits a four-bagger, he is reminding everybody
that baseball is our game too.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dominicans are even more sensitive than other people in Latin
America about the way they are portrayed in the United States, and
they flinch every time this country is linked to drug trafficking
or illegal immigration. So the burst of publicity that has come
with Sosa's ascent has been welcomed by all classes and political
tendencies as a chance to change the country's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy is a wonderful kid, and what he has done is great for
baseball, great for the Dominican Republic and great for San Pedro
de Macoris,'' said Manuel Rodriguez Robles, a former mayor here.
``He has projected this country and this town onto the world stage
in a way that no Dominican has ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's rise from rags to riches is the source of much of the
popular adulation he enjoys here. One of six children of a widow
who cooked meals for factory workers to eke out a living, Sosa as a
child ``shined shoes, sold oranges, washed cars, did any kind of
work that was honest,'' as he put it in an interview last year, to
help his mother make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sosa had to overcome all kinds of adversity, economic and
social, that McGwire never had to face when he was growing up,''
said Luis de la Cruz, one of the fans watching Sunday's game at
Josecito's Betting Parlor. ``That makes what Sammy has done all the
more admirable and extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Sosa's initiatives here is a baseball school, which
opened late last year. Talented teen-age players from families of
``limited means'' are recruited from around the country, given
scholarships, housing, food and training that includes clinics
personally taught by Sosa. Already, five graduates have been signed
by four different major league teams.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, all 16 of the players enrolled in the academy Sunday
proclaimed themselves Sosa supporters. But the most passionate of
them was probably Simon Soriano, a 16-year-old who plays right
field, Sosa's position, wears Sosa's number, 21, and even mimics
his idol's batting stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a photocopy of Sammy Sosa,'' he said proudly. ``Sammy has
already broken the Latin American record, the Cubs' team record and
the record for the most homers in one month. He deserves to break
this one too, and I know he will.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The storm came. The storm passed, much like the
unfocused lightning in Marat Safin's racket. Pete Sampras weathered
the wave of humidity, and a touch of tension, posed by an
18-year-old with a future which, for the sake of men's tennis,
can't come soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, though, it was business as usual at the U.S.
Open on Monday. Sampras took care of the rookie Safin in the Round
of 16, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2, and then went home to wait for Andre Agassi,
which he has been doing for most of his professional tennis life.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long, unfruitful wait. On the brink of elimination
Monday night, trailing by two sets and by 2-4 in the third to Karol
Kucera of Slovakia, Agassi resorted to boorish, Connors-like
tactics. His mimicking of Kucera's aborted service tosses and his
moon-balling tactics won him the third set. When more rain came,
Agassi led an obviously distracted Kucera, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Agassi-Sampras quarterfinal that the Open has been counting
on for a surge of electricity was still alive, though that in
itself would not make this tournament _ any more than it has saved
this decade _ from being pretty much a one-man show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen with one match,'' said Sampras, never
happy when people fail to appreciate the effort it takes to carry
his sport, year after year.
</P>
<P>
   It was unfair to expect heavy lifting from Safin, the latest
tennis teen-age titan, as even he had predicted the other day that
he had ``no chance'' against the world's No. 1. Sampras again
demonstrated that he is unimpressed by raw power. If you want to
push him on the hardcourts of the Open, you'd better be able to
keep the ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   Safin had a few moments, in the form of two early service games,
when he forcefully announced himself from Russia, at love. Then, as
the sky darkened in biblical proportions over Arthur Ashe Stadium,
Sampras broke Safin at 15 in the 10th game with a reflex volley
forehand to win the first set. By the time they returned, two hours
later, Safin might as well have been back in Moscow, 12 years old
and unable to beat Anna Kournikova, the reigning kid queen of his
club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first set, I couldn't believe the pace of his serve,''
Sampras said, referring to the 130 mph blurs. ``I heard from other
players he had a big game. But you need to find that medium game.
If I were coaching him, he doesn't have to hit the ball so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   While Safin and a few others learn the difference between touch
and go, the men's game will continue in its holding pattern,
waiting for someone with Sampras-like talent to show up and stick
around at the top. That's where Agassi was supposed to be,
challenging Sampras' serve-and-volley precision with his baseline
power. Beyond one glorious year, when he was No. 1, Agassi has
proved most adept at making the art of reinvention routine.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi has taken too much grief for this, for not having
Sampras' resolve. The truth is that Agassi has been more the rule
than the exception, since the big money came into tennis and
allowed the best players a lifestyle cushion when they began to
mentally flab out in their tennis middle age.
</P>
<P>
   The Bjorn Borg-John McEnroe rivalry lasted only until Borg
realized right here at the Open that he couldn't beat McEnroe, and
then he slipped into a limousine and into retirement. When McEnroe,
in turn, surrendered the hill to Ivan Lendl a few years later, his
passions soon turned to music and art. Boris Becker said goodbye
last year at Wimbledon, the lawn he loved most, by shaking the hand
of the new champ, Sampras, and wishing him well.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras doesn't win every Grand Slam, and he could very well
lose on Wednesday if he has to face Kucera, who hammered him in
January at the Australian Open. He actually twice fell to No. 2, on
computer points, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But this is how serious the sport is about Marcelo Rios, who
briefly displaced Sampras in the ranking and was seeded second
here: While Rios was facing elimination in the fifth set against
Magnus Larsson on Sunday night, the USA Network broadcasting team,
starring Mad Dog McEnroe, was fielding phone calls from fans.
</P>
<P>
   With Safin a memory, with Agassi possibly in over his
hair-starved head against Kucera, someone wanted to know if Sampras
thought the defending champion, Patrick Rafter, had achieved
superstar status. Sampras' smile almost turned to laughter. ``To do
it for many, many years is a true sign,'' he said, diplomatically.
``That's the way I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has always saved most of his compliments for Agassi, his Nike
compatriot, who proved in 1995 that he had the style and talent to
be No. 1 and proved again Monday night that he can stir emotions
and make the match. Agassi just never had what it took to stay in
focus, in position. No one but Sampras has, and it remains to be
seen if anyone else soon will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, very tough, I think I can't play this game,'' Safin said,
when asked if he had his sights set on Sampras. ``To be half of
Pete Sampras is enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Men's tennis, unfortunately, needs more than that.

Despite the presence of oil tankers and garbage barges, New York
Harbor's gulls are being joined by cormorants, snowy egrets and
other birds. Several of the species now thriving on the harbor
islands had once been threatened with extinction; others had never
been known to nest anywhere near New York City. Their expanding
presence -- with federal protection -- in the harbor is testament
to the incredible resilience of nature, once it is given half a

Undeterred by PCBs, noise, odors and other types of pollutants,
populations of double-crested cormorants (pictured), herons and
egrets have flourished in New York Harbor. Although, to humans,
several of the harbor islands and their environs may look like

37-year-old record. The cheering crowd stood in unison while the
St. Louis Cardinals first baseman held both arms wide and high as
he approached first base. Only three players have hit 60 or more

   ISRAEL-BIRD-MENACE (Kfar Ruppin, Israel) _ As they do every year
in the spring and fall, as many as 500 million birds are expected
to pass over Israel this season, converging along its narrow spine
on the way toward warmer winter climes. It is a stunning natural
spectacle, but it strikes less awe than fear in Israeli pilots and
their commanders. They are better equipped for evading missiles
than birds, who have become a far more frequent peril in recent
years. By Douglas Jehl.

   NM-SANDIA-INDIANS (Sandia, N.M.) _ Rising 10,378 feet into the
desert air, Sandia Mountain is more than a picturesque backdrop to
Albuquerque, a city of more than 400,000 people. It is an escape
valve for a booming Sunbelt city. According to the U.S. Forest
Service, the mountain, 15 minutes from downtown Albuquerque, plays
host annually to 1 million hikers and picnickers, 275,000 cable-car
riders, 50,000 bird watchers, 10,000 rock climbers and 10,000 hang
gliders. So it was with shock that Albuquerque residents learned in
August that a federal judge in Washington had ordered the federal
government to transfer ownership of the mountain's western face,
9,400 acres of wilderness in the Cibola National Forest, to Sandia
Pueblo, an American Indian tribe with 481 enrolled members. The
judge based his decision on 18th-century land grant documents. By
James Brooke.

<P>
   SHAREHOLDER-WORKERS (Menlo Park, Calif.) _ More than in almost
any other industry, stock options have fueled the boom in Silicon
Valley and in other regions of the country where high-tech and
Internet companies are congregated, allowing start-up companies to
pay smart, ambitious workers a relatively low base salary _ along
with the promise of great riches if their sweat and creativity help
the ventures to take off. Along the way, that phenomenon seems to
have sparked a unique brand of investment psychology that can be
gleaned from talks with employees like those at Onsale, each of
whom describes his or her own method of coping with the kind of
volatility that might be unimaginable to a more traditional
mutual-fund investor. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

smaller companies go out of business, up from 50 a day in the year
preceding the I.M.F. bailout. While the lumbering conglomerates
that dominate the South Korean economy manage to avoid
restructuring, utilizing deep pockets, foot-dragging and financial
machinations, the small companies that are the backbone of any
sound economy are dying and taking with them the livelihoods of
hundreds of thousands of people. By Stephanie Strom.

   BERKSHIRE-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ It is well known that Warren
Buffett is one of the world's smartest investors and one of the

Force flights. At the intersection of three continents, Israel
forms a land bridge whose thermal air currents lure not only vast
clouds of songbirds, but also hawks, eagles, pelicans and storks
making their way toward warmer climes. Since Israel began keeping
records in 1974, its military aircraft have slammed into birds at
least 3,000 times, sometimes with catastrophic consequences. (Rina

criticized the president about the Monica Lewinsky matter. Thus
far, there are few overt signs that the Lewinsky matter will

other Democrats are willing to openly scold a president of their

Monday. The event which was supported by civil rights groups and
prominent black leaders was even more sparsely attended than a
rally in Harlem on Saturday. In the days leading up to the Atlanta

the so-called Million Youth March in New York City, led by Khallid

the area open, despite the transfer ownership of the mountain's

ASIAN MARKETS SURGE IN POWERFUL RALLY

 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Stock markets surged from Singapore to Seoul Monday
in a powerful rally, fueled by a stronger Japanese yen and
interventionist government policies in Hong Kong and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest increases were in Malaysia and Hong Kong, a pattern
that dismayed some free-market advocates, since both recently
intervened in their markets. In Malaysia, the government imposed
sweeping capital controls.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than flee, investors bought heavily. Kuala Lumpur's stock
exchange rose a record 23 percent, to 443.59 points. By shielding
itself from the global market, Malaysia has been able to lower
interest rates, attracting local investors, particularly big
pension funds with ties to the government.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index soared 7.9 percent, to 8,076
points, as investors reacted enthusiastically to lower interest
rates and new government measures to police the market more
strictly. Those measures came in the aftermath of a $15 billion
government buying spree to prop up shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a technical rebound in these markets,'' said Miron
Mushkat, the director of strategy at Indocam Asia Asset Management.
``With the government policies, there is a greater desire to inject
liquidity into the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Mushkat drew a distinction between Malaysia, which has erected a
wall around its economy, and Hong Kong, which is trying to take the
sting out of its participation in the global economy by supporting
its stock market and devising new rules to ward off foreign
speculators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malaysia has closed the door; Hong Kong is repainting it,'' he
said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In early trading Tuesday, the Hang Seng was up 2.1 percent.
Stocks in Malaysia were down 3.8 percent.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In both markets, it is government policy _ rather than
underlying optimism about the local or global economy _ that is
spurring investors to buy shares. If the Hong Kong and Malaysian
markets were functioning freely, interest rates would probably be
higher and shares would probably trade low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance of the markets doesn't alter our
uncertainty,'' said Jan Lee, chief economist of Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corp., which has been one of the main targets of
Hong Kong's buying spree.
</P>
<P>
   In other Asian markets, the reason for Monday's increase was
external _ the strengthening of the Japanese yen relative to the
U.S. dollar. Analysts attributed the strengthening of the yen to
speculation that the Federal Reserve Board may cut interest rates
in the United States to reduce the risk of a recession.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stocks also rose in other markets. In London, the FTSE 100 index
closed 3.5 percent higher, a 180-point advance, its second-largest
point gain ever. German shares closed about 2 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   But in Russia, political and financial chaos continued. The
parliament refused to confirm acting premier Viktor Chernomyrdin,
the Central Bank president offered to resign and the ruble fell
further.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Hong Kong said Monday that their three-week-long
intervention had succeeded in driving foreign speculators out of
their market. The government had accused such speculators of
improperly manipulating Hong Kong's market in an effort to drive
down shares and futures contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made an incursion, and we want to leave as quickly as
possible,'' said Donald Tsang, financial secretary of Hong Kong.
``We are not in the business of making long-term investments in
commercial companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hong Kong is no longer buying shares, it has opened a
new front in its campaign against the speculators. On Monday, the
government announced a 30-point plan to tighten the securities and
futures markets. The new rules would stiffen penalties for
violations of securities laws, increase monitoring of short selling
and restrict the lending of shares for the purpose of short
selling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced a
package of seven measures designed to strengthen the link between
the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. The highly technical
regulations guarantee, among other things, that licensed Hong Kong
banks can convert Hong Kong dollars into U.S. dollars at a fixed
exchange rate of $7.75 to $1.
</P>
<P>
   Tsang reiterated the government's pledge to maintain the fixed
exchange rate. And he said Hong Kong had no plans to follow
Malaysia down the path of capital controls. ``We hate to be in the
market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Hong Kong is still espousing a free-market credo, Malaysia
has swung clearly to a government-dictated approach. Analysts said
Monday's increase on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange was driven by
institutional investors with ties to the government. Foreign
investors have effectively been frozen out of the market, since
Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, no longer trades outside the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analysts said another reason for the sharp rise in
Malaysia's market was that foreign investors are finding it hard to
sell their shares because they can no longer transfer their ringgit
holdings out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of Malaysia's new policy, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, named himself finance minister Monday, less than a week
after he dismissed Anwar Ibrahim, his reform-minded protege, who
had been both finance minister and deputy prime minister. Anwar's
opposition to closing off Malaysia's market had caused a bitter
rift between him and Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   As Mahathir tightens his grip on Malaysia's economy, Anwar is
battling charges of sexual misconduct and treason.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that shielding Malaysia from the ravages of the
global market could pay short-term dividends. The lower interest
rates, in addition to lifting shares, could jump-start Malaysia's
stalled economy. And the capital controls will insure that Malaysia
does not suffer any more painful devaluations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Malaysian experiment is successful, and other Asian
countries are still struggling a year from now, it could lead to
some disillusionment with naked capitalism and Anglo Saxon-style
markets,'' Mushkat said.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts warned that economic isolationism may give
Malaysia the excuse to put off necessary economic restructuring.
That is the same argument critics have used to fault Hong Kong's
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mobius, president of the Templeton Emerging Markets Fund,
said the fund would no longer invest in either Hong Kong or
Malaysia. Mobius said he was worried that Hong Kong's recent
actions raised questions about its commitment to the link between
its currency and the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   As for Malaysia, Mobius said the government's restrictions on
taking capital out of the country amounted to a ``theft of
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we allow this kind of thing to spread globally,'' Mobius
said, ``the whole financial system will freeze up.''

FIRST TV ADS ARE SET TO RUN IN CONNECTICUT'S SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERBURY, Conn. _ Connecticut's largely invisible U.S. Senate
campaign will burst onto the state's airwaves on Tuesday, when
television advertisements will begin pitting the incumbent's
formidable political record against his challenger's compelling
personal story.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent, Sen. Christopher Dodd, has dwarfed his Republican
challenger, Gary Franks, in fund-raising and poll ratings, so the
campaign has received much less attention than the state's lively
gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials, which are the first paid advertising by either
campaign, have different missions, according to aides to the
candidates. Dodd, a Democrat with ties to President Clinton, hopes
to overcome voters' frustrations with politics by showing that
positive things can be accomplished in Washington. Democratic
leaders across the country fear that their voters, dismayed by
Washington scandals, will stay home in November.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, on the other hand, just needs people to notice him.
Though he served in Congress from 1991 until he was defeated in
1996, he is less well known than the senator. He said that by
starting his commercials the day after Labor Day, he hoped to
capitalize on the traditional increase in attention to politics
that occurs then, as voters stop thinking about vacations and
return to work and school. Franks, a Republican, said he was eager
to reach Democratic and independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   In what is likely a preview of coming attractions, Franks'
campaign is to begin broadcasting a radio advertisement on
Wednesday that refers to the president's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we look around and find our faith and confidence in public
officials shaken, we need leaders who can be a strong role model
for our children,'' the announcer says.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, who is seeking a fourth term, emphasizes his legislative
achievements and the businesses and services he has helped bring to
the state, and his pictures show him shaking hands next to a
submarine, reading a book to children and touring a factory floor.
The advertisements show him toiling, pen in hand, on a sheaf of
papers in his darkened home study.
</P>
<P>
   A 60-second advertisement makes much of Dodd's authorship of the
Family and Medical Leave Act and his support for a higher minimum
wage, for ``dependable health care and for safe child care.'' The
advertisement calls him ``the Senate's most respected advocate for
children'' and says he has ``been at the center of the battle to
produce the nation's first balanced budget in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   A 30-second advertisement focuses on the senator's support for
tighter regulation of health insurers. Both spots finish with the
tag line, ``Experience that works. Chris Dodd in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The television advertisement for Franks begins by showing him as
a youngster wearing a big carnation on his eighth-grade graduation
suit, cuts to slaves working in a field, then later shows him
shaking hands with President George Bush. ``His life story is an
inspiration,'' the narrator says. ``The great-grandson of a slave,
the son of a mill worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Franks appears on camera to say, ``I'm a conservative.
I've never voted for a tax increase. I believe in a smaller
government, lower taxes, a strong national defense, the death
penalty, school choice, and empowering the people.'' The tag line
is, ``Gary Franks _ U.S. Senate. Standing up for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks is married and has three children, ages 4 to 14. The
senator is divorced and has no children.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodd campaign said it would spend $167,000 on the
advertisements over the next week. Franks would not reveal the cost
of his advertising campaign.  &QL;

 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vice President Al Gore cut loose with a fiery,
arm-waving Labor Day speech here Monday, hailing President
Clinton's economic achievements, and trying to turn the spotlight
back to Democrats' issues from Clinton's personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   The formally clad, technology-oriented ``New Democrat'' seen on
past Seattle visits was supplanted by a Gore in shirtsleeves
appealing passionately to his party's base.
</P>
<P>
   He called for more spending on child care and a patients' bill
of rights ``in which medical decisions will be made by
professionals and not by budget accountants and bean counters.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore depicted the Republican-controlled Congress as attempting
to slice into workers' rights and federal laws on workplace safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``This president has vetoed every piece of anti-labor
legislation that has ever appeared on his desk,'' Gore cried. ``If
they try it again, we'd do it again! And again! And again!
</P>
<P>
   ``He sounded like an old Democrat to me,'' Rep. Jim McDermott,
D-Wash., chuckled afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is making two visits in six days to Washington. He will be
back Sunday, for a hike on Mount Rainier, a meeting on local
initiatives to save salmon and a trio of fundraisers.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's trips are an indication of Washington's
fairly central role in the country's political struggles. Bidding
to retake the House, Democrats are counting on capturing at least
two of the state's six GOP-held House seats in the 1998 mid-term
election _ the seat of GOP Rick White and the positions being
vacated by Rep. Linda Smith, who is running for the Senate.
Republicans are hoping to upset Democratic Sen. Patty Murray in
their pursuit of a filibuster-proof 60-seat Senate majority.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor has targeted the state, putting onto the ballot
an initiative to raise the state minimum wage. It has made
Washington a focus for organizing efforts in fields not
traditionally associated with unions _ workers in apple processing
plants, child care, and physicians employed by health care plans.
</P>
<P>
   But the achievements and problems of Bill Clinton hung like a
large cloud above a sunny Woodland Park yesterday as Gore and
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney rallied the troops at the King
County Labor Council's annual picnic. About 3,000 people were on
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policies and leadership of President Bill Clinton are
making an enormous, positive difference for the working families of
the United States of America,'' Gore, a loyal No. 2 man, said of
Clinton. He recited the litany of 16.7 million new jobs created,
the lowest unemployment in 28 years, and inflation running at its
lowest rate since Lyndon Johnson was in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Murray argued that in this Washington she hears people
talking about health care, education and the environment, not the
scandal that has preoccupied the Washington, D.C., press corps and
produced stormy debates in the Democrats' Senate caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't focused on that, they are focused on what is
real to them,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray again said she is ``upset and angry'' at what Clinton
has done in his personal life. Asked if she would welcome another
campaign visit by the president, the senator replied: ``It is not
in our plan right now at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has visited Washington frequently during the last three
years as he has revived a once-moribund AFL-CIO. In accents of his
native New York, he regaled the crowd yesterday with labor's
accomplishments in the 20th Century, from outlawing child labor to
cleaning up slaughterhouses to guaranteeing every American a
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after his speech, however, Sweeney voiced
frustration that such goals as a patients' bill of rights are being
starved for attention by the Washington, D.C., media clamor over
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do?'' asked Sweeney. ``The media is running an
onslaught. It is so hard to get attention for issues that matter to
ordinary people. It is so hard to get Congress to do anything. On
the talk shows, it's Monica, Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, at least, the political strategy seems to be
sending Gore into the breach.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president will travel to Connecticut Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He will be back in Washington and Oregon this weekend.
Additional trips are planned this month to such states as New York,
Wisconsin and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The effort cannot hurt Gore's ambitions to claim the presidency
in two years. He was referred to in a slipup as ``President Gore''
by the master of ceremonies at yesterday's picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won over yesterday's labor-dominated crowd. He denounced
Initiative 200 as ``certainly not the kind of vision we need for
our future.'' The measure, on Washington's November ballot, would
roll back state affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   He decried as ``paycheck deception'' the recent so-called
paycheck protection measure on California's ballot, which would
have required unions to seek approval from individual members
before spending dues on political causes. It lost at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in good shape with us,'' said Al Link, secretary
treasurer of the Washington State Labor Council.
</P>
<P>
   In a curious way, Gore's visit yesterday showed just how much he
has picked up politically from Clinton over the last six years. The
visit began _ as have many Clinton stopovers _ with the vice
president holding a private meeting with a group of union workers
and a pair of labor-friendly local employers.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers platform was occupied not by politicians, but by
those with whom Gore had met. A single mother and worker trainee at
the Port of Seattle, Kelly Palmer, introduced the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said afterward that she was impressed with the Gore she
met behind the scenes. ``He seemed to listen, to care about our
issues,'' she added. ``He was very direct. He listened and asked us
questions. I liked him.''

 &HT;    McGwire's tribute to father, son
 &HT;    By Cheryl Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The moment was the perfect tribute of a father to a
son, of a son to a father.
</P>
<P>
   Of a son to another's father.
</P>
<P>
   When Mark McGwire hit his 61st home run Monday, it wasn't just
for him or his teammates or the 50,530 fans at Busch Stadium or
even for history.
</P>
<P>
   It was for his dad, John, who was celebrating his 61st birthday.
It was for his 10-year-old son, Matt, who arrived at the stadium
just in time to see his father's immortal swing.
</P>
<P>
   It was for Roger Maris, who is the only other man ever to hit 61
home runs, and for his four sons, who watched from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   It also was for Mike Davidson, the 28-year-old catering manager
from St. Louis who caught the ball and can't wait till the moment
his unborn child is old enough to understand what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked over to the left and there was my son,'' said McGwire
of the moment he started toward home. ``I didn't see him today
until I went to get my bat after the top of the first. I told him I
loved him and gave him a kiss. The next thing I know, I see him at
home plate. What a wonderful thing for a father.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hugged his son and lifted him over his face. Words
weren't necessary. Matt laughed. McGwire grinned.
</P>
<P>
   Pure joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think was how awesome it would be to share a
moment like that with my only child,'' teammate Tom Lampkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute continued. McGwire pointed at his father. Then he
pointed at his heart, the sky and then the Maris brothers, so
they'd know their own father was with him. They stood and watched
the home run, applauding politely.
</P>
<P>
   It must've hurt, for a moment, to see their father's record
tied. But now he's not alone, as he must've felt when he was going
for the 34-year-old record of Babe Ruth in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The nation was not pulling for Maris, as it is for McGwire. Even
his New York Yankees teammates back then rooted for another, as
Mickey Mantle closed in on the record, too.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire met with the Maris family in front of the Cardinals'
dugout after the game. It was too public a spot to get too
emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all thanked me and gave me a hug,'' McGwire said. ``I'd
love to meet with them someday when this is all over and tell them
the feelings their father was feeling, and having them understand
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, he's in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is 34, the same age Maris was when he retired. McGwire
returned after the game to the same clubhouse in which Maris
finished his career.
</P>
<P>
   He achieved the same goal as Maris. But most of Maris' six
children were not born yet in '61. They never got a chance to
experience what Matt did, to watch their father achieve the
unachievable. That is why it was so important for McGwire to see
the look in his own son's eyes, a memory neither will forget.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire thought of his father, a retired dentist, on his way to
the ballpark. Things have gotten a bit hectic for McGwire lately
and he didn't have a chance to call him before the game.
</P>
<P>
   He figured a home run would make for the perfect gift. And he
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever let go of the moment,'' McGwire said.
``I don't know if I'll ever be here again. The whole time I
thought, `What a great birthday present for my dad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What a great present for everyone's dad. For anyone's son.

RED SOX TOP YANKEES, 4-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jeffrey Maier, the fan who reached out to drag a Yankee
home run into the stands two years ago, might have a twin who is a
Red Sox fan.
</P>
<P>
   A fan reached out from the center-field stands of Fenway Park in
the eighth inning on Monday night and pulled in a long drive by
Boston's John Valentin, and the instant the ball disappeared, the
Red Sox had the run they needed to beat the Yankees and David
Wells, 4-3. Boston ended a four-game losing streak and maintained
its five-game lead in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led by 3-0 in the bottom of the seventh inning, and
Wells was dominant. But the Red Sox scored three runs in the
seventh, tying the score.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with two outs in the eighth, Valentin smashed a high
drive; Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams turned and watched as
the fan reached from the stands to catch the ball. It appeared, on
replays, that the ball would have bounced off the top of the wall
without the help.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gordon closed out the Yankees in the top of the ninth, a
needed respite for Boston. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox led the wild-card race by nine games just six days
ago, but their advantage over Toronto was cut by four games in four
days when they lost four straight to the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Boston remains in command: Pedro Martinez, its Cy Young award
candidate, who will pitch against the Yankees' David Cone on
Tuesday, is capable of preventing any long losing streaks. They
have two front-line players in first baseman Mo Vaughn and
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. The Red Sox do not play any more games
against Toronto, which hurts the Blue Jays' chances of overtaking
them. Boston will play three poor teams in the final 12 days of the
season, the Chicago White Sox, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and the
Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the Red Sox, and the fans who worship them possess
a Calvinistic sense of predestiny, an assumption that they will
somehow find a way to lose. They had a 14-game lead over the
Yankees in 1978 and did not win the division. They came within one
strike of winning the World Series in 1986 and lost to the New York
Mets. They have not won a World Series since 1918.
</P>
<P>
   The local news media coverage of the Red Sox reflects the fans'
sense of history and doom. A story written about the Red
Sox-Yankees rivalry, on the front page of Monday's Boston Globe
sports section, mentions the former Yankee shortstop Bucky Dent _
who hit the three-run homer to beat Boston in the one-game playoff
in 1978 _ in the fourth paragraph. The Curse of the Bambino,
supposedly born of Boston's decision to sell Babe Ruth to the
Yankees, is noted in the ninth paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are in control of the wild-card race. But Boston
wondered, what if the Red Sox lose to the Yankees on Monday night?
(The subconscious thought: and they're going to lose.) What if they
lose on Tuesday, too? Jennifer Power of Boston admitted that she
almost expected them to crumble. ``Yeah, unfortunately,'' she said.
``That's what has happened in my lifetime _ and you can extend that
to my father, who is 67, and my grandfather. He was 18 when they
last won the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells pinned the Red Sox in the first inning, striking out the
side, and struck out nine batters and allowed only one hit in the
first six innings. His stuff was stunning, as it had been for the
better part of a month, and he did not reach a three-ball count
before the seventh inning. He took a 3-0 lead into the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn and Garciaparra singled with one out before Mike
Stanley waged war with Wells. Stanley stepped out and Wells stepped
off the rubber repeatedly between pitches, the tension building.
Stanley fouled off two two-strike pitches, took Ball 2, then fouled
off another two-strike pitch. On the eighth pitch of the at-bat,
Stanley smacked a double into the left-field corner, driving home
Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   A groundout scored a second run, and then Jason Varitek lined a
double off the Green Monster, tying the game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, 25, grew up in California. He did not grow up with
the ``curse'' or the specter of Dent's hitting a home run or Mookie
Wilson's ground ball going through the legs of Bill Buckner. To
him, the four losses in Toronto were not the latest Red Sox gaffe;
they were just blips in an otherwise exceptional season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could've won any of them,'' Garciaparra said before Monday
night's game. ``Toronto is definitely playing great, but it wasn't
like we just got crushed. There's still a lot left in this season,
a ways to go, but we're sitting in the position we'd like to be in.
It's a lot different than last year, when we were making plans to
go home at this point.''

ONE VICTORY, TWO MATCHES IN WILLIAMS' WIN OVER PIERCE
</HEADLINE>
   (See also TEN-US-OPEN.) 
(nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Venus Williams got credit for winning only one round
Monday at the U.S. Open, but those who managed to wait out the
weather and return to their seats at Louis Armstrong Stadium know
that Williams won two very different matches against Mary Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   The first one was played in the early afternoon and was as
dreary as the leaden sky. Williams won that encounter, 6-1, 1-0,
with surprising and stultifying ease, before a stiff wind and some
large raindrops sent the two players and about 9,000 fans scurrying
for shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The second match was played two and a half hours later and was
much better theater, in part because Pierce suddenly remembered
that her shots needed to land in the court to count, and in part
because Williams suddenly forgot how to step in and smack a service
return for a winner.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams is an 18-year-old with an uncommon knack for
staring down big expectations, and, by raising her game and volume,
she found a way to win this encounter, too. She triumphed in a
high-velocity tie breaker to close out a 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) victory and
earn a date in the quarterfinals with the French Open champion,
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the easiest thing to play error free, and sometimes
you just have to go for your shots,'' Williams said of the final
tie breaker Monday. ``You just can't let someone step up before you
do.''
</P>
<P>
   When it ended, with a Pierce backhand floating past the
baseline, Williams did some different sorts of steps: dancing to
some rhythm that only she could hear before giving Pierce's hand a
firm and delighted shake and then dancing some more after she
reached her courtside chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really shouldn't have done the dance,'' Williams said. ``I
should have waited until later. I don't know why I did it. I hadn't
planned to do the dance at all. I really had just planned to win
the second set real easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The second set might have been a struggle, but Williams, who
reached the final here last year in her inaugural Open and is
seeded fifth this time, has still dropped only 12 games in her
first four matches. She is moving well despite tendinitis in her
left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Williams played Pierce, that knee was her
undoing, as she had to default trailing by 4-0 in the third set in
the quarterfinals in San Diego. She then had to withdraw from her
next two tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible because I just couldn't give my best,''
Williams said. ``And I really never had that situation before where
I couldn't move, because movement is really an important thing in
this sport. Especially for me, because I'm a good mover, and I can
make you hit that extra shot or hit a little closer to the line,
which is tough to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, seeded 12th, had great difficulty keeping the ball
anywhere inside the lines in the opening set, in which she appeared
tight and off balance in the face of Williams' aggressive ground
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like one of those days where you're totally off,'' she
said. ``I didn't really feel my strokes. I didn't feel like I was
in the match. Every point was going by too quickly without me
really realizing what was going on. I was just, you know, grateful
for Mother Nature to let me have that break.''
</P>
<P>
   After she and Williams took turns sprinting across the concourse
in the wind and rain to the refuge of the players' lounge, Pierce
listened to music and talked with her coach. When she returned, she
flirted much more regularly with her considerable potential:
changing pace occasionally when she sensed Williams was getting too
deep in a groove from the baseline and doing her best to approach
the net.
</P>
<P>
   But more often than not, it was a case of ``can you top this?''
with two of the most powerful women in the sport each trying to
dictate play. Williams broke Pierce in the 11th game _ a game that
encompassed nine deuces _ but Pierce promptly returned the favor to
force the tie breaker. Pierce jumped out to a 4-1 lead, but
Williams roared back to win the next 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   The dancing could begin, and why not? After all, how often do
you win two singles matches in a single day at the U.S. Open?

BRONCOS OPEN DEFENSE OF TITLE BY DEFEATING PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ It was not a good sign for the Patriots when only
minutes before their game with the Broncos began, a parachutist,
aiming for a spot near midfield, went crashing into the New England
bench, knocking over buckets of water, his parachute going into the
stands. The Patriots were under attack even before the game
started.
</P>
<P>
   Then the real hits came. In the second quarter the Denver
Broncos were up by 10-0 but were playing so hard, you would think
they were losing big. At one point, quarterback John Elway dumped
off a pass to fullback Howard Griffith, and Patriots linebacker
Chris Slade closed in for the tackle. But then tight end Shannon
Sharp delivered a stunning block that will make every highlight
tape. Sharp hit Slade so hard that the tight end temporarily
knocked himself out of the game with a mild concussion, and the
245-pound Slade was bounced clean off his feet.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Super Bowl champions didn't demolish the Patriots
as they often have here at Mile High Stadium, but they put on an
impressive performance nonetheless, winning by 27-21 before 74,745.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any question that the Broncos may be complacent
after beating Green Bay in January, there shouldn't be. The Broncos
weren't flawless, but they played smart, intense football.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe, the Patriots' quarterback, was under pressure all
night and the Patriots could barely muster a running game. They
were able to cut a 17-7 halftime deficit to just 17-14 after a
24-yard Troy Brown touchdown catch. But the Broncos responded with
a field goal from 42 yards by Jason Elam to increase their lead to
20-14 at the end of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then Elway, who flirted with retirement in the off season,
worked his typical magic late in the game. Deep in New England
territory, he threaded a pass to wide receiver Ed McCaffrey between
three Patriots defenders. That put Denver at the 1-yard line. From
there running back Terrell Davis punched it in for his second
touchdown of the night. The Broncos led by 27-14.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe threw a touchdown pass with less than 2 minutes to play
to make it 27-21, but Denver held on.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fourth consecutive time that the Broncos under their
ultra-intense and talented coach, Mike Shanahan, have beaten the
Patriots, and the 11th consecutive victory by Denver over New
England here since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   That Denver outplayed New England should have come as no
surprise for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   During all of preseason, the Broncos played at a high level,
something that defending Super Bowl champions sometimes have a
difficult time doing. But the Broncos have taken every step
possible to eliminate complacency, from the fun to the not-so-fun.
This past spring, the team offered to give every player who made
each off-season workout session a black Broncos jacket valued at
hundreds of dollars. It became a point of pride for the players to
get one, and almost 40 made all the workouts.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been several things Shanahan has done to show he
will not tolerate complacency, and they are not so cute. He cut the
rookie wide receiver Curtis Alexander, a fourth-round pick, less
than a week before Denver was to play an exhibition game against
Tennessee in Nashville. Alexander played his college football at
the University of Tennessee and had invited more than 40 members of
his family to the game. No matter. Shanahan also cut the
fifth-round pick, Chris Howard, for fumbling too much.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case the team still didn't get the message, he
demoted the popular veteran safety Tyrone Braxton from starter to
second team.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan is no hypocrite, though, because he demands as much
from himself as he does from his players. In early August, more
than a month before Monday night's game, Shanahan spent hours
breaking down game films of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Some would ask why Shanhan spent so much time on a team he has
destroyed every time he has faced it. Three games, three Broncos
blowouts, outscoring the Patriots by 105 points to 24.
