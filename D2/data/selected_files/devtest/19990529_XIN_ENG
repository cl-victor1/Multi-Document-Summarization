<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Friday expressed his concern at the conflict between
India and Pakistan over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman office, Annan, who is
now on a trip to Europe and will return to New York on Saturday,
said he remained very concerned about the hostilities near the
Line of Control in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Annan was encouraged by direct contacts which had taken place
between the Prime Ministers and other officials of India and
Pakistan, and their continued willingness to pursue their dialogue
on a number of issues, including Kashmir, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N chief was in contact with both sides and was following
developments closely, the statement added.

Conflict between India and Pakistan over Kashmir has escalated
since Wednesday. India and Pakistan have gone to war over Kashmir
twice since they won independence in 1947.

In 1949, the United Nations arranged a ceasefire and set up a
truce line, leaving the northwestern third of Kashmir under

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Exhume and Examine Remains of 1974 War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign experts are arriving in
Cyprus to exhume and examine remains of the Greek-Cypriot and
Greek victims in the 1974 war to find out their identities,
Cyprus' Press and Information Office (PIO) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
PIO said in a press release that the experts are members of the
international non-governmental organization "Physicians for Human
Rights," which shared the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize with another
organization.
</P>
<P>
The team will carry out exhumations at two cemeteries, one in
Nicosia and the other, a military cemetery, located seven
kilometers south of Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The team, comprising anthropologists, archaeologists and
pathologists from various countries, will conduct scientific
examination of the remains at a scientific laboratory in Nicosia,
the PIO said.
</P>
<P>
Following the examinations, samples will be handed over to the
Nicosia-based Institute of Genetics and Neurology for analysis in
order to find out the identity of the dead.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the war victims will be notified of the results and
the remains will be handed over to them for proper burial.
</P>
<P>
The team starts work early next week, under the auspices of
Cyprus' Foreign Ministry and the Office of the Presidential
Commissioner for Humanitarian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,619 persons listed as missing since 1974 and so far
the fate of only one of them has been established as dead.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Finances Urban Development Project in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced Friday
the approval of a loan of 105 million U.S. dollars to the Indian
government to bolster urban infrastructure services in cities
throughout the state of Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
"The Second Tamil Nadu Urban Development Project will support
the state's ongoing reforms to improve urban finance and
decentralize urban planning, help raise living standards in urban
areas by financing basic urban infrastructure investments," the
bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The project expands on an ongoing Integrated Sanitation Program
in the state, which provides grants for public sanitation
facilities, garbage removal, and other sanitation services in
urban slums.
</P>
<P>
Nongovernmental organizations will help mobilize poor
communities and involve them in the preparation, design,
construction, and operation and maintenance of the new facilities,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
To help secure sustainable funding sources for urban
improvement projects, the project also provides a
80-million-dollar line of credit through the existing Tamil Nadu
Urban Development Fund, the first public-private joint financial
intermediary in India specializing in municipal financing without
the use of state government guarantees.
</P>
<P>
"The project will bring significant economic, health, and
environmental benefits to people living in Tamil Nadu's urban
areas, particularly the poor, who represent more than 25 percent
of the state's total urban population," said Hiroaki Suzuki,
principal operations officer in the World Bank's South Asia
Infrastructure Unit.
</P>
<P>
The total costs of the project are 205 million dollars, to
which urban local bodies will contribute 50 million dollars, the
Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund will provide 25 million dollars,
and financial institutions will provide 25 million dollars. The
World Bank's LIBOR-based loan has 20 years to maturity with a
five-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> China Insists on Complete Investigation of Embassy Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China again urged the United
States Friday to carry out a complete, thorough and fair
investigation into the brutal bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade in which three people were killed and 20 others injured.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people are entitled to get to know the bottom of
the serious incident," said Li Zhaoxing, Chinese Ambassador to the
United States at a press conference at the U.S. National Press
Club.
</P>
<P>
Li said this is an "atrocity rarely seen in history of world
diplomacy" and it is imperative for the U.S. side to have the
investigation as requested by the Chinese people and government.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that when the co-authors of the Cox Report are
so enjoying their investigation of the so-called China "theft",
they are conspicuously silent and quiet about any investigation of
such a tragic event.
</P>
<P>
A nine-member U.S. Congress committee recently released a
872-page investigation report alleging that China obtained nuclear
secrets from the United States through "espionage".
</P>
<P>
"The world public opinion has witnessed a very good example of
double standard," the Chinese ambassador said, referring to the
Cox report.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether any of the co-authors of the well known
report have uttered any word of sympathy or expressed anything
like sorrow or sadness," he added.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhaoxing said the bombing incident has damaged the
atmosphere for the discussion of China's accession to WTO between
China and the United States and the U.S.-led NATO should be held
responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that China's position on its entry into WTO has
been consistent and clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
"We are positive on the accession, and we believe we are
qualified for the accession," he said.
</P>
<P>
But China cannot join WTO at any price and China can only join
it on a fair basis -- to reach a balance between rights and
obligations of a developing member.
</P>
<P>
Li said China will continue to support a sound and healthy
trade relations with the United States on the basis of equality
and mutual benefit.

TEHRAN -- Italy has agreed to provide a credit line of 2
billion U.S. dollars to Iran, a source from the Central Bank of
Iran (CBI) has said.
</P>
<P>
The source, requesting anonymity, said an agreement to the
effect will be finalized within the next two months, adding the
credit will be used for small industries and production units.
</P>
<P>
He said the preliminary talks for the new credit were held
during the ground-breaking visit of Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami to Italy in March.
</P>
<P>
Italy provided 1.2 billion dollars in credits to Iran last year
and 1.1 billion dollars of the money were used for buying 20 huge
water turbines needed for dam construction.

Following a financial shortage as a result of the sharp drop in

up to 100 percent. However, tariffs on certain agricultural produce would be

private hospitals and contractors, the paper quoted Finance

issued 2.5 billion dollars in foreign-denominated bonds in order
to move the debt-ridden economy afloat.

<HEADLINE> Cameroon Called for Promotion of Trade with Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Cameroonian Minister of Public
Investments and National Development Justin Ndioro on Friday
called for efforts to promote trade with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency, Ndioro
said broad prospects for cooperation exist between Cameroon and
Egypt as the two countries have great potentials.
</P>
<P>
Ndioro, who is in Cairo to attend the annual meeting of the
African Development Bank on Tuesday and Wednesday, hailed the
relations binding Cameroon and Egypt, which he said date back to
the 1960s following the independence of Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed regret that the volume of trade and the scope
of economic cooperation between the two countries are "still under
the desired level."
</P>
<P>
The moderate level of trade and economic cooperation is
attributed to the lack of direct marine lines and air routes
between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
A joint committee will meet soon to discuss ways of solving the
problems in a bid to enhance the bilateral economic cooperation,
the Cameroonian minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ndioro expressed readiness to personally encourage Cameroonian
businessmen to visit Egypt to get the first-hand knowledge of its
progress in trade and the industrial sectors in the recent years.
</P>
<P>
Egypt kicked off economic reforms in 1991 to loosen control
over and privatize the state-run enterprises in a bid to boost the
efficiency of the industrial sector. It is also considering
liberalization of foreign trade.

ANKARA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's 57th government was formed
Friday evening by the central-left Democratic Left Party (DSP),
the right-wing Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and the
central-right Motherland Party (ANAP).
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel approved the list of the
new coalition government submitted by DSP leader and Prime
Minister-designate Bulent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet list was presented to Demirel after Ecevit, MHP
leader Devlet Bahceli and ANAP Chairman Mesut Yilmaz signed a
protocol on forming the new government at the residence of the
prime minister after three days of talks.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three political party voiced their wishes for a
long and harmonious coalition.
</P>
<P>
Bahceli told reporters that "God willing, we will form a
harmonious, continuous and stable coalition that will solve the
problems of the Turkish people."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said this coalition government must be long-lasting
because Turkey has deep-rooted problems that must be solved
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The DSP, which got 13 posts, held on to many of the key
positions, keeping Ismail Cem as foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The MHP held 12 posts, with Bahceli named as the first deputy
prime minister, his deputy Sabahattin Cakmakoglu as national
defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The ANAP gained 10 posts and the party's No.2, Saadettin
Tantan, was nominated as interior minister.

the biggest party in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The MHP stood the second by winning 17.90 percent of the votes
and the ANAP ranked the fourth with 13.22 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Controversial Law Repealed: Abubakar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The out-going Nigeria's military
ruler General Abdulsalami Abubakar Friday announced the repeal of
the controversial decree two of 1984, under which hundreds of
people had been detained without trial over the years.
</P>
<P>
The obnoxious decree criticized by pro-democracy and human
rights bodies within and outside the west African country had been
used by previous military regimes against their opponents.
</P>
<P>
In a farewell national broadcast ahead of his hand-over
Saturday, the head of state said the decree was among several ones
"whose tenor is incompatible with the provisions of the 1999
Constitution," and had therefore been repealed by the out-going
Provisional Ruling Council, the highest policy-making body in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Abubakar regime, which assumed power in June last year
after the sudden death of former military dictator General Sani
Abacha, had been widely acclaimed for freeing hundreds of
political detainees, implementing a credible transition program
and restoring Nigeria's relations with the international
community.
</P>
<P>
In his 21-page speech which reviewed his 11-month rule,
Abubakar noted that during its short tenure, his regime had made
modest contributions," but we recognize that there is still much
distance to cover."
</P>
<P>
"Out of a state of near-total isolation Nigeria is, once again,
a proud and respected member of the international community," the
general said, adding that "our best days are yet to come."
</P>
<P>
He commended the country's armed forces and police for playing
"important roles" in the life of the nation, but warned that "now
is the time for the military to return to its constitutional role
of defending the country's territorial integrity and sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old general, who is to retire to his home town
Minna in northern Nigeria Saturday after 31 years of active
military service, challenged the in-coming civilian government of
General Olusegun Obasanjo not to disappoint the country and the
international community.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Rebel Leader to Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government and the
rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) have agreed in principle to
the release of the rebel leader Foday Sankoh, according to reports
reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Togolese Foreign Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh said Thursday
in Lome that RUF and government delegates had broken into small
committees to work out a legal framework for freeing Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Koffigoh, who is mediating between the two sides at the peace
talks being held in the Togolese capital, noted "all that is left
is the modalities of this release in order that it conforms with
Sierra Leonean law."
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was sentenced to death by a Sierra Leonean court last
October over treason charges and is on prison leave to attend the
peace talks in Togo.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah has maintained that
Sankoh would be free once a peace agreement was reached, and his
freedom was a matter for the judiciary to decide at appeal.
</P>
<P>
"I will expect that his freedom might well have some
conditionalities," said one source in Lome, who added that it was
unlikely that Kabbah would play his trump card so early in the
negotiations by releasing Sankoh unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
The two sides involved in the eight-year conflict in the west
African country have yet to go into direct negotiations since the
peace talks started Tuesday.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Donors have pledged to provide
Zambia with financial support totaling 630 million U.S. dollars
this year in balance of payments support and project assistance.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement faxed here from Paris by the World
Bank office Friday, the amount consists of 390 million dollars in
project assistance and 240 million dollars in balance of payments
support.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which came at the end of a two-day talks between
the Zambian delegation and the consultative group for Zambia,
stressed that the donors' pledges were conditional on the
government's fulfilling certain obligations.
</P>
<P>
They are mainly on satisfactory economic and good governance
performance.
</P>
<P>
Depending on a number of factors, including copper price levels
and the timing of the sale of the remaining assets of Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), additional financing may need to
be secured when the program is fully funded, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The 630 million dollars pledged excludes debt relief of 219
million dollars which is already provided by the Paris Club.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Refutes Cox Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the United
States Li Zhaoxing refuted the Cox Report here Friday, saying it
is "fabrications" which will not serve the purposes of peace,
stability and friendship.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the sophisticated, awesome appearance, that 700-page,
three-volume dark red report is but fabrications out of thin air,
not worth the millions of taxpayers' dollars, not serving any
useful purposes of greater peace, stability and friendship," Li
said at a press conference at the U.S. National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
He said that "with all its pomposity and condescending
manner", that "thick tome" is no more than things "cooked up"
and "dreamed up".
</P>
<P>
A special U.S. Congress committee led by Republican
Representative Christopher Cox released a report recently,
alleging that China obtained nuclear secrets from the United
States through "espionage".
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that China is nothing like what the report
paints it to be, adding that "China is a peace-loving country with
a civilization dating back to at least five millenniums".
</P>
<P>
"China desires to live in peace, equality and friendship with
all the countries in the world, including the United States of
America," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said China cherishes the Golden Rule of Confucius that "Do
not do unto others what you don't want others to do unto yourself".
</P>
<P>
He said through self-reliance and "solely for self-defense",
China has developed its nuclear capability, but China is the
only nuclear weapon state that has renounced the first use of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said President Clinton, during his trip to
China, has reached agreement with Chinese leaders that both
countries would not target each other with their respective
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cox report, Li said that "it is plain wrong
and even vicious and irresponsible to whip up a sweeping hysteria
simply to serve some politicians' hidden ambition and their
unpopular agendas."
</P>
<P>
"The kind of hysteria has harmed the valuable and very much
cherished relationship between our two good countries, a
relationship which is mutually beneficial and which is also good
for maintaining world peace and for encouraging common
development the world over," he added.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said China and the United States "have some
imperative issues to address", but he hoped all this will be done
on the basis of the three Joint Communiques between the two
countries and also in accordance with the consensus and agreements
reached during the visits of Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Zhu Rongji to the country.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his confidence that the peoples of China and the
United States will have fair judgment on the Cox Report in spite
of the difficulties and setbacks in their bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Denies Row with Egypt over Nile Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ethiopian official on Friday
denied reports that his country and Egypt are getting involved in
a row over the use of Nile water.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Egypt's Middle East News Agency, Ethiopian Minister
of Economic Development and Cooperation Ghirma Biru termed the
reports as "sinister and wicked."
</P>
<P>
The reports said the Ethiopian-Egyptian ties have become
strained due to Addis Ababa's dissatisfaction about Egypt's
alleged overuse of Nile water in its reclamation of land from
desert in the south.
</P>
<P>
"There is enough water to meet the needs of both Ethiopia and
Egypt," said Biru, who is in Cairo to attend the annual meeting of
the African Development Bank on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He warned that some neighboring countries "are trying to drive
a wedge" between Addis Ababa and Cairo. But he did not give the
names of the countries.
</P>
<P>
He described a recent meeting between Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as "very
constructive."
</P>
<P>
Zenawi paid a two-day visit to Egypt on May 18, during which he
discussed with Mubarak the issue of Nile water.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said
the issue of Nile water "will never be the cause for" a dispute
between the two countries, but "rather an incentive for
cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Hammers Civic Organizations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean and President Robert
Mugabe on Friday took a swipe at labor, civic and opposition
leaders, describing them as puppets of the Western countries.
</P>
<P>
He said this at the third Zanu (PF) National Youth League
conference in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe called on his supporters to rally behind Zanu (PF) and
ignore opposition parties, which he said were being funded by
enemies of the state.
</P>
<P>
He said he had evidence that the opposition leaders, civic and
labor organizations were being funded by foreign organizations
whose ideologies were at variance with the Zimbabwean interests.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was referring to the human rights watchdog, ZimRights,
the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) and the Zimbabwe
Union of Democrats (ZUD).
</P>
<P>
He said, "I have evidence that they are getting money from
Britain, America and Europe. We should never allow our government
to fall in the hands of foreigners or the puppets or stooges of
the foreigners. We will never allow this to happen."
</P>
<P>
The national labor movement ZCTU, the ZUD and ZimRights, have
refused to participate in the National Constitution Commission
appointed by Mugabe, and have formed their own National
Consultative Assembly to discuss the amendments to the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also accused the independent press of being used by
foreigners to promote their interests.
</P>
<P>
"Some fora in Europe and the United States have been discussing
the need to get rid of the Zanu (PF) leadership. They want to
control and exploit our resources," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Attend Inauguration of Nigerian New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Retiring South African
President Nelson Mandela said Friday that he was looking forward
to attending the inauguration of Nigeria's new president, Olusegun
Obasanjo, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I am just going to witness the most important development in
the history of that country," South African Press Association
quoted Mandela as saying in Estcourt, KwaZulu-Natal, before
jetting out to the Nigerian capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo used to be the military ruler of Nigeria from 1976 to
1979 following the assassination of General Murtala Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
After the country's first democratic election in 1979, Obasanjo
handed over power to civilian northern politician Shehu Shagari,
and in doing so he became the country's first military ruler to
hand over power to a democratically elected administration.
</P>
<P>
General Sani Abacha's government imprisoned Obasanjo in 1996
for 15 years following his alleged involvement in a plot to
overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
He was released from jail last year after Abacha died.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Obasanjo had met on more than three occasions. The
Nigerian president-elect also attended Mandela's 80th birthday
party in July last year.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Blames Multinationals for Zimbabwe's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday blamed multinationals for some of the economic hardships
facing the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the third national Zanu (PF) Youth Conference in
Harare, Mugabe admitted that the government had made some mistakes
but was not totally to blame for the economic problems afflicting
the country.
</P>
<P>
He attacked white commercial farmers saying they created
shortages to influence price increases.
</P>
<P>
"Whites will never get you empowered. Yes, you will get a job
at companies such as Anglo-American Corporation and Rio Tinto, but
they are the ones digging out our resources and remitting their
dividends outside. This is why we are suffering from lack of
foreign currency," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president reassured 2,500 delegates that the government was
 committed to economic empowerment of its people and the land
acquisition and resettlement programs.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We need to keep these resources in this country and
this is what the Americans and the British don't want. They are
stealing our resources."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the government's primary focus was land
redistribution and he did not let the West dictate how and when it
should be done.
</P>
<P>
He said because of the land policy, the West labelled him "a
dictator, the devil, an authoritarian."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also urged the youths to come up with concrete programs
that would create employment and help solve the unemployment
crisis.

ISLAMABAD, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Friday offered to send his foreign minister to New Delhi
for talks on the latest developments along the Line of Control
(LoC) in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Sharif made his offer in a telephone call to his Indian
counterpart, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, according to a report by
Pakistan Television on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Sharif proposed that Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz be sent to
New Delhi for talks with his Indian counterpart, Jaswant Singh, on
ways and means to defuse the tension on the LoC area and push
forward the bilateral dialogue process.
</P>
<P>
Sharif made the phone call in response to a similar call made
by Vajpayee on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said to Vajpayee that Pakistan is not responsible for
the escalation of conflicts on the LoC and said these developments
are very dangerous, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It is highly unfortunate that only within three months since
the Lahore summit between the two prime ministers, the result of
the Lahore Declaration has been diminished, said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is committed to the spirit of the Lahore Declaration
and wants to push forward the dialogue process with India, the
prime minister added.

<HEADLINE> Freight  Volume Up by 8.7% in Mozambique's Nacala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The freight volume of Nacala
Corridor in north Mozambique reached 269,000 tons last year, a
record high and up by 8. 7 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Jacinto Nhussi, executive manager of the
North Mozambique Railway Company at a meeting held in Nacala, the
Mozambique News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The executive manager said the transport volume for the
railway system in the first half of this year is expected to reach
150,000 tons, while the handling capacity of the port is estimated
at 250,000 tons, both of which will increase remarkably as against
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Nacala Corridor includes Nacala port and the railway system
 stretching from the port to the interior of the country. Those
benefiting from the corridor are the northern provinces and the
neighboring Malawi.
</P>
<P>
According to Nhussi, about 48 percent of the goods transported
via the railway system in the corridor are for domestic
consumption, while the rest are transit goods. The port, however,
handles 80 percent of the goods for international transportation
which include the country's exports and imports.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's exports are mainly salt, maize, cotton, fuel,
cashew nut and wheat, whereas Malawi's major exports are tobacco
leaves, tea and peas.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe exported commodities worth
almost 24 billion Zimbabwean dollars (631 million U.S. dollars)
last year, Freddy Chawasarira, chief executive of the Zimbabwe
trade body, Zimtrade, said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He told an exporters' conference in Harare that agricultural
products contributed 50 percent of the total exports for the past
three years, with the manufacturing sector accounting for 30
percent, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"This justifies the need to enhance our production focus to
value added manufacturers which are less susceptible to global
price fluctuations," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the prevailing unfavorable economic
environment had resulted in the loss of export competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's economic environment is characterized by inflation
of 53 percent, interest rates of between 45 and 50 percent and an
unstable exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Exporters at the conference called on the government to help
them identify competitive markets in neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Russian Minister Quits, Government Crisis Feared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia's new First Deputy Prime
Minister Mikhail Zadornov resigned Friday after his request to
remain as finance minister at the same time was rejected.
</P>
<P>
Zadornov said President Boris Yeltsin has accepted his
resignation and signed a decree dismissing him from the post of
first deputy premier.
</P>
<P>
He said he accepted the appointment of first deputy premier
last Tuesday on condition that he would combine it with his
position of finance minister.
</P>
<P>
"My stance is that the finance ministry should play a key role
in the government," Zadornov said.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this position did not find support from the
President and his administration," he said.
</P>
<P>
The departure of the 36-year-old liberal was believed to be a
blow to the efforts of Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, confirmed
by parliament on May 19, to form a cabinet capable of steering
Russia out of crisis.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, a former interior minister who replaced former
premier Yevgeny Primakov, has little experience of the economy and
has said an authoritative economist is needed to control
micro-economic planning and finances in his government.
</P>
<P>
He has made it clear he does not believe the other first deputy
prime minister, Nikolai Aksyonenko, can do that, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe Aksyonenko was forced on Stepashin by the
Kremlin and Russian media said the two first deputy premiers had
been waging a struggle for power.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin first rejected Stepashin's choice of Alexander Zhukov,
the head of parliament's budget committee, to be the second first
deputy premier.
</P>
<P>
Then he refused to let Zadornov be a first deputy premier and
finance minister at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Yeltsin appointed debt negotiator Mikhail Kasyanov as
finance minister in a snub to both Stepashin and Zadornov.
</P>
<P>
Zadornov's departure was a further blow for Stepashin and the
consequences could be far-reaching.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is entering a new period of acute crisis," the NTV
commercial television channel said. It was not immediately clear
whether anyone would be appointed to replace Zadornov or whether
Aksyonenko, a former railways minister, would concentrate all
responsibility for the economy in his own hands.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister's post also remained in question. Kasyanov
is reported to be reluctant to take the job.
</P>
<P>
The Stepashin cabinet will meet Saturday to discuss the
situation in the wake of Zadornov's ouster.

<HEADLINE> Romania Surpasses Highest Peak of Foreign Debt on 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Romania on Friday paid on due
term the whole amount of 432 million U.S. dollars, meaning the
equivalent of the Samurai bonds issue bought in Japan in 1996
through the Nomura bank, announced the central Romanian bank BNR.
</P>
<P>
The payment was made by BNR, out of the state's hard currency
reserves. In order to counterbalance the diminution of these
reserves, BNR bought over April and May substantial hard currency
sums, as well as financial operation for which an arangement with
five foreign commercial banks will be signed over the coming
period. BNR will also make loans in association with the Ministry
of Finance.
</P>
<P>
By end-May, Romania's hard currency reserves will amount to
over one billion U.S. dollars, BNR estimated. The gold reserve
stands at 101 tonnes (about 900 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The payment of this sum has entailed the surpassing of the
highest debt peak on 1999, as concerns the payments of the foreign
debt servicing. The foreign debt's service for 1999 stands at over
2 billion U.S. dollars, the highest not only in the last five
years but also in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important step in meeting the market requirements
for Romania's future issues on the Japanese and international
money market", Managing director of the Nomura International
Daniel Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
The Samurai bond issues, launched in May 1996, with a 5.2
percent interest, was Romania's first step to enter the capital
markets.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Denies Proposing to Change Amnesty Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki Friday denied reports that he intended to review
amnesty legislation.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to recent press reports in this regard, Mbeki said he
never suggested this.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Mbeki asked Justice Minister Dullah Omar
to consider changes to amnesty laws so that former soldiers of the
old South African Defense Force, who were involved in violence in
KwaZulu-Natal and members of political parties could get amnesty
without having to apply as individuals.
</P>
<P>
"The Office of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki has noted the
recent press reports on his alleged intention to review amnesty
legislation. The deputy president never suggested anything of this
sort," a statement from his office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Mbeki stood by his speech in Parliament
during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission debate on February
25 that the "idea of general amnesty should never be entertained".
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mbeki also said South Africans should, however,
not allow themselves to be drawn into a situation of conflict as a
result of the political crimes of the past.
</P>
<P>
"The office of the deputy president wishes to point out that
the sentiments expressed in his February 25 speech remains the
position adopted and forms the basis of the referral of all the
issues... to the Justice Ministry to look into," Mbeki's office
said.
</P>
<P>
The issues sent to the justice department pertain to the
special problem of KwaZulu-Natal, the problem of former security
force members who did not apply for amnesty because the leaders of
the former government failed to accept political responsibility
and amnesty on an equal basis for political organizations engaged
in the struggle.

PARIS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- NATO will begin air dropping
humanitarian materials in Kosovo soon, because of support by
France, the United States and Britain, said French Foreign
Ministry on Friday.
</P>
<P>
``In order to help the displaced people inside Kosovo, whose
situation remains tragic, France, the United States and the United
Kingdom have decided to contribute to the air dropping by the
non-governmental organization International Rescue Committee (IRC)
of humanitarian aid on the territory of the province,'' said the
foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
The IRC will rent two civilian planes which will fly to Kosovo
from Pescara, Italy, twice a day in average.

Several cabinet members from both countries attended the

to South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
"We thought the meeting was a necessary continuation of
discussions we had in Maputo. There is a whole variety of
questions we have to deal with, such as the Maputo Corridor and
other economic initiatives," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
It was important to sustain the momentum of these projects, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We remain convinced that we need to work very hard in ensuring
that there is development in Mozambique and South Africa."
</P>
<P>
Speeding up this process required a partnership between the two
 countries, Mbeki said, adding that this would also be the
approach of the post-election South African government, Mbeki
said.
</P>

Mocumbi, on the other hand, said: "We are showing today that
the expectations of our people should not be hampered by the

<HEADLINE> European Defense Ministers Set Timetable for WEU, EU Fusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 28 (Xinhua)--Defense ministers from 21 European
countries Friday in Bonn passed a timetable for merging the
Western European Union (WEU) with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Under their working plan, the WEU will integrate with the EU by
the end of year 2000, and the EU, long being an economic and
political organization, will gain military capacity for the first
time in its history.
</P>
<P>
WEU, a bloc founded in 1955 and including 10 western European
states, has made up the " European pillar" of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The working plan, as a successive step to EU's Amsterdam Treaty
which became effective since May 1, will boost Europeans' common
security and defense policy, said German Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping, who hosted the minister meeting.
</P>
<P>
Scharping hailed Friday's result by saying the plan would give
the EU an "armed arm" and would promote it to a world military
power.
</P>
<P>
The fusion plan will also be one of the main topics at the
European Union summit scheduled for June 3 in Cologne, he said.
</P>
<P>
Scharping stressed that Europe needed greater cooperation in
arms planing, weapon manufacturing, and it must develop its own
satellite intelligence ability and air transport capability.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted there were still considerable problems ahead,
with the fact that four EU members remained neutral countries
outside the NATO. The four neutral states are Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Ireland.

<P>
During their summit meeting held in Toulouse, southern France,
Chirac and Schroeder said that they also reached ``a perfect
agreement'' on the strategy of NATO toward Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Schroeder began on Friday in Toulouse the 73th

<HEADLINE> IFC Invests in Compact Disk Recordable Project in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation announced Friday that it has signed an agreement to
invest up to 25 million U.S. dollars in Moser Baer India Limited
(MBIL), the largest manufacturer and exporter of floppy disks in
India.
</P>
<P>
IFC's financing consists of an equity investment of 8 million
dollars and a loan of 17 million dollars for IFC's own account.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, IFC invested to help MBIL expand its floppy disk
capacity seven-fold. With the new investment, IFC's total exposure
in the company would be about 31 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 91-million-dollar project will allow MBIL to set up a
global-sized export oriented facility with an annual production of
95 million compact disk recordables (CD-Rs) -- CDs on which data
and music can be easily recorded, said the IFC, a member of the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
CD-R has become one of the most popular of the various optical
data storage media products introduced in the market in recent
years and has achieved explosive growth as the demand for optical
data storage media is growing rapidly with increasing multimedia
applications and the need for higher data storage capacity and
greater operational reliability.
</P>
<P>
Rashad Kaldany, IFC Director for South and Southeast Asia, said
that the project, the first of its kind in South Asia, would put
India on the world map for the manufacture of high quality optical
media and make the country an important source for such high-tech
products.
</P>
<P>
The project would also introduce new technology and sustain the
growth and development of the technology sector, a priority of the
Indian government, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Concerned Over Bias Against Chinese Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the United
States Li Zhaoxing Friday expressed his concerns over the
discrimination against the Chinese and other Asian Americans
following the release of the Cox Report on "Chinese espionage".
</P>
<P>
"We are very much worried and concerned" over such
discrimination, Li said at a press conference of the U.S. National
Press Club.
</P>
<P>
"I only hope that this country, which is so proud of its rule
of law, will not have any discrimination against ethnic
minorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I've already heard that many Chinese working in this country
are being discriminated against. And this is a sad thing to
watch," he added.
</P>
<P>
Discrimination and harassment against the Chinese and other
Asian Americans have mounted since some U.S. congressmen and
newspapers started playing up the so called "Wen Ho Lee espionage
case" in March and particularly after the release of the Cox
Report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Li said that many just-minded and fair-minded American people,
who are also concerned about such discrimination, are urging the
U.S. Congress and government to pursue a policy of equality among
all ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
David Wu, the first Chinese American congressman in the United
States, introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives
Thursday condemning racial discrimination against Chinese and
other Asian Americans and calling for protection of the legitimate
rights of the minorities.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said Americans of Asian ancestry have made
profound contributions to the progress of American society and
life and they deserve to be protected.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Finds no Evidence of Violation by DPRK on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- the United States said on Friday
that there is no evidence to support its allegation of possible
revival of a nuclear weapons program by the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The admission came after a U.S. team of 14 experts has
concluded its inspection of an underground site at Kumchang-ri,
which Washington had alleged to be part of a revived nuclear
weapons program. After the investigations they said what they
found at the underground site was an empty tunnel.
</P>
<P>
At a regular briefing State Department spokesman James Rubin
said that based on what the team found, "there is no basis to
conclude that North Korea is in violation of the agreed
framework."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a 1994 agreement under which the DPRK would
receive fuel oil and light-water nuclear reactors in exchange for
its graphite reactor, which the United States had alleged might be
used to develop armaments.
</P>
<P>
"The underground portion of the site is a large empty tunnel
complex," Rubin said. "Construction was unfinished and no
equipment was present."
</P>
<P>
Addressing speculation that nuclear-related equipment might
have been moved out before the U.S. team arrives, Rubin said: "It
was at a stage of construction prior to the time when any relevant
equipment other than construction equipment would be expected to
be present.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said another inspection is scheduled next year. He
insisted that the United States has the right to return to the
site for inspection when concerns are raised again.
</P>
<P>
"We have the right to return," he said. "In anticipation of an
outcome such as this preliminary one, we wanted to ensure future
visits so that we could fully remove our suspicions about the
intended use of the site."
</P>
<P>
On special envoy William Perry's visit to the DPRK, Rubin said
he did not meet DPRK president Kim Jong Il, but his delegation was
"well received" and met with a number of top officials during the
visit that ended earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation met with a range of senior officials from
political, foreign affairs and defense circles and thereby heard
authoritative views," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Perry's visit was separated from the inspection of the U.S.
team. His mission is to make a policy review toward Pyongyang
upon his visit.

PARIS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany on Saturday asked
the Group of Eight (G8) to meet within a short period of time to
evaluate the declaration made by Yugoslavia that it would accept
the principles of G8 for solving the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard

if the content of the declaration by Yugoslav President Slobodan

the principles of G8, it should be taken seriously.

"For this purpose, we think that holding a meeting of the G8
countries within a short period of time at the level of political
directors (of foreign ministries) will allow us to evaluate the
real meaning of this declaration and to act correspondingly," said
Chirac and Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also said that they support the diplomatic
efforts being made by Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari in the
name of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said in a communique issued on Friday that he was
ready to accept the "general principles" of the plan presented by
G8 for ending the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
The G8 plan includes a withdrawal of Serb troops and militias
from Kosovo, return of Kosovo refugees to their homes and

<HEADLINE> Withdrawal of Brownback Amendment Unfortunate:Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday described as
"unfortunate" the withdrawal in the U.S. senate of the Brownback
Amendment seeking a five-year suspension of sanctions imposed on
Pakistan and India for their nuclear tests last year.
</P>
<P>
"Withdrawal of the Brownback Amendment is a new road block to
the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) by
Pakistan," a Foreign Office spokesman told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback had moved the amendment in the U.S.
senate to repeal all sanctions against Pakistan and India
including the Pressler Amendment.
</P>
<P>
But he suddenly withdrew the amendment on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"The United States should consider the implications of the
withdrawal of the amendment," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Senator Brownback said in Washington earlier this week that he
was planning to offer an amendment to lift economic sanctions on
Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
He said the withdrawal of the amendment was the result of the
latest escalation of tension in the Kashmir area.
</P>
<P>
"I have considered the wisdom of offering my amendment on India
and Pakistan at this time," he said, but added that "I strongly
believe in the long term importance of easing economic sanctions
on both these nations."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the move by Brownback has almost diminished all
chances of removal of sanctions and sealed the fate of the CTBT as
Pakistan was expected to ink the treaty if sanctions were lifted.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani spokesman, however, reiterated that Pakistan will
adhere to the CTBT by September if the atmosphere of sanctions and
coercion is removed.

<HEADLINE> Visit to India to Help Mitigate Tension: Pakistan FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz said Saturday his visit to New Delhi will help defuse the
"hot environment" at the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir and that
technical issues concerning the Lahore Declaration would be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a group of journalists here, Aziz said the dates of
his visit to India would be finalized shortly through the
diplomatic channel.
</P>
<P>
He said the objective of his visit is to defuse tension at the
LoC and set dates for the resumption of talks at the foreign
secretary level.
</P>
<P>
"This talks process anyway would start after the elections in
India," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
"The violations of cease-fire at the LoC by India in summer
used to be a normal routine but this time it has been escalated as
the Indian jet fighters have violated Pakistan's airspace abusing
international conventions," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that my visit to India would help in overcoming the
hectic violations at the LoC," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also said that both sides are fully committed to the
Lahore Declaration signed by the two prime ministers of Pakistan
and India in February. "But there are various technical matters
required to be settled and I am going to talk on the same during
my this visit."
</P>
<P>
Aziz said he hoped his visit to New Delhi would help defuse
tension at the LoC "as this time the most unwarranted tension
gripped the area due to qualitative escalation in violations."

<HEADLINE> New Arhat Statues Built On Southwestern Buddhist Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 1,000 senior monks and other
many people gathered today on Emei Mountain in southwest China's
Sichuan Province to celebrate the completion of the new "500
arhats" statues, a symbol of auspiciousness and strength in
Buddhism, in a local temple.
</P>
<P>
Emei Mountain, a picturesque locale in northwestern Sichuan,
is considered one of China's four "Buddhist mountains" with its
concentration of ancient Buddhist temples.
</P>
<P>
One of the most famous temples on the mountain, the Fuhu Temple,
once boasted a hall of worship with magnificent statues of the 500
arhats, well-known not only to local Buddhists but also to
overseas believers. However, the hall and its statues were
dismantled in 1968.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist Association of Emei Mountain raised more than 5
million yuan (about 600,000 U.S. dollars) through its own efforts
and began rebuilding the hall and arhat statues in 1995 to
restore the old appearance of the Fuhu Temple.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 2,731 square meters, the new hall is even
larger and more splendid than the previous one, with all the
arhats made of colored clay and covered in gold foil.

<HEADLINE> Report: Belgrade Agrees to Russian Settlement Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia has agreed to a Russian
plan for the settlement of the Balkan crisis, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was made during a Friday visit to Belgrade by
Russian special envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, who talked with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for over nine hours, Tass
said, quoting an informed source in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Russian plan envisions a halt to NATO's bombing, which
entered the 67th day Saturday, reduction of the Yugoslav army and
police strength in Kosovo province and the start of a peacekeeping
operation under the auspices of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, contingents of NATO troops participating in the
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia are to be deployed in Albania
and Macedonia and to be tasked with sealing off the conflict
region and keeping the Kosovo Liberation Army out of it, and with
attending to humanitarian relief of Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Peacekeeping forces of NATO countries that stayed away from the
air operations are to be introduced to the border area of Kosovo
to reinforce border control and secure stability.
</P>
<P>
Military contingents of neutral countries, including Russia and
other member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States,
would be stationed in the remaining territory of Kosovo with the
task of policing security and refugee return.
</P>
<P>
The Russian plan also calls for placing the general leadership
of the peace operation under the U.N. Security Council, with a
commander of peacekeeping forces to be appointed from a neutral
country.
</P>
<P>
A chief of staff could be a representative of a NATO country
that did not take part in the military actions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia "has fully agreed to the Russian draft of the plan
and expressed a readiness to go along with a number of additional
concessions," Tass said, quoting the source.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Belgrade could agree to the use of
reconnaissance planes of NATO and Russia to monitor its withdrawal
of troops, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia could also agree to an expansion of the border area
and the incorporation of elements of NATO's control system into
staff bodies of the peacekeeping operation's command.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how the NATO alliance sees the Russia plan,
but Chernomyrdin is expected to meet again with U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari on the Yugoslav crisis.

<HEADLINE> U.S., S.Korea, Japan Hold Tripartite Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy William Perry held
a consultation meeting here with South Korean Unification Minister
Lim Dong-won and Japanese Foreign Ministry Policy Director Kato
Ryozo.
</P>
<P>
"A key role of mine in this visit was to establish meaningful
relationships with a wide range senior DPRK officials with direct
links to the DPRK leader, and to convey them clearly and firmly on
U.S. and Allied views and concerns. I have no doubt that I
succeeded in doing precisely that," said Perry, who flew to Seoul
Friday night from Pyongyang, at a joint press conference held
after the tripartite meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also said he discussed the possibility of major expansion of
relations between the United States and the DPRK as part of a
process in which U.S. and Allied missile and nuclear concerns are
addressed.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. defense secretary said he conducted frank,
sincere talks on a wide range of issues with DPRK officials in an
atmosphere of mutual respect during his four-day visit to the
country,
</P>
<P>
Perry said the visit gave him a valuable chance to assess DPRK
views first hand although he did not meet DPRK leader Kim Jong-il.
</P>
<P>
In Pyongyang, Perry conveyed a letter from U.S. President Bill
Clinton and oral messages of South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to DPRK leader Kim Jong-
il and met leaders from the DPRK's Foreign Ministry, National
Defense Commission, Korean Workers Party and the Korean People's
Army.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. special envoy pointed out that "it will take some time
for the DPRK to further reflect on the views I expressed and for
us to reflect on our visit."
</P>
<P>
He said he will complete his DPRK report in the coming few
weeks or so and deliver it to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, South Korean Unification Minister Lim
Dong-won, who reportedly masterminded Kim Dae-jung's sunshine
policy toward the DPRK, said the tripartite consultation meeting
agreed that Washington, Seoul and Tokyo remain firmly committed to
the implementation of the 1994 Agreed Framework.
</P>
<P>
Under a 1994 agreement with the United States, the DPRK agreed
to freeze its nuclear development program in exchange for two
safer nuclear reactors and fuel oil.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Women Gives Birth To Quadruplets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A woman pregnant for eight-and-a-
half months successfully gave birth to four babies by Cesarean
section on Friday morning in Tianjin, north China, the first
multiple birth in the city in a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old woman was rushed from Dacheng County in
neighboring Hebei Province to a hospital in Tianjin at around one
o'clock in the morning in fairly poor medical condition.
</P>
<P>
Doctors attended to her for about two hours before she gave
birth to the four babies, the heaviest weighing 1,820 grams and
the lightest 1,500 grams.
</P>
<P>
The four newborns, three girls and one boy, are reportedly all
in good condition. The mother had a baby girl in 1992, and since
that time had taken no fertility drugs. The grandmother of the
quadruplets is also the mother of twins.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region has developed an environmental protection system
for desert-prevention and ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiguang, executive vice chairman of the autonomous regional
government, announced this today during a Ningxia Promotion Week
event in this city of southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
As part of the '99 World Horticultural Exposition, the
promotion week will include performances, exhibitions, a trade
fair and information related to the autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is facing severe problems of desert encroachment, soil
erosion, and deteriorating resources, Ma said, and people in the
region are making great efforts to protect the environment and
ecology.
</P>
<P>
The region has carried out many environmental protection
projects such as afforestation, desert control, and orchard
planting, and now the extending desert area has shrunk from 16,500
square meters in 1970s to 12,600 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has mapped out a 12-year forestry development project
to further improve its ecological environment, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia covers an area of 66,400 square meters, and about one-
third of its 5.3 million population are Moslems.

<P>
ATHENS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Saturday strongly
protested to its neighboring Albania over the handling of a bus
hostage crisis, in which two people were killed and another one
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Public Order Minister Michalis Chrysohoidis described
the action by the Albanian police as "thoughtless" and "
disregarding human lives," saying that Albanian police blocked the
Greek police forces at some distance from the bus, before
intervening.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greece's Deputy Foreign Minister Yiannos Kranidiotis,
after meeting with Albanian ambassador in Athens, said that the
two sides had agreed to set up a joint committee to investigate
the event.
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, a 25-year-old Albanian national, Antonio
Flambo, hijacked a bus carrying nine Greeks on the Scholari-
Thessaloniki route. The hijacker, who threatened to kill the
hostages with a Kalashnikov assault rifle and a grenade, forced
the bus toward the Greek-Albanian border during the night.
</P>
<P>
After crossing the border, the bus was escorted by Albanian
special police forces, which later stormed the bus and killed the
hijacker and a Greek passenger, with another woman hostage injured.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Notaries Public Handle 12 Million Cases in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The sharp augmentation has been a result of enhanced public
awareness of the law, as well as efforts of notaries public to
expand business," Gao said at a national conference on
notarization.
</P>
<P>
Since the reinstatement of the notarial system in 1979,
attesting officers have increased their involvement in civil case
involving foreign parties in all aspects of social and economic
life including family and marriage issues, land contracts, finance,
real estate, public bidding, enterprise reform, and farming.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, notaries public helped prevent 1,579
illegal deals in 1998 and avoid 100 billion yuan of potential
economic losses by the State, companies and citizens.
</P>
<P>
Of all the notarial cases handled last year, 1.9 million were
related to foreign parties or residents of Hong Kong, Taiwan and
Macao. Chinese notarial documents were issued throughout 100
countries and regions nationwide.
</P>
<P>
There now are 18,100 attesting officers working in 3,180
notarial offices in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, with the rapid growth of notarial business, certain
bad phenomena have alarmed the government, for instance incorrect
or fake notarization which are few in number but enormous in terms
of harm, minister Gao said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to introduce a new system to have notaries public
punished for both deliberate or unintentional mistakes, and
empower qualified attesting officers with independence for the
discharge of duties.
</P>
<P>
Other reform measure include notarial offices being separated
from administrative bodies and turned into service agencies of the
society, retaining the authority of the law, and notaries public
being recruited from the general public through unified
examinations.

<P>
The country's capital fell in jubilant and a national prayer is
to be held in Abuja's central mosque in the afternoon and various
cultural displays and a splendid firework show will also take
place when night falls.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian people have plenty of reasons to be jubilant, at a
time they can bid farewell to the past and hopefully could get a
better future.
</P>
<P>
"I hope our life could be a little bit different with the
coming of civilian rule," said a taxi driver at the Abuja
International Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
In a farewell address broadcast nationwide Friday evening, Gen.
Abubakar called on the armed forces to go back to the barracks and
concentrate on its professionalization.
</P>
<P>
Military's rule, accounting for 29 out of the 39 years after
Nigeria' s independence from Britain in 1960, is blamed by the
international community and critics at home for the country's
economic down-turn.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has slid from among the world's top 50 richest
countries to the poorest 30 over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
The oil price drop in the world market made the country's
economy even worse, with its foreign reserve hitting the record
low and federal deficit record high.
</P>
<P>
Rampant corruption, high population growth rate and ethnic
conflicts, especially in the oil-rich Delta State have also
hindered Nigeria's economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Despite many challenges he must address, President Obasanjo has
shown his confidence and determination on many occasions that
Nigeria should and can undertake the leadership on African
continent by starting reforming and rehabilitating its battered
economy and inefficient governance.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Saturday's handover could be a start for
Nigeria to make a real difference, said many foreign visitors at a
party in Abuja's Nicon Hilton Hotel.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Auction Raises Funds For Sick Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- With Children's Day on June 1
around the corner, a roadside charity auction was held today in
China's largest city of Shanghai, raising more than 5,000 yuan (
about 600 U.S. dollars) for local kids suffering from serious
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The auction, held in a garden on Huanhai Road, one of
Shanghai's most famous commercial streets in the city center, was
organized by the Shanghai Municipal Committee on Women and
Children's Work, and hosted by the Shanghai Oriental International
Auction House.
</P>
<P>
"Every year some children in Shanghai are stricken with serious
diseases like leukemia and malignant tumors and must stay in the
hospital for a long time. We have been trying to build some
'sunshine huts' for these children for the last days of their
lives," said Tian Xiong, deputy director of the women and
children's work committee.
</P>
<P>
Building the huts, which are filled with toys and modern
facilities including computers, requires a lot of money, most of
which should come from public donations, Tian added.
</P>
<P>
Items going under the gavel today included children's bicycles,
suitcases, and wines, all donated by local businesses. All the
money raised went to the Shanghai Foundation for Children's
Activities.
</P>
<P>
The auction attracted many shoppers and passersby, who
surrounded the makeshift auction table and offered generous bids.
Some local residents who knew about the auction in advance even
walked a long way carrying their children to the auction site.

<HEADLINE> New Management Measures for Processing Ventures (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The State Council has announced
plans for a big shake-up in the way manufacturing and processing
joint ventures are managed in China. The main points of the plan
include:
</P>
<P>
The types of commodities traded will be classified into three
categories: the prohibited, the restricted, and the permitted.
</P>
<P>
The prohibited refers to those imported commodities banned by
the foreign trade law of China and those over which Chinese
Customs cannot exercise bonded supervision.
</P>
<P>
The restricted refers to those imports whose prices at home and
abroad differ widely and those sensitive commodities which Chinese
Customs cannot supervise.
</P>
<P>
The allowed refers to the remaining commodities not included in
the first two categories.
</P>
<P>
Joint ventures dealing in processing will be divided into four
categories according to their performance -- A, B, C, and D. A
list of companies and their respective category will be announced
regularly.
</P>
<P>
Category A ventures refer to those ventures under the
supervision of customs officers stationed within ventures under
approval of the General Administration of Customs, bonded
factories whose computers are connected to those of local customs
authorities and have no record of illegal activities, and those
that are engaged in special industries such as airplane and ship
manufacturing.

<TEXT>
<P>
Category A ventures will be under the bonded supervision of
Chinese Customs and exempt from the guaranty money-machine account
system. Processing ventures within bonded zones will also be
exempt from the guaranty money-machine account system.
</P>
<P>
Category B ventures refer to those which operate in accordance
with law and have no record of unlawful activities. These type of
firms will continue to be treated within the current system.
</P>
<P>
Category C processing ventures refer to those which have been
found by Chinese Customs to have engaged in illegal activities.
These firms will have to deposit a sum of guaranty money, the
equivalent amount of import duty, plus import value-added tax, in
a machine account.
</P>
<P>
Category D refers to those which were determined by Chinese
Customs to have engaged in smuggling or to have been found guilty
of at least three instances of illegal activity. These firms will
be punished by Chinese Customs according to law, and their
licenses will be revoked. overseas-funded firms in Category D will
have their import and export rights suspended for a year.
</P>
<P>
The plan also stipulates terms of treatment for manufacturing
firms under commission of processing firms.
</P>
<P>
Processing ventures engaged in the trade of restricted
commodities, and Category C firms, must abide by the guaranty
money-machine account system. In doing so they must deposit money
into the account set by Chinese Customs at the Bank of China. The
money and its bank interest will be refunded after the relevant
firm re-exports their processed goods within a set period of time.
Those who fail to do so will have their deposit money and interest
turned into tax money, with interest.

<HEADLINE> New President of Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Olusegun Obasanjo was Saturday sworn
in as the elected president of the Fourth Republic of Nigeria,
bringing new hope to the most populous African country after 15
years of military rule.
</P>
<P>
With his promise "to defend the constitution of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria," Obasanjo has completed the long-expected
transition of power from military to civilian in the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo is the only military ruler in the Nigeria who has come
back to the state house for the second time in two decades, but
this time as a civilian leader.
</P>
<P>
He is also the only military ruler in the history of Nigeria
who handed over power to elected President Shehu Shagari two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The soldier-turned-poultry farmer was sentenced to life
imprisonment in 1995 and later commuted to 15 years of
imprisonment on alleged charges of plotting a coup along with 43
other people by the late military leader General Sani Abacha. He
was released from prison eight months ago, following the sudden
death of Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Born in Abeokuta in southwestern Nigeria, Obasanjo belongs to
the Yoruba tribe, one of the three major tribes in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In a country riven by tribalism, Obasanjo is one of the few
politicians who can claim to be more popular outside than within
his own ethnic group of Yoruba.
</P>
<P>
Born on March 5, 1937, Obasanjo was educated at the Baptist
secondary school in his home town Abeokuta, about 100 kilometers
north of Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos.
</P>
<P>
He became a teacher before joining the army in 1958 and
receiving military training at schools in Britain and India.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed Works and Housing Commissioner (minister) in
1975 and later became Chief of Staff of Supreme Headquarters until
February 1976 when he succeeded the slain General Murtala Muhammad
as head of state.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo was Co-Chairman of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons
Group on South Africa and he founded the African Leadership Forum
in 1988 based in his Otta farm near Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Having won a reputation as an officer-democrat, Obasanjo
adopted the role of world statesman when he tried to win the post
of the U.N. Secretary- General in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In remarks after his election on February 27, Obasanjo pledged
to serve Nigerians with justice and fair play and to restore good
governance.
</P>
<P>
Married more than once and with many children, Obasanjo says
his hobbies include farming, table tennis, snooker and squash.

<P>
NEW DELHI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee has rejected his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz
Sharif's suggestion to stop air strikes in Kargil to pay the way
for talks with Pakistan to resolve the current crisis, official
sources said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing on his telephone talks with Sharif at a meeting of
leaders of major political parties here, Vajpayee said, "Stopping
air strikes may not be possible. It cannot be one-sided. You are
sending infiltrators and regulars."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said that India was ready for talks.
</P>
<P>
When asked about Pakistan's Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz's
visit to New Delhi for talks over the crisis, caretaker
Parliamentary Affairs Minister P. R. Kumaramangalam said that
India was always willing to talk and Vajpayee was still to get a
final communication from Islamabad in the matter.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Islamabad said that Aziz would
travel to India early next week as part of Islamabad's diplomatic
efforts to ease tensions in the Kashmir region. Pakistan's
Information Minister Mushahid Hussain said that Vajpayee had
accepted Sharif's offer Friday to send Aziz to New Delhi for talks
with External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh.

<P>
MANILA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that English will remain as the medium of instruction in
elementary and high schools to ensure that the Philippines keeps
its competitive edge in the global market.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Education Secretary Andrew Gonzales said
science and mathematics will continue to be taught in English
while social studies will be taught in Tagalog in all schools.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales said that according to the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the most effective
medium of instruction for small children is the home language or
the vernacular.
</P>
<P>
"We should not neglect our advantage in the English language,
which is a universal language. Filipinos have an advantage over
other laborers because they know how to speak English, even our
drivers know how to speak English," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Secretary for Health and
Welfare of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government
Robin Gill said Saturday that food safety and food hygiene would
be the focus of the Healthy Living Campaign here this year.
</P>
<P>
"The government is committed to raising the standards of food
hygiene and food safety of Hong Kong," Gill said, adding that
various new measures and initiatives would be introduced to this
end.
</P>
<P>
Gill made the remarks while announcing the results of the
latest series of 10 public opinion surveys which showed that most
of the respondents considered hygiene standards, the type of food
provided and the price and taste of the food rather than whether
restaurants were licensed or not in their choice of food premises.
</P>
<P>
To promote higher hygiene standards in food premises, Gill said
that proposals on Categorization of Restaurants and Hygiene
Manager Schemes will be implemented in November this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposals, members of the public would be made aware
of the rating given for hygiene standards in food premises.
</P>
<P>
In addition, licensees would be actively encouraged to upgrade
the hygiene in their premises.
</P>
<P>
The surveys also revealed that one-third of respondents said
they had patronized unlicensed food premises/cooked food stalls in
the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 71 percent were aware of the risks to their health
by eating unclean food, 24 percent found nothing wrong to
patronize unlicensed restaurants or cooked food stalls while
another 10 percent thought that it would encourage illegal hawking.
</P>
<P>
As a highlight event for this year, a large scale ceremony will
be held at which representatives and employees of the food and
catering industries will pledge support to promote clean and safe
food, Gill said.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Fereydoun Verdinejad, Managing
Director of the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) and the
English-language paper Iran Daily was jailed on Saturday for
press violations.
</P>
<P>
An informed source from the agency told Xinhua that Verdinejad
was arrested for "press issue." But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that Verdinejad was put into jail upon the order of a
local court for government employees. However, the report did not
mention the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
Verdinejad was imprisoned after failing to pay a bail of 180
million rials (about 60,000 U.S. dollars), IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
The IRNA and Iran Daily, widely believed to be close to the
Iranian moderate President Mohammad Khatami, have been under
strong attacks by the conservatives since Khatami came to power
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The conservative critics accused IRNA and the newspapers
published by IRNA for siding with the moderates in their
publications.

years of military rule.
</P>
<P>
Following are key facts and figures about Nigeria:
</P>
<P>
Population: 108 million (government estimate). About one in
five Africans is a Nigerian. There are more than 200 distinct
ethnic groups, but the three main tribes are the Hausa-Fulani, the
Yoruba and the Ibo. Life expectancy averages 52 years. Literacy is
62 percent for men and 39 percent for women.

and humid near the Atlantic coast to dry and arid in the north.
</P>
<P>
Capital: Abuja. The biggest city and commercial capital is
Lagos with eight million people.
</P>
<P>
History: Nigeria has been inhabited since at least 700 B.C. It
was one of the countries worst affected by the trans-Atlantic

</P>
<P>
It won independence from Britain in 1960 and has been ruled by
soldiers for all but 10 years since then. All nine changes of
government have been inspired or effected by the military.
</P>
<P>
Economy: the currency is the naira (one U.S. dollar = 100

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set Up Biogas Plants Under Pilot Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research (BCSIR) has set up about 2,500 biogas
plants and 2,500 more will be set up across the country under a
pilot project, to meet the growing demand for energy and for
recycling the nutrients process of soil.
</P>
<P>
Twenty percent of the country's agricultural families, meaning
four million people, who own four to five cows each, are in a
position to set up biogas plants to meet their family needs of
energy, said Kazi Akhteruzzaman, project director of the biogas
plants of the BCSIR, the BSS news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the five-year project at 91.3 million taka (1.9 million
U.S. dollars), 128 sub-assistant engineers have been recruited to
provide technical assistance to those who are using biogas plants
or are interested to set up such plants, he said.
</P>
<P>
Families having four to five cows are also provided one-time
grant of 5,000 taka (104 dollars) each to set up a biogas plant,
which requires an investment of 12,000 to 14,000 taka (250 to 292
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Describing the declining soil fertility as alarming,
Akhteruzzaman said the soil nutrients of Bangladesh is 11 percent,
compared with 40 percent in India and 65 percent in China. Wider
use of biogas plants would help increase soil fertility in the
process, he said.
</P>
<P>
One biogas plant has been set up at the village home of
President Shahabuddin Ahmed at Netrakona district, 140 kilometers
away from the capital, and another at the village home of Chief
Election Commissioner Abu Hena, to encourage people to set up
biogas plants to meet their increasing needs of fuel and
electricity, another official of the project was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
One BCSIR official said there had been initial lapses and
difficulties with the biogas plants in the early 1980s, describing
the present model as improved version of earlier models and also
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Mshiuzzaman, chairman of the BCSIR, said, "If we take
into consideration the total renewable energy, we find production
of biogas as very useful for the country. Initially, even if the
comparatively rural affluent people are benefited, in the
long-run, the use of biogas would benefit also the poor by
increasing soil fertility and contributing to the total energy
savings."
</P>
<P>
The residue of biogas digesters would be available for use as
organic fertilizer, he said.
</P>
<P>
But there is catch to set up the planned biogas plants in the
country, where most of the rural people cook with cow-dung and
rice straw, a report said.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, a four-cow family is a wealthy family, one which
can afford to buy its own kerosene and does not relish the tedium
of feeding dung into a digester, it said.
</P>
<P>
If the government does manage to popularize the use of biogas
among cow-owning families, the report said, the landless majority
of the Bangladeshi people will have a more difficult time finding
dung with which to cook -- it will all be going into biogas
plants.

CAIRO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
left here for Damascus on Saturday to discuss the latest
developments in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will hold talks with his Syrian counterpart Farouq
al-Sharaa on coordination of Arab stances on the developments in
the regional situation, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's visit, which will run for hours, is part of Egypt's
diplomatic efforts to arrange a five-way Arab summit aimed at
forging a unified Arab position towards all eventualities in the
coming stage in the Mideast peace process, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak proposed a summit among Egypt,
Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians to seek ways of
advancing the peace process after Ehud Barak, moderate leader of
the Israeli Labor Party, won premiership in the country's
elections on May 17.
</P>
<P>
But Syria has shown little interest in attending the proposed
summit, as it is still keeping distance with the Palestinians due
to the Palestinians' signing of interim peace accords separately
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats in Cairo said that Moussa is expected to
persuade Damascus to take part in the five-way summit in a bid to
form one Arab voice in the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will actively examine the
implications and cost effectiveness of the recommendations
recently submitted by the consultants studying red tide management
and monitoring in Hong Kong, a government spokesman said here

The major recommendations of the consultancy study included
proposals for enhancement in coordination, phytoplankton and
biotoxin monitoring, public communication/education, and
mitigation measures.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government recognized the importance of overall
coordination between bureaus and departments in dealing with red
tide incidents and HAB, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Services Bureau will consider the formation of a
Red Tide/HAB Task Force as recommended by the consultants.
</P>
<P>
And the Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) will
coordinate the establishment of an Operational Technical Team to
enhance the cooperation between departments on operational matters.
</P>
<P>
An Expert Advisory Group will also be formed to enhance
communications with red tide experts and mariculturists.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the primary objective of the study is to minimize
the impacts of red tide on the mariculture industry and that most
of the consultants' recommendations were related to red tide
monitoring, the spokesman reiterated that AFD had upgraded its
monitoring capability from visible red tide monitoring to pro-
active monitoring to provide early warning of HAB to
mariculturists.
</P>
<P>
Satellite remote sensing monitoring was still a research tool
rather than an available operational option, he stressed and this
was a view shared by the consultants.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government would also examine other longer term
recommendations such as the development of red tide/HAB tracking
models and research projects, he said.

MAPUTO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Private and public sectors in
Mozambique, Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia have been urged to act as
"the engine" in developing the Mtwara Corridor.
</P>
<P>
The international conference on the development of the Mtwara
Corridor in Pemba, capital of the northern Cabo Delgado Province,
Friday called on the private and public sectors of the four
countries to establish partnerships with regional and
international investors and donors.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias newspaper Saturday quoted participants as saying
at the meeting that priorities should be given to private sectors
when the four countries are developing the Mtwara Corridor.
</P>
<P>
The development projects should contribute to the economic
growth and the well-being of the people in the region, they said.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Minister of Transport Paulo Muxanga said that the
participation of the private sectors in the corridor development
is very important for the perfection of the memorandum of
understanding.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the memorandum is the legal foundation for
the establishment of a development zone in the Mtwara corridor.
</P>
<P>
It will be submitted to the workshop of investors in Dar es
Salaam, capital of Tanzania, in November this year, which the
heads of state and government of the four countries will attend.

meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mtwara is a town in south Tanzania. According to former
agreements reached by the four countries, the development program
includes the use of the Ruvuma River bordering Mozambique and
Tanzania and Indian Ocean as well as the joint development in
agriculture, fisheries, mines and tourism.
</P>
<P>
After the corridor development project starts, it will benefit
some 67 million people from the three northern provinces of
Mozambique, six districts of southern Tanzania, five counties of
Malawi and northern and eastern parts of Zambia.

<HEADLINE> SADC States to Face Food Shortage: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) are likely to face a serious
food shortage following a deficit of 2.2 million tons of cereal,
according to a latest survey by the SADC Regional Early Warning
Unit.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the regional cereal requirement for this
year stands at 28 millions tons, up from last year's 25.83 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
The current deficit of some 2.2 million tons is higher than
that of 1997/ 98's shortfall of 1.83 million, sending signals to
SADC member countries to be on the alert for shortages of food.
</P>
<P>
Famine is predicted in at least one SADC country, Angola, where
food production has been severely curtailed by the prolonged civil
war.
</P>
<P>
Cereal shortage in SADC countries are usually caused by
drought, and in the previous protracted dry period, the region was
saved only by substantial donor funding and the availability of an
abundant South African maize crop.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, once the other major SADC maize exporter, is now on
the list of maize-importing countries.
</P>
<P>
The last drought ended in most SADC countries three years ago.
The current cereal shortage has been caused by this season's
incessant rains, which affected not only the crop growth of nearly
all cereals, but also undermined the efficient applications of
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will have an estimated maize harvest of 6.39
million tons, a 15-percent drop compared with last year's harvest
of 7.4 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Accepts G8 General Principles on Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic expressed Friday in Belgrade willingness to accept the
general principles of the Group of Eight (G8) on a political
solution to the Kosovo conflict, the Yugoslav newspaper Politika
Daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic made his stance clear following hours of talks with
visiting Russian Balkan envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Milosevic as saying that his country would
like to accept the general principles that were hammered out by
the G8 on May 6 in Bonn and the relevant resolutions passed by the
UN Security Council in accordance with the UN Charter.
</P>
<P>
The G8 general principles include an immediate end to violence
in Kosovo, the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from the province,
the deployment of an international civilian and security presence
which would be authorized by the United Nations, the establishment
of an interim administration, a safe return of the refugees and
the demilitarization of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that in order to solve the Kosovo crisis,
which emerged as the mostly ethnic Albanians populated southern
Serbian province Kosovo began to seek independence years ago and
was worsened by NATO's over-60-day bombings, the first things
first was to submit the issue to the UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
To keep intact the sovereignty and territory of Yugoslavia has
been the ultimate wish of Yugoslavia and the international
community, he said.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing to do at present was to get right as
soon as possible the situation in the region and guarantee safe
return of the refugees, he added.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic stressed that the Kosovo conflict ought to be settled
through political dialogues and on the basis of putting all
nationalities in the province on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
According to Itar-Tass, Yugoslav Ambassador to Russia Borislav
Milosevic told a news conference on Friday in Moscow that the
peace talks would make progress provided that NATO stopped
bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country accepted the G8 general principles as
the basis of negotiations and okayed the UN peacekeeping mission
in Kosovo, but the formation of the forces and the time of
deployment needed to be discussed.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Team in Uganda to Discuss Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A team of six people from the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in Uganda to discuss with
officials here the implementation of the peace accord between the
two countries signed in Sirte, Libya, last month.
</P>
<P>
DRC Ambassador to Uganda Isabelle Iboula told Xinhua in a
telephone interview Saturday morning that the team is spearheaded
by Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo.
</P>
<P>
"A team has arrived here and they are discussing matters of
common concern with Ugandan officials. But I am not authorized to
comment on their mission," she said.
</P>
<P>
A report run in Saturday's Monitor daily in Uganda said that
the team is aimed at pressing ahead with the pact signed by DRC
President Laurent Kabila and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in
Sirte, Libya, on April 18.
</P>
<P>
The accord called for the immediate cessation of hostilities,
the withdrawal of foreign troops from DRC and the deployment of
neutral African peace-keeping forces in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda, however, played down the accord after it was
signed.
</P>
<P>
Another report said that Rwanda has declared a unilateral
cease-fire in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The 10-month-long armed conflict has sucked in troops and
militiamen from seven other countries. Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia
and Chad are said to be fighting along with the DRC government
troops while Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi allegedly back the Tutsi
rebels trying to topple Kabila.

<HEADLINE> NZ Farmers Plan Lamb Trade Protest Action Against U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand farmers say they
will mount protests in Wellington and Auckland next week over the
bid by their American counterparts to restrict imports of New
Zealand and Australian lamb.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) Saturday quoted a NZ
Federated Farmers spokesman as saying that he wasn't in a position
to say what form the protests aimed at U.S. diplomats in
Wellington would take. He declined to speculate on whether they
would involve a mob of sheep being released into the grounds of
the U.S. Embassy in Wellington, or a mass gathering of farmers at
its gates.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Thomas, president of the Taranaki region of the Federated
Farmers, was said to have urged farmers in his region to support
"demonstrations" next week outside the U.S. Embassy in Wellington
and the U.S. Consulate in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
If U.S. President Bill Clinton brings in tariffs and quota
restrictions against the imports of New Zealand and Australian
lamb, "in my view, he'll be a typical American -- says something
and does the opposite. Where is the free trade he's always talking
about?" Thomas was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Bailey, national president of the Federated Farmers,
said that New Zealand is staring down the barrel of tariffs and
quota restrictions that could destroy NZ lamb exports worth 130
million NZ dollars (70 million U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
"Protest action is the last chance to make an impact on Mr.
Clinton," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the United States International
Trade Commission (ITC) recommended a range of measures to "protect
the U.S. sheep meat industry", including a tariff of around 20
percent on all lamb imports on 1998 level and a quantitative
restriction of 52 million pounds. President Clinton will decide by
the end of next week on the ITC proposal for tariffs to be used
against New Zealand and Australia, which supply most of the U.S.
lamb imports.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Declares Unilateral Cease-fire in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has declared
a unilateral cease-fire in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
where it has deployed thousands of troops in support of DRC
rebels, Kampala-based New Vision newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda has decided to declare a unilateral cessation of
hostilities with effect from midnight," Rwandan Foreign Minister
Amri Sued was quoted as saying in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for all parties involved in the 10-month-long
armed conflict to create an atmosphere and give peace a chance,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan minister stressed that the cessation of
hostilities, if it is to be effective, would have to be respected
by all the parties to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Since the eruption of the conflict in early last August, Rwanda
has provided vital military and logistic support to the Tutsi
rebels determined to oust DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has deployed troops inside the DRC to allegedly ensure
the safety of its borders. It has accused Kabila of making common
cause with Hutu hard liners responsible for the 1994 genocide of
minority Tutsis and Hutu moderates.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's government has accused Rwanda and Uganda of supporting
the DRC rebels. Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Chad have sent
troops to help Kabila fight against the rebels. But reportedly,
the Chadian troops have begun to withdraw from the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Parliament Urged to Pass Amnesty Bill for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese lawmaker has urged the
parliament to endorse a bill bestowing amnesty to members of the
pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) in light of the militia's
imminent withdrawal from the Christian town of Jezzine in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The young men who were forced to work with the South Lebanon
Army are concerned about their fate after a withdrawal. These men
were either forced to work for the SLA or had to work for
financial reasons," The Daily Star Saturday quoted Jezzine Deputy
Nadim Salem as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jezzine, just north of Israel's self-declared security zone in
south Lebanon, has been policed by the SLA since 1985, the year
Israel set up the border zone with the claimed aim of protecting
its north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Due to rising casualties suffered in Hezbollah's intensified
bombing ambushes around the town, the 2,500-strong militia's
commander Maj. Gen. Antoine Lahd this week decided to withdraw
his 170-man garrison from Jezzine into the Israeli occupied
border enclave.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, a Shiite Muslim group, is leading a
guerrilla war to oust Israeli troops and its proxy SLA out of the
country. It gets financial and political support from both Syria
and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The militia's imminent pullback, which has not formally
started, fueled fears in Jezzine of possible reprisal killings
against the suspected SLA members or Israeli collaborators who
would choose to stay on in the town after the militia's departure.
</P>
<P>
The Jezzine deputy said that the people in Jezzine were "upset
and terrified" at the recent developments in the area, hoping the
parliament to pass the amnesty bill as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hezbollah's deputies presented the parliament a
draft bill to grant SLA fighters amnesty if they defect within
three months after the bill is endorsed.
</P>
<P>
But the bill has been on hold ever since, despite frequent
demands by lawmakers for its ratification.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Visits Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
Saturday left here for Amman for the first official visit to
Jordan by a Lebanese head of state in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
His visit came on the heel of a visit by Jordanian King
Abdullah to Syria last month through which the long-time
lukewarm ties between Syria and Jordan have been warmed up.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Jordan, Lebanon and Syria cooled after late
Jordanian King Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in
1994 when Lebanon and Syria are technically still at war
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon follows the foreign policy lead of Syria which
stations some 35,000 troops in Lebanon ostensibly as
peacekeepers to prevent the reignition of the 1975-1990 civil
war.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit, Lahoud will hold talks with King
Abdullah on bilateral ties and regional affairs, especially the
chances of Middle East peace following the election of Labor
leader Ehud Barak's as Israeli prime minister this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Libyan troops who have arrived in
Uganda will not be deployed between Ugandan troops and the
government troops of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
Uganda's leading daily "the New Vision" reported Saturday
</P>
<P>
The Libyan troops would go back home, Ugandan State Minister of
Defense Steven Kavuma was quoted as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
There were a series of agreements reached on the DRC issue and
the Libyan accord, signed by DRC President Laurent Kabila and
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in Sirte, Libya, last month,
should not be implemented in isolation, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Amama Mbabazi, State Minister for Regional Cooperation, told
the paper Friday night that there has to be a cessation of
hostilities before a cease- fire and that modalities are yet to be
worked out concerning the status of the neutral African
peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newspaper said that it received a faxed
statement from Libyan People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation saying that the Libyan troops had
already been positioned between Ugandan and DRC troops as planned.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian FM: China's Restraint Calms Region's Trouble Spots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China's restraint in dealing
with disputes with its regional neighbors has contributed in
containing them from exploding into aggressive conflicts,
Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said.
</P>
<P>
"The restraint that China has shown so far has created an
environment that enables discussions to be the methodology in
resolving differences and issues in the region," he told Bernama
news agency Saturday in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of
the establishment of diplomatic relations between Malaysia and
China.
</P>
<P>
He said various confidence-building measures undertaken had
also contributed in ensuring that regional peace and stability
would not be at any time jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said: "Peace, stability and the future of this area
would very much be dependent on ourselves. We must build the
necessary building blocks to achieve it rather than inviting a
third party to interfere in our regional affairs."
</P>
<P>
He said with its more than one billion population and
tremendous economic potentials, China was definitely a country to
be reckoned with as developments there would have an impact and
ramifications on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
"That is why I think that at the end of it, China has to be
brought into the World Trade Organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said while there were similarities, Malaysia and China
operated on different systems.
</P>
<P>
"In certain principle issues our views seem to coincide. One of
the most important views that we hold is that a country should be
allowed to evolve and mold its own system, its own way of
governing," he said. "There cannot be standardization in the world
whether in terms of human rights or democracy because there are
different shades of color to democracy that one needs to
understand."
</P>
<P>
On his May 30-June 3 visit to China, Syed Hamid said it was
part of a collaborative effort by the Malaysian government to
further deepen and expand bilateral relations after 25 years.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be an opportunity to underline the closeness
in the relations and to update each other on developments
pertaining to matters involving the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said Sino-Malaysian relations grew over the years
with frequent visits at the highest level as well as by ministers
and members of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia has always considered China as a country which cannot
be ignored and must be brought into engagement to enable it to
become an effective and meaningful player in the regional and
international stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a joint statement on a framework for future bilateral
cooperation would be issued during the visit covering areas like
economic, social, political, cultural and trade and investment.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A 50-year-old man living in
Cape Town, legislative capital of South Africa, was arrested
Friday at his residence after he was found to have made phone call
threats to kill Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, police said.
</P>
<P>
The arrested man last week made five calls in which the life of
Mbeki was threatened, the Citizen newspaper Saturday quoted police

</P>
<P>
Mbeki, also chairman of the ruling African National Congress,

of state after the general elections set for June 2.
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman declined to identify the arrested man,
saying it could jeopardize investigation.
</P>
<P>
However, Mbeki's office said Friday that the arrest would send
a clear message to those who planned such heinous deeds that they
would face the full might of the law.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A 200 million yuan project to upgrade
the highway leading to the world's highest airport in the Tibet
has been completed, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The Bangda Airport, in Changdu Prefecture, at an elevation of
over 4,000 meters, is part of a transprovincial highway from Tibet
to the neighboring Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Now, passenger buses can easily reach the airport in three
hours over the asphalted road.
</P>
<P>
The 136-kilometer-long road, built in 1953, had been in a very
poor condition and very dangerous for vehicles as traffic was
often blocked with mud slides and collapses.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, when the airport was put into use, the road had
been under greater pressure due to the increasing amount of goods
and passengers.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has three civilian airports, with the other two located
in Lhasa, the regional capital, and Shigaze, the second largest
city in this southwest China autonomous region.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Abuja Bracing Up for a New Start </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
ABUJA, May 29 (Xinhua) - With the arrival of the distinguished
guests and many jubilant events launched in Abuja Friday, the
hill-surrounded Nigerian capital is in full gear for the historic
event of hand-over.
</P>
<P>
Eagles Square, the main venue of the May 29 ceremony, on which
the Head of State Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar will hand over his
power to the civilian administration of the President-elect
Olusegun Obasanjo has finished its final decoration.
</P>
<P>
The square is under strict security guard and a bullet-proof
glass screen had been set up to keep the dignitaries from possible
attacks.
</P>
<P>
With a population of less than 300,000, the Federal Capital
Territory, where Abuja is located, suddenly found itself immerged
in a flood of visitors, among whom about 30 heads of state or
government have been confirmed for participation.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing Head of State Gen. Abubakar and incoming President
Obasanjo have spent almost the whole day receiving foreign
dignitaries at Abuja airport, about 40 kilometers from the city.
</P>
<P>
S. African President Nelson Mandela, British Prince Charles and
U.S. Human Rights Envoy Jesse Jackson are among those expected to
attend the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Fleets of cars stopped at the "City Gate" of Abuja by turns,
while Minister of Federal Capital Territory and Mayor of Abuja M.
T. Kontagora presented "golden keys" to the guests.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the Friday morning, Abubakar gave the first "golden
key" to his successor President-elect Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Chinese State Councillor Ismail Amat representing Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, also jetted in Abuja around noon Friday
from Lagos, the country's commercial capital, after a one-day stop
there.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar immediately held talks with Amat in a conference
chamber at the airport's waiting hall. The state councillor
conveyed to him a letter from Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
May 29 is also a day of solemn as well as jubilant
celebrations. A national prayer is to be held in the afternoon in
Abuja's central mosque and various cultural displays and a
splendid firework show will also take place when night falls.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian people have plenty of reasons to be jubilant, at a
time they can bid farewell to the past and hopefully could get a
better future.
</P>
<P>
"I hope our life could be a little bit different with the
coming of civilian rule," said a taxi driver at the Abuja
International Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
In a farewell address broadcast nationwide Friday evening, Gen.
 Abubakar called on the armed forces to go back to the barracks
and concentrate on its professionalization.
</P>
<P>
The military's rule, accounting for 29 out of the 39 years
after Nigeria' s independence, are blamed from time to time by the
international community and critics at home for the country's
economic down-turn.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has slid from among the world's top 50 richest
countries to the poorest 30 over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
The cheap price of oil on the world market made the country's
economic situation even worse last year, with its foreign reserve
hitting the record low and federal deficit record high.
</P>
<P>
Rampant corruption, high population growth rate and ethnic
conflicts, especially in the oil-rich Delta State have also
hindered Nigeria's economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Despite many challenges he must address, President-elect
Obasanjo has shown his confidence and determination on many
occasions that Nigeria should and can undertake the leadership on
African continent by starting reforming and rehabilitating its
battered economy and inefficient governance.
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, May 29 could be a start for Nigeria to make a real
difference, said many foreign visitors at a party in Abuja's Nicon
Hilton Hotel.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has said that the government is working hard to improve the
economic situation in the southern African country by initiating
positive and enabling policies.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said this Friday at the 47th Copperbelt Agriculture and
 Commercial Show in Kitwe, in Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Saturday quoted him as saying that
the government needed the backing of every Zambian to help it
broaden the industrial base of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"I realize that industry and commerce are going through a
torrid time at present with the lack of money, the high inflation
rate and the depreciation of (local currency) kwacha against other
currencies," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the president noted that it was his government's duty
to arrest the trend and turn on a positive line of production and
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said there were good signs that Zambia had been well
received at the Consultative Group meeting in Paris, in which the
government gets a total of 630 million U.S. dollars aid pledges.
</P>
<P>
The president observed that the government's intention is to
remove duty on some imported agricultural machinery in line with
this year's budget to assist farmers to reinvest in production
equipment.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government's long term objective is to have a
strong agricultural and agro-processing industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We can feed ourselves from our own resources and we must
appreciate that farming is a business not a hobby and it should be
treated as such by all Zambians," the president stressed.

LHASA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- For ten years, a stele bearing the
words "I have the taliman" has stood at the foot of the tallest
peak of the Himalayas to tell visitors that the Qomolangma (Mt.
Everest) Peak Nature Reserve in the Tibet Autonomous Region is
protected by the State.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the central government and foreign donors,
this third-largest nature reserve in China, which covers over 33,
900 square kilometers, has created a scientific protective system
and maintained biological balance and a sound environment.
</P>
<P>
Duojie, an official from the reserve administration, told
Xinhua that snow leopards, Tibetan wild donkeys, long-tail monkeys,
antelopes and a variety of rare birds have been found in the area.
</P>
<P>
Several foreign expeditions have called the area one of the ten
best in the world, featuring snowy mountains, meadows, shrubbery,
forests, and subtropical plants, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
"The biological environment of the area has maintained its
primitive form with all the wild animals well protected," he said.
Antelopes and wild donkeys often visit local herdsmen for food.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, local authorities have made protective
efforts including setting up checkpoints and erecting signs and
steles asking visitors to abide by all regulations.
</P>
<P>
Special teams have been established to prevent fire, robbery,
and illegal logging and hunting, while local villagers have been
mobilized to plant trees.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, local people have cleaned up more than
400 tons of waste left behind by visitors.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that over 6,000 mountaineers,
expeditions, and tourists visit the nature reserve annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to impose
restrictions on the exploitation of eight mineral resources by
halting or sharply cutting the issuing of new mining licenses, the
Ministry of Land and Resources announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The eight minerals are rare earth, wolfram, tin, stibium, coal,
molybdenum, barite and fluorite.
</P>
<P>
"In the recent period, the mining capacity and the actual
production of these minerals in China have far exceeded the market
demand, causing a heavy waste of resources and serious
environmental problems," said a ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
To change the current situation, he said, the Land and
Resources Ministry has decided to halt its approval of any new
projects on the exploitation of rare earth, wolfram, tin and
stibium from now until the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
During the same period of time, the ministry will also stop
issuing licenses to any new small or medium-sized miners of coal,
molybdenum, barite and fluorite, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry has also required relevant departments across the
country to step up their efforts to help local licensed miners of
the eight minerals to improve mining efficiency and protect the
ecological environment," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Denies Proposing to Change Amnesty Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki Friday denied reports that he intended to review
amnesty legislation.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to recent press reports in this regard, Mbeki said he
never suggested this.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Mbeki asked Justice Minister Dullah Omar
to consider changes to amnesty laws so that former soldiers of the
old South African Defense Force, who were involved in violence in
KwaZulu-Natal and members of political parties could get amnesty
without having to apply as individuals.
</P>
<P>
"The Office of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki has noted the
recent press reports on his alleged intention to review amnesty
legislation. The deputy president never suggested anything of this
sort," a statement from his office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Mbeki stood by his speech in Parliament
during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission debate on February
25 that the "idea of general amnesty should never be entertained".
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mbeki also said South Africans should, however,
not allow themselves to be drawn into a situation of conflict as a
result of the political crimes of the past.
</P>
<P>
"The office of the deputy president wishes to point out that
the sentiments expressed in his February 25 speech remains the
position adopted and forms the basis of the referral of all the
issues... to the Justice Ministry to look into," Mbeki's office
said.
</P>
<P>
The issues sent to the justice department pertain to the
special problem of KwaZulu-Natal, the problem of former security
force members who did not apply for amnesty because the leaders of
the former government failed to accept political responsibility
and amnesty on an equal basis for political organizations engaged
in the struggle.

WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield and Lennox
Lewis will fight a rematch for the undisputed heavyweight title in
Las Vegas in November, but when and where still remains to be
decided.
</P>
<P>
A new deal between boxing promoter Don King and a major casino

</P>
<P>
King and Park Place Entertainment Corp. announced earlier this
week that they have agreed to an 18-fight deal that includes the
Holyfield-Lewis rematch.
</P>
<P>
If casino officials in Las Vegas have their way, the rematch
would be on November 6, which is seen as a better tourism weekend

</P>
<P>
But HBO, which will televise it via pay-per-view on its TVKO
network, wants it on November 13 and has already tentatively

<HEADLINE> Canada Seeking Public Support on Taxation on Australian Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Government of Canada is seeking
public support on an imposition of heavy surtax on certain
Australian imports, if Australia does not lift its 24-year-old ban
on imports of fresh, chilled and frozen salmon by July 6, 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to a release issued Friday by Department of Foreign
Affairs and International Trade, Canadians are being asked to
comment on the list of products that might be subjected to surtax.
The list will be published in the Canada Gazette on May 29, 1999,
and comments are requested by June 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998, a World Trade Organization(WTO) panel ruled that
Australia's ban was scientifically unjustified and discriminatory,
and contrary to Austrlia's international trade obligations. An
Australian appeal to the WTO Appellate Body failed. In February
1999, a WTO arbitrator gave Australia until July 6, 1999, to
implement the WTO rulings, said the release.
</P>
<P>
"To date, Australia has shown no sign of lifting the ban," said
Canadian International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi. "That is why
we are preparing to defend Canadian interests and why we are
consulting with the public on building a list of imported products
that could be taxed."
</P>
<P>
If Australia fails to implement the WTO ruling on July 6, WTO
rules allow Australia to negotiate compensation with Canada as an
interim arrangement until it brings its measure into compliance
with the rulings.
</P>
<P>
If an agreement on compensation cannot be reached, the canadian
government will ask the WTO to allow Canada to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
Upon receiving the WTO's authorization to retaliate, the
government will select certain imported products from the list it
published in the Canada Gazette and impose a surtax of 100 percent
above existing customs duties on the items in question, said the
release.
</P>
<P>
Australia's ban was first introduced in 1975 after Australia
alleged that imports of fresh, chilled and frozen salmon presented
a health risk to Australia's salmon population. After years of
unsuccessful bilateral efforts to settle the dispute, the WTO
Dispute Settlement Body established a panel on April 10, 1997, at
Canada's request.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export Earnings Fall 9.89 Pc Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The export earnings of Bangladesh
fell short of target by 9.89 percent during the first nine months
of the current July 1998-June 1999 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Only the ready-made garments and tea sectors managed to achieve
their targets in the period, The Daily Star Business Saturday
quoted sources in the Export Promotion Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the failure to reach the target to the decline
in export earnings from major traditional items.
</P>
<P>
Among the major traditional items, frozen food fell 23.02
percent short of target, leather 26.5 percent and knitwear 16.71
percent. Earnings from other traditional items such agricultural
goods, petroleum by-products, raw jute and jute goods also fell
compared to the performance in the same period of the previous
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In the July-March period of the fiscal year, the country earned
3.8 U.S. billion dollars against the target of 4.2 billion
dollars. The total export target for the fiscal year was fixed at
5.63 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings, however, posted a 1.07 percent growth over
that of last fiscal year's corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Of the total volume of export earnings, 55.87 percent came from
the ready-made garments sector, which earned nearly 2.13 billion
dollars, 2.84 percent higher than the target.
</P>
<P>
The country earned 36.36 million dollars by exporting 2.134
million kilograms of tea, 15.43 percent higher than the target.
</P>
<P>
Around 35.44 percent of the country's total export items went
to the United States during the period.
</P>
<P>
The other major countries importing goods from Bangladesh were
Germany, Britain, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Iran,
Japan and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Undertakes Nation-wide Census of Agent Orange Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam decided to undertake next
month a nation-wide census of Agent Orange victims, Vietnam's
English daily Vietnam News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The results of the census are intended to be used by the
Vietnamese government to work out more relevant policies for the
well-being of victims, and to call for stronger support from
domestic organizations and international assistance for victims.
</P>
<P>
During the Vietnam war, the Americans sprayed 42 million liters
of toxic chemicals, most of it Agent Orange, said Vietnam News,
adding that the victims include people who lived and worked in
areas sprayed between 1961 and 1971 southwards of the 17th
parallel.
</P>
<P>
Congenital deformity and disability caused by exposure to the
toxic chemical during the war can be found even in the second
generation of people directly exposed to it, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
Its effects on humans include cancer and skin disease, as well
as congenital deformities and disabilities, while causing
widespread environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and
Social Affairs believe more victims now live in Vietnam's central
and northern provinces than the south, with some families in
central Vietnam having three to five affected children.
</P>
<P>
The census will be implemented in all the 10,300 villages in
the country and be completed by July, an official of Vietnam's
Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs said.

damages to normal body cells.
</P>
<P>
In a study published in the May issue of Agricultural Research,
a magazine run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the
researchers said the soybean extract contained an active compound,
phytochemical complex 100 (PCC 100), that has chemicals known as
saponins.
</P>
<P>
According to laboratory tests, PCC contained in leftovers from
soybean oil and protein extraction, can suppress growth rates of
cancer cells. In addition, soy protein was found to reduce the
growth rate of human colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
While some natural and synthetic chemicals disrupt DNA and
sometimes result in malignancies, scientists say, other compounds
in daily food supply help protect against irreversible DNA damage.
In preliminary studies, mice fed certain PCC components for two
weeks were protected from cell damage.
</P>
<P>
The soy protein finding did not come as a surprise, said the
researchers, because previous documented studies have shown that
soy-derived isoflavones have positive anti-cancer effects. But the
still-evolving technique may allow scientists to more precisely
identify the specific protein agents and the anti-cancer
mechanisms that are involved.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Chinese scientist Yang Zhenhua announced in Los
Angeles that a non-toxic, low-molecule-weight compound named SBA
had been isolated from a fermented soybean product. The compound
has demonstrated promising anti-cancer effects in a series of
preliminary studies. She found SBA after isolating isoflavones
from the fermented soybean product.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Spends 39 Mln Dollars on Safe Drinking Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has spent
2,533 million (39 million U.S. dollars) last year towards
achieving the goal of "safe drinking water for all by the year
2010," officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During last year 66 percent of the population had access to
safe drinking water, an official with the National Water Supply
and Drainage Board (NWS&AMP;DB) said.
</P>
<P>
The NWS&AMP;DB has given 47,694 new connections last year and half
of that were given to rural people.
</P>
<P>
It plans to provide over 40,000 connections this year and its
capital investment will be around 3 billion rupees (43 million
dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
In urban areas 90 percent of the population have access to safe
drinking water while in the rural areas only 57 percent enjoy this
facility, the official said.
</P>
<P>
This emphasizes the need for further expansion of water supply
facilities in rural areas in order to improve the hygienic
conditions of the rural population.
</P>
<P>
The demand for a reliable supply of pipe-borne water is growing
rapidly due to the expansion in population as well as due to the
escalating demand from the commercial and industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Presidential Task Force on Housing and Urban
Development emphasized that the annual investment in the water
supply sector has to be increased by about three times the present
level to meet the present demand for safe drinking water.
</P>
<P>
During last year, NWS&AMP;DB produced over 297 million cubic meters
of water and managed 276 water supply schemes.

<P>
QUITO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador claimed it lost legally a
total of 14,121 square kilometers of land by the final demarcation
of its border with Peru, according to a report by the Military
Geographical Institute (IGM) published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's new territorial extension is 256,549 square
kilometers, said the IGM report, which has been presented to the
foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry has already received two sketches of the
new Ecuador map with the international border with Peru: a
physical and a political one.
</P>
<P>
Under earlier agreements between the two countries, the
territorial extension of Ecuador is 270,670 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official explained that in those agreements
the 270,670 square kilometers is considered the Ecuadorian
international border with Peru beyond the El Condor mountain range,
and toward the east up to the Santiago River.
</P>
<P>
These agreements are still in force, but will have to be
substituted with a new one, he said.

BUCHAREST -- Romania on Friday paid on due term the whole

The payment was made by BNR, out of the state's hard currency

<P>
SEOUL, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from the United
States, South Korean and Japan met here Saturday morning to
discuss the result of U.S. special envoy William Perry's four-day
visit to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The three sides focused their discussion on DPRK's response to
a comprehensive package deal jointly made by the three nations
which urged the DPRK to abandon its development program of nuclear
weapons in exchange for extensive economic aid and diplomatic
recognition by the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The package deal is said including dismantlement of U.S.
economic sanctions against Pyongyang, economic cooperation to
improve DPRK's agricultural productivity, diplomatic normalization
with Washington and Tokyo, a promise of guaranteeing current
DPRK's political system.
</P>
<P>
Perry, former U.S. defense secretary, who arrived here Friday
night from the DPRK and met South Korean Unification Minister Lim
Dong-won and Policy Director of Japanese Foreign Ministry Kato
Ryozo Saturday morning, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Pyongyang, Perry, who was the ever highest-
ranking U.S. official to travel to Pyongyang, transferred a
personal letter from U.S. President Bill Clinton to DPRK top
leader Kim Jong-il. Perry also reportedly met senior DPRK
officials.
</P>
<P>
While the DPRK's response remains unavailable, South Korea's
media gave various reports and analysis on Perry's visit,
indicating that DPRK leaders will accept Perry's package deal for

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Looks Abroad to Rise Funds For Sports Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The National Sports Council (KONI)
will help promote Indonesian sports in the international arena as
part of efforts to raise funds for sports development in the
country, The Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Arie Sudewo, KONI deputy chairman, said that the council would
cooperate with business-people and sports federations, which have
proven capabilities dealing with international sports bodies.
</P>
<P>
He said details of the agreement between KONI and the sports
federations had not been decided. He also did not disclose when
the arrangements would commence.
</P>
<P>
"KONI will be the center for the national sports industry.
Sports will become a marketable commodity, but we will need the
federations' help to make the scheme a success," said Arie, a
retired Army lieutenant general.
</P>
<P>
One of the objectives is to enable the council to serve as a
promoter of tournaments featuring the world's leading athletes.
</P>
<P>
"We could invite overseas soccer teams, for example, to play at
Senayan stadium (in Jakarta). I'm sure it will attract many
spectators," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arie said the council would not meddle with the sports bodies'
primary task of grooming athletes, finding sponsors and paving the
way for athletes to start professional careers.
</P>
<P>
"If we can sell our sports for money to be used to train
athletes and improve their welfare, I think they would gradually
become professionals," he said.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will be internally supervised by KONI officials in
charge of business, media and promotion affairs.
</P>
<P>
Arie also said KONI would give its support to any sports bodies
which planned to hire foreign coaches.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, permission would be given only to sports
federations whose athletes could win medals in international
sports events such as the Southeast Asian Games and the Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
He said that instead of importing coaches, KONI hoped to
develop national coaches and promote them to the regional and
international sports community.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has so far exported three badminton coaches who
formerly played for the national team. The three are Indra Widjaya,
Atik Djauhari and Ardy B. Wiranata.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's First Oil Waste Processing Center Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's first oil waste
processing center was inaugurated by Environment Minister
Panangian Siregar in Batam on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The facility is owned by PT Karimum Sembawang Shipyard (KSS)
and its partner Singapore Cleanseas Pte Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"We should increase the awareness about waste production by
some industries to reduce its potential danger to the public,"
Siregar said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the government had issued a new regulation
on procedures to dispose of industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
Although its waste processing capacity was limited, both in
quantity and quality, the oil waste processing center was expected
to contribute significantly to the creation of an environment that
was free from dangerous waste, the minister was quoted by Antara
News Agency Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The center has a capacity to hold 30 tons of oil waste (brought
by tankers along with oil) a day.
</P>
<P>
In a month, an average of four tankers enter the shipyard, but
with the existence of the waste processing center, the number is
expected to increase to six tankers a month.
</P>
<P>
KSS shipyard was inaugurated by former president Soeharto on
March 17, 1997. It is a joint venture between Singapore's
Sembawang Group and Indonesia's Salim Group.
</P>
<P>
General manager of Singapore Cleanseas Seah Khen Hee said the
center would use a waste processing method which only left one
percent of the waste while the rest was turned into a raw material
to make bricks.
</P>
<P>
"Some 40 percent of the waste is usually lubricating oil, 30
percent water and 30 percent solid waste. The solid waste is
processed into raw material for bricks," Hee said.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana confirmed Friday he had canceled his trip to
Mexico for attending the 13th Summit of Rio.
</P>
<P>
The president suspended his planned trip to decide on the
appointment of a new defense minister, after former Defense
Minister Rodrigo Lloreda's resignation last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen generals and more than 100 officers announced their
resignation last Wednesday after Lloreda resigned.
</P>
<P>
President Pastrana will attend a meeting of armed force
commanders on Friday at the Tolemaida base, in Bogota's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto and businessman
Nicanor Restrepo Santamaria, one of the government's negotiators
with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), are among
the possible candidates for the defense portfolio.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the history of the armed forces that
a president summons the heads of the armed forces to take
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Commander General Fernando Tapias, who Thursday night assumed
as acting defense minister, will hold talks with the resigned
generals and ask them to remain in the military service.
</P>
<P>
However, only five of the 16 resigned generals of divisions and
brigades will attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said this is the first serious crisis of
Pastrana's nine-month-old government.
</P>
<P>
Lloreda resigned Wednesday after stepping up his criticism of
the government's concessions to the rebel group, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
President Pastrana ordered all government troops out of an area
of 42,000 square kilometers in November, ceding it to FARC in
order to bolster peace talks and ease a conflict that has claimed
more than 35,000 lives over the last decade.

<HEADLINE> IMF Official Optimistic of World Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary Fund (IMF)
representative in Peru Andrew Wolfe said that there is optimism
about the future of the world economy after the first five months
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Wolfe said that global production will grow 2.3 percent in 1999,
and next year 3.4 percent. This economic improvement was not
noticed at the end of 1998, and even three months ago the
situation was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
The economist was quoted Friday by the press that the emerging
economies will improve this year, according to the financial
markets conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said that a recovery of the capitals inflow of two billion
dollars will be registered in Latin America in the next months.
</P>
<P>
The roots of this optimism are in the last 1998 quarter. Most
of the developed countries central banks caused the reduction of
the interest rate to improve world liquidity, said Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
Wolfe said that the good perspectives are founded in the fact
that the United States economy continues advancing, at the same
time that Japan announces new measures to purify and restructure
its banking system, with more tax stimuli.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Brazilian situation is much better than what
had been forecast, because of the recovery of its production, the
stabilization of its exchange markets, which are reflected by the
successful sale of its bonds in the world markets.
</P>
<P>
The Asian economies recovery also helped, especially those of
Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia, and by the advance
of the dialogue between Russia's creditors and its government.
</P>
<P>
However, Wolfe also revealed latent risks for the forecasts,
such as that the United States Federal Reserve might increase the
rates of interest for a soft landing of its economy.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Says U.S. Won't Push for Ground War in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said on Friday that the U.S. will stick to NATO's air-only
military strategy in Yugoslavia and not push the allies into
ground combat in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Cohen stressed that pushing the allies into adding ground
combat forces would risk fracturing NATO and undercutting support
for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Cohen was quoted by the Associated Press (AP) as telling a
group of reporters that he was increasingly confident that NATO
will prevail using air power alone.
</P>
<P>
"There is no consensus for a ground force," Cohen said, adding
that it would be unwise to start pressing for such a dramatic
shift in strategy if there is no assurance that all the allies
would go along.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said for the Clinton administration to press for a NATO
consensus on using ground combat troops would mean "you really
diffuse or in any way diminish the commitment to the air campaign.
"
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that evidence of that was the German reaction when
Britain proposed recently that ground forces might forcibly enter
Kosovo once the Serb army is worn down by more bombing.
</P>
<P>
Britain was not arguing for an all-out ground war, but the
suggestion prompted German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to declare
a ground campaign "unthinkable."
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman earlier on Friday told reporters that
Cohen met quietly with some of the allies on Thursday, at a
meeting of defense ministers from member countries of the European
Union in Bonn, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers affirmed NATO's air strategy and agreed
that the alliance should attack an ever-wider array of targets,
the spokesman said. Cohen's trip was not announced until his
return.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration strongly rejects the demands of
Greece, Russia and some Democrats in Congress for a pause in NATO
bombing, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
He said now is the time to apply maximum pressure on Milosevic,
as more strike aircraft join the battle and the weather improves.
</P>
<P>
"It is precisely the wrong time to be talking about a pause,"
Cohen said.

 Chinese FM Spokesman on Filipino Warship,
Cox Report
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is blamed for violating Chinese sovereignty
after its warship sank a Chinese vessel in Chinese waters,
according to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
 In response to a question about Cox's report on the so-called
espionage case, Zhu said at a regular press conference that this

States with ulterior motives and in essence an attempt to stir up
anti-China feelings and divert people's attention.

Some Americans are sticking to the Cold War mentality and are
making a great effort to dream up stories about China's spying on

<HEADLINE> Rio Group Urged to Repudiate NATO Bombing of Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Legislators, scholars and human
rights defenders, among other Mexicans, urged the heads of state
and of government of the Group of Rio to make a statement against
the ongoing Balkan conflict, local media reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The demand was published during the seminar named "Toward a
negotiated and peaceful solution to the conflict in Yugoslavia,"
held here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the seminar called on the presidents, who will
get together here starting Friday night in the 13th Group of Rio
Summit, to urge an immediate stop of the bombings carried out by
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
They also asked the Rio Group to demand the NATO countries to
compensate for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) legislator Jorge Calderon
said that it would be fundamental for Mexico to facilitate a
special resolution of the Rio Group on immediate resumption of
direct negotiations between NATO and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Almeyra, a university professor and expert in
international law, warned that the only way to stop that NATO's "
adventurer action" in Yugoslavia is to intensify the international
movement of repudiation of the bombings.

<HEADLINE> Peso Expected to Weaken with Increasing Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso is seen to
weaken in the next few months as imports started to pick up due to
the expected increase in economic activity, the Philippine Star
newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"As the economy recovers from the Asian financial crisis,
domestic activity will correspondingly increase leading to higher
imports," Nonald Hanna, Goldman Sachs Executive Director for Asia
Economic Research, was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that payments for imports are seen to grow by 2.6
percent this year from a 17.5 percent drop a year ago, adding that
imports are seen to outpace exports next year, resulting in a
weakening of the peso.
</P>
<P>
"Exports (in the Philippines) would grow by 11.4 percent this
year, then by 10 percent in 2000 while imports will move up by
23.9 percent. There will be a weakening of the peso in the course
of these years," Hanna said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the continued inflows of capital from abroad
will help arrest the expected weakening of the peso in the
near-term.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Goldman Sachs expects the peso to
average at 38 to the dollar next month, and hit 40:1 level by
March 2000.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the peso closed at 38.105 against the greenback at
the local foreign exchange market.

<HEADLINE> NATO Launches Airstrikes From Hungary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TASZAR, Hungary, May 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. fighter planes have
launched bombing missions against Yugoslavia from Hungary's Taszar
Airbase, a press release of the airbase announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time NATO planes had carried out air raids
from Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The missions, ordered by U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen,
were aimed at reinforcing NATO's military strength in the Balkans,
the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Taszar Airbase is located some 60 kilometers north of the
Yugoslav border.
</P>
<P>
According to a Hungarian defense ministry spokesman, three U.S.
A-10 offensive planes had arrived at Taszar Airbase; another 18
will arrive in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
The American military planes came amid deep divisions among the
Hungarians over their country's involvement in NATO military
actions.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party Kovacs Laszlo said
Friday that next Monday he would submit to parliament a bill
banning NATO missions from Hungary.
</P>
<P>
"If the ruling party deputies are against this bill, they will
be responsible for all the consequences arising from the missions,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
On March 24, the Hungarian parliament approved NATO's
unconditional use of the country's airspace and airports.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 16 KC-135 aerial tankers are based at the Budapest
International Airport, and 24 F-18 fighter jets and three A-10
offensive planes are at the Taszar airbase.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Urges India, Pakistan to Show Restraint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine urged India and Pakistan on
Friday to practice restraint and not to take any hasty actions, so
as to avoid an escalation of the tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Friday by the foreign ministry,
Ukraine said it was concerned over the shooting down of two Indian
fighter planes by the Pakistani armed forces in a border conflict
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan said on Thursday it shot down two Indian Mig jet
fighters that "crossed into its territory" along the disputed
Kashmir border.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Information Minister Mushahid Hussain Thursday
confirmed the downing of the Indian jets at a special joint press
conference in Islamabad and said that the first jet was shot down
at 11:15 a.m. local time (0615 GMT) and the second at 11:35 a.m.
local time (0635 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The two jets, one Mig-21 and the other Mig-27, were targeted by
Pakistani ground fire in the second round of India's air
operations in the Line of Control (LoC) region. India said it
launched the air campaign Wednesday to dislodge Pakistan-backed
militants from the Indian side of the LoC. The first round of
Thursday's air operations was carried out in early Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The disputes between the two countries should be solved through
political means, the Ukraine foreign ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that it would be in the interest of world peace and
security that India and Pakistan unconditionally implement all the
relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, continue
their candid and constructive dialogue which had already begun,
and actively seek new ways for building up trust and stability in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine was willing to make positive efforts to seek a
political settlement of the disputes between India and Pakistan,
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Issues Bonds to Recapitalize Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government Friday
issued bonds worth 157.61 trillion rupiah (about 19.4 billion U.S.
dollars) to recapitalize 23 banks and fund its obligations to the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
It was the first tranche of bond issues created under the bank
recapitalization scheme, and will cost the state 351 trillion
rupiah (about 43.22 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Bambang Subianto said the bond issue was an
essential step in efforts to rebuild confidence in the banking
industry and the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"All this is expected to have a positive impact on the
restoration of the Indonesian economy," Subianto was quoted by
national newspapers Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government issued two types of bonds worth 103.831 trillion
rupiah (about 12.79 billion dollars) to recapitalize the 23 banks.
</P>
<P>
The first consists of floating-rate bonds worth 95.15 trillion
rupiah (about 11.72 billion dollars), with the interest rate
linked to Bank Indonesia's three-month Bank Indonesia Certificates
(SBI) promissory note rates and with a maximum maturity of 15
years from the date of issue.
</P>
<P>
The second consists of fixed-rate bonds worth 8.68 trillion
rupiah (about 1.07 billion dollars) also with a maximum maturity
of 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The 23 banks to be recapitalized with the proceeds from the
bonds consist of seven private banks included in the
recapitalization program, four banks taken over by the government
and 12 regional administration-owned banks.
</P>
<P>
The seven private banks are Bank Lippo, Bank Universal, Bank
Internasional Indonesia, Bank Prima Express, Bank Bukopin, Bank
Patriot and Bank Arta Media.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, the government provides up to 80 percent of
the funds needed to recapitalize the ailing banks. Bank owners
come up with the remainder.
</P>
<P>
Subianto said bond issues for state banks as well as other
nationalized banks will take place gradually this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the government planned to allow a secondary market for
the bonds but will have to wait until January 2000 because of
concerns over the so-called Y2K computer problem.

<HEADLINE> Sheringham Back to England Squad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United striker Teddy
Sheringham is back in the England squad for the crucial Euro 2000
qualifiers against Sweden and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
But there is no place in the party for Paul Ince, raising
questions about the Liverpool midfielder's international future
under manager Kevin Keegan.
</P>
<P>
Sheringham, who has been ignored by England since the World Cup,
forced his way back with stunning displays in the FA Cup and
European Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Keegan highly praised Sheringham for his performance in the
last two games. "He has been very influential, especially when he
has started, and has been part of a successful side," said Keegan.
</P>
<P>
"He thoroughly deserves to be in there and gives me options
which is what you need as a manager."
</P>
<P>
But Manchester United's treble success has not led Keegan to
select as many as eight of their players, as predicted.
</P>
<P>
Instead there are five of Alex Ferguson's team in the 22-man
squad, with no place for Gary Neville, who is said to be exhausted,
and midfielder Nicky Butt.
</P>
<P>
Ince is overlooked, despite being available again after missing
most of the international season through suspension following his
sending off against Sweden last autumn.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "He is disappointed as you would expect.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think there was no point taking him as I wouldn't
probably play him but the door is still open.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult because I know what it means to him to play
for England.
</P>
<P>
"I could have announced a squad of 24 or 25 and fudged it. No
player appreciates being left out and Paul is no exception."
</P>
<P>
Two newcomers for the friendly against Hungary, Leeds defender
Jonathon Woodgate and Sunderland wing-back Michael Gray, keep
their places.
</P>
<P>
Ipswich goalkeeper Richard Wright is also in the squad as third
choice behind David Seaman and Ian Walker.
</P>
<P>
Keegan added: "We proved against Poland that even when things
went against us during the week we went out and gave a great
performance.
</P>
<P>
"We are going out at Wembley in a game (against Sweden) we
can't afford to lose and I think we can keep it going. It is us to
keep it going."
</P>
<P>
Steve McManaman told Keegan he was not mentally prepared for
the games following the death of his mother.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham's Darren Anderton and Chris Armstrong were both due
to be named in Keegan's squad but were forced to pull out.
</P>
<P>
The club said in a statement that Anderton has been advised by
a specialist to take a complete rest after his first full season
back following a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong recently underwent surgery on an ankle injury.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD to Help Poor Countries Prepare for WTO Ministerial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will help the Least Developed
Countries (LDCs) prepare for the third ministerial conference of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) by organizing a workshop for
trade officials from 48 LDCs.
</P>
<P>
The workship, to be organized jointly with the UNCTAD and South
Africa on June 21-25, will enable LDCs to ensure that their
interests are properly recognized in the emerging consensus on
issues that fall with the parameters of the trade-development
nexus, said the UNCTAD in a press release here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD argues that these countries can contribute to
shaping a positive trade agenda by articulating their interests,
even they are in a weak multilateral bargaining position.
</P>
<P>
Specific proposals will be put forward with regard to the
implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements and negotiations o
the WTO's "built-in agenda" and the so-called "new issues", such
as competition and investment.
</P>
<P>
The LDC representatives, mainly trade ministers and trade
negotiators, are expected to formulate strategies for the WTO
conference to be held in Seattle, the United States from November
30 to December 3.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is part of the follow-up by UNCTAD and UNDP to the
High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiative for the Least
Developed Countries' Trade Development, held under WTO auspices in
Geneva in October 1997.

<HEADLINE> Macedonian PM Criticizes Indictment Against Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubko
Georgievski on Friday criticized the announcement by the Hague war
crime tribunal to indict Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic as
a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
He told the Macedonian television A1 that the indictment would
push Milosevic to the corner and make him to fight to the end.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian prime minister said that he was saddened with the
large-scale damage caused by NATO air strikes in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Even if peace was achieved in the end through continued air
strikes, it would bring about a grave infliction on Macedonia's
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides that, there could be a senario that Serb refugees flood
into Macedonia after ethnic Albanian refugees return home in
Kosovo, Georgievski said.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to believe that all the damage in Yugoslavia can be
repaired in just one or two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian prime minister said that there is an urgency to
resolve the Kosovo crisis as soon as possible and otherwise it
will drag on to the winter.
</P>
<P>
If the crisis is not solved quickly, a possible NATO ground war
will plunge the entire Balkan region into real danger and the
situation can run out of control, he warned.

<HEADLINE> Abubakar: China Is Nigeria's Genuine Friend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The out-going Nigerian Head of State
Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar said Friday that China is a genuine
friend of Nigeria and thanked China for its help in times of need.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the remarks when he met China's State Councillor,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's special envoy for Nigeria's power
hand-over, Ismail Amat, who arrived here Friday for Nigeria's
hand-over ceremony from military rule to a civilian government
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said at the airport building that he appreciated China's
consistent support to Nigeria, especially in the difficult
circumstances Nigeria has been experiencing during the last
decades, welcomed Ismail Amat and thanked President Jiang for
sending an envoy to come and attend the hand-over ceremony.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Ismail Amat, Abubakar expressed thanks
for the warm greetings and congratulations President Jiang has
given him via his special envoy.
</P>
<P>
He pleasantly recalled his talks with President Jiang and the
days spent in China during his state visit to China last year.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Chinese official, in turn, said that Nigeria and
China, two developing countries which share common interests, have
great potential and bright prospects in their future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Amat, who was met by Nigerian Foreign Minister I. C.
Olisemeka and other cabinet members, presented a letter from
President Jiang to Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Jiang said the Chinese government, as always, is
paying close attention to Nigeria's political program of
transferring power from the hands of the military to civilian
rule. The Chinese government and people are happy with Nigeria's
successful accomplishment of the program, which enjoys the support
of both Nigerian people and international community, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Ismail Amad arrived in Lagos, Nigeria's
commercial capital Thursday afternoon on his three-day visit to
the Africa's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Minister of the Federal Capital Territory and
Abuja's mayor Gen. M. T. Kontagora gave a golden key of the city
to Ismail Amat at Abuja's "City Gate" on the way to Nigeria's
capital.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Says Italy Pays High Price in Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
Friday night said that Italy was paying a high price for its
front-line role in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Italian south city of Palermo, D'Alema said that
"Italy is in the front line in the Kosovo war, we are paying a
very high price not only in economic terms or for the bombs in the
Adriatic or the refugees that reach our beaches across the
Adriatic, but we are also paying a psychological price because of
a feeling of concern."
</P>
<P>
D'Alema stressed the need to "arrive at peace" but added that
"we are aware of our responsibilities" to the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
"War is a hard responsibility, represented by the anguish of
seeing the planes of NATO, of which we are members, hitting
innocent people," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a war that is not aimed at conquest, at destroying or
defeating a country, but means to impose by force a just peace
that respects the human rights of people which Europe perhaps
watched too long and with too much cynicism," D'Alema added.

PARIS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- France was sceptical about the
announcement by Yugoslavia on Friday that it is ready to accept
the Group of Eight (G8) plan for solving the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
``These engagements should naturally be devoid of any
ambiguity, be confirmed and concretized,'' said French Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic met with Russian
presidential envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin in Belgrade on Friday and
he issued a communique promising to accept the ``general
principles'' of the G8 plan for solving the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
The G8 plan calls for the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from
Kosovo, the return of Kosovar refugees to their homes and the
deployment of an international security force in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON May 28 (Xinhua) - Most European stock markets ended the
last session of the week on a high note Friday, as Wall Street's
rally pulled bourses up from heavy losses earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Telecoms and drugs were the best performers throughout the
session due to strong gains in Deutsche Telekom and British Pharma
SmithKline Beecham.
</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE 100 index closed higher for the first time in six
days on Friday after a New York rally prompted a late session bout
of bargain-hunting.
</P>
<P>
By the close, the index had risen 26.7 points or 0.4 percent to
6226.2, having earlier been down by some 89 points in the wake of
the Dow's 235-point tumble on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Market turnover reached 937 million shares by the official 1630
London time end of trading, by which time the US blue chip and
broad-based S&AMP;P 500 indices were up 98 points and 1.5 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra DAX share index rebounded from an early fall
and closed up 0.13 percent, or 6.67 points, at 5070.98.
</P>
<P>
The CAC 40 in Paris was the only one of the three main bourses
that failed to escape from the red Friday. The blue chips closed
down 11 points at 4315.04, a drop of 0.26 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the Paris bourse proved more resilient than other
European markets over the past week, with the leading index down
only about 1.9 percent over that period.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Says Italy Would Shun Ground Attack in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Italy would be forced to
"disassociate" themselves from a ground attack in Kosovo that
would ruin decades of diplomacy, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said in an interview published Friday by Italian news-weekly
Panorama.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that "sending ground troops into Yugoslavia would be
an invasion, to all intents and purposes" which would "burn up
twenty years of political and diplomatic work."
</P>
<P>
"I fear that Italy would be forced to disassociate itself from
this," he said, adding that "America would not have the support of
Germany nor of many other NATO members, apart from Britain."
</P>
<P>
NATO has been building up ground forces in Macedonia - over
15,000 to date - in the event of being allowed into Kosovo to
escort refugees home, possibly as part of a wider UN-mandated
force.
</P>
<P>
But the idea of ground troops going into a hostile environment
has caused extreme uneasiness in many European capitals.

<HEADLINE> Greece Calls for Direct NATO-Yugoslavia Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou Friday called for direct talks between NATO and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic so as to speed up a
diplomatic settlement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a breakfast with journalists here, Papandreou said
he doubted Milosevic would accept NATO's terms for a deal unless
he met a representative from the alliance.
</P>
<P>
"Milosevic is not going to come out one day and say publicly
that he agrees (to NATO's demands)," Papandreou said.
</P>
<P>
"He would want to meet with someone who he feels actually
represents the other side in one way or another," he added.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the alliance has not contributed more
efforts to diplomacy. Greece has proposed NATO to temporarily
halt the air bombing against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Our diplomatic efforts really haven't been full-force. We
don't have any direct dealings with Yugoslavia from our side and I
think we're losing, we have lost a number of opportunities to
maybe have him sign up," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Let's attempt some diplomacy. Let's deal with whoever we have
to deal with." he said.
</P>
<P>
Greece, a NATO member, did not participate in the alliance's
bombing. Greeks are also Orthodox Christians as the Serbs are.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Papandreou said his government was also concerned by
two big possible developments in the Balkans -- the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) was becoming a political force in Albania
and that NATO bombing might drive Serbs out of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
These developments would complicate the crisis on the Balkans
and further threaten the stability in the region, according to the
minister.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Image Damaged by Kosovo War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Image of U.S. President Bill
Clinton was damaged by Kosovo war which have gone into the third
month and killed over 1000 innocent people, according to results
of recent polls.
</P>
<P>
A poll jointly conducted by CNN, USA Today and Gallup and
released Wednesday found that Clinton's job approval declined from
60 percent earlier this month to 53 percent, the lowest since
August 1996.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that support for U.S. involvement in Kosovo
slipped to 49 percent and only 40 percent of Americans supported
sending ground troops if airstrikes didn't work. A poll conducted
by Pew Research Center found only 44 percent would support sending
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
The Pew poll conducted May 12-16 also showed that public
approval for U.S. participation in the airstrikes on Yugoslavia
had fallen to 53 percent from 62 percent in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's approval rate remained to be 63 percent in January
and stayed in mid to high 60s even during impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's approval ratings are dropping as Americans grow
increasingly anxious about nine weeks of airstrikes, bombing
accidents and debates over a ground invasion, AP said.
</P>
<P>
"All of these polls are showing less basic support for
involvement in Kosovo and less general support for President
Clinton as a consequence," said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
"The public is frustrated by a lack of progress and also by
these accidents," he added.
