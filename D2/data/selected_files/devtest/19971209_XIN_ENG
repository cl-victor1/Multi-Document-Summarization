<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Enjoy Better Housing Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The per-capita living
space in Shanghai has grown by 29.6 percent to 8.7 sq.m. over the
past six years, according to information released during a local
symposium on housing finance.
</P>
<P>
Today's symposium was sponsored by the local branches of the
People's Bank of China and the China Construction Bank, and Morgen
Stanley Asia Ltd. of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government of Shanghai has extended great efforts
to improve the living conditions of local residents in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Shanghai has allocated 127.78 billion yuan to
construct residential housing. New apartments with a total floor
space of 52.89 million square meters have been completed.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has also reformed the
housing rental fees. A government plan calls for rental fees to
grow by some 50 percent annually during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, local families are expected to spend 15
percent of their annual income on rents.
</P>
<P>
Local residents are currently being encouraged to purchase
publicly-owned apartments.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October this year, some 670,000 local residents
had purchased publicly-owned housing in which they were living at
cost prices. Related housing covered 35 million sq.m. and
constituted some 54 percent of publicly-owned apartments on the
market.
</P>
<P>
The city introduced the system of public housing funds for
employees in 1991, with some 98 percent of local workers having
since participated in the program.
</P>
<P>
The fund has accumulated 16.49 billion yuan, with 13.82 billion
yuan allocated as housing loans enabling individuals to purchase
their own houses on the market.

<HEADLINE> Six British Farmers Arrested After Beef Imports Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Six farmers were arrested Monday
after a truck was damaged in an incident which police believed to
have links with farmer's protests.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said around 100 people protested at the port of
Fishguard in Pembrokeshire Monday morning as part of the
continuing protests against cheap beef imports from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Police said all vehicles left the port safely. But one was
stopped later near Haverfordwest with its rear lights broken.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in several port cities have staged protests since last
Monday against cheap beef imports. They even brockade roads to
ports with tractors to halt traffic.
</P>
<P>
The long-running "mad cow" disease crisis has hit the British
beef industry hard, and farmers have accused the government of not
doing enough to help them.
</P>
<P>
They were further angered on Wednesday when Secretary of State
for Agriculture, Jack Cunningham, proposed a ban on beef sold to
prevent a tiny risk that people may become infected with the human
form of mad cow disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair has urged the farmers to stop
blockading roads and ports, and vowed that law and order must be
upheld and truck routes must be kept open.

<HEADLINE> Cook: Long Way to Go in Achieving Lasting Bosnia Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said here today there is still a long way to go in achieving
a lasting peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of an international conference due to open in Bonn,
Germany on Tuesday, Cook wrote in The Times newspaper today: "We
have a long way to go," although a series of achievements have
been made over the past two years since the Dayton Peace Agreement
was signed.
</P>
<P>
"Bosnia barely functions as a nation, let alone one able to
deal on equal terms with democracies in Europe," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook criticized Bosnian leaders in failing to restore their
shattered country by saying: "The efforts of the international
community can not make up for the inactivity of Bosnia's leaders."
</P>
<P>
"My main hope for Bonn (conference) is that it will issue a
wake-up call for Bosnia's leaders. Too often they have been
prepared to make progress only grudgingly, prodded into action by
the international community," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"They must now live up their responsibility to lead the Bosnian
people into the real world," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary also noted that the Bonn conference would
focus on human rights, open and fair government, transparency in
public finances and a free and independent media.
</P>
<P>
On the international peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, Cook said
that British Prime Minister Tony Blair has already made it clear
that British peacekeepers "should stay in the foreseeable future."
</P>
<P>
"We are in no doubt that a successor force to SFOR (Salvation
Force), whose mandate expires next June, must be NATO led with the
participation of all key allies" he added.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Meets With Prominent Government Critic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen held talks with opposition leader Sam Rainsy here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is their first encounter since the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
They did not release the contents of their hours-long talks,
which might have significant impact on the fate of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed, what is important is the national interest,"
Sam Rainsy said.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy is a political ally of the deposed Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, who was ousted by Hun Sen in early July.
</P>
<P>
He served as finance minister for a year in the coalition
government set up by Ranariddh and Hun Sen after U.N.-run
elections in 1993 and was sacked in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
Both Sam Rainsy and Ranariddh were not in Cambodia at the time
of the prince's ouster and together they launched a campaign
against Hun Sen's new government from abroad.
</P>
<P>
But Sam Rainsy returned to Phnom Penh late last month and said
he would co-operate with the government to ensure that the 1998
election is free and fair.

<HEADLINE> Ruehe's Resignation Urged for Neo-Nazi Army Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Germany's main opposition Social
Democrats (SPD) today demanded that Defense Minister Volker Ruehe
resign after another neo-Nazi scandal involving the German armed
forces being recently discovered.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl must consider sacking Ruehe in order to
show, once and for all, that the German army is not a neo-Nazi
playground, said SPD parliamentarian Hans Buettner.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Kohl said that he had full confidence in Ruehe.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe has vowed to drive all proven rightests out of the
Bundeswehr after many neo-Nazi incidents in the army went public,
such as drunken soldiers beating foreigners and homemade films
showing solders giving stiff-armed Hitler salute and mocking
executions and rapes.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Ruehe admitted that Manfred Roeder, a leading
neo-Nazi, gave a lecture at the Hamburg Bundeswehr Leadership
Academy in 1995, on how to repopulate the former German state of
East Prussia, which was divided between Poland and Russia after
World War II, with ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Roeder, 68, was convicted in 1982 of carrying out bomb attacks
on behalf of the rightist "German Action Group" and sentenced to
13 years in prison. He was released on probation in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The academy officials said that they were unaware of Roeder's
background when they invited him.

LUSAKA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 17 opposition parties
including the one led by former president Kenneth Kaunda have
registered for the inter-party dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Micheal Sata, national secretary of the ruling Movement for
Multi-party Democracy (MMD), today expressed happiness at the
response from the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
He said here that the secretaries of political parties will
decide on the agenda of the planned dialogue when they meet on
Tuesday as no conditions have been set.
</P>
<P>
Sata hailed the opposition parties for registering without
setting any conditions.
</P>
<P>
This shows that they are serious about dialogue on various
issues that have remained unresolved between the MMD and the
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Among the parties which have registered are Kaunda's United
National Independence Party (UNIP), the Zambia Democratic
Congress, Liberal Progressive Front, the Unity Party for
Democrats, National Party, and National Lima Party.
</P>
<P>
The MMD set up an office here today to register for opposition
parties interested in the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The inter-party talks failed to kick off as planned last July
after opposition parties renewed their calls for abolishing the
current constitution, establishing an interim government and

<P>
ULAN BATOR, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Trying its best since 1990,
Mongolia so far has contracted 164 million U.S. dollars worth of
foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Seven years after it had a law to boost capital inflow, the
Bureau of Foreign Investment said today, the land-locked country
now hosts 708 joint or foreign ventures.
</P>
<P>
The foreign funds, the government agency said, mainly go into
Mongolia's oil, mining, livestock products, food and light
industries as well as its trade and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Of the 26 million dollars capital inflow so far this year, 6
million dollars was in the mining industry and 7 million in the
trade and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Those bringing much needed investments are from Japan, Russia,
China, Portugal and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Besides the preferential policies effective from 1990, Mongolia
is amending laws and regulations, and improving infrastructure to
make the country a better choice for investors.

Madikizela-Mandela, ANCWL president and former wife of South

North-West province.
</P>
<P>
"Suggestions in the media that ANC spokespersons have
indicated that the ANC Women's League has decided to drop the
name of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela from their nominations list,
are wholly incorrect and devoid of all truth," the ANC said in a
short statement.
</P>
<P>
Madikizela-Mandela's reputation was marred to some extent
after she was implicated in 18 cases of human rights violations
at a nine-day Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing.

Mandela is set to step down at the conference as ANC leader to

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada's federal government
would negotiate with Quebec if the Yes forces won a referendum on
sovereignty there, said Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
The comment was the most clear-cut statement Chretien has made
that he would enter into talks on Quebec independence after an
indisputable vote for sovereignty in the French-speaking province.
</P>
<P>
"In situation like that, there will be a negotiation with the
federal government. No doubt about it. No doubt about it,"
Chretien was quoted as saying by reports today.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister said that he's sure a unilateral
declaration of independence by Quebec would be illegal and "very
rare."
</P>
<P>
Conditions would have to be met before the federal government
agreed to negotiate, Chretien said at the end of the biennial
meeting of his Liberal Party's Quebec wing.
</P>
<P>
"But if, if, if," he added. "In theory there will be. But they
have to have a referendum, a clear question, a strong majority and
many other barriers to overcome," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois
government have insisted that Quebec doesn't need anyone's
approval or permission to determine its future.

<HEADLINE> Anti-smoking Position Not to Change, Chretien </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said his government will not further reassess its
anti-smoking legislation in spite of pressure from the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
"For us, the health question is fundamental," Chretien was
quoted as saying by today's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The government has already decided to loosen the anti-smoking
Bill C-71 in certain areas.
</P>
<P>
"But we have no intention of abolishing the law," the Canadian
prime minister insisted.
</P>
<P>
"We believe (tobacco) is a major problem and that we have to
spend efforts to ensure that children do not fall into tobacco
trap," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chretien was responding to Imperial Tobacco's announcement
Friday that it will withdraw financial support for Canada's
cultural and sporting events by next October.
</P>
<P>
Bill C-71 limits the ability of tobacco companies to promote
themselves at arts and sporting events.
</P>
<P>
For example, it will restrict tobacco brand names to a
10-percent strip along the bottom of promotional signs or posters.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed into law in April. As a result of intensive
lobbying by the tobacco industry, the government has agreed to
delay the sponsorship restriction to October 1, 1998.

<HEADLINE> low world metal prices worrying in zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The current recession in metal
prices on the world market may threaten the operations and
viability of Zimbabwe's small mines, a senior Chamber of Mines
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Chamber Derek Bain said the fall in
mineral prices was also likely to significantly reduce profits in
the bigger companies which would be forced to scale down
operations.
</P>
<P>
''the more profitable companies may have to take cost cutting
measures which may include retrenchments while those companies
which make marginal profits will face closure if the situation
does not improve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The plummeting metal prices have caused panic in local and
international mining concerns as several companies have recorded
losses and reduced profits.
</P>
<P>
Minerals most affected include gold, nickel, copper and
ferrochrome.
</P>
<P>
Prices for gold, the country's second biggest single forex
earner after tobacco are currently hovering at around 220 U.S.
Dollars per ounce, a big drop from the 400 US Dollars per ounce
that is considered as the good price.
</P>
<P>
On recent suggestions that Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) countries should form cartel to be able to
influence prices on the world market, Bain said although it was a
good idea, the total regional mineral output was not enough to
influence the fixing of prices.
</P>
<P>
He added, ''the formation of such cartel would be against
certain provisions of the world trade organization (WTO ) and
furthermore the output may not be big enough to influence
prices."
</P>
<P>
"We can only hope that prices will improve soon,'' he noted.

OTTAWA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada's industries operated at
86.2 percent of capacity in the third quarter of 1997, Statistics
Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Propelled by high foreign demand, strong business and consumer
spending, the industries produced goods at an operating level just
shy of its peak recorded in the 1988 economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
"Rates of capacity use have been rising for over a year and are
now at or near recorded levels," the federal statistics agency
said.
</P>
<P>
An industry's capacity use is the ratio of its actual output to
its estimated potential output.

<P>
In the third quarter, 14 of the country's 22 industry groups
raised their rates of capacity use, and eight of them recorded
rates over 90 percent, the agency said.

HARARE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2,170 foreigners
were deported from Zimbabwe this year for contravening
immigration laws.

<P>
Most deportees were from neighboring Mozambique, who flout

Zimbabwe's chief immigration officer Elasto Mugwadi said today
that most illegal immigrants ran away from economic hardships in
their countries to Zimbabwe which had also been identified as a
new base in crime.

<P>
The high rate of unemployment within other countries, he said,
was contributing a lot to the flouting of laws by foreigners who
normally engaged in unlawful employment and business once they
arrived in Zimbabwe.

Other deportees were from Nigeria, Zambia, Malawi, South

<HEADLINE> Chinese Representative Explains Policy on Climate Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China opposes the introduction of
any new commitments by the developing countries in addressing
global warming, a senior Chinese official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yaobang, Chinese forestry minister and head of the Chinese
delegation, made the remark in a speech to the delegates from some
160 nations at the ministerial session of the U.N. climate change
conference in Kyoto, western Japan.
</P>
<P>
"China supports the adoption of a protocol or another legal
instrument that is in conformity with the U.N. Framework
Convention on Climate Change and the `Berlin Mandate'," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
However, China "is opposed to the introduction of any new
commitments for the developing countries and the launching of any
negotiation process that attempts to introduce new commitments for
developing countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted five
years ago, set forth different commitments for developed countries
and developing countries in combating climate change in accordance
with the principles of "common but differentiated
responsibilities" and equity, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, though the implementation of the
Convention has been on track, its progress has fallen short of
expectations.
</P>
<P>
This is mainly because most of the developed countries will not
be able to fulfil their commitments in stabilizing their
anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases at their 1990 levels
by the end of this century, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that although the Convention stipulates that the
developed countries should provide financial resources and
technology needed by the developing countries to implement the
Convention, there is no progress in technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
All this shows that the implementation of the Convention is
faced with great challenges.
</P>
<P>
Chen also expressed disappointment with the failure of the
developed countries to take the lead in combating climate change
as stipulated by the "Berlin Mandate", which was adopted two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
On China's policies on tackling global warming, Chen said the
Chinese government attaches great importance to the issue of
global climate, adding that China is among the 10 leading
countries that have ratified the Convention.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has formulated "China's Agenda 21", a
sustainable development strategy which is suited to China's
country-specific conditions, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has set up a Co-ordinating Group on
Climate, involving all relevant ministries and departments, and
has taken climate change into consideration in programming
socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, China has made great contribution to
modifying longer-term trends of climate change by persevering in
large-scale afforestation and implementing policy of controlling
population growth, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country with 1.2 billion people, while being
willing to make greater contribution to addressing climate change,
China is also faced with enormous actual difficulties in this
regard, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chen unveiled four aspects in which China will make efforts to
tackle climate change such as persisting in controlling the
population growth rate, encouraging and popularizing energy saving
technologies, and developing renewable energies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister also said that China is ready to take an
active role in international cooperation and exchanges and to make
due share of contribution in addressing climate change within the
framework of the Convention.

<HEADLINE> Georgian President on Border Problem with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze Monday expressed confidence in settling the border
dispute between his country and Russia through negotiations, the
Itar-Tass News Agency reported from Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
There can be no problems or strategic contradictions insoluble
between the two countries, Shevardnadze said, adding that he and
his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin have created a legal basis
for solving the border issue.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a Russian delegation headed by Deputy
Prime Minister Valery Serov is expected to arrive Tbilisi on
Monday, and to talk, among other problems in bilateral relations,
the border issue.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said the Georgian side is ready to resume
negotiations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Tbilisi government had earlier accused Russian border
guards of "unilaterally moving the border sign in an area where
the border has not been finally agreed upon", while Russian border
guards claimed moving the sign had not changed the existing border.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said the Russian border guards "seized the agreed
1.5 kilometer-wide neutral zone without any talks or notification."
</P>
<P>
Delimitation and demarcation of the border, the Georgian
president pointed out, should be decided by state commissions of
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Approves Tax Reform Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives today finally approved the country's vital income
tax reform bill, the third and final phase of the Comprehensive
Tax Reform Package (CTRP).
</P>
<P>
The ratification was announced by House Speaker Jose de Venecia
this evening, who was just chosen by President Fidel Ramos as the
ruling Lakas party's presidential candidate for the 1998 polls.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which will help generate 7 billion pesos (200 million
U.S. dollars) in new revenues for the government, is a vital
requirement in the country's planned exit from 35 years of
economic supervision by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The country was supposed to graduate from the last IMF
supervision program in June this year, but the graduation was
delayed due to the lower house's failure to pass the CTRP.
</P>
<P>
The lower house's passage of the income tax bill cleared the
last hurdle for the country's graduation from the IMF, which was
rescheduled for the end of this month. The Senate had already
approved the bill last month.
</P>
<P>
The income tax bill provides a 100 percent tax exemption to 4
million overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and wide-ranging tax
breaks to 25 million workers at home.
</P>
<P>
"This is our gift to Philippine labor," said De Venecia,
beaming after mobilizing the ruling party's allies in the lower
house to successfully ensure the passage of the measure.
</P>
<P>
"This is for the OFWs who helped prop up the country,
especially during the dark days of its economy, and this is for
workers who stayed home and helped create the Philippine economic
miracle," De Venecia said.

<HEADLINE> Luxembourg PM: Talk With All Those Willing to Enter EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Luxembourg Prime Minister
Jean-Claude Juncker said here Monday that talks should be held
with all those applying for the European Union (EU) membership.
</P>
<P>
However, Junker told a news conference joined by his Finnish
counterpart Paavo Lepponen, the pace of the negotiations should
vary according to each of the 11 countries' economic development.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were made after the two prime ministers'
discussion on the scenario for the EU's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg prime minister's new proposal was believed here
to be a compromise over the different views within the EU on how
to grant the membership to Central and Eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
Lepponen said Finland is in favor of Luxembourg's proposal, and
called on the other 13 current members of the regional bloc to
reach a consensus in the accession talks scheduled for early 1998.
</P>
<P>
In addition, media reports here said Sweden, Denmark and Italy
also agree to talk with all applicants at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Besides the EU enlargement, the Luxembourg and Finnish
ministers also discussed the mechanism for consultation within the
European Monetary Union (EMU), and the presidency for the future
European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Juncker, who arrived here on Saturday evening, left afterwards
for Sweden and Denmark to continue his tour in the Nordic region.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Firms Not Prepared for Year 2000 Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Less than half of all Canadian
firms have taken action to prepare for anticipated Year 2000
computer problems, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
As the clock tick away towards the January 1, 2000 deadline,
about 10 percent of all companies were not even aware of the
problem, the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
A further 46 percent of all firms said they were aware of the
issue, but had not done anything about it.
</P>
<P>
The Year 2000 issue refers to the need to fix computers whose
programming assumes that every year begins with "19".
</P>
<P>
Unless they are updated, they will assume that the day
following December 31, 1999, is actually January 1, 1900. This
will cause great confusion to everything related to computers.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the problem could cost the Canadian
economy a minimum of 12 billion dollars (8.5 billion USD) in
direct costs to fix.
</P>
<P>
"This total excludes the unidentified costs of the many
businesses that have not begun to address the problem," the agency
said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Willing to Discuss Turkish Cypriots' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government is ready
to discuss the proposals on Turkish Cypriots' representation in
the European Union (EU) accession talks, a government spokesman
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Manolis Christofides
noted that the EU recognizes the Cypriot government as the only
legitimate negotiator.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the call by Turkish Cypriots and Turkey
for inclusion of Turkish Cypriot representatives in Cyprus'
delegation for EU accession talks.
</P>
<P>
All those interested in Turkish Cypriots' representation in
accession talks are expected to have some ideas to propose, he
noted, adding that "we are willing to discuss the issue when it
arises."
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that all proposals should comply with
U.N. resolutions against the recognition of the illegal entity
unilaterally declared by the Turkish Cypriots in the northern part
of the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether it will be tangible to start Cyprus-EU accession
talks on April 10, 1998, Christofides said Cyprus believes
negotiations will start on that date, even if the problem of
Turkish Cypriots' representation is not yet settled.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also announced that President Glafcos Clerides
will attend the Luxembourg meeting of members of the European
Council, European Commission and associated countries later this
week.
</P>
<P>
Clerides will then visit Luxembourg, currently holding the EU
six-month rotating presidency, at the invitation of the country's
Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker.

<HEADLINE> France to Provide Food Aid to Ethiopia: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Minister
of Cooperation Charles Josselin announced here today that France
will provide 10,000 tons of food aid to Ethiopia in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made when Josselin met with Ethiopian
Minister of Economic Development and Cooperation Girma Birru,
according to the Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The food aid will be given as Ethiopia has been hard hit by
the El Nino weather pattern. Dozens of people died in floods in
the eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first general Franco-Ethiopian joint commission
meeting was held here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Josselin said the opening of the
commission extends the Ethio-French cooperation to areas like
political dialogue as well as economic and commercial relations.
</P>
<P>
He said France could provide Ethiopia with the benefits of its
expertise and know-how in the legal cooperation and animal
husbandry in particular.
</P>
<P>
Josselin added that trade between France and Ethiopia has
increased by 50 percent within three years and France has
recently been the second largest foreign investor in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Girma said that the level of Ethio-French
cooperation is widening in the fields of culture, science,
education, politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of projects including the rehabilitation of
the Ethio-Djibouti railway and supervision work for Tiss Abay
hydropower project are being implemented smoothly through the
collaborative efforts of the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Josselin today also met and held talks with Ethiopian Foreign
Minister Seyoum Mesfin on issues pertaining to bilateral
relations and the situation in central and east African
countries, according to a spokesman from the Ethiopian Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The governments of France and Ethiopia have signed here a
joint communique to extend the 1966 Ethio-French cultural,
scientific and technical agreement to include political and
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the visiting French minister today visited the
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) here and
signed an exchange of letters with the ECA.
</P>
<P>
The French minister ended his three-day visit here today.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Unite International Efforts Against Buruli Ulcer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) is trying to unite international efforts to fight against
Buruli ulcer in particular in Africa, WHO Director-General Dr
Hiroshi Nakajima announced.
</P>
<P>
"Today, on behalf of the World Health Organization, I can
announce to you that we have taken the decision to unite
international efforts for the control of this scourge," said
Nakajima on the occasion of his visit to Cote d'Ivoire. "We are
going to mobilize worldwide expertise and the necessary resources
for confronting this new challenge."
</P>
<P>
Buruli ulcer is a terrible disease mainly striking young
people. Cases have been reported since 1948 in Benin, Cote
d'Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana and Uganda, according to a WHO press
release here today.
</P>
<P>
A working group specially set up by WHO will be meeting for the
first time in 1998 to take stock of current knowledge about this
disease and propose a two-year plan of action.
</P>
<P>
Many questions remain unanswered regarding the agent of this
disease, the conditions of its survival in the natural environment
and its mechanisms of transmission to man.
</P>
<P>
Buruli ulcer seems on its way to replacing leprosy as a social
scourge in Cote d'Ivoire, where some 400 cases have been recorded
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
At present, there is no medical treatment for effectively
controlling Buruli ulcer, which is the third most widespread
mycobacterial disease in the world after tuberculosis and leprosy.
</P>
<P>
The only treatment possible consists in extensively excising
the lesion and making a skin graft, which is not only long and
costly but leaves sequelae.
</P>
<P>
The disease exists in the form of endemic foci in the marshy
parts of the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Oceania,
Latin America and Africa.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Threatened by Cholera Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in the Somali
capital have warned against the spread of cholera epidemic in the
wake of the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Forlanini Hospital, north Mogadishu
today, the Joint Health Authority (JHA) warned against the
possibility of a large number of child mortality as a result of
cholera if the situation is not intervened promptly.
</P>
<P>
Dr Ibrahim Maow Gandi, acting coordinator for the JHA, said
they have so far recorded the death of 41 children in the past
few days alone while 721 other people, mainly children, are now
suffering from severe diarrhoea and cholera.
</P>
<P>
According to the doctor, six out of 13 samples taken from
these affected children tested positive of cholera in
laboratories in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The JHA warned that without quarantines the disease will
further spread into new communities.
</P>
<P>
There are both chlorine and sodium infusions in some of the
warehouses of the aid agencies in Mogadishu, Gandi said, adding
however, "The local staff cannot do anything during the absence
of the international expatriates who fled the capital for
security related problems."
</P>
<P>
"We would suggest that the local staff are authorized to give
out some help," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The JHA called on the people to bring their patients to the
hospitals where they can at least get some medical help or
consultations. The sodium infusions are getting scarce as
diarrhoea and cholera are affecting the people, especially the
children, in the capital in their hundreds.
</P>
<P>
In the markets and chemist's, one bag of 0.5-liter infusion is
now sold in 20,000 Somali Shillings (about three U.S. Dollars),
which only a few people can afford. But earlier it was sold in
less than one Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, airlifted food have begun to reach flood affected
regions in southern Somalia. Reports from Buale town said two
helicopters have made four flights to their town dropping some
food.
</P>
<P>
Elders from the town said that planes belonging to the World
Food Program are yet to quench down the hunger of the people as
each flight brought about not enough supplies to combat the
suffering of tens of thousands of people who fled their houses
from the floods.
</P>
<P>
Both the floods and rains continue further to devastate
villages and towns. The local authority in Sablale district of
lower Shabelle region have declared the flood situation is now
out of hand.
</P>
<P>
Adan Farah Abdi, a community elder in Sablale, said all 27
villages around the town are now deserted due to the flood
waters, and the road linking the town to the capital is also cut
off.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of these people are now on the small flood created
islands without food, shelter and medicine. They are also dying
in dozens of malaria and famine, said the elders.

<HEADLINE> Diplomats Call for Arab Common Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Senior Arab diplomats today
called for reviving the decades-old dream of creating an Arab
common market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a cultural seminar on the Arab common market held
here, Fouad al Sadek al Mahdi, Saudi Arabia's representative to
the Arab League, called for the revival of Arab solidarity in an
effort to promote development and build strong economy.
</P>
<P>
He said to set up a common market among Arab countries is "an
urgent obligation."
</P>
<P>
The Arab League proposed to set up the Arab common market more
than 30 years ago, which still remains a dream today.
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to liberalize trade among Arab countries by 2007,
an Arab free trade area will be set up next year.
</P>
<P>
When complaining of the Arab underdevelopment, Syria's
Ambassador to Egypt Issa Darwish said one out of three in the Arab
workforce will be unemployed in the first decade of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
He added that the inter-Arab investment currently amounts to
almost nothing when compared to Arab investment in other parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Arab world has a strong economic
potential. Egypt, Syria and the oil-rich Saudi Arabia will be the
center of Arab renaissance, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world has 252 million population, 62 percent of
world's known oil reserves, 22 percent of natural gas reserves,
and produces 66 percent of world's oil annually.
</P>
<P>
The seminar organized by the Egyptian Committee of the
Afro-Asian Peoples Solidarity Organization was attended by Arab
diplomats, economists, media men and experts on Arab affairs.

<HEADLINE> ILO/UNDP Report Sees Economic Revival in Sub-Saharan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Economy in sub-Saharan Africa is
showing the first signs of resurgence, with 33 countries enjoying
economic growth rates greater than the rate of increase in their
populations, according to a report made public here today.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has no alternative but to embark on a process of
sustained GDP growth if it is to avoid continued marginalization"
from the global economy, says Jobs for Africa, a new report by the
International Labor Organization (ILO) and United Nations
Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The report points out that while recovery prospects can be
boosted by further domestic reforms and increased international
investment, accelerated job and income growth are now critical to
sustaining the upturn and maintaining political stability in what
has become the world's poorest region.
</P>
<P>
The overall economic growth rate in sub-Saharan Africa rose to
3.7 percent in 1995, the last year for which accurate figures are
available, up from 1.9 percent in 1994, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"The turnaround in growth signals the beginning of a new start
in Africa if the right policies are put in place and pursued
consistently," said ILO economist Samir Radwan.
</P>
<P>
The report's main author believed that the main emphasis of
policy makers "should be on encouraging new, private-sector
enterprises, particularly those which are small in scale and labor
intensive, and on enabling small enterprises to expand, innovate
and penetrate new markets, including export markets".
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the report acknowledges that Africa's recent
reversal of fortune is still anaemic and highly vulnerable. It
cites "the development of productive employment" as one of the
potential stumbling blocks for the economic growth in the
sub-Saharan African region.
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1994, labor force in sub-Saharan Africa continued
to grow at about three percent annually, declining or stagnating
levels of wage employment, decreasing real wages and deteriorating
working and living conditions" throughout the region, according to
the report.

<TEXT>

JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today criticized some European countries for
automatically siding with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
over the stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu voiced the complaint at the weekly Cabinet meeting,
during which he briefed the cabinet on his just-concluded visit
last week to Europe, where he held talks with leaders of Germany,
France and United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Both Germany and France criticized Israel for its
intransigience on the issue of further troop redeployments in the
West Bank, which have been long delayed in violation of the signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
On last Thursday, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl reportedly
expressed to Netanyahu his "growing concern" over the peace
process when they met in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac made similar comments in his
Saturday meeting with Netanyahu in Paris, saying he is
pessimistic about the prospects of the peace. Chirac added that
long delays in the peace process are a threat to Israel's
security.
</P>
<P>
After hearing Netanyahu's proposal on the second redeployment,
both Kohl and Chirac stressed that the Israeli plan for further
pullback is insufficient. Although the Israeli government has
never publicized its plan on the redeployment, local media has
widely reported that Netanyahu is proposing a 6-8 percent
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to some speculations, Netanyahu said he did not
discuss the extent of the second redeployment with Albright
during their two meetings last week in Paris.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that he did tell Albright that the
PNA's initiative to achieve state status in the United Nations
was a violation of its commitments and the Oslo obligations.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy urged the cabinet to produce a
clear proposal on the further redeployment as soon as possible,
otherwise Netanyahu would not be able to hold another meeting
with Albright on December 17 in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
During her meetings with Netanyahu, Albright urged Israeli
government to approve a more credible further redeployment in
order to push forward the peace process. The U.S. government
is increasingly impatient with the slow pace in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have failed to achieve any
progress since their resumption early October after a seven-month
freeze.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today in Paris after meeting with French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, Albright said she believes both Israelis
and Palestinians are genuinely trying to advance the peace
process. She reiterated that Israel has to come up with a plan on
the second troop redeployment, while the PNA must fulfill its
obligations in the field of security by making 100 percent effort
to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu-led ministerial committee charged with deciding
the extent of further redeployment and guidelines on the
permanent talks has already held three meetings, but failed to
reach an agreement so far because of differences of opinions
on Israeli security interests.
</P>
<P>
The committee will not reconvene until its member, Defense
Minister Mordechai's scheduled return on Wednesday. Israeli
sources doubted if the committee will be able to finish drawing a
final map on the redeployment and permanent talks before next
week's meeting between Netanyahu and Albright.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Federico Mayor, director general
of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), said today that balance must be kept
between development and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a five-day conference of the "Environment and
Society: Education and Public awareness" which opened today in the
northern Greek port city of Thessaloniki, Mayor said that the time
had now come for action. People must pressure their governments in
order for them to take measures to deal with not only the
destruction of the environment, but also poverty and ignorance, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the solution to those problems was to invest
in dignity, education and training throughout life.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of Greece's environmental, educational and cultural
ministries also stressed in their speeches the importance of the
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The conference has been organized by UNESCO in cooperation with

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Enjoy Constitutional Rights: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopians are currently
undertaking various political, economic and social activities by
taking advantages of the different rights provided by the Federal
Constitution, President Negasso Gidada said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Negasso made the
statement here in an opening speech to a human rights symposium
organized in connection with the third anniversary of the
adoption of the Federal Constitution.
</P>
<P>
By exercising these rights which entitle them to the right of
self determination up to secession, the president said, "the
people are deciding directly on all issues affecting their life
and involve themselves in their execution."
</P>
<P>
State accountability has also been ensured through the
creation of favorable conditions for the people to bring down
from power untrustworthy representatives, he added.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, our constitution is a supreme law of the
country which ensures respect for basic human rights of
individuals and people which develops, in an organized manner,
the broad and democratic participation of the people," Negasso
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Clear signs are already emerging that the constitution
represents a strong popular expression capable of removing the
old outlook of territorial unity and replacing it by a popular
democratic unity founded on voluntary will of the people," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Dawit Yohannes, speaker of the House of People's
Representatives, said at the symposium that the house has already
registered satisfactory results in its day to day struggle to
translate the constitution into reality.
</P>
<P>
In addition to efforts aimed at building its capacity, the
house has conducted a detailed study of the five-year development
program presented to it by the executive branch, and had made it
its own and the nation's work plan, Yohannes noted.
</P>
<P>
"The constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of
Ethiopia" was ratified on December 8, 1994.

<P>
AMMAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan
Ibn Talal left here today for Tehran to attend the eighth summit
of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) scheduled for
December 9-11, official Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has had sour relations with Iran for many years for
Jordan's presumed tilt over Iraq, a long-time foe of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Hassan's delegation includes Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali,
Speaker of the Senate Zaid Rifai and several other cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh had arrived in
Tehran earlier and joined his counterparts of other OIC members
for a ministerial meeting, which ended Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, Jordan will take part in the discussion of
major subjects such as the liberalization of Jerusalem and
Palestine, conflict in Kashmir, situation in Bosnia, crisis in
Afghanistan and ending colonial rule in Muslim countries, the

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Defeats Non-Confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (Parliament)
today rejected a non-confidence motion against Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu by a vote of 52-45 with 2 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The motion, which dealt with both political-diplomatic issues
and the country's economy, were filed by opposition Labor party,
left wing party Meretz, Hadash and the Democratic Arab Party.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cabinet's decision on the further
redeployment in the West Bank, the motion charged that Netanyahu
has failed in advancing the Oslo peace process and there was
nothing new in the government decision.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet last month approved Netanyahu's proposal that
Israel implements further withdrawal from unspecified areas of
the West Bank on condition that Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) fulfills its commitments as appended to the Hebron
Agreement last January.
</P>
<P>
The motion also said that Netanyahu should be responsible for
the five-day crippling nationwide strike, launched by the Trade
Union last Wednesday in protest against government plans for
wages reform and privatization.
</P>
<P>
The strike caused heavy economic losses to the country by
effectively shutting down airports, seaports, banks, government
offices and state-owned industries. The Treasury put the economic
losses of the strike at some 300 million shekels (about 86 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Ehud Barak has said that Netanyahu can not bring
about either peace or security to the country because he has lost
all credibility with the Palestinians, the United States and even
Knesset members and government ministers.
</P>
<P>
"Our stand is clear: we do not have confidence in Netanyahu and
we will vote against him in all non-confidence motions," Barak
said.
</P>
<P>
Barak also said he expects there will be general elections
next year and that the party is preparing for them.

<HEADLINE> BA Takes Tough Measures to Curb Drunkenness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- British Airways (BA) announced a
new "alcohol policy" to curb drunkenness by air travellers to
ensure the safety and security of passengers and staff, said local
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, BA employees will be empowered to prevent
passengers who appear drunk from boarding aircraft. They should
also stop serving in-flight alcohol to anyone who seems to be
drunk.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, crew members can confiscate duty-free drink from
drunken passengers, and the drink will be returned to passengers
once an aircraft has reached its destination.
</P>
<P>
The new measures followed two recent court cases which involved
assaults on airline cabin crew by drunken passengers.
</P>
<P>
BA said that as with most other air carriers, it is
experiencing an increase in the frequency and severity of
disruptive and drunken behavior by passengers, which places
+unacceptable burdens on crew members and ground staff.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that over the past year, 14 serious incidents
involving violence had been reported on BA's planes compared with
only two or three five years ago.

<HEADLINE> UK to Step Up Fight Against Drugs in Caribbean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
here today that it would contribute an additional 720,000 pounds
(about 1.2 million U.S. dollars) in a new effort to support the
European Union (EU) Caribbean Drugs Initiative (CDI).
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokesman said in a statement issued
this afternoon that the Foreign Office will contribute 500,000
pounds (830,000 dollars) towards some CDI projects, which aimed at
the training of law enforcement officials and members of the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British Home Office is separately providing
220,000 pounds (about 365,000 dollars) towards another project,
which is designed to intercept drugs being smuggled at sea, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
British Minister of State Tony Lloyd said today: "These
additional funds will provide a significant boost to the fight
against the drugs trade."
</P>
<P>
"Some 30 percent of the cocaine destined for the UK first
transits the Caribbean. British is determined to do everything it
can to substantially reduce this flow," Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that British drugs-related assistance to the
Caribbean region totaled some 15 million pounds (about 25 million
dollars) over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Loses $125 Million Yearly on Timber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Mismanagement of Nigeria's rich
wood resources has inflicted an annual loss of about 125 million
U.S. Dollars on the country's timber revenue, a United Nations
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The nation loses 10 billion Naira yearly because of the
continuous use of sawdust producing machines unlike in South
Africa, Europe and America," said Kehinde Sanwo, consultant on
tropical timber for the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization,
according to the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Ondo and Oyo states in southwestern Nigeria with the highest
concentration of rare species, account for 60-80 percent of the
country's timber revenue losses, noted Sanwo.
</P>
<P>
Another major cause for the loss of forest resources is
desertification, which eats five kilometers of land per year and
could be attributable to national "voracious" land hunger and
uncoordinated urbanization, the U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
The wasteful use of international aid on deforestation and
degradation control by government agencies has led to the
stoppage of assistance, Sanwo added.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that current assistance through private
companies were being marred by greed.
</P>
<P>
Only education and enhanced research in renewable resources
would help combat environmental degradation, the official
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Blair Urges Labor MPs to Be Patient in Welfare Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair today urged potential rebels to be patient in government
reforms to the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
"We can't do it all at once. It will take time," Blair said in
a speech launching a new government initiative to help the poor
and socially excluded.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary vote is expected to expose the deep discontent
among Labor MPs about plans to cut benefits for single mothers by
up to 11 pounds (18 US dollars) a week.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, as many as 25 Labor MPs could vote against the
party unless a planned cut in benefit for single mothers is
reversed. Dozens of others are considering abstaining in protest.
</P>
<P>
Ministers are set to meet Labor backbenchers in an attempt to
prevent the most serious revolt against the government since Labor
took power in May.
</P>
<P>
The amendment to the Social Security Bill was sponsored by
Labor legislators Audrey Wise and Lynne Jones with opposition
Liberal Democrats. But given Labor's 179-seat parliamentary
majority it is certain to be defeated.
</P>
<P>
Blair, announcing a new Social Exclusion Unit to coordinate
government efforts to draw people back into society, said this was
just one of a string of initiatives to solve Britain's social
problems taken by the government since it defeated the
Conservatives in elections last May 1.
</P>
<P>
"Progress I promised and am delivering. Britain reborn in a day
or even a Parliamentary session -- I never did promise that and
could not deliver it," he said.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Banks Merger Threatens UK Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) - Up to 2,000 highly paid City
workers could lose their jobs after Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC)
and Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) announced today a full merger.
</P>
<P>
The merger will create the world's second largest commercial
bank, with assest of nearly 600 billion US dollars, after HSBC
Holding plc.
</P>
<P>
The combined bank aims to cuts costs at home, to match the top
German and Japanese banking groups in technology and to challenge
the market dominance of American global investment banks.
</P>
<P>
"The merger was aimed at remaining a leading global player in
five or ten years," UBS chief executive Mathis Cabiallavetta, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
City experts said that the move follows a series of bank
mergers in Britain, Japan, the United States and even Germany.
</P>
<P>
SBC and UBS said they would shed some 13,000 jobs overall over
the next three to four years if their merger is approved by their
respective shareholders in February.
</P>
<P>
There are fears that London could be badly hit because of
duplication in the bank's operations. Over 2,000 people in the
City will lose their jobs.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Faces More Competition Under WTO's Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The world Trade Organization's
recent rejection of U.S. claims of Japanese protectionism in
photographic film promises to heighten trade tensions and increase
competitive pressures on Eastman Kodak Co.
</P>
<P>
The WTO's verdict brought calls by Kodak for consideration of
new tariffs or other unilateral sanctions against Japan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wall Street Journal Monday, the decision was
also a setback for Kodak Chief Executive Geoage Fisher, who has
billed the case as critical not just for Kodak but for all U.S.
industries seeking to break down alleged "internal barriers" to
trade in Japan -- such as the locked-up film-distribution system
that Kodak portrayed in the WTO case.
</P>
<P>
Among the 21 claims made by Kodak against the Japanese, the
central one was that Japanese regulations and business practices
had deprived Kodak of fair access to the market and therefore
negated trade benefits granted to the U.S. in reduced tariffs over
many years. But the WTO panel ruled that the Japanese regulations
predated any lowered tariffs and therefore couldn't have negated
them.
</P>
<P>
Photography analysts say that Japan's Fuji Photo Film Co.
will feel even freer to attack Kodak in the U.S., where the two
have been waging a price war that has gained Fuji substantial
market share. Kodak has stagnant 10 percent share of Japan's
film business; Fuji has about 15 percent to 16 percent of the
dollars spent in the U.S. market, up from 11 percent a year ago,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Though a preliminary decision, it is unlikely to be reversed
before the final decision in January.
</P>
<P>
Kodak is trying to convince the U.S. government to impose
tariffs on Fuji's imported film, as well as on the chemicals that
Fuji must import from Japan to a new manufacturing facility it has
built in South Carolina. The company might also ask to impose the
antidumping penalties on Fuji, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Kodak, facing steadily eroding earnings and lower margins on
its film products, announced last month that it would cut 1
billion in costs over the next two years, and eliminate as many
as 10,000 jobs.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Capital Threatened by Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Some multi-million-U.S.-dollar
facilities constructed about 17 years ago in the new Nigerian
capital Abuja are now facing imminent threat of collapse if
urgent steps are not taken to salvage the situation.
</P>
<P>
The general condition of the facilities has deteriorated
drastically due to lack of routine maintenance and neglect by the
authorities, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The facilities, according to the report, comprise sewage and
drainage systems, road networks as well as water and electricity
supply installations.
</P>
<P>
As part of the measure to improve the situation, the
Authorities of the Federal Capital Territory have mapped out key
areas to start rehabilitating and improving such facilities as
roads, water and electricity supply equipment, it said.
</P>
<P>
Abuja was created in 1976 because of the inadequacies of Lagos
in the southwest coast to function as the federal capital.
</P>
<P>
Located in the center of the country, the Federal Capital
Territory covers an area of about 8,000 square kilometers, which
is two and half times the size of Lagos state.

Bringing people back into society had to be "written back into

The Social Exclusion Unit would tackle truancy in schools as a
top priority. But the Unit would also be charged with tackling
homelessness and problems on some of Britain's worst council
estates.

<P>
"I hope very much the Social Exclusion Unit will yield results
over months and years not days but its purpose is going to be
central to the values and ambitions of the new government."

<HEADLINE> Employment Tops UK Agenda as EU President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The most important job for the
United Kingdom Presidency of the European Union (EU) for the first
half of 1998 would be to create more jobs, British Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs Robin Cook said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Cook made the remark Monday afternoon in Brussels where he
got together with his EU counterparts to continue preparations for
the bloc's planned eastward enlargement ahead of an EU summit in
Luxembourg later this week.
</P>
<P>
After making a brief mention of jobs creation through education
and open market, the British foreign minister went on to call for
transparency of EU policies and institutions and "openness and
accessibility" of the EU through Internet.
</P>
<P>
He said the UK presidency would want to enhance the EU's fight
against organized crimes, particularly against drugs and computer
crimes.
</P>
<P>
He also said the EU presidency should assume the responsibility
for environment, adding that improvement of air quality was an
issue which deserved special attention.
</P>
<P>
On EU enlargement, Robin Cook said that the "screening" of all
the 11 applicants for EU membership would not slow down the EU's
process of negotiation with the six applicants in forefront -- the
Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and the divided island
of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, proposed in
July that the EU should start talks with the six applicants which
were considered most advanced in economic and political reforms.
</P>
<P>
But this would leave the other five applicants -- Latvia,
Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania -- in the EU's waiting
room.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg summit is expected to decide whether or not to
begin entry talks only with the six applicants on the fast lane or
with all the applicants.

American delegation led by Congressman Charles B. Rangel that he
was pleased with the ever growing relations between the two
countries.

toward the development endeavors of Ethiopia with special
emphasis to the socio-economic, cultural and educational sectors.

is optimistic that the involvement of the U.S. business community

steadily grow and that Ethiopia would do everything necessary to
this end.
</P>
<P>

from the U.S. would further strengthen the existing ties between
the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urged to Overhaul Teachers' Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian educationist today
called for a total overhaul of teacher's education to improve the
training and supply of science and technology teachers in the
country.
</P>
<P>
A program for the training of emergency teachers in science
and technology could not be ruled out if Nigeria was to enter the
21st century with hope and confidence, said Prof. Dibu Ojerinde,
registrar of National Board for Educational Measurement in Minna,
Niger state.
</P>
<P>
Teachers' education in Nigeria has been defective since the
advent of western education, particularly the curriculum which is
devoid of science content, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This resulted in producing teachers who had little or no
knowledge of science. The teacher education curriculum showed
emphasis on arithmetic only and mathematics with all its
importance left out," the News Agency of Nigeria quoted the
professor as saying.
</P>
<P>
While calling on the government to professionalize teaching
and give teachers a special salary scale, Ojerinde pointed out
that the quality of science graduates must also improve.
</P>
<P>
"Several graduates can hardly communicate scientific knowledge
in meaningful ways to their pupils or hardly recognize scientific
apparatus and equipment, talk less of having ability to mount up
experiments or demonstrations in school laboratories," he said.
</P>
<P>
This had led to ill-prepared teachers teaching ill-prepared
pupils and under-achievement in science, he told a lecture
organized by the Science Teachers' Association of Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Labor Party Differs Over Peace Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Labor Party leader
Ehud Barak said here today that only formal decisions of the party
can represent its positions on the issues of Golan Heights and the
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting of top Labor officials in
response to a statement by Shimon Peres, former Labor leader and
prime minister of the Labor government, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
While praising Peres as a great statesman who has won the
respect of all party members, Barak said that it is the party as
an institution that decides the positions on such issues as Golan
Heights and Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Labor convention held in Tel Aviv, Peres strongly
advocated a Palestinian state and the return of the Golan Heights
to Syria to realize a lasting and comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
"If we want a Jewish state, then we need to have a non-Jewish
state right alongside it, not just some vague entity. We need what
is explicitly and unequivocally a Palestinian state," said Peres.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that Syrian President Hafez al-Assad "wants peace,
but he won't make peace in return for only part of the Golan
Heights. If we put this off, the price (Israel has to pay) will
not decrease, not even in 10 years."
</P>
<P>
The Golan Heights, part of Syrian territory, was occupied by
Israel during the 1967 Six-day War.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the meeting of Labor's top officials, some key
members of the party criticized Barak for siding with the current
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and trying to
stage a "one man show" on the issues of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Peres, a leading figure of Israel's former Labor government in
reaching the Oslo Accord with the Palestine Liberation
Organization in 1993, is a firm advocate of realizing peace with
the Arab neighbors.

Madeleine K. Albright arrived here tonight on a two-day working
visit to further ties with Ethiopia and discuss African issues.
</P>
<P>
The visiting U.S. secretary of state is expected to meet
senior government officials including Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
and Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin for talks to this end,
according to the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Albright will also meet Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary general

Africa and the Great Lakes" here on Tuesday morning to African
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is the first leg of her seven-nation African tour
which also includes Uganda, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of

U.S. attaches importance to the role of Ethiopia in Africa's
affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended to establish an UN support group to
replace the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern
Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) after UNTAES
completes its mandate before January 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said UNTAES has
successfully achieved the basic objectives for which it was
established and has completed those tasks within its power.
</P>
<P>
He said although much has achieved by the parities in the
region, full implementation of Croatian commitments remains
incomplete. Since October, the Government of Croatia has made a
major effort to meet those commitments and to reassure its
citizens. The performance of the past two months should be the
baseline from which additional efforts are made.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General hoped that the termination of UNTAES on
January 15 1998 would not jeopardize the results of two years of
intensive international investment and effort in the region.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the Security Council establish a support group
of 180 civilian police monitors whose task would be continue to
monitor the performance of the Croatian police in the Danube
region, particularly in connection with the return of displaced
persons.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said this would include monitoring investigation
by the Croatian police of any allegation of police misconduct
related to the return of displaced persons to the region and the
provisions of limited on-the-job training to improve the
professional capability of the local police.

ATHENS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said today that Athens' position in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had been promoted after the
agreement last week on the alliance's new structure.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today, Tsohatzopoulos said that
Greece had for the first time acquired the right of veto in the
alliance which Athens withdrew from in 1974 and rejoined in 1980.
</P>
<P>
He complained several days ago that for the past decades,
Greece had been regard as "a second-class member" because the
alliance's old structure allowed Turkey to use a veto on a series
of important issues.
</P>
<P>
Under NATO's new military structure, a headquarters will
function in Naples, Italy for NATO's southern flank, with one
regional subheadquarters in Greece, Italy, Spain and Turkey. The
subheadquarters in Larissa, Greece, will have a Greek commander
and 55 percent of its staff will all be Greek nationals.
</P>
<P>
Greece's participation in the new NATO structure, he said,
would promote the desired policies of security, stability and
cooperation in the greater region of the Balkans, trans-Caucasia
and the Black Sea.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Chides Developed Nations over Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today chided developed
countries for breach of faith and lack of leadership in providing
financial and technological commitment required to mitigate
climate change all over the world.
</P>
<P>
It then urged developed countries to commit themselves to
serious technology cooperation and redeem their financial pledges
without any conditionality.
</P>
<P>
These are the highlights of a speech at the ongoing World
Climate Change Conference in Tokyo today, delivered by Adegoke
Adegoroye, director-general of Nigeria's Federal Environmental
Protection Agency (FEPA).
</P>
<P>
Noting that an ad hoc group was set up in Berlin in 1995 to
embark on the negotiation of a protocol on world climate change,
the FEPA chief said the group had become necessary because some
developed countries had not demonstrated leadership.
</P>
<P>
"Eight sessions of the ad hoc group from Berlin to Tokyo, it
has yet to be proved to the international community that these
major developed countries are committed to the principles set
forth within the context of the framework Convention on Climate
Change," he said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria supported the establishment of a compensation fund
currently being proposed as a means of limiting emissions of
green house gases blamed for global warming, he said.
</P>
<P>
While praising some developed countries which "have taken
giant steps in stabilizing their emission to 1990 levels", the
FEPA chief urged the others "who have breached faith to be more
committed to the principle of the convention for the sake of
humanity".
</P>
<P>
In this respect, it would not be fair to require further
commitment from the developing countries, he said, adding that
doing this "is like asking the hungry to feed the overfed."

MOSCOW, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has said that Russia will take part in the handling of chemical
weapons sunk in the Baltic Sea, in the Skagerrak and Kattegat
straits, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has instructed the interdepartmental commission for
chemical disarmament to participate in the preparation and
implementation of an international program to deal with the
aftermath of the burial of chemical weapons sunk in the above
areas.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrahemsky told reporters today
that Russia has sufficient cause to draw the conclusion that the
situation in the areas where chemical weapons have been sunk is
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Russian experts believe that extensive pollution in the Baltic
Sea and the North Sea may become a reality within the next few
years, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
Nobody (besides Russia) is planning to raise the issue of some
historical responsibility of particular sides for the burial (of
chemical weapons), Yastrahemsky said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the quantity of toxic substances sunk in the
Baltic Sea is comparable with the overall stocks of the United
States and Russia due to be destroyed in line with the Chemical
Weapons Convention.
</P>
<P>
Russia alone has technology allowing a real settlement of this
problem with minimal costs, he noted.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul Aziz said here today that the convening of an Islamic summit
is particularly important at a time when Muslims need unity most.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince was commenting on the eighth summit of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), which is to be held here
Tuesday, in an arrival statement at Tehran airport.
</P>
<P>
He said that Muslims all over the world bless this meeting and
are placing their hopes, expectations and sufferings on it.
</P>
<P>
"We shall listen to all topics raised in this meeting with
conscious hearts and good response to whatever serves Islam,
Muslims and world peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
The summit, expected to be attended by leaders of the 55 OIC
members, will examine issues concerned with the Islamic world,
besides bilateral discussions.
</P>
<P>
His visit to Iran is the first by a Saudi leader ever since the
founding of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979. The bilateral
relations have been marred by issues like territorial and
political disputes.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif reportedly
said earlier that the summit will be an opportunity to enhance
relations among the participant countries, expressing the hope
that it will offer a chance for further strengthening relations
with Saudi Arabia.

<P>
This is the first meeting between the defense ministers of the

Dominiguez told reporters after the meeting he had failed to

embargo against Argentina imposed since 1982.
</P>
<P>
"We want to delete any restriction in the area of defense, but
no position was adopted," Dominiguez said, adding "We see it as a
political fact. The elimination of the embargo would reflect very
clear political progress (between Britain and Argentina)."
</P>
<P>
British government officials were quoted by the BBC television
as describing the talks as "friendly and constructive".
</P>

The two defense chiefs also exchanged views on international
peacekeeping, one British official said.

It was reported that both Britain and Argentina are currently

Education has announced.
</P>

<P>
ANKARA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will explain its
controversial military cooperation with Israel at the upcoming
summit of Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC), according to a
Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here, Sermet Atacanli said
that Turkey will clarify its position on the Turkish-Israeli
military cooperation so as to clear up misunderstandings of the
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Syria, two Arab neighbors of Turkey, have reportedly
prepared a motion for the OIC summit calling for a collective
condemnation of Ankara's closer military ties with the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
"The references in the resolution did not quite reflect the
truth of the issues," Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Turkey's cooperation with Israel in defense
and military fields is not directed against any other country.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel will head an official delegation at the eighth OIC summit
scheduled to be held Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly increasing military contacts between Turkey and
Israel have aroused grave concerns among the Arab countries in
the Middle East, which accused Turkey of betraying the interests
of the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel signed two defense and military training
agreements last year to allow joint warplanes exercises in each
other's airspace.

<HEADLINE> EU FMs Fail to Reach Compromise on Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign
ministers tonight failed to reach a compromise they had hoped to
find on how to launch the bloc's eastward enlargement drive
without creating new divisions on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Major questions on the issue, which remain to be solved, will
have to wait until the upcoming EU summit which is going to be
held in Luxembourg Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders are expected at the summit to work out an
invitation list for potential EU new members and the appropriate
treatment which should be given to Turkey, whose application for
EU membership has been complicated by human rights concerns.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat, which asked not to be identified, said today that
it was "really difficult" for the EU foreign ministers to reach
agreement on the two major issues -- an invitation list for the
first wave of EU expansion and how to console the applicants left
out.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, proposed in
July that the EU should start entry talks next year with the six
countries considered most advanced in economic and political
reforms -- Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia
and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, Sweden and Denmark expressed their concern that the
process would create new divisions across Europe by leaving the
other five applicants -- Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania and
Slovakia -- in the EU's waiting room.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg summit is expected to decide whether or not to
begin entry talks with the six applicants on the fast track or
with all the 11 applicants.
</P>
<P>
The ministers were discussing a compromise whereby full
negotiations would only start with Cyprus and the five former
Communist countries, but the others' cases would be "screened"
from the start to make them feel involved.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining that Turkey meets none of the political criteria
laid down by the EU as a potential member, Greece was still
opposed to the inclusion of Turkey in the planned European
Conference of EU candidate countries.
</P>
<P>
"If it is tailored to cater for our relations with Turkey, I
believe that these relations should develop on the level of
substance and not on the level of appearances," Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, the chances of Turkey's candidature for EU membership
being finally acknowledged has increased in recent weeks since
Germany, an initial opponent, moved in favor.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman: Turkish Military Operation in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The scale of the Turkish
military operation being carried out in northern Iraq has been
exaggerated by the press, a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly news briefing, Sermet Atacanli said the
Turkish troops are launching a small-scale cross-border action
against the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
"The effective strength of the troops involved in the action
has been exaggerated," Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
Around 20,000 Turkish government troops poured across the
Turkish-Iraqi border to round up some 1,000 PKK rebels who
gathered there for the past weeks, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Atacanli failed to reveal how many government troops
are involved in the action.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the ongoing operation is part of
Ankara's efforts to wipe out the PKK rebels who pose a serious
threat to Turkey's border security.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity will be fully
respected during the action, he said, adding that the Turkish
troops will withdraw from the region as soon as their objective is
achieved.
</P>
<P>
"As we said many times, Turkey does not envisage a permanent
military presence in northern Iraq," Atacanli stressed.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Ministry Saturday issued a statement condemning
Turkey's invasion of northern Iraq, demanding an immediate
pull-out of the Turkish troops.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has lost its effective control over northern Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War in which it was defeated by the
U.S.-led multinational forces.
</P>
<P>
Ankara launches cross-border incursions every now and then with
an aim to wipe out the camps of the PKK, a group fighting against
the government for independence in southeast Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Ankara's frequent military operations in northern Iraq has
negatively affected its relations with Arab countries, observers
noted.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan recommended prompt dispatch of a technical team to
Sierra Leone to assess what role the United Nations could play to
help in the implementation of the Conakry Agreement.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said the coup of
May, 25, 1997 was a serious blow to Sierra Leone and also to the
subregion. Sierra Leone and its people have suffered greatly from
the overthrow of the democratically elected government and
continue to suffer harm from its effects on their security and
living conditions.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said it is evident the international
community is determined that the coup must be reversed and the
constitutional order restored as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said the signing of the Conakry Agreement was a
significant step towards resolving the crisis in Sierra Leone.
However, despite some encouraging indications, little concrete
progress has been made so far in the implementation of the
agreement which should be pursued with a sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the military, political and humanitarian aspects of
the agreement requires further clarification and negotiation, as
well as the early formulation of the practical modalities for its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations should be prepared to take an active
part in such negotiations and to help yo assure the proper
implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
With the purpose, the UN chief recommended sending of a
technical team to the country.
</P>
<P>
In his report, he also requested his special envoy for Sierra
Leone to make arrangements to reopen a small liaison office in
Sierra Leone subject to acceptable security conditions and the
availability of funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers stopped their search
and rescue works Monday night at the site of a deadly air crash in
the Siberian city of Irkutsk, an official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The death toll of the crash, by an An-124 military cargo last
Saturday, reached 66, Minister for Emergency Situations Sergei
Shoigu was quoted as saying by the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the 28 people unaccounted for on the ground were
still unknown, Shoigu said, noting that "most probably it will be
hardly possible to identify more than two-thirds of them."
</P>
<P>
Alexander Kamenski, head of the regional department for
emergency situations and civil defense, refuted some media reports
that there were more than 23 people on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State military inspector-secretary of the Russian
Security Council Andrei Kokoshin warned against drawing "hasty
conclusions" about the results of the aircrash.
</P>
<P>
One should wait until the official outcome of the
investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The An-124 crashed in a residential district of Irkutsk only a
few seconds after its take-off from the airfield.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin flew to the crash
site on the other day to probe the tragedy. More than 1,600 people
took part in the rescue operation, the report said.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Causes Light Damages to S. California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The weekend's powerful
Pacific storm hit Southern California's Orange County the hardest,
but causing only light damages to local residents.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino-related storm, starting to sweep across Southern
California Friday, dumped nearly eight inches of rain in Laguna
Beach, Orange County. Scores of houses and mobile homes were
damaged, but most of them were minor, limiting the direct damages
to about 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A 40-year-old mother of five died after she got down a mountain
to pick up her youngest son. Her body was discovered by rescue
workers in the Angeles National Forest.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of further injuries or drownings, despite
several unconfirmed reports of people and children being swept
away by churning waters, said emergency officials.
</P>
<P>
The light damages might be attributed to sound preparations for
the storm before the weekend, when teams from the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers cleared the Los Angeles River flood control channel
and swift-water rescue teams drilled in every county.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross officials also made door-to-door stops beforehand in
Laguna Beach, Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa, asking if people
needed help.
</P>
<P>
During the past two days, 49 residents spent night at a Red
Cross emergency shelter set up at a local school while 525 warm
meals were served to the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Rain stopped Monday but weather forecasters said a cold front
would follow and bring the chilliest temperature of the year to
Southern California by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Snow and freezing temperatures were already reported in local
mountains, which made driving hazardous on some California
highways.
</P>
<P>
Emergency teams and residents are preparing for the next storm,
which weather experts said would possibly arrive later this week.
</P>
<P>
For the United States, El Nino will make itself known by the
"intensity, frequency and location" of winter storms expected to
lash the southern tier of states from California to Florida from
mid-December to January, meteorologist said.

<HEADLINE> EU Grants Aid to Trans-European Energy Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union (EU), will grant 18 million
ECUs (about 22 million U.S. dollars) as further financial support
for trans-European energy networks.
</P>
<P>
The aid, intended for 16 feasibility studies to pave the way
for construction of these networks, was the second financial grant
approved by the EU this year in this field, said a press release
issued in Brussels Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This will help co-finance 11 trans-European electricity schemes
with 6.2 million ECUs (some 7.5 million dollars) and five studies on
trans-European gas projects with 11.8 million ECUs (about 14
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
"These trans-European networks play an essential role in future
Union energy policy, not only with regard to completion of the
internal energy market but also for our security of supply and
operational flexibility," Christos Papoutsis, EU energy
commissioner, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The aid will bring the total granted by the EU executive to
studies of this kind up to 50 million ECUs (some 60 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The electricity schemes receiving support will upgrade the
interconnections between Portugal and Spain, between Spain and
France and between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The schemes will also establish new interconnections between the
United Kingdom and Norway, between Sweden and Poland, between
central Europe and the Baltic zone and between central Europe and
eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The gas network projects will help reinforce the gas pipeline
and underground storage system in Austria, which is a key crossroad
for Europe's gas supplies, and to establish new underground storage
sites for natural gas in Spain and Ireland.

<HEADLINE> PGA Championship in HK to Decide Omega Order of Merit Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- For the second time in three
years, the race for golf's Omega Order of Merit title will be
decided at the 500,000 U.S. dollars Omega PGA Championship
starting at the scenic Clearwater Bay Golf and Country Club
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although any one of top ten players can still mathematically
win Asia's most prestigious golfing award after last week's Hong
Kong Open, the winner of the moneylist is actually more likely to
come from the top five money-earners.
</P>
<P>
Leading the challenge and strong favorite to win the title of
the four-day event, is the current Omega Order of Merit leader
Mike Cunning from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Following his joint ninth place finish at the Hong Kong Open,
Cunning heads the Order of Merit with 170,619 U.S. dollars in
prize money, 46,813 more than the second-placed Prayad Marksaeng,
31, of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Prayad's chances of catching up with the American rival
suffered a lot as he decided to skip the Hong Kong Open, which
allowed Cunning to steal even more ground over the two-time winner
on the 1997 circuit.
</P>
<P>
Lying in the third place on the Order of Merit with 107,091 US
dollars is India's Jeev Milkha Singh. Qualifying recently for
next year's PGA European Tour, Jeev has a disappointing week at
the Hong Kong Open, where he finished tied for 46th.
</P>
<P>
Back to defend his title this week, and still in with a slim
chance of securing the Order of Merit crown, is Gerry Norquist of
America. Norquist lies fifth on the Order ranking with 105,711
U.S. dollars, a mere three dollars behind compatriot Ted Purdy in
fourth place.
</P>
<P>
Norquist finished tied for 28th place in the Hong Kong Open,
and will looking to repeat his form earlier in the season when he
took the DFS Galleria Guam Open.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding in the 132-strong field from 22 countries and
regions is the 1996 Omega Order of Merit winner Kang Wook-soon
from South Korea. Having had a disappointing season to-date, Kang
showed signs of a return to form by finishing runner-up to New
Zealand's Frank Nobilo at the Hong Kong Open.
</P>
<P>
Among others to note were 1995 Omega OGA champion Yeh
Chang-ting from Chinese Taipei and Zaw Moe from Myanmar, winner of
the Singapore Open in August.
</P>
<P>
The Omega PGA Championship represents the final strokeplay
event of the 1997 Omega Tour, and the final Major of the Asian PGA
season.

<HEADLINE> China To Help More Farmers Escape Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China plans to allocate some
four million US dollars over the next three years to help some
60,000 farmers escape poverty, according to the State Science and
Technology Commission (SSTC).
</P>
<P>
The goal of the project, which involves a large number of poor
farmers living over a wide area, is to introduce advanced
technology to poverty-stricken regions in order to help farmers
develop resources more efficiently and raise the productivity of
local laborers.
</P>
<P>
Officials point to the fact that preparatory work has been
completed, and note that the United Nations Development Program
has donated 1.85 million US dollars to fund the project which
covers 10 counties in six provinces.
</P>
<P>
SSTC Vice-Minister Han Deqian said the project, the first of
its kind in China, will offer mortgage-free loans to
poverty-stricken families.
</P>
<P>
"Participating farmers will have access to free technical
training and long-term technical support," said Han, adding that
the government will help farmers sell their products.
</P>
<P>
China has reduced its rural poverty-stricken population from
250 million in 1978 to the current 58 million. Two decades of
effort has also reduced the poverty rate from 33.3 percent to 6.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
China's poverty-stricken population currently accounts for only
five percent of the worldwide total, compared to 25 percent only
20 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Elf Again Discovers Giant Oilfield off Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The French oil group
Elf-Aquitaine has discovered a giant offshore oilfield off the
coast of Angola, the daily Le Figaro reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield, 1,250 meters under water in the Guinea Gulf and
about 200 kilometers northwest of Luanda, is the group's third
biggest discovery in the "bloc 17" exploration zone since May 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is reportedly believed to contain more than 100 million
metric tons of oil, or about 730 million barrels of oil, which is
equivalent to one year's consumption by the French economy.
</P>
<P>
With such a huge reserve, it could probably be the most
fruitful one in the history of oil exploration, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In "bloc 17," Elf is the operator with 35 percent of the
shares, while its partners Esso has 20 percent, British Petroleum
16.67 percent, the Norwegian Statoil 13.33 percent, Norsk-Dydro 10
percent and the Belgian Fina 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The oil group scored its first discovery in May 1996 in "bloc
17" 1,350 meters under water. The oilfield, named "Girassol," was
regarded as an "elephant" with more than 660 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
Elf announced the discovery of a second oilfield, Dalia, in
August 1997 only three kilometers from "Girassol." Although no
official data have been published, it is circulated among oil
circles that it contains 100 million tons of oil, or 700 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, only four oil fields of such a scale have been
discovered by oil companies, and Elf joined in three of them, said
le Figaro.

LUANDA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Angola and the Congo Republic

the Angola News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>

areas when Angolan Minister of the Interior Andre Pitra Petroff
met his Congolese counterpart Piere Oba in Cabinda on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that not only the separatism groups of Cabinda
Province but also soldiers of the opposition of National Union

former Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko and former Congolese
President Pascal Lissouba have gathered along the common border
of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The presentation of troops is threatening to the security and
safety in the border areas, which is worrying the two governments
of Angola and Congo, the report added.
</P>
<P>
After investigations into the border situation by the joint
technical committee, the two ministers of the interior will meet

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said here today that the U.S. has today an
opportunity, unprecedent since African states gained their
independence, to build a true partnership in the Great Lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that "a successful effort will support peace and
the rule of law, promote good governance and democracy, and
encourage economic development and integration" in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Secretary of State was making a speech entitled "the
United States, Africa and the Great Lakes" before African
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
She said that the United States hopes to work with leaders
across the region in a Great Lakes justice initiative, to develop
judicial systems that are impartial, credible and effective.
</P>
<P>
She announced that the U.S. will provide 30 million US Dollars
to support national initiatives to train court and police
officials, re-build legal machinery and assist programs that
promote reconciliation and healing after conflict.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Albright
said that the end of Mobutu's repressive reign has opened a
historic opportunity for the Congolese people to achieve the
democracy, prosperity and peace they have been so long denied.
</P>
<P>
However, she stressed that the Kabila government has a great
distance to travel to meet the goals of constitutional reform,
democratic elections and economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
She revealed that the United States will contribute 10 million
US Dollars to the World Bank Trust Fund and said that through it,
the international community will support reconstruction projects
that reflect Congolese priorities.
</P>
<P>
She pledged that the United States is expanding aid and
is looking at the possibility of debt relief to the Congo.
</P>
<P>
On the aim of her current visit to Africa, Albright said she
came to Africa to open a dialogue with people from all parts of
Africa, whether they are powerful or impoverished, high officials
or refugees.
</P>
<P>
She said the new African leaders "are challenging the United
States and the international community to get over the
paternalism of the past, to stop thinking of its Africa policy as
a none-too-successful rescue service."
</P>
<P>
She said that the U.S. pledges its best efforts
to nurturing a new partnership that will work to the benefit of
Africans and Americans alike.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here last night for a visit to Ethiopia,
which is the first leg of her six-nation African tour. She will
leave here tomorrow morning.

<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China will carry out a series
of fieldwork projects concerning key scientific and economic
problems in order to promote scientific and economic development,
according to Lu Yongxiang, president of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Fieldwork serves as the foundation of scientific research
concerning resources, the environment, biology and agriculture, as
well as an important means for promoting high technology
application.
</P>
<P>
Lu told participants in the second CAS meeting on fieldwork,
which opened today in Beijing, that China's fieldwork should focus
on solving the key scientific and technological issues, including
global and regional climate changes, macrobiological evolution,
natural disasters, sustainable resources and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that thorough research of key issues will enable
China to further develop branches of learning such as resources
science, environmental and disaster science, macrobiological
science and oceanology.
</P>
<P>
Lu added that China should develop fieldwork stations into
national, and in some cases even the world bases for scientific
and technological experiments and research.
</P>
<P>
He called on Chinese scientists and technicians to focus on
problems related to food, the environment and health.
</P>
<P>
"We should also try to find a way to relieve poverty and ensure
the nation's prosperity," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
China will face pressing issues related to a growing population
and environmental deterioration in the forthcoming
century. China's population is expected to reach some 1.6 billion
by the year 2030, and the nation will suffer from a critical
shortage of resources such as arable land, water, and fuel.

</P>
<P>

<P>
With the opening of the new airport less than six months away,
HACTL Managing Director Anthony Charter confirmed that HACTL would

<P>
"After today's milestone, we will be embarking upon the final
stages of an aggressive construction schedule. It is our
intention to launch operations at Chek Lap Kok at 50 percent
capacity in April," he said.
</P>
<P>
SuperTerminal 1, at the cost of 8 billion HK dollars (1 billion
U.S. dollars), comprises a six-storey main terminal building with
a total floor area of 274,000 square meters and a two-storey
Express Center providing a further 46,000 square meters.

<HEADLINE> China Strives to Standardize Accounting Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A recent government document
vows that China will standardize basic accounting practices within
3-5 years.
</P>
<P>
The document also stipulates severe punishment for those found in
violation of the rules.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the campaign to rectify order within the
accounting sector yielded positive results during 1996, various
problems such as the falsification of statements, budgets, cost
estimates and profits have not as yet been fundamentally resolved,
according to the document, which was approved by the State Council
and jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Auditing
Administration, the Economic and Trade Commission, the
Administration of Taxation, and the Administration for Industry
and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, all sectors and departments should conduct random
audits and reexaminations, and violations must be dealt with
in a resolute manner," according to the document.
</P>
<P>
The document urges all units to maintain accurate accounting
records and stresses that state-owned enterprises must adopt
strict procedures for the use of funds for both consumption and
production.
</P>
<P>
"Basic accounting practices should be standardized within the
next 3-5 years," according to the document.
</P>
<P>
The document also stresses that leading officials are
responsible for the legitimacy and accuracy of balance sheets for
their respective units.
</P>
<P>
Officials from units with inappropriate accounting practices
and those who present falsified balance sheets or
infringe upon the rights of accountants will be held legally
accountable, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
It also urges taxation administrations at all levels to
strengthen management over both ordinary and value-added tax
invoices.

<P>
MACAO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Pop song lovers in China's
inland will be able to hear the voice of a Macao pop singer for
the first time in history next year.
</P>
<P>
Casimiro Pinto, a Macao pop singer, is to make a debut for
China's inland audiences when his first CD album is published next
May or June in cooperation with the China Records Company in
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
With a Portuguese father and a mother from Guangzhou, Pinto,
who works as an interpreter at a government department, will sing
in Portuguese and Standard Chinese (Putonghua) a song about the
return of Macao to the motherland in the new album, according to
an agreement signed by Pinto and the Guangzhou-based studio on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The song will be specially written for him, expressing the
feeling of a Macao-born Portuguese about the transition and return
of Macao," said Wu Songjin, a pop song composer and producer who
represents the China Records Company.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a piece of MTV program featuring the song will be
shot for him in Macao and Guangzhou. The program will be broadcast
both in China's inland television stations and Macao TV station.
</P>
<P>
Rita Santos, president of Pinto's promotion committee, said
that she hopes the coming album will help inland listeners know
better about Macao's culture, its people and history.
</P>
<P>
"Listeners in China's inland will be able to listen to the
'voice of Macao'," she said. "We consider the new album will
express the full confidence of Macao residents in their future and
their life after the handover of power in 1999."

<HEADLINE> China Hails Four-Party Talks on Korean Peninsula Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The first session of the
four-party talks being held here on the Korean Peninsula issue is
of great significance, said a senior Chinese diplomat on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It marks the formal beginning of the process toward a peace
mechanism for the peninsula, said Chinese Vice Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan in a key-note statement at the two-day talks.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue, among the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK), the Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China and
the United States, is scheduled to last through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Replacing the existing armistice mechanism with a new peace
mechanism through the talks, Tang said, undoubtedly has a positive
impact on the process toward a lasting peace on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"It is our sincere hope that all parties will treasure this
achievement, persist in dialogues and consultations" within the
framework of the talks, said the head of the Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
He also called for a peninsular peace accord "on the basis of
gradual improvement of relations and building mutual trust" among
the parties, so as to achieve the goal of the four-party talks.
</P>
<P>
"As a close neighbor of the Korean Peninsula," he said. "China
takes maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula as the
fundamental principle in its handling of Peninsular affairs."
</P>
<P>
"Over years, China has dedicated itself to maintaining peace
and stability there, endorsing the improvement of relations
between the North and South of Korea and supporting their
independent and peaceful reunification," he added.
</P>
<P>
China believes that the ultimate solution of the Korean issue
requires not only the reconciliation and mutual trust between the
DPRK and South Korea, but also the improved DPRK-U.S. relations,
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that the steady improvement of North-South
relations and DPRK-US relations will create a favorable atmosphere
and pave the way for further easing of tension and early
establishment of the peace mechanism on the peninsula," he said.

NEW YORK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Utah Jazz celebrated the
return of guard John Stockton on Monday with a 106-97 victory over
the Indiana Pacers in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
Stockton, the 36-year-old NBA's all-time leader in assists and
steals, made his debut of this season after undergoing
arthroscopic knee surgery in October and had 10 points and seven
assists.
</P>
<P>
"There were improvements every day and I wasn't even sure today
that I was going to play tonight," Stockton was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone welcomed his teammate by contributing 31 points for
the Jazz, who has not lost to the Pacers in nearly seven years.
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Tim Hardaway scored 23 points to lead the Heat to a
105-97 win over the New Jersey Nets, who lost for the third time
in four games.
</P>
<P>
Miami won for the sixth time in seven games and held an
opponent under 100 points for the sixth consecutive game to
improve to 10-2 at home.
</P>
<P>
In Orlando, Rony Seikaly scored 24 points and grabbed 15
rebounds to help the Magic to their fourth win in five games, a
95-86 triumph over the Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
The injury-plagued Magic won despite playing without All-Star
guard Penny Hardaway, who was placed on the injured list before
the game, and lost swingman Nick Anderson in the second quarter
with a broken bone in his left hand.
</P>
<P>
In Portland, Isaiah Rider scored 21 of his 26 points in the
second half to lead the Trail Blazers to a 105-99 victory over the
Los Angeles Lakers, who were led by Nick Van Exel's 24 points and
12 assists.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Builds Refuse Transfer Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A refuse transfer station
built inside a man-made cavern was opened here today, capable of
processing 1,000 tons of waste a day.
</P>
<P>
It was the second waste transfer station built on the Hong Kong
Island, and the other one has already been in operation in the
east part of the Island. Their total handling capacity of waste
added up to more than 2,200 tons, sufficient to accommodate all
waste generated on the Island.
</P>
<P>
The new station was constructed at a cost of 640 million HK
dollars (82 million US dollars), and its annual operation cost is
estimated to reach 56 million HK dollars (7 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
An official of environmental protection said today that noise
and odor nuisance could be greatly reduced since the station was
built inside a man-made cavern and installed with waste water
treatment facility and odor removal equipment.
</P>
<P>
All waste received would be compacted into specially designed
sealed containers and transferred by vessels to a landfill site in
the New Territory for final disposal, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Urges Bosnian Parties to Implement Dayton Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel Tuesday urged the Bosnian parties to carry on the
implementation of the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel made this call at a two-day international conference on
Bosnia peace which opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Those who want reconciliation will receive our help. Those who
do not implement Dayton accord, who seek to obstruct the recovery
effort, will bear the consequences," he said at the conference
which is held annually to review the implementation of the accord.
</P>
<P>
Despite progress in disarmament, elections, return of refugees
and economic reconstruction over the past few years, there was
still a lack of will among the Bosnian parties to take the
necessary decisions in building the common institutions as the
basis for further development, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the institutions included a single passport and
nationality law, a common currency, uniform car registration
plates and a law on the functions of the Bosnian Council of
Ministers.
</P>
<P>
He also called it "unacceptable" that most of the indicted war
criminals including Radovan Karadzic were still free in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international community would not back off
until all of the accused had been brought to account.
</P>
<P>
The conference, attended by representatives from 51 countries
and 21 interanational organizations, will also discuss the
deficiencies in Bosnian judicial and law enforcement system and
will boost measures to fight corruption in the country.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: More Countries Get Wired to the Net </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The year 1997 has seen more
countries getting wired and more people jumping online as computer
networking gains greater momentum throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Such terms as internet, intranet and extranet are acquiring
more and more currency among political leaders, business
executives and the man in the street.
</P>
<P>
While the developed nations try to sharpen their competitive
edge in the networking business, the developing ones, becoming
more aware of the huge "Net" potential, are trying desperately to
catch up.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays you can do virtually anything in the virtual world of
cyberspace. Networking has breathed new life into almost all
facets of life, from industry, agriculture, telecommunications,
transportation to education and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the value of electronic commerce conducted over the
Net totaled nearly 3 billion U.S. dollars. The value is expected
to increase annually by 100 percent in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet is going to change everything, and at a pace we
have never seen before," said John Chambers, CEO of the
California-based Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
In Canada and the United States where the net was born,
Internet use doubled over the 18 months ending in March, according
to a survey by CommerceNet/Nielsen Media Research,
</P>
<P>
Almost one out of four -- 23 percent of people over the age of
16 -- in the two countries now use the Internet as opposed to only
10 percent in the fall of 1995, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, somewhat lagging behind in recent years,
has proposed laws to promote the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, plans to
increase investment in research and development, develop computer
networks and encourage start-up ventures to help make the EU more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, the region that witnessed the fastest economic growth,
networking is also booming.
</P>
<P>
At the end of October, China had more than 100 Internet service
providers and 600,000 online users, said Lu Xinquan of the
Information Task Force under the country's State Council.
</P>
<P>
China plans to inject an annual 100 billion yuan (about 12
billion dollars) in 1996-2000 to build fiber-optic cables and
satellite communications facilities.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, all residents of Singapore will be
connected by a high-speed, broad-band network.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's construction of a Multimedia Super Corridor in and
around the capital of Kuala Lumpur is gaining steam. Cyberjava
City, a high-tech manufacturing area where homes and buildings
will be equipped from the start to send, receive and process
electronic information, held a ground-breaking ceremony recently.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, still struggling to rebuild itself from the rubble of
war and unrest, established a full-time Internet connection in May.
</P>
<P>
Africa is also stepping up Internet development. Five West
African nations passed a declaration in April calling for
expedited establishment of the Net in the region.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless a formidable disparity still remains between the
developed and the developing countries in computer networking.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by the International
Telecommunications Union in September, two-thirds of the world's
Internet users are in the United States and Canada, 21.9 percent
on the European continent, 6.3 percent in Asia and 3.7 percent in
Oceania. Internet users in Latin America and Africa account for
only 1 percent and 0.6 percent of the total respectively.
</P>
<P>
Although the yawning gap cannot be bridged easily or soon, the
developing countries are not without opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries can embark from a better established
starting point and thereby avoid the pitfalls encountered by their
developed counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Networking needs many specialized talents. Developing nations
such as China and India, with a large number of specialists in
computer softwares and related fields pooled over the years, are
capable of competing with the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Networking technology has advanced the development of network
computers, the production of which is relatively simpler. The
developing countries are able to capitalize on this opportunity to
develop and consolidate their fledgling computer industry and
related sectors.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the developing countries recognize the
importance of information technology to economic growth and have
put net development on the top of their agenda.
</P>
<P>
As Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad put
it: "Eventually the entire world will have to come to use this new
technology, which seems to have no respect for borders."
</P>
<P>
And such a world online will surely be a smaller, and better,
place to live.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Chief in Paris to Discuss Arms Inspection in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of the United
Nations Special Commission in charge of disarmament in Iraq
(UNSCOM), Richard Butler, held talks with French Defense Minister
Alain Richard Tuesday in Paris on the role of UNSCOM in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has called for the increase of the number of French experts
in the UNSCOM, which has been so far dominated by English-speaking
and Nordic countries.
</P>
<P>
No official declaration was made after the meeting, but Agence
France-Presse (AFP) said that the talks should be focused on the
methods of functioning of the UNSCOM and the question of access by
UNSCOM inspectors to the presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
Butler will hold talks later Tuesday with French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine and other French Foreign Ministry
officials, said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM chief will fly to Baghdad for the first time in a
few days since the crisis between Iraq and UNSCOM erupted in late
October, in a bid to persuade Iraqi government to let UNSCOM
experts enter presidential sites, which are so far banned from
inspections.
</P>
<P>
France has called on Iraq to show restraint and moderation, and
rejected Iraqi insistence on excluding UNSCOM members from
presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
The French government hoped that a
pragmatic solution can be found for the stand-off between Baghdad
and the international community, and wished the United Nations to
offer Iraq a perspective for the lifting of the economic sanctions
imposed against Baghdad since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Guizhou to Draft Law to Protect Rare Cranes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
Province will work out detailed plans to deal with the environmental
deterioration of its most famous wetland nature reserve,
according to a senior local official.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial People's Congress will draft Guizhou's first
regulation to ban illegal zinc smelteries around the Caohai Nature
Reserve, according to Wang Shusen, vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 black-necked cranes normally migrate from the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to Caohai's grassy marshes which cover
25 sq. km. in poverty-stricken Weining County, according to a
nature reserve official.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that the nature reserve faces the possibility of
severe pollution if environmental protection departments fail to
take decisive action.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that any failure to act will deprive rare cranes
and other migratory waders of their winter habitat in Caohai.
</P>
<P>
"Approximately 33 percent of Weining's wastewater pours into
Caohai without any form of treatment," said an official
with the Guizhou Environmental Protection Bureau (GEPB).
</P>
<P>
He noted that the existing pollution currently threatens the
life of migratory cranes.
</P>
<P>
Wang estimated that sewage disposal plants will cost the
province some two million yuan (240,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 farmers living in close proximity to the nature
reserve earn their livelihoods from farming. The large population
and limited natural resources in the Caohai area present a
challenge to both conservation and development, according to the
GEPB official.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey carried out by the GEPB revealed that zinc
smelteries near the wetland are an even greater threat to the
nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
Smoke, dust and sulphur dioxide emissions from the 211 furnaces
have harmed both birds and local residents. Waste gases and other
heavy metal elements from the smelteries will cause even greater
environmental damage in the future, according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Peace Conference Opens in Bonn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- An international conference opened
here Tuesday to review the implementation of the Dayton accord for
bringing peace back to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The annual event, the third of its kind, is aimed at increasing
international pressure on the Bosnian leadership for better
compliance with the November 1995 accord.
</P>
<P>
Its organizers also intend to bring new impetus to a
"self-sustainable" political and economic development in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are delegates from 51 countries and 21
international organizations, including Bosnian presidency members,
Alija Izetbegovic, Kresimir Zubak and Momcilo Krajisnik, as well
as the president of the Srpska Republic, Biljana Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
To see that commitments made at Dayton, the United States, were
not being honored, said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, is
"insufferable" for the international community.
</P>
<P>
The world community has been providing major funding, personnel
and military resources to Bosnia, Kinkel, the host of the two-day
meeting, noted prior to its opening.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever cooperates with the peace process will be rewarded,
whoever sows hatred and discord will be punished financially," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel and his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine traveled to
Sarajevo last Thursday to push for long-overdue decisions by the
Bosnian leadership on a series of issues before the Bonn meeting.
</P>
<P>
These included a single passport and citizenship law, a
common currency, national auto-registration numbers and the
composition of the Bosnian national council of ministers.
</P>
<P>
If the Bosnians wanted continued international aid, said
Kinkel, they should not show up in Bonn empty-handed.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Macao experts today warned
residents to be careful but not panic over the bird flu that has
killed children in neighboring Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
No bird flu case has been found in Macao and people should stay
calm, experts from the Macao Nurses' Association and the Public
Health Department said.
</P>
<P>
But they did urge people to be careful in contacting birds,
take care of proper personal and environmental hygiene and cook
their food thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
Leung Iok Va, deputy-secretary-general of the Macao Nurses'
Association, told the Macao Daily News today that there is no
effective way of prevention as the cause and way of transmission
of the bird flu on human beings have not been found.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local dealers of imported fowls said imported
chickens, ducks and geese are safe to eat because they have passed
strict examinations before they are put on the local market.
</P>
<P>
The poultry imported from China's inland areas are from a
different source from those imported by Hong Kong, they said.
While Hong Kong's imports mostly come from Shenzhen, Macao's are
mainly from Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Jiangmen cities.
</P>
<P>
The experts want local residents to buy poultry only at
licensed food stalls, saying those sold by illegal mobile vendors
might be unsafe.

BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Asian Olympic chief expressed
concern over delays in construction of the main sport complex for
the 1998 Asian Games, radio reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah, President of the Olympic Council of
Asia (OCA), said he remained confident that Bangkok would host the
games to be held next December.

<HEADLINE> Australian Voters Cool on Poll For Constitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- More than half of Australia's
voters have rejected a poll on selecting delegates to next year's
constitutional convention which will decide whether Australia
would become a republic.
</P>
<P>
Latest turnout figures show that only 44.2 percent, or 5.3
million of Australia's almost 12 million registered voters replied
to the voluntary postal poll, a trial one for selecting half of
the delegates to February's constitutional convention.
</P>
<P>
The figures show a late rush of votes, with the ACT (Australian
Capital Territory) and Victoria state having the highest
participation rate of 49.14 percent and 48.95 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
But even with a late surge in ballots, national turnout was
expected to remain well below 50 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The returns signal public apathy for the convention, which will
see 76 elected and 76 appointed delegates attempt to thrash out a
consensus on an alternative constitutional system for Australia.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of a republic were today confident of a positive
result. They said more people voted from the electorates of the
Labor Party, most members in which favor a republic, while turnout
in regional and National Party electorates was low. The National
Party leaders are for the current constitutional monarchy system.
</P>
<P>
But all sides were disappointed by the low response.
</P>
<P>
Opposition spokesman Nick Bolkus said up to 1.5 million, mainly
younger Australians who had changed address since the last
election, did not receive a ballot paper.
</P>
<P>
"The major problem is that the result opens up the possibility
that whoever loses could then play the spoiler, by saying any
result is not truly representative," Bolkus said.
</P>
<P>
Special Minister of State Nick Minchin, who is responsible for
the republic issue, said in a statement that "the level of voter
turnout reflects the level of interest in the question of a
republic, and the intensity of the campaigns by the various groups
and individuals contesting the election."
</P>
<P>
"It must also be remembered that this election was to chose
half of the delegates to attend the convention. It was not to
decide the issue of whether or not Australia should become a
republic, which can only be determined by a compulsory attendance
vote in a referendum."
</P>
<P>
First results from the poll are due late tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Power Supplier Opens Office in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China Light &AMP; Power Company
Limited (CLP), which supplies the bulk of Hong Kong's electricity,
today opened its representative office in southern China's
Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
Located in Guangzhou, the capital city of Guangdong, the new
office is to help promote CLP's interest in the growing power
industry in the province and its long-term development in southern
China, sources from the company said.
</P>
<P>
Michael Kadoorie, CLP's chairman, said: "CLP has a
long-standing, strong business relationship with southern China."
As early as the beginning of this century, CLP was supplying
power in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
In 1979 when China started to adopt the open policy, the power
company interconnected its transmission system with the Guangdong
grid. Ever since then, it has participated in such projects as
China's first nuclear power station and the Guangzhou pumped
storage power station.
</P>
<P>
"Looking ahead, we have full confidence in the continued growth
of southern China," he said, "the establishment of the Guangzhou
office demonstrates again our firm commitment and determination to
play a key role in the power business in the region."

CHANGCHUN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Gao En, a 73-year-old farmer
in Nong'an County of northeast China's Jilin Province, started
collecting various kinds of newspapers in 1960, enabling him to
set up a household reading room.
</P>
<P>
Gao's reading room, with a floor space of more than 40 square
meters, now has more than 2,000 books in 10 varieties,
127 various publications and 250 books of newspaper clippings. The
reading room has been used by 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Gao's reading room is one of the 2,000 medium-sized reading
rooms in the province.
</P>
<P>
Tiexi Village in Nong'an County established a reading
association in 1994, where local farmers can learn about what
happened in the country, the world and, more importantly, in

The Chinese government has launched the "Book Store Project" in
rural areas to improve farmers' cultural quality so as to raise
agricultural productivity.
</P>
<P>
Lin Guocai is one of the beneficiaries of the
project. Vegetable growing technology has ensured his income will
reach 40,000 yuan (about 4,787 US. dollars) this year, though his

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The 36 newly elected deputies
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) to China's
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) have voiced their readiness
to participate in the management of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
The 36 were elected by the Election Conference through secrete
balloting Monday. This was the first time for Hong Kong to elect
NPC deputies as an independent constituency.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the election results were announced in Hong Kong,
newly elected NPC deputies were busy granting interviews to
newsmen outside the election hall or in their offices.
</P>
<P>
Of the 36 NPC deputies, four are females including Rita Fan Hsu
Lai-tai, president of the Provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
She said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua that she very
much cherished the chance to be a Hong Kong NPC deputy.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of the election, the first of its kind
in Hong Kong's history, she said involvement in the election is
an embodiment of performing a Chinese citizen's obligation
entrusted by the HKSAR Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
She said, "I am a Chinese. The best I hope for is to make China
strong. To this end, I will work hard and serve as a 'bridge'
between Hong Kong and the inland areas."
</P>
<P>
"The paramount task for me to be a good NPC deputy is to
acquaint myself with the operations of the NPC and the latest
progress of the inland areas," she added.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tsang Hin Chi, chairman of the Goldlion Holdings Limited,
said that he was pleased to see that the Election Conference
members and the nominees encouraged one another, creating a very
good atmosphere for the election.
</P>
<P>
As a newly elected HK deputy to the NPC, he said he will fully
abide by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and
the HKSAR Basic Law, and will not interfere in the affairs which
the SAR administers on its own.
</P>
<P>
"I will try my best to continue to play the role of a bridge in
boosting economic links between China's inland areas and Hong
Kong and promote their mutual understanding and respect under the
two different systems," he said.

<HEADLINE> Efficiency Initiative for HK's Export Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A Supply Chain Management
(SCM) initiative was introduced here today to increase the
competitiveness and efficiency of Hong Kong's export companies.
</P>
<P>
A road map on SCM in global trade was launched by the Hong Kong
Article Numbering Association (HKANA), following a study
supervised by the Export SCM Steering Committee comprising leading
Hong Kong export companies.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by Kurt Salmon Associates Management
Consultants (KSA) for the HKANA, highlighted the fact that for
Hong Kong's export industry to remain successful, exporters must
do business differently from today's traditional ways.
</P>
<P>
The companies need to adopt SCM to improve efficiency, with the
need for change driven by the retail trends in major Western
consumer product markets.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Germany and Britain, traditional
pre-season orders are increasingly replaced by speed sourcing
(last-minute ordering) and more replenishment orders
(within-season ordering).
</P>
<P>
"SCM is a way of conducting business that requires trading
partners to collaborate and integrate many aspects of their
operations, using global standard practices and technologies, in
order to effectively manage the supply and demand of goods and
services," said Anna Lin, chief executive of the HKANA, a member
of an international organization promoting SCM.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong companies need to invest in electronic commerce and
communications system in order to decrease cycle time and
inventory overheads, she said.
</P>
<P>
The study suggested that timely implementation of SCM in Hong
Kong could lead to annual savings of 9.2 billion HK dollars (1.2
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A series of workshops and seminars will be held by HKANA next
year to improve the local awareness of the importance of
SCM.

<HEADLINE> ILO Calls For Effective Workers' Benefit Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Michel Hansenne,
director-general of the International Labor Organization (ILO)
today warned of the potentially grave social consequences of the
financial turmoil in Asia and called for effective unemployment
benefit systems for workers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a three-day ILO Asian regional
meeting here, Hansenne also called on representatives of ILO Asian
and Pacific members to facilitate worker redeployment and increase
opportunities for education and skills acquisition.
</P>
<P>
He said if the sudden onset of the current economic crisis is
not quelled speedily, it is likely to see strong negative impact
on the real economy and hence on employment and the welfare of
workers.
</P>
<P>
The social consequences of a sharp increase in unemployment
could be catastrophic because of the weakness of the existing
system of social protection in most parts of Asia, Hansenne said.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is typically no system of unemployment
benefits or mechanism for facilitating re-training and
redeployment. Consequently, jobless workers will have to fend for
themselves and rely on family and other traditional social support
systems.
</P>
<P>
The ILO meeting is being held to consider a range of issues of
concern to the ILO -- employment, poverty, human resources
development, industrial relations, and protection of workers,
women and child laborers -- in the broad perspective of
globalization of economies and liberalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
Globalization will not be politically viable if it leads to a
deterioration in social justice, the ILO director-general said,
adding that rising inequality, deteriorating labor welfare, and
the absence of adequate social protection could "breed discontent
and provoke a strong backlash against globalization."
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, participants from 43 ILO members of the region
representing governments, employers and workers will forge new
strategies for ILO future activities in the region on a wide range
of social issues.

<HEADLINE> Feature: A Briton Who Writes About HK Success Story (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- From a journalist who wrote
about the long-isolated China in the wake of Mao Zedong's death,
to a consultant who co-authored the influential book "The Hong
Kong Advantage" just before Hong Kong's historic handover, Briton
David Dodwell found that Asia has become an increasingly deep
brand on his careers in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He joined the Financial Times in September 1976, days before
Chinese leader Mao Zedong died. The paper needed articles on
everything about China, but at that time almost nobody knew about
China since it had been isolated from the rest of the world for so
 long.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Dodwell happened to teach Chinese diplomats
 in London English, and it was this summer job in college years
that enabled him to have practical contact with the Chinese
people. That was how he started to write about China, and later
about Asia and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Having been in Asia on and off for 20 years, Dodwell
highlighted his insights into the issue of Hong Kong in a book
titled "The Hong Kong Advantage". The book, when published in May
1997, drew the limelight of the international media community that
clustered in Hong Kong for the handover coverage.
</P>
<P>
Its convincible study dispersed doomsday myth that "Hong Kong
is over", highlighted Hong Kong's intrinsic strengths of
adaptation, resilience, and counter-intuitive combinations, and
underpinned challenges faced with the economy.
</P>
<P>
Michael Enright and Edith Scott, a couple from Harvard Business
 School, and Dodwell started the research project on which the
book is based in the autumn of 1995, and completed it a year
later.

<HEADLINE> Provincial Job Network Gives Laid-Off Workers New Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Wang Shanshan, a laid-off
plastics company worker here, has a new, well-paying job as a taxi
driver.
</P>
<P>
Wang had been jobless for two years until she participated in a
special training class sponsored by the Municipal Department of
Labor in Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi Province. She
then bought a taxi and began to earn an eye-catching monthly
salary for ordinary Chinese workers: 5,000 yuan (600 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Wang is only one of the beneficiaries of the city's
re-employment network involving 19 enterprises, 50 training bases
and 10,000 laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The network includes government-sponsored training classes, and
technical and vocational schools.
</P>
<P>
Established in October, the re-employment network offers
professional training and recommends job opportunities to laid-off
workers. The network also organizes the export of labor services.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Department of Labor has also promulgated several
other preferential policies to encourage laid-off workers to
engage themselves in such jobs as cleaning apartments and looking
after the elderly and patients.

<P>
Dodwell said that an important objective of the study was to
provide a group of private business people here with a better and
sound understanding of what are the true strengths and what are
the real problems in the economy, so that they can incorporate
them into their strategies going forward.
</P>
<P>
"Now the book not only provides practical insight for the
private sector, but also practical help for the government
decision makers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Having concluded on the basis of their study that Hong Kong is
perhaps the best place in the world to see the future of the
global economy, Enright and Scott have done what Dodwell did
several years ago -- relocate to Hong Kong. Enright now is a
visiting professor at the University of Hong Kong's School of
Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
On the impact of the recent Asia financial turmoil, Dodwell
said: "I feel it is a valuable test of the strength of Hong
Kong. Hong Kong has very effectively, efficiently mediated the
challenges that swept over it through October."
</P>
<P>
"It illustrated just how flexible this economy is. It takes
shocks very directly, deals with the shocks, absorbs the shocks
and repositions to where it's on, much more quickly than the other
economies do," he went on.
</P>
<P>
One important reason, he argued, is because there are very few
linkages between the government decision making and the business
decision making so that the government can take swift and firm
actions. "In other Asian economies, those linkages are the heart
of the problem," he added.
</P>
<P>
As the book points out, Hong Kong's core strength lies in its
immense flexibility, a wide spread of economic activities, and a
wide spectrum of markets. "Hong Kong is luckily placed to have
good strong business links with the Chinese mainland to give it an
extra area of business activities to keep the economy robust," he
reiterated a unique advantage mentioned in the book.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, Hong Kong's economy has been hurt and will be hurt
for some time because of what has happened in the region, "said
Dodwell, adding that its high flexibility to quickly respond to
changes would again surface to help Hong Kong recover.
</P>
<P>
His strong belief in robustness and resilience of Hong Kong's
economy was built upon his solid experience in the city. As the
first residential correspondent of the Financial Times in Hong
Kong, he worked here for five years between 1984 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
Then back to London, he stayed there for four years, but
finally decided to come back to Hong Kong in 1993, wrapping up his
17-year role as a journalist and starting his second career as a
consultant on trade policy and macroeconomic affairs.
</P>
<P>
"I was impatient about the lack of flexibility and vitality in
the European economy," which he described as a depressed scenario
of protectionism.
</P>
<P>
"The economy here in Asia is buoyant and flexible," he
said. "And I think Hong Kong is a much more interesting option."
</P>
<P>
Another strong pushing factor for his return was that he would
rather be a participant than a spectator. "One of the most
exciting things about returning to Hong Kong is that the work I
was doing was going to have direct policy consequences." He was
delighted to see his work had an influence in decision making
circles in Hong Kong and throughout Asia.

<HEADLINE> ILO Urged to Help Improve Workers' Basic Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Minister of Labor
Li Qiyan said here today that the International Labor Organization
(ILO) should help developing and transitional economies to
overcome their practical difficulties and improve their workers'
basic living and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the three-day 12th ILO Asian regional meeting,
which opened here today, Li said, "We always maintain that in
efforts to safeguard and promote the basic rights of workers and
to implement international labor standards, countries should
proceed from their own economic development levels and
socio-cultural realities and work for gradual implementation
through developing the economy and improving legislation."
</P>
<P>
He added, "overlooking the distinctive conditions in countries
and disrespect for the independent choice of each member state and
attempting to force the implementation of international labor
standards through applying pressure with a protectionist mind will
only intensify division and create confrontation, rather than
achieving the desired result."
</P>
<P>
He said some proposals, such as the so-called "social clause",
"social labeling" and an expansion of the supervision mechanism,
rather than helping with the economic development of developing
nations, will only interfere with the employment strategies in
these countries and will not serve the goal of protecting the
basic rights of the workers.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the region, Li said that most Asian nations, because
of their large population and relatively weak economic
fundamentals, are still faced with serious problems such as
poverty, unemployment and semi-employment.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the promotion of employment and the
elimination of poverty have always been a priority of this region,
and the same should be the focus of ILO in its activities in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Army Ordered to Be Prepared for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Sani Abacha has ordered the national army to be prepared for the
challenges posed by some sections of the international community
with "unjustifiable attempt" to isolate the country.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of this year's Chief of Army Staff annual
training conference on Monday in Enugu, southeastern Nigeria,
Abacha urged the armed forces not to continue to depend on other
countries for vital supplies and training facilities.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the armed forces should "embrace with greater
seriousness the principle of effective management and proper
maintenance of existing facilities," Abacha told the service
chiefs, commanders and administrators at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the federal government would continue to
do its best to maintain an army that could efficiently carry out
its constitutional roles.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian military has been facing various sanctions from
west European countries, the United States and Canada following
allegations of human rights abuse which climaxed with the
execution in November 1995 of minority rights activist Ken
Saro-Wiwa and eight of his kinsmen.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions have cut off fresh supplies of military
equipment and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Although the country is able to produce or even export to
neighboring countries some simple conventional weapons, the
sanctions have added difficulties to the renewal and maintenance
of sophisticated military equipment.
</P>
<P>
While praising the army's efforts to repair air defense weapons
and other military equipment, Abacha also urged the army to
resist attempts by detractors of the government to derail the
political transition program.
</P>
<P>
"Your unalloyed loyalty and dedication to duty are vital to
the successful attainment of our national objectives," said
Abacha.

<HEADLINE> Market Prospects for China's Coal Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Today's edition of the
"Economic Information Daily" reported that China's demand for coal
resources will reach 1.48 billion tons by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Projections call for the domestic coal consumption volume to
reach 1.43 billion tons and exports will rise to 50 million tons,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The power generation, heating, metallurgy, chemical, building
materials, transportation, postal services and light industry
sectors will account for the vast majority of coal consumption.
</P>
<P>
China's coal industry has developed steadily since the
beginning of the Ninth Five-Year-Plan Period (1996-2000), with
supply exceeding demand.
</P>
<P>
Projections call for the country to produce 1.42 billion tons
of coal in 1997, thereby surpassing the annual target for the coal
industry.
</P>
<P>
Most of the country's coal is produced in Shanxi Province, the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in North China, and Shaanxi
Province in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Some 37 billion yuan was earmarked for capital construction in
the coal mining industry between 1996-1997, with the added annual
production capacity slated to reach 63 million tons, according to
the paper.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Hail NPC Deputies Election (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Major Hong Kong newspapers
today responded warmly to the election of the 36 deputies of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) of China.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the major newspapers gave extensive coverage to
Monday's election of the HKSAR deputies. They devoted special
pages to the reports and photos about the election.
</P>
<P>
Many carried pictures and brief notes of the newly elected
deputies.
</P>
<P>
A commentary of the Ta Kung Po said that the 36 deputies
elected Monday, representing the Hong Kong people, will have the
right to join China's supreme organ of state power in the
management of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
This right is particularly prominent and precious for the Hong
Kong people who have just returned to the motherland after more
than a century-long colonialist rule and elected their own
deputies to the NPC as an independent constituency, it said.
</P>
<P>
The election, which was smooth, satisfactory and successful,
served as a lively education in patriotism to all the people of
the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Through this election, the Hong Kong people came to see that
they had become a part of the country after Hong Kong's return to
the motherland and have the same rights as the Chinese people in
other parts of China to participate in the management of state
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The commentary expressed the hope that the 36 deputies will
practice their duties, link up the connection between Hong Kong
and the inland areas and report to the Central Government the
SAR's actual situation and the real ideas of the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that the people of the SAR will show their
support to the deputies and help them really play their role and
make their contributions as representatives of the SAR under the
policy of "one country, two systems".

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Hail NPC Deputies Election (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hong Kong Commercial Daily in its commentary said that the
election of the 36 HKSAR NPC deputies, the first group of deputies
elected by the Hong Kong people after Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, is a demonstration of the further implementation of
the policy of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The newly elected deputies are broadly representative because
they have been always loving the country and Hong Kong and have
made their contributions to the country and Hong Kong, it said.
</P>
<P>
Through this election, it said, the Hong Kong people have a
deepening understanding of the people's congress system of the
country, the role and position of the NPC in the political life of
the country, and the policy of "one country, two systems", as
well as of how the Hong Kong people can participate in the
management of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
A signed article in Wen Wei Po said that the 36 HKSAR deputies
to the NPC can represent the Hong Kong people because they are
from various sectors including industrial and commercial circles
and sectors of profession, labor, grassroots and religion.
</P>
<P>
When the Ninth NPC opens in Beijing next spring, it said, these
deputies will, together with representatives from other parts of
China, represent the interests and ideas of the Chinese people
including the Hong Kong people to discuss state affairs and put
forward their ideas about the prosperity of Hong Kong and the
rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Draft Bill on Human Rights Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is now
finalizing the draft of a bill to set up National Human Rights
Commission (NHRC) which is likely to be placed before the
Parliament session next month, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The present government has given special consideration to the
long standing demand by civil society and human rights
organizations for setting up the NHRC, the Bangladesh Observer
stated.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft bill, the president will constitute the
NHRC in consultation with the prime minister, parliament speaker
and the opposition leader in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The chairperson of the commission will be appointed from among
the retired judges of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court,
and four members of the commission will be selected from among
persons having knowledge or practical experience in matters
relating to human rights. At least one female member will be
included in the commission.
</P>
<P>
The five-member commission will be formed for a term of five
years, the draft bill says.
</P>
<P>
The NHRC will have the power to institute inquiry on a petition
or complaint by a victim due to violation of human rights or
negligence by a public servant.
</P>
<P>
The commission can intervene in any proceeding involving any
allegation of violation of human rights pending before a court
with the approval of the concerned court, according to the draft
bill.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill will encourage the efforts of the
Non-Governmental Organizations and other private institutions
working in the fields of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The commission will recommend appropriate measures to stop the
acts of terrorism that inhibit the enjoyment of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The NHRC will be deemed to be a civil court with judicial
proceedings, and all members of the commission will function
without political or official interference, and the annual or
special reports of the commission will be placed before the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be financed through a Trust Fund to be
created by the government with the approval of Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Farmers Lose 90% Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian farmers lose about 90
percent of their agricultural yields every year to poor seeds and
other artificial hazards, the Daily Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The farmers are compelled to produce below 10 percent capacity
yield per land unit due to the traditional planting of low yield
seeds and lack of government support, according to Murtala Nyako,
President of the Practicing Farmers Association of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the country, he said, had been constrained in
competing with others at international level because of their low
production capacity.
</P>
<P>
The quality of their products was equally not encouraging, he
said at a news conference on enhanced agricultural activities
held recently in Kano, North Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The president asserted that farmers in Nigeria were still
producing at subsistence level, pointing out that even the
large-scale farming class had crumbled because their production
capacity could not pay the production cost.
</P>
<P>
To address the low yield production problem, Nyako advised
that the government should as a matter of urgency support the
farmers by providing them with loans, improved hybrid seeds and
education on extension service delivery.
</P>
<P>
The government should also subsidize input and coordinate
export opportunities for farmers, he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Sanitation Workers Continue Striking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Despite the end of the
crippling five-day nationwide strike Monday, Israeli sanitation
workers in Tel Aviv decided to continue striking today, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The workers, objecting to the city's hiring private
contractors to collect garbage, made the decision after their
representatives failed to reach an agreement with Tel Aviv
Municipal government Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Trade Union Chairman Amir Peretz, who signed an
agreement with the Treasury ending the general strike Monday,
met Tel Aviv Mayor Ronni Milo later in the day in an attempt to
broker a compromise between the municipality and the striking
workers.
</P>
<P>
Although Peretz proposed that as a compromise the city employ
private contractors to clean up just four city quarters, using
no more than eight trucks, the striking workers insisted on
further negotiations with the municipality.
</P>
<P>
In certain parts of Tel Aviv, citizens were spotted walking
around in gas masks, white sanitary masks, or simply covering
their noses and mouths with their shirts or handkerchiefs.
</P>
<P>
In other places, business owners closed down their shops
because the heaps of garbage filling the sidewalks and pilling
over into the streets prevented access to their shops.

CANBERRA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Sydney's construction boom was
generating projects worth 10 billion Australian dollars (6.7
billion US dollars), Premier Bob Carr of Australia's New South
Wales state said tonight.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the new figures released today showed that 3.8
billion US dollars of construction was underway and a further 3.1
billion US dollars was planned for Sydney, capital of the state.
</P>
<P>
"Sydney and New South Wales are experiencing a construction
boom due to international focus on the state - and these figures
do not include private sector investment outside the CBD (central
business district)," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the Olympics (Games to be hosted by Sydney) alone
have generated 7,865 jobs on site and 15,730 jobs offsite."
</P>
<P>
"Hotel construction accounts for more than 1.3 billion
Australian dollars (870 million US dollars)," he said.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 4 million, accounting for 22 percent of
the country's total of 18 million people, Sydney has been the
country's leading business, financial and cultural center as well
as tourist attraction.

GUANGZHOU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion China
entered the semifinals of the 11th Asian Women's Soccer
Championship after a 16-0 win over the Philippines in a Group B
match on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The victory left the home side with a maximum and unassailable
nine points out of three group matches with DPR Korea second on
six points after its 8-0 rout of Uzbekistan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at Zhaoqing, Chinese Taipei also made the last four as
it whipped Khazakstan 6-0 to wrap up group C with perfect record.
</P>
<P>
The three group winners and the best runners-up advance into
Friday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
China, five-straight-time champion, completely terrorised its
weak opponents, who did not even manage a shot on goal throughout
the match.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine defense cracked up on five minutes and the
Chinese girls closed out the first half at 5-0.
</P>
<P>
The scoreline soared into 11-0 in space of ten minutes in the
second half so that the Philippine coach decided to try out the
substitute goalie, only to come on dumbed by another Chinese
strike.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, 21-0 victims by China at 10th championship two
years ago, lost all their group matches and saw their net tore
open for 32 times.

SINGAPORE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined on the
Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index
fell (STII) back by 19.11 points to close at 1,734.22 points
today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that share prices closed lower on profit-taking
activities with sentiment affected by a correction in the
Malaysian market following a surge in the past couple of days.
Signs of a sharply weaker demand in cars also helped push the STII
down, they added.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank to 228.2 million units, valued
at 463.23 million Singapore dollars (285.94 million U.S. dollars).
Declines overwhelmed advances by 256 to 95, while 259 other
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Technologies (ST) Engineering again was the most
actively traded stock as it registered a turnover of 44.13 million
units. It was followed by Asia Food and Property (AFP) which had
14.95 million shares traded. RHB Capital Warrant 99 was next with
8.9 million units changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Local computer sound card maker Creative 50 led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 1.2 dollars to end at 36 Singapore dollars.
The DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) Foreign and soft drinks
and food maker F&AMP;N increased by 40 cents each to close at 16.9 and
9.65 Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Foreign was

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of South
Africa's People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD), Abida
Roberts, was arrested early this morning in her Cape Town home
after being found in procession of a secret document, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
PAGAD is a paramilitary vigilantes' organization dealing with
crime and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said officers seized a secret document in
Roberts home which was allegedly leaked from parliament.
</P>
<P>
It was alleged that the document, originating from
intelligence sources, was marked for the attention of South
African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Roberts is expected to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's
Court later today.
</P>
<P>
PAGAD accused the police of acting illegally when they
arrested Roberts, saying the police warrant only made provision
for the premises to be searched for weapons and ammunition and
that police were not entitled to search for documents.
</P>
<P>
Police denied PAGAD's claim and said the document seized was
within the ambit of the warrant.

<HEADLINE> University Students in Tianjin Study Deng Xiaoping Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- In today's China, young Chinese
find it is more and more difficult to totally agree with a
theory. However, Deng Xiaoping Theory seems to strike a chord with
young people.
</P>
<P>
This is particularly true for the 70,000 university students in
Tianjin, who have shown a great interest in the theory.
</P>
<P>
The university students here have established "Deng Xiaoping
Theory Study Society of University Students in Tianjin".
</P>
<P>
Ten of the municipality's 20 universities have set up
school-level academic forums on Deng Xiaoping Theory, which draw
tens of thousands of students. They have organized more than 500
study groups.
</P>
<P>
Nan Jingwei, an undergraduate from Nankai University, said:
"Deng Xiaoping Theory has brought earth-shaking changes to China
and is rich in content. We university students are deeply
interested in the theory."
</P>
<P>
Wu Hongjun, an official from the Tianjin Municipal Education
Committee, said: "Many courses on Deng Xiaoping Theory are
available in the universities, and they are warmly welcomed by the
students."
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to set up municipal-level symposiums first for
university students to study Deng Xiaoping Theory in the next few
months."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Unemployment Rises by 27% in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Nigeria
increased by 27 percent this year from the 9.6 percent recorded
last year, according to the latest statistics released by the
country's Organized Private Sector (OPS).
</P>
<P>
The figures were contained in the OPS 1998 pre-budget
memorandum submitted to the federal government recently, This
Day, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The OPS consists of members of the Manufacturers Association
of Nigeria (MAN), firms which belong to the Nigerian Association
of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture
(NACCIMA) and Members of the Nigerian Employers Consultative
Association (NECA).
</P>
<P>
The bodies, which made a joint pre-budget memorandum for the
first time this year, attributed the contraction of employment
this year to the large-scale rationalization of human and natural
resources in both the public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Of the 17 sectors which the OPS sampled in its 1997 employment
survey, only two, agriculture and allied services and training,
education/consultancy sectors recorded increase in their average
workforce.
</P>
<P>
The other fifteen sectors recorded employment drops of between
8.4 and 91.7 percent in the year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 402 firms from the 17 sectors were randomly
selected for the survey.
</P>
<P>
The OPS also raised the issue of productivity in the
workplace, saying that "almost all industrial groups recorded a
decline in labor productivity during the survey period".
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the government announced macroeconomic
improvement, the OPS said "the economy is still in recession" on
the macro scene.
</P>
<P>
The recession is made worse by poor infrastructure -- power,
water, telephone, and shortage of utilities like petroleum
products.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a real focus to address these problems,
including privatization and private participation in electric
supply" and special emphasis placed on building of
infrastructure, the memo said.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen also painted a dismal picture of the standard
of living of Nigerians, saying that the "poverty level has
degenerated".
</P>
<P>
Lamenting the very high cost of doing business, the POS called
for removal of excise duty on all products, reduction in port
charges and multiplicity of taxes.
</P>
<P>
It also called for removal of all bureaucratic bottlenecks and
effective/efficient implementation of incentives, as well as more
positive and concrete measures to enhance agricultural and food
production.

<HEADLINE> First Reptile Virus Isolated in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A research group at the
Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has
successfully isolated the virus which gave rise to last year's
epidemic of sinohelicoprion, a reptile living only in China.
</P>
<P>
As reptile virus research is relatively incomplete compared to
the other vertebrates, it's the first time in the world that
scientists have been able to isolate a virus from a reptile.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe the discovery has not only clarified the
root cause of the fulminating-type epidemic disease, but also
created a new approach to looking for the cause and prevention of
disease from the perspective of molecular biology and immunity.
</P>
<P>
Sinohelicoprion breeding has spread rapidly in China due to its
value in medicine and nutrition. But the breakout of epidemic
disease last year sharply reduced its production.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, half of sinohelicoprion breeding farms
were reportedly affected, with the mortality rate reaching 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Scientists who analyzed the virus specimen under electron
microscopes said the virus, globular in shape and 30 nanometers in
diameter, has no cyst-membrane. Five polypeptides construct its
basic protein.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said that at the moment they are carrying out
further pathology research on various levels of tissues, cells,
and molecules as well as immunity research.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The southwestern Chinese
province Yunnan staged a trade and investment fair here today,
eyeing closer links with Hong Kong, its No. 1 investor and trading
partner.
</P>
<P>
The fair was the second of its kind with the first one held in
early 1993, Secretary-General of the Yunnan Provincial Government
Yang Chongyong told the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
For the five years from 1993 to 1997, trade between Yunnan and
Hong Kong is estimated to total over 1.8 billion U.S. dollars,
with an average annual growth of over 20 percent, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
As of November 1997, Hong Kong has invested 670 projects in
Yunnan, or 43 percent of the total foreign-invested projects, with
the contracted investment reaching 780 million U.S. dollars, 43
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has become Yunnan's largest economic and trading
partner, Yang noted, expressing the hope that bilateral
cooperation would be further broadened.
</P>
<P>
The fair, running through to Saturday, brought some 400
projects for potential Hong Kong partners. A great number of the
projects involved the province's four pillar industries: tobacco,
biological resources development, mineral resources development
and tourism.

<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Municipal Government of
China's capital recently launched a project to make major streets
and roads three times brighter in the next five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The municipal office in charge of power supply has upgraded the
lights in Tian'anmen Square and those along East and West Chang'an
streets, the city's most famous transportation trunk line.
</P>
<P>
Four groups of halogen lights have been erected in Tian'anmen
Square. Each group has a lighting capacity of 46 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, lighting will also be improved on five
major east-west streets, three major north-south streets and the
three ring roads.
</P>
<P>
The last step will be to "light up each and every street and
road in Beijing," an official said. There are 83,000 street lights
in the city.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many Chinese cities have received a face lift
with illumination projects. For example, the night scene of the
Bunds in Shanghai, China's industrial and commercial center, has

<HEADLINE> Iran Against Mideast Peace Process: Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ali
Khamenei said here today Iran is against the Middle East peace
process because it is "unjust and illogical."
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech to the eighth summit of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), Khamenei said, "our
opposition to the so-called Middle East peace process is because
it is unjust, arrogant, contemptuous and finally illogical."
</P>
<P>
He said, "the imposed principle of 'land for peace' means that
the Zionists (Israelis) would return the lands of all neighboring
countries, provided that we accept that Palestine belongs to
them. What could be more unjust than these words?"
</P>
<P>
He said that it is the time that the Islamic world should
give more support to the frontline states who are waging heroic
struggle against Israel, the usurper of Arab lands, while
expressing his solute to the resistance movement in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader called on the Islamic world to close ranks,
stressing that "what can the United States do vis-a-vis the
united front of the Islamic countries ranging from Indonesia to
North Africa?"
</P>
<P>
He then blasted the U.S. for creating discord and disunity in
the Islamic world in order to make the Islamic nations fear each
other. He declared, "Iran poses no threat to any Islamic
country," apparently referring to the Gulf nations.
</P>
<P>
He termed the U.S. military presence in the Gulf as "improper"
as the Gulf, "an Islamic sea and an important source of energy
for the entire world," has turned insecurity. At the same time,
he suggested that the OIC deploy forces from Islamic countries to
preserve and safeguard peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the OIC performance, Khamenei said that the world today
has more serious expectations from the organization as compared
with those of the past. "This organization can be the symbol of
true unity of the Muslim countries in the face of events and
common interests. It can speak on behalf of its members, make
demands, carry out requisite measures, and enjoy their financial,
economic, and political backing," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the organization can play an active role in the
economic area and to translate the idea of the common Islamic
market from a far-fetched dream to a reality.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that the OIC should become the sixth permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council as it is the representative of
55 nations with a total population of over one billion.
</P>
<P>
The eighth OIC summit is the largest ever get-together of the
55-member Islamic body since it was established 27 years
ago. The seat of Afghanistan is left vacant because the OIC was
divided as to who should represent the country. Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani attends the meeting as an observer.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 presidents, vice-presidents, emirs and crown
princes are present at the summit, together with thousands of
officials and representatives.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit commits itself to promoting "dignity,
dialogue and participation" in the Islamic world and is expected
to address a wide range of issues faced by the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the summit, the OIC foreign ministers held a two-day
meeting on December 6-7 to debate and give endorsement to more
than 140 draft resolutions. The drafts will be further discussed
at the summit for final approval.
</P>
<P>
Moroccan Prime Minister Abdul Latif Al-Filali, whose country
hosted the seventh Islamic summit three years ago, also made a
speech at the session and Iran's President Mohammad Khatami
followed him to address the session.

<HEADLINE>   Toyota to Build New Assembly Plant in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese automaker Toyota
announced today that it will build a new assembly plant in Onnaing
near Valenciennes in the Nord sub-prefecture of France.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshi Okuda, the president of Toyota, announced the decision
here after having a meeting with French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second plant to be constructed by Toyota in
Europe. Toyota has already have a plant in Burnaston in the
Midlands of Britain.
</P>
<P>
The new plant, which will enter service in 2001, will have a
production capacity of 150,000 vehicles a year. It will construct
a model specially designed for the European market, said Toyota in
a communique.
</P>
<P>
Toyota will invest 80 billion yens (about 615 million
U.S. dollars) in the plant, which will create 2,000 jobs in a
direct way, said Okuda.
</P>
<P>
He said that the establishment of Toyota in France is "an
important step" for the group in enhancing its "European
engagement."
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that the choice of Onnaing by Toyota as the site of
its new plant means that "the competitiveness of France is
appreciated abroad."
</P>
<P>
While hailing "the more and more marked interests" by Japanese
investors in France, Jospin said that the Toyota plant will bring
about "new technologies and new methods of industrial management,
as well as the possibilities of multiple industrial cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Onnaing Daniel Crepin said that his city will
celebrate the decision of Toyota with a festival this evening on
the streets and in cafes.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a spontaneous festival. We have nothing to
predict until the official announcement," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Offers Arms Package to S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia has bid to sell
150 Mig-29 fighters, 150 T-80U main battle tanks and four 636
diesel submarines to South Africa, local daily, the Citizen
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The arms package also include six maritime research and rescue
helicopters and six anti-submarine helicopters, a visiting
Russian delegation was quoted as saying at a press conference in
Pretoria Monday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation said the proposal would include offset programs
in South Africa of up to 80 percent of the contract value.
</P>
<P>
The offset programs would include establishing factories for
the assembly of the Aviatika-890 ultralight multi-purpose
aircraft and a light business aircraft in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Russia would consider establishing a heavy truck
manufacturing plant here and would become involved in mining
technology, education and other ventures.
</P>
<P>
The tender follows invitations by South Africa to the
international armaments industry to come up with proposals to
fulfill its armed forces' armament needs as outlined in the
Defense Review earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria has made it clear in putting out the tender that it
would require agreements which would include delayed payment for
the armaments acquired as well as substantial offset of the
contract amount through job and wealth creation programs here.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Mig-29 to be sold to South Africa is
an upgrade of the older model with a range of 3,500 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The T80U battle tanks is a 46 ton tank with a 125 mm
smoothbore gun capable of firing both projectiles and laser
guided missiles. It is also equipped with active armor which uses
explosives to stop incoming projectiles and missiles.
</P>
<P>
It has a maximum speed of 70 km/h and can travel at speeds of
up to 35 km/h on rough terrains. Russians claimed that the tank's
engine was not very particular about fuel, namely it can run on
diesel, petrol or paraffin or any combination of the three fuels.
</P>
<P>
The 636 diesel submarine is an advanced attack submarine with
a range of up to 7,500 miles at a steady seven knots. It has a
maximum speed of 19 knots submerged and 11 knots on the surface.
</P>
<P>
The submarine has a stealth design and is armed with 653 mm
torpedo tubes. More than 90 of these submarines have been
exported to 154 countries throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Russia, Britain, Germany and Spain have also
been trying to sell packages of weapons to South African armed
forces which complains that some key arms in use are either
obsolete or in poor condition.

<HEADLINE> Big Gas Field Discovered in China's Tianshan Mountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Hutubi region at the
northern foot of northwest China's Tianshan Mountains has been
verified as a large natural gas field containing geological
reserves estimated at 30 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The gas field, inside Hutubi county of the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, is about 60 kilometers from Urumqi, the
regional capital, south of the Tianshan Mountains and north of the
Junggar Basin.
</P>
<P>
In August of 1996 one testing well promised a daily output of
780,000 cubic meters of natural gas and 140,000 tons of light oil.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Petroleum Administration sank two new testing
wells this year. They also followed that by using advanced
three-dimensional seismic technology for further exploration. The
two test wells produced high-yield gas flows in November, and now
have a daily output of more than 500,000 cubic meters
</P>
<P>
Workers also tested for gas on the well sunk in 1996 and have
increased the daily output to 940,000 cubic meters of gas at one
depth and 1.17 million cubic meters at another depth.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Professor Ou Yuande, vice
president of the Xinjiang Petroleum Research Academy, said that
Hutubi county has 120 square kilometers of oil-bearing land, with
a verified geological gas reserve of 31.3 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts say that six similar major gas-bearing geological
structures also exist in the 12,000-square-kilometer area at the
northern foot of the Tianshan Mountains and the southern edge of
Junggar Basin.
</P>
<P>
The discovery and verification of the large gas field in Hutubi
county offers high hopes for other sites.
</P>
<P>
China also has found thick gas-bearing strata in a number of
testing wells sunk in nearby areas, indicating that the northern
side of the Tianshan Mountains could become an important
production center of natural gas in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Exploration, development and a comprehensive use of natural gas
resources in Junggar Basin have been accelerated. By the end of
this century, Junggar Basin expects to have 200 billion cubic
meters of verified natural gas reserves and produce three billion
cubic meters of gas a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Li Zhe, a doctor of
traditional Chinese medicine who is famous for curing cancer with
Chinese remedies, has been honored by the 1997 Hong Kong
International Academic Exchange Conference on Medical Science and
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Li, head of the Changchun Institute of Anti-Cancer Medical
Materials, developed Zhu Xiang Powder, a special medicine in
powder form made out of 17 kinds of Chinese medicinal herbs which
has been effective in treating cancer of the liver, lung, brain
and kidney.
</P>
<P>
Li, born in a family of doctors of traditional Chinese
medicines, suffered from breast cancer 20 years ago. The
experience encouraged her to seek a cure.
</P>
<P>
The effective rate of Zhu Xiang Powder in a strict two-year test
performed by the Institute for the Control of Drugs and Biological
Products proved to be 72.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Li submitted a paper, "Clinic Observation for 856 Treatments of
Carcinoma with a series Traditional Chinese Medicine -- Zhu Xiang
Powder," to the Hong Kong conference, which aroused great interest
among medical experts.
</P>
<P>
So far, Li has won 16 awards both in China and abroad. The
Oriental Medicine Institute in the United States has granted her
titles of "honorary chairman" and "guest professor."
</P>
<P>
The conference was designed to promote exchanges between
Chinese and Western medicines and to show the achievements of
today's medical science.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen other doctors were also honored at the conference.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Save Banks Through Governmental Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korean government will pour
huge money into two ailing banks -- Korean First Bank and Seoul
Bank -- within this week to boost their paid-in-capital to the
adequacy level required by the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS).
</P>
<P>
Finance and Economy Ministry officials said the investment,
amounting to 1.18 trillion won (about 886 million U.S. dollars)
for each, would return the two banks to health, as their capital
will represent eight percent of risk-weighted asset, the
BIS-required capital adequacy ratio.
</P>
<P>
As their paid-in-capital will rise from 820 billion won (about
615.6 million dollars) each to two trillion won (about 1,5 billion
dollars) each, the two banks will be able to dissolve the
insolvency fears raised during the negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) about its rescue credit.
</P>
<P>
The IMF negotiators demanded the two banks be closed if they
fail to improve their paid-in-capital up to eight percent in four
months by stringent restructuring.
</P>
<P>
With the investment, the government's interest in the two banks
will increase 59 percent of their equity capital.
</P>
<P>
In return, the government will require the banks to follow a
stringent restructuring regime, including the layoffs of more than
1,500 workers each over the next one and half to two years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they will have to slash wages by at least 10
percent for employees and 30 percent for officers, and shut down
some 40 branches each, in addition to disposal of "unnecessary"
property.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Minister Threatens to Close Unethical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 9 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of mounting public
condemnation of unethical scenes being broadcast by local
television, Lebanese Information Minister Bassem Al-Sabaa
has threatened to close down sinning networks.
</P>
<P>
"Why, in one month, were a number of programs broadcast on
rape, homosexuality, premartial sex and incest, as if this was
the true problem in Lebanon?" local newspaper the Daily Star
today quoted Sabaa as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The goal, not to raise social issues, may have involved
politics or advertising, especially since none of the episodes
provided specific, scientific solutions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Several programs had shown "the worst image of Lebanese
society in a very short period of time", while movies and
programs with scenes of sexuality were being broadcast at
inappropriate hours, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri recently hosted a meeting of TV
station chiefs at his home.
</P>
<P>
He said that abiding by the law was a prerequisite for media
institutions and if they continued to show little respect for
legislation, he would have to intervene and hold them
accountable.
</P>
<P>
Christian and Muslim clerics have already started organizing
campaigns against unethical programs and press stories and
pictures.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi on more than one occasion
brought up the issue, calling for more control and decency.

<HEADLINE> Service Sector to Help Laid-off Workers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While keeping public ownership as the foundation of the
socialist economic system, China needs to develop the sector of
mixed ownership and the non-public sector, the commentary
continued.
</P>
<P>
Estimates show that self-employed and private businesses
provided about 13.9 million new jobs from 1991 to 1995, accounting
for 40 percent of the total newly created job opportunities in
cities, the story said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, the service sector will take up
nearly one-third of the total employment and will create 11
million new jobs annually, according to the story.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai had 700 enterprises go bankrupt in the last few years,
laying off nearly one million workers. New businesses in the
service sector provided 800,000 of those with jobs.
</P>
<P>
Part-time jobs should be encouraged and are expected to
increase, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The service sector still has great potential, said an official
from the State Planning Commission, and is lagging behind in some
areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the traditional service enterprises should develop
in such professional and society-oriented modern businesses as
transportation, security services, accounting, finance and public
relations, the commentary concluded.

<HEADLINE> Forcing Schoolgirls to Marry Illegal: Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye has ordered school children to report to
relevant authorities if their parents force them to get married.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the directive last weekend when
addressing public rallies at Msangano and Iyula villages in the
Mbozi District during a tour to the Mbeya Region in the
southwest, according to The Guardian today.
</P>
<P>
He said stern measures would be taken against parents who
forced their school children, especially girls, to get married.
</P>
<P>
Any girl who learns that her parents want her to marry should
report immediately to divisional secretaries, the premier
directed, after knowing that school attendance in most primary
schools in Mbozi District was declining because of early
marriages.
</P>
<P>
Forcing schoolgirls to get married is a criminal offense and a
violation of their rights to education, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
He said anybody found guilty of making a schoolgirl pregnant
would be severely punished.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker on Asian Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
continued to fall today, sliding to a new four-year low of 66.7
U.S. cents in early European trading, pressured by troubled Asian
markets.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the local session at 66.9 U.S.
cents, from 67.11 cents yesterday, and continued to drift lower in
early offshore trading. It was last at these levels in December
1993.
</P>
<P>
Traders say little respite is in store for the local currency
now that it has breached the critical 66.8 U.S. cent level.
</P>
<P>
St. George Bank foreign exchange trading manager Stuart Moore
said the market was mixed today, with short covering pushing the
Australian dollar to the day's high of 67.37 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"But then with the Asian markets opening, the Korean won
weakening, and the Indonesian rupiah weakening, the Aussie slowly
drifted back off," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
Moore said 66.8 U.S. cents was seen as a critical support level
and a breach could lead to a quick run to the downside.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Westpac general manager of economic planning and
strategy Bill Evans said the Australian dollar could fall to 65
cents against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
"Our research indicates that probably the fair value for the
dollar at the moment is about 68, 69 cents but the research also
shows that in extreme times, and we have an extreme time at the
moment, it can fall 4 or 5 cents below that fair value."
</P>
<P>
Against the Japanese yen this evening, the Australian dollar
finished at 87.24 from 87.05 yesterday. It was at 1.1983 from
1.1957 against the Deutsche mark.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Robot Explores Ocean Floor at 6,000-Meter Depth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China has succeeded in building
and utilizing a robot recently to survey Pacific Ocean depths of
6,000 meters, according to today's "Economic Information Daily."
</P>
<P>
The robotic accomplishment represents an advanced level in this
high-tech sector, experts said. Exploration of the ocean floor at
6,000-meter depth has sparked fierce competition among nations.
</P>
<P>
Survey technology at such depths -- considered by some to be
more sophisticated than space technology -- must cope with
atmospheric pressure 600 times that at sea level. In addition,
oceanic research robots must adjust to unexpected problems.
</P>
<P>
The China-made robot completed its deep-water video record,
measurements of the ocean bottom, investigation of water
conditions and search for missing objects while automatically
recording data, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
A special group of experts for the robot project also expressed
satisfaction with the cable-less robot's quality and reliability.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for the first
census in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are completed and the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) will begin collecting
completed questionnaires from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first census in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
and the PNA has mobilized thousands of staff for this job, which
the PNA regarded as a historical event for the Palestinian
people.
</P>
<P>
"Of course this is a big event for the Palestinians under
occupation, but we are afraid that Palestinians in East
Jerusalem will not be included in this census," said a shop
keeper today in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani sent a
letter Monday to the PNA, warning them that any census in
Jerusalem would violate the autonomy accord.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani also ordered the Israeli police to take whatever
steps necessary to stop such activities in the city.
</P>
<P>
During its preparations for this census, the PNA said it will
stay out of East Jerusalem to avoid a confrontation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the census plan, the census will last until
December 24, and the final results are expected to be announced
on January 4, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Australian Official Foresees Steady Trade Growth With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Trade and exchanges of visit
between China and Australia are going to grow rapidly in the next
few years, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander
Downer said here today.
</P>
<P>
Downer, arriving here at noon, wasted no time to emphasize the
Australian Government's commitment to expanding its relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
In a short speech at the inauguration of the new annex of the
Australian Embassy in Beijing at 1:30 local time, Downer said that
Australia is ready to further expand the "strong, rapidly growing
ties with China."
</P>
<P>
He noted that trade between the two countries will continue to
grow at a rapid rate as in the past ten years. He said that the
number of Chinese people visiting Australia every year will
increase from 56,000 in 1996 to 139,000 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
There are two important features of the strong, rapidly growing
relations between Australia and China. One is trade, the other is
people-to-people exchanges, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that physical expansion of the Australian Embassy is
parallel to the development of good bilateral relations because
the consul and trade sections of the Embassy are located in the
new annex.
</P>
<P>
Downer will stay in Beijing till Thursday morning before going
to Xi'an in northwest China.

<HEADLINE> President Orders to Help Flood-Ridden Kenyans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has instructed relevant government departments to move
swiftly in Northeastern Province which has been affected by
floods, the East African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
Moi called for sufficient supplies of food and medicine to the
affected areas where have for the last few weeks been badly
affected by heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
He said that no one should die as a result of the floods which
have claimed dozens of lives and displaced hundreds of families.
</P>
<P>
At least 12 people have reportedly died at Garusa and
Kumahumato areas of the flooded province over the past two days
following an outbreak of diarrhoea.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of others are said to be suffering from the same
disease and starvation-related ailments due to the acute shortage
of food and clean water.
</P>
<P>
Garissa District Commissioner Ali Mbwarali was quoted as
saying that he had asked for assistance from Nairobi for the
ailing and starving residents.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said that all major roads had been made
impassable by heavy rains, hindering the delivery of humanitarian
aid to the local residents.
</P>
<P>
Former Cabinet Minister Hussein Maalim Mohamed yesterday
donated food and medical supplies worth 60,000 U.S. Dollars to
victims of Tana River floods.
</P>
<P>
The British government has given Kenya some 500,000 Dollars to
fund emergency relief operations in Northeastern Province of
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government has offered Kenya two military
transport planes to assist in airlifting emergency food supplies
to flood-affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The on-going nomination of parliamentary and civic candidates
in the province were yesterday delayed due to floods and
inaccessibility.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Electoral Commission Chairman Samuel Kivuitu said
Monday that some returning officers and clerks were stranded in
parts of Tana River District which could not be reached by road.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements had been made to hire two government helicopters
to transport the documents and personnel to the affected areas
and it is hoped that the exercise would go on as planned, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The torrential storms and floods blamed on the El Nino
phenomenon have forced the Kenyan government to declare Coast and
Northeastern provinces disaster zones.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations estimates that some 300,000 people are
affected and desperately need relief food in the East African
country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Mining Industry Lays Off 2,000 Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's mining industry,
hard-pressed by free-falling metal prices, has retrenched over
2,000 workers this year and many more jobs might be lost next
year if prices remain depressed, The Herald daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Poor prices of minerals, particularly gold, nickel and copper,
have strained operations forcing mining companies to cut costs
through retrenchments.
</P>
<P>
President of the Chambers of Mines John Nixon said the 2,000
retrenched workers included only those workers retrenched by big
mines.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to get the exact numbers of other workers who
were laid off by small-scale and informal sector miners.
</P>
<P>
Nixon told the paper Monday the market was unlikely to recover
in the shorter-term, spelling more problems for mining companies.
</P>
<P>
The low gold price, which hit the lowest this year in the last
12 years, has already forced the closure of some marginal mines.
Larger companies have had to streamline their operations to
remain in business, Nixon said, adding noted Ashanti Gold Mine
Company is also selling six of its smaller mines in this country
as it focuses on larger mines.

<HEADLINE> Northwestern Region Nears Record High in Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The total export value of
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in the first 10
months of this year reached 209 million U.S. dollars, up 43.6
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The region is expected to record a historic high in exports
this year.
</P>
<P>
An official in the regional bureau of foreign economy and trade
attributed the growth to efforts made by state-owned companies
specializing in foreign trade, production-oriented enterprises
with the right of import and export, and foreign-funded businesses
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that between January and October, state foreign
trade companies earned 123 million U.S. dollars in exchange, a
13.8 percent increase over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Local products such as coal, cashmere, tires and tantalum (a
metallic element that resists corrosion) sold better than last
year in the international market. The export value of coal, for
example, reached 16 million U.S. dollars, 110 percent more than
the same period last year.

<P>
CANBERRA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
closed slightly down after a lackluster day's trade today as the
traditional wind-down for the Christmas/New Year season began to
take hold.
</P>
<P>
A softer U.S. market and stronger performances on Monday night
in Asian economies failed to influence investors, with only light
trading in local stocks.
</P>
<P>
Henderson Charlton Jones dealer Scott Emms said the local
bourse took little direction from overseas markets today.
</P>
<P>
"Our overall market was terribly light on volume," he said. "I
think a lot of people are winding down for the Christmas period."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Peace Group Releases Report to Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli human rights
group B'tselem released a report today to mark the 10th
anniversary of the intifada, or Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Since the onset of the intifada on December 9, 1987, through
November 30, 1997, 1,346 Palestinians were killed by Israeli
troops or security forces, and another 131 Palestinians killed
by Israeli civilians, while 256 Israeli civilians and 127
Israeli soldiers were killed by Palestinians, the report said.
</P>
<P>
From December 1987 until the signing of Oslo accords in
September 1993, 1,087 Palestinians were killed by Israeli
soldiers and 75 others killed by Israeli civilians. In the same
period, 101 Israeli civilians and 59 Israeli soldiers were killed
by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
From the signing of Oslo accords in September 1993 to November
1997, 259 Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers and 56
others by Israeli civilians. In the same period, 155 Israeli
civilians and 68 Israeli soldiers and policemen were killed by
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
This means that since the signing of Oslo accords, more
Israeli soldiers and civilians have been killed than during the
1987-1993 period when the intifada was at its peak, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
B'tselem said that while no Palestinians have been deported
from the Palestinian territories since the end of 1992, Israel
has destroyed the homes of 81 families of accused assailants
from the end of 1992 through the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian lawmakers marked the 10th anniversary of
intifada Monday by calling for struggle until achieving
statehood. Members of the Palestinian Council marked the intifada
by opening a meeting in Ramallah, West Bank, with a moment of
silence in memory of the Palestinians killed in the uprising.
</P>
<P>
While the council refrained from issuing an official
statement, members debated the intifada's significance in the
context of current peace moves. The consensus was that
Palestinians should continue their struggle until they achieve
independent statehood.
</P>
<P>
Council member Marwan Barghouti, Secretary of the mainstream
Palestinian movement Fatah in the West Bank, said the intifada's
goals have not been achieved and the uprising must continue in
spirit. He warned Israel that if the peace process breaks down,
"the intifada will return, using different methods and
techniques."

<HEADLINE> Service Sector Expected to Help More Laid-off Workers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Laid-off Chinese workers should
find new jobs in the flourishing service sector, stressed a
commentary in today's People's Daily, the country's leading
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
State-funded enterprises had been the mainstay of job
opportunities in the planned economy, but are now faced with
surplus workers, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
There has been a steady decline in the number of newly employed
workers in state-owned enterprises -- 72 percent of the total in
cities in 1978, 61 percent in 1985 and 34 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Employees in the state economy accounted for 64.1 percent of
all Chinese urban workers in 1996, compared to 78.3 percent in
1978. This means that state-run businesses have laid off 25
million workers. In addition, three million lay-offs are expected
each year through 2000, according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
In developed countries, the industrial sector usually provides
18 percent of the jobs. In 1994, for the first time in China,
there were fewer jobs in the industrial sector than those in the
service sector. The industrial sector's need for workers is
expected to continue to decline, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Readjustment of the economic structure will provide new job
opportunities, economics experts pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Senators Welcome Ramos' Anointment of House Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Senators from different
political parties today welcomed President Fidel Ramos' decision
to choose House Speaker Jose de Venecia as the ruling Lakas-NUCD
party's candidate for next year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Even as opposition leaders expressed optimism that they can
defeat the speaker, still they admitted that de Venecia may be
hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
"The president's choice of Speaker Jose de Venecia as
presidential standard bearer of Lakas-NUCD gives the opposition a
worthy opponent," said Senate President Blas Ople, a stalwart of
the grand opposition party, the Laban ng Makabayang Masang
Pilipino (LAMMP).
</P>
<P>
Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, a leader of the Liberal Party,
warned the presidential aspirants from other parties not to take
de Venecia lightly.
</P>
<P>
LAMMP however issued a press statement predicting a landslide
victory for the opposition with de Venecia's anointment, in view
of his poor performance in a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
But Enrile said de Venecia can easily improve his showing in
surveys with the support of Ramos, whose achievements during his
five years in office will be strong enough to swing votes to de
Venecia's favor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, de Venecia enjoys the backing of congressmen and
their constituents, making himself "the most viable candidate of
the ruling party," Enrile said.
</P>
<P>
"He leads a big contingent of congressmen who are very
influential in their districts... He has also a big influence over
local government units," he said.
</P>
<P>
Even Senator Ramon Magsaysay Jr., who himself also sought
President Ramos' anointment, said Ramos' timely decision avoided
the split of the ruling party.

<HEADLINE> Endangered White-flag Dolphins Found in Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have found
more than 20 white-flag dolphins during one week of monitoring the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
White-flag dolphins, a rare mammal found only in the Yangtze,
is one of the most endangered cetacean mammals in the world. Less
than 100 are believed to be alive. White-flag dolphins are under
first-degree national protection for wildlife in China.
</P>
<P>
About 500 researchers traced white-flag dolphins and black
finless porpoises simultaneously along the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze River, China's longest. This is the first
time that monitoring work was done at the same time in different
sections of the river.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found eight white-flag dolphins on the first
day of monitoring, according to sources from the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS), and more on succeeding days in Hubei, Jiangxi,
Anhui and Jiangsu provinces.
</P>
<P>
Many more black finless porpoises were traced. Researchers even
found groups of newborn black finless porpoises in Poyang Lake in
Jiangxi Province and in some sections of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that there is a vigorous complementary colony for
black finless porpoises," said one CAS researcher who took part in
the monitoring work.
</P>
<P>
Black finless porpoises, under second-degree national
protection for wildlife, are dispersed over China's coastal areas,
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and northeast
China's Yalujiang River. The black finless porpoises living in the
Yangtze River are considered a relatively independent
variety.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean minister said
employers should make an effort to weed out sexual harassment in
the workplace in order to tap the potential of female employees.
</P>
<P>
Public service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence
Chitauro told a meeting on 16 days of activism against gender
violence said every third woman in Zimbabwe's workplace was
sexually Harassed.
</P>
<P>
This makes sexual harassment the most prevalent form of gender
based victimization of women.
</P>
<P>
Sexual harassment not only affected women's productivity, but
also their health and social lives, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless and until sexual harassment in all its diabolic forms
is reported and companies and authorities respond to it as a
crime violating the rights of working women, it cannot be
eliminated," said Chitauro.
</P>
<P>
The participants to the meeting implored Chitauro to introduce
legislation that explicitly condemns sexual harassment and
prescribes penalties against offenders.
</P>
<P>
They said sexual harassment did not only affect women in
formal employment, but those in the informal sector as well.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro said respective companies should come up with clear
policies against sexual harassment and establish a transparent
reporting procedure.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Debt Situation Healthy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"All the indices indicate that China has been generally
successful in the administration of foreign debt," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign debt has been expanding yearly since it began
borrowing overseas in 1979. The amount of foreign debt China
borrowed totaled 240.24 billion U.S. dollars between 1985, the
first year when official statistics were available, and 1996. Over
the years China has maintained a good debt-repayment record,
paying back 169.72 billion U.S. dollars in principal and interest.
</P>
<P>
The expanding foreign debt has prompted the Chinese government
to adopt a series of policies and regulations to strengthen debt
management to improve its overall situation, including the
introduction last year of a quota control system for medium- and
long-term overseas loans.
</P>
<P>
While gradually encouraging qualified enterprises to raise
funds on their own in the international capital market, China will
further reform its system in accordance with such international
practices as imposing a ceiling on financial institutions'
outstanding value of medium- and long-term foreign debt and
enforcing a credit rating system among institutions raising funds
overseas, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Economists warn that foreign debts are "double-edged": while an
appropriate amount of foreign debt may effectively boost economic
growth when used efficiently, excessive foreign debt will result
in a crisis if improperly used.
</P>
<P>
Based on this understanding, China should strive hard to
control the size of its foreign debt and make more efficient use
of the borrowed money, they suggested.

<HEADLINE> Province Has Satisfactory Grain Output After Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province in northeast
China harvested 13 million tons of grain this year despite a
severe drought, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The harvest did not come easily. As the country's oldest
heavy-industrial base, the province's agricultural sector has
been considered a bottleneck for local economic growth since the
1980s, with nearly half of its grain and vegetable supplies
coming from other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Strategies have been worked out, giving equal importance to
agricultural development and the prevailing industrial sector, as
Wen Shizhen, governor of Liaoning, said that agricultural
development should be treated as a top priority.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has allocated 1.6 billion yuan annually to aid the
agricultural sector. The past five years have seen improvements to
120,000 hectares of low-yielding farmland and expansion to 250,000
hectares of irrigated fields.
</P>
<P>
Recent efforts to improve flood- and drought-resistant
capabilities of the seven major reservoirs in the central part of
the province have helped the province increase at least 2 billion
kilograms of grain.
</P>
<P>
For the last five years, Liaoning's grain output has exceeded
15 million tons, which is considered more than
self-sufficient. Non-staple goods such as vegetables, fruits,
meat, eggs and aquatics reached 20 million tons this year, double
the figure of five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Benefited by rapid growth in the rural economy, half of the
province's two million impoverished people have been lifted above
the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also show that the output value from township
enterprises accounting for 40 percent of the province's total
industrial sector and this year's per-capita annual income in the
rural areas averages over 2,300 yuan (about 277 U.S. dollars).

DAR ES SALAAM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is expected to
earn 60 million US Dollars from tobacco exports in the 1997/98

</P>
<P>
"Our production has actually gone up by 50 percent in all
tobacco growing areas and we expect this positive trend to

Tanzania Tobacco Board, Hassan Liana told the paper Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liana said his board is committed to ensure tobacco growers
are fairly treated in the free market system.
</P>
<P>
He called on farmers to redouble their efforts in the
production of the cash crop, saying that tobacco has a ready
market abroad with attractive prices.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Debt Situation Healthy  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The status of China's foreign
debt is healthy, with all major indices well within established
international safety limits, officials and experts agree.
</P>
<P>
Both the size and risk potential of China's foreign debts have
been brought under effective control in tandem to improve the debt
structure since 1993 when China began to implement macro-control
economic policies, an official of the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange (SAFE) told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that China's foreign debts have
entered a period of reasonable growth, with the increase in
outstanding value up less than 10 percent in 1996 and 8.3 percent
in the first half of 1997, compared to an average 25 percent for
the 1986-1990 period and 15.2 percent for the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
In terms of structure, short-term debts accounted for barely
11.5 percent of China's foreign debt of 118.64 billion U.S.
dollars at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
"China's foreign debt is appropriate to its economic strength
and its position of balance of international payments," Li Yang,
director of the Financial Research Center of the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, the three major indices tracking the
health of a country's foreign debt situation are all well below
internationally accepted levels.
</P>
<P>
China's ratio of outstanding foreign debt to annual foreign
exchange earnings was 75.6 percent at the end of 1996, much lower
than the conventional standard of 100 percent. The indebtedness
rate, or the ratio of annual repayment of debt principal and
interest to foreign exchange income of the same year, was at 6.7
percent, compared with the recognized standard of 20 percent. The
other index, the debt-servicing ratio, measured by the result of a
country's gross domestic product divided by the outstanding value
of its foreign debt, was 14.3 percent, far below the average for
developing nations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Indian Offer on Import Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
rejected India's offer to phase out quantitative restrictions on
imports over a six-year period, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and India have been locked in a trade dispute over the
latter's quantitative restrictions on imports for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
In an informal meeting with the press here, visiting U.S.
Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, however, expressed hope about
receiving an improved offer from India which may end the logjam.
</P>
<P>
Daley, who held talks with his Indian counterpart B.B. Ramaiah
on Monday, said the U.S. side had decided to continue negotiating
with the Indian side even after the World Trade Organization (WTO)
sets up a panel to look into the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. is also pressing for reduction in import duty
on a variety of items before the two countries could arrive at a
compromise to end the dispute over quantitative restrictions on
imports.
</P>
<P>
When asked why the U.S. was taking a rigid stand while others
like the European Union, Canada, Japan and Australia have accepted
the six-year phaseout offered by India, Daley simply said his
country's position is different.

KIEV, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian army has fulfilled
its development plan for 1997, Vasily Sobkov, army commander, said
here today at a press conference marking Ukraine's first Army Day.
</P>
<P>
Despite the economic difficulty it has been experiencing since
its founding six years ago, Sobkov said, the Ukrainian army has
not lost its combat effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
He said the army now has 200,000 men, including 40,000
officers, and six academies, two trainers divisions and three
warrant officers schools.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Sobkov pointed out, the army still has big
numbers of commissioned positions unfilled. When Ukraine was first
independent, 47 percent of the officers were Russians. Now with
those Russians gone, he said, only 80 percent of the positions of
officers and warrant officers are filled.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the army's 1998 technology and equipment
development plan will soon be publicized.
</P>

Ukraine has a defense force of 370,000 men. Besides a military
construction and development program to be implemented before the
year 2005, the government also mapped out the plan for the army at
the beginning of 1997 so as to help its professionalization and
modernization.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Wins Initial Success in Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government agents
have arrested 28 kidnap suspects since Friday, giving heat to the
latest anti-kidnapping campaign launched at the beginning of the
month.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said the 28 suspects belong to three
kidnap syndicates. Their fall solved 80 percent of the
kidnap-for-ransom cases reported across the country this year.
</P>
<P>
"We will not tolerate further kidnappings in this country. This
is a quick response and warning to all who defy the law," Justice
Secretary Teofisto Guingona said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official with the Presidential Anti-Crime
Commission revealed that the national police are monitoring the
activities of some other gangs believed to be involved in
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
Guingona said the nabbed suspects include the kidnap-slayers of
Gordon Tan and Ignacio Ong Jr., two young Filipino-Chinese
businessmen killed on November 24 and December 2 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The murder of Tan and Ong prompted the Filipino-Chinese in
Metro Manila to stage a series of protests. In a strongly-worded
open letter to President Fidel Ramos, they called for the
immediate stop of such kidnapping cases in the country.
</P>
<P>
"we are aghast. We fear for our lives and those of our beloved
ones," they wrote, saying President Ramos is the only one who can
help them.
</P>
<P>
"The kidnap-for-ransom syndicates have hurled a direct
challenge at your leadership and at your law enforcers' capability
to catch not only the criminals but their masterminds", they said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by anti-kidnapping
organizations, about 950 people were kidnapped between 1993 and
1996 and 85 of them murdered. In the first 10 months of this year,
193 more were abducted and at least 9 million U.S. dollars have
been paid in ransom.
</P>
<P>
Not only has the problem worsened considerably but the
kidnappers have also become more and more brazen and daring,
taking victims right from inside their business establishments and
homes, in broad daylight and in busy thoroughfares too,
anti-kidnapping groups said.
</P>
<P>
The Filipino-Chinese attributed the rampage of kidnapping cases
to the incapacity of the military and the police. They said some
cops were kidnappers or protectors of abductors, citing that a
national police ID was recently found on a kidnapper's dead body.
</P>
<P>
However, the police accused the victims' families of failing to
cooperate with them. In fear that the victims might be killed by
the kidnappers, the victims' families usually do not report the
case to the police. Instead, they pay the ransom immediately,
giving no clues for the police to pursue the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Swamped by widespread criticism of his government's failure to
stop and solve kidnappings, President Ramos became angry and
turned the heat on his cabinet secretaries and police generals.
</P>
<P>
"I want results," Ramos told the secretaries of all law
enforcement agencies, scolding them for failing to cooperate well
with each other. He ordered the top leaders of the police and the
military to quickly map out a battle plan against kidnappers and
their own men engaged in kidnapping and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Philippine National Police chief Recaredo
Sarmiento tendered his resignation for the recent rash of
kidnappings. Ramos accepted his resignation, appointed a new
police chief and ordered the launching of the latest
anti-kidnapping campaign.
</P>
<P>
Since then policemen have been on 24-hour patrol in sensitive
areas in Metro Manila. Policemen working in neighboring provinces
also came to reinforce the forces in Manila as courts were urged
to speed up the prosecution of kidnapping cases and the execution
of convicted kidnappers facing death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The anti-kidnapping organizations commended the initial success
of the law enforcers. But they also called on the police to work
hard to arrest the masterminds of these kidnapping cases and have
them punished.

<HEADLINE> China Eximbank Sets Up Chengdu Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of China
(China Eximbank) opened a representative office in Chengdu Monday,
capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the office, its sixth, following the bank's
offices in Dalian, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou and Xi'an, aims to
help bolster southwest China's exports of machinery and electronic
products.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials said the establishment of the Chengdu office
will help the bank to strengthen loan project investigation and
management in the region and also provide convenience for local
enterprises to get financial support from the Eximbank.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality are important
industrial bases in southwest China, with the exports of the
region's machinery and electronic items increasing by 32.3 percent
during 1987-1996 period, higher than the country's export growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
The Eximbank, one of China's three policy-oriented banks, was
established in 1994. It is designed to support the country's
export of high-tech and high-value products as well as complete
sets of equipment, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Minister to Probe Central Bank Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will take action
against senior officials of the country's central bank found
responsible for mismanagement of the bank and foreign reserves,
according to the Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
A special committee will be set up within days to investigate
the Bank of Thailand's management of public money loaned to
troubled finance firms, and the use of foreign reserves to defend
the baht, the newspaper quotes Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
In mid-year the central bank poured a staggering 430 billion
baht (16.9 billion U.S. dollars) into a hopeless, secret bailout
attempt of debt-ridden finance companies, many of which were
closed down Monday, 100 billion baht (3.9 billion dollars) of
public money in assisting the ailing Bangkok Bank of Commerce, and
23 billion dollars or two-thirds of the country's foreign
reserves, into international markets to defend the baht.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said officials involved must accept responsibility for
their actions.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government will change the law so that it
would limit the power of the central bank governor and his
deputies in deciding and implementing economic policies.

<HEADLINE> Closure of 56 Thai Finance Firms Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government's decision
to close 56 of the 58 suspended ailing finance firms has received
wide-spread support from both local and foreign business people
and analysts.
</P>
<P>
Most believe the step was, although painful, necessary and in
the right direction, according to the Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
"The government announcement lifted some more of the black
cloud surrounding Thailand. It was a very positive move. It will
mean some short-term pain but a long-term gain for the whole Thai
economy," Paul Wanglee, chief strategist for Thailand at Goldman
Saches (Hong Kong), was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the closures mean that foreign investors are invited in
and bad management and companies are kicked out of business.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index strengthened Monday
in response to the announcement, rising 13.03 points (3.35
percent) to close at 401.80, with trading value of more than 3.5
billion baht (83.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The baht strengthened to 41.45 immediately after the
announcement, but gradually weakened to 42.20 on very high demand
for U.S. dollars from corporations.
</P>
<P>
Nikhil Srinivasan, vice president of equities at Morgan
Stanley, said the announcement seemed to point to a political will
to get the country back on the right track. Transparency,
equality, and willingness have all been shown in the announcement
and these are the things demanded by investors.
</P>
<P>
Khananphan Natanasen from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said the
government had taken an impressive and tough decision, and this
was bound to boost confidence and could greatly assist efforts to
persuade foreign banks to roll over their loans extended to the
Thai private sector.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's country director in Thailand J. Shivakumar
said Monday, "The World Bank strongly welcomes the decision" of
the Thai government.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Expert Denies Engines Caused Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Engine failure was unlikely to be
the cause for the An-124 crash in the Russian city of Irkutsk on
December 6, a Ukrainian expert said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vyacheslav Boguslaev, chairman of the Motor-Sich aircraft
engine manufacturing association which is based in the Ukrainian
city of Zaporozje, said Russian investigators have not found
sufficient evidence to prove engines made by Motor-Sich were the
cause for the crash.
</P>
<P>
The An-124 jumbo transport plane crashed in Irkutsk just a few
seconds after takeoff last Saturday, killing all on board and many
people in an apartment building the plane slammed into.
</P>
<P>
Russian television reported the number of casualties had risen
to about 60 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Boguslaev was furious with Yevegeni Shaposhnikov, the Russian
President's adviser on aviation matters. Shaposhnikov indicated
that Motor-sich engines were the cause even before Russia's
inquiry team led by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin set off on
a fact-finding mission to Irkutsk.
</P>
<P>
The Motor-Sich chairman said Shaposhnikov gave confusing
information about the crash in his televised speech.
</P>
<P>
"Shaposhnikov said two of the four engines failed, but later he
said the four engines failed simultaneously," said Boguslaev.
</P>
<P>
He said engine performance did not depend solely on the
manufacturer, but also on those who maintained them. "Human error
was 99.9 percent the cause," he predicted.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Meet Clinton on Arms Reduction Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will meet United States President Bill Clinton here next year to
discuss the enactment of the Third Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's Press Secretary Sergi Yastrzhembsky made the
statement Monday in response to Clinton's signal for a meeting
with his Russian counterpart on the issue. The meeting would not
be this year, Yastezhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Although Yeltsin called for contacts between Russian and
U.S. experts on the enactment of the treaty during his visit to
Sweden last week, Yastrzhembsky said, summit talks on the issue
would be a totally different matter.
</P>
<P>
He said at the moment it was still difficult to set a specific
date for the meeting. However, he noted, it was right to say it
should take place after Russian State Duma endorsed the Second
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was signed by Russia
and the United States in 1993. The U.S. Senate approved it in
1996. The Duma, however, still retains its negative attitude
toward it.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Drug Lords Look for New Ways to Move Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Colombian drug cartels have
been searching for new ways to transport cocaine from production
regions to markets, a report from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency
(DEA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted by the local daily La Republica said that
drug lords are using maritime routes from Panama to Guatemala
through the Caribbean Sea, instead of land.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Plunges Lowest Against US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah fell
deeper Monday, breaking the 4,100 barrier to touch another
historic low, while the stock market managed to make a three-day
rally, dealers and brokers said today.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said spot rupiah fell to a historic low of
4,155 against the U.S. dollar Monday afternoon, compared with last
Friday's close of 4,025.
</P>
<P>
The drop occurred despite sporadic intervention by Bank
Indonesia, the central bank, to support the currency.
</P>
<P>
Bank dealers said the rupiah was weighed down by concerns over
President Soeharto's health, fire at the central bank building and
some regional weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
Worries over Soeharto's health surfaced last Friday when the
76-year-old leader failed to attend a government function and a
senior minister announced the he was taking a 10-day rest to
recuperate from a recent overseas trip.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah's dramatic drop coincided with a fire Monday at Bank
Indonesia's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The fire engulfed the top four floors of the bank's new
25-story A tower, killing 15 people.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost 40 percent of its value since July amid
steep drops in currencies across Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Despite the weakening rupiah, stock prices on the Jakarta Stock
Exchange continued to rally. The composite index gained 2.1
percent to close up 8.835 points at 423.613.
</P>
<P>
Stockbrokers said the rise was due more to support from
state-owned enterprises rather than fundamentals.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Pakistani-Indian Rapprochement Vital to Regional Peace, Development (1)  by Xu Yuenai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and India are facing
this year many uncertainties both on political and economic
fronts, especially on the much-talked issue of normalizing
bilateral relations between them.
</P>
<P>
The prospects of resuming bilateral talks, which gained
momentum with positive results in the first half of this year,
seem to be overshadowed by the latest political crises in the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Pakistan's recent constitutional crisis
which had gripped the nation for almost four months and the
political turmoil in neighboring India which led to a change of
government could be anything but conducive to promoting the
rapprochement process.
</P>
<P>
For half a century, it has been a cherished dream of the
peoples of Pakistan and India to normalize bilateral relations by
resolving all outstanding issues including the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Kashmir dispute, the main obstacle to the normalization
process, has bedeviled the atmosphere of understanding and
cooperation between Pakistan and India and has sparked several
brutal armed conflicts between the two since their independence in
1947.
</P>
<P>
Before January 1994, Pakistan and India had held seven rounds
of foreign secretary-level talks. But due to their basic
differences on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, the two countries
failed to make any important and practical headway.
</P>
<P>
After that the two South Asian nations virtually had no
political contact on all levels for three consecutive years. It
was in March this year the impasse in the strained relations was
broken as the two countries resumed their bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
The major initiative taken by the two countries towards
rapprochement was widely welcomed by the international community.
More encouraging, neither Pakistan nor India laid down any
pre-conditions for their eighth round of foreign secretary-level
talks held in New Delhi at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India have held three rounds of bilateral talks
since March this year. The most encouraging one was the meeting on
May 12 between Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and then
Indian Prime Minister I.K. Gujral in Male, capital of the
Maldives, during which the two sides agreed to address all
outstanding issues of concern and set up a mechanism, including
working groups at appropriate levels, to address all the issues in
an integrated manner.
</P>
<P>
However, due to their differences on major issues, the meetings
between the two leaders on September 24 in New York and on October
25 in Edinburgh, Scotland, made no major progress.
</P>
<P>
It is still hard to predict when the two countries will resume
their talks or whether any breakthrough will be made in future
talks.
</P>
<P>
Observers here are of the view that improving the long-strained
bilateral relations between Pakistan and India is an economic
necessity for both countries and the South Asian region as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Economic matters, especially cooperation in commerce and trade
for common development, have become a top priority in
international relations today.
</P>
<P>
For developing countries like Pakistan and India, there is a
compelling need to spend less on armaments and more on social and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, half a century after their independence,
Pakistan and India are still locked in confrontation over the
Kashmir issue. Successive governments of the two countries have
perpetuated this insecurity by diverting valuable resources needed
for alleviating poverty and ending social injustice to armament.
</P>
<P>
Observers here note, however, that despite their long-standing
dispute over the Kashmir issue, both Pakistan and India are now
under increasing strong domestic and global pressure to move
towards peace, friendship and cooperation with each other.
</P>
<P>
The leadership in the two countries have time and again
stressed the urgency to improve the living condition of their
peoples by alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that only in a tension-free environment can
the two countries divert their scarce resources to development in
social and economic sectors.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Pakistani-Indian Rapprochement Vital to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As far as Pakistan is concerned, it is faced with such a
critical resource crunch that its total national income is unable
to support two principal items of expenditure, namely, the debt
servicing and defense. Therefore, it faces severe chronological
budget and trade deficits.
</P>
<P>
The only way to overcome its growing trade gap is for Pakistan
to increases its export. Revitalizing the economy, therefore, has
become the top priority for the present Pakistani government.
</P>
<P>
India faces similar problems. Its target of seven percent
annual growth rate may not be achieved unless it is able to
attract large amounts of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The economic liberalization programs launched by the successive
Indian governments have generated a momentum for maximum
development process which can only be sustained if India promotes
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Instability in the South Asian region has obstructed the
development of the member countries of the South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), the main regional forum
established in 1985.
</P>
<P>
At the Ninth SAARC Summit in Male, the Maldives, last May,
member countries decided to establish the proposed South Asian
Free Trade Zone by the year 2001, four years ahead of the
previously scheduled time.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Summit called on all member countries to accelerate
their cooperation in all fields and concentrate on economic
development in order to put an early end to the poverty and
backwardness of the region.
</P>
<P>
But Pakistan and India, the two largest economies within SAARC,
have never enjoyed the circumstances to do so.
</P>
<P>
Many believe that the targets set by the SAARC Summit may not
be achieved if the relationship between India and Pakistan remains
hostile.
</P>
<P>
Normalization of Pakistani-Indian relations is necessary for
strengthening peace and security in the region and for opening up
avenues of collaboration to tackle crucial economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that suppressed trade between Pakistan
and India strongly depresses the chances of promoting intra-SAARC
trade to its maximum potential.
</P>
<P>
Reviving and promoting bilateral trade between the two
countries through official channels is critical for sustained
expansion of mutually beneficial intra-SAARC trade and
trade-related joint ventures, they say.
</P>
<P>
As the two largest nations within SAARC, it is in the greater
interest of the two countries as well as the entire region that
Pakistan and India take concrete measures to liberalize their
trade to push forward cooperation within the SAARC towards the
next century.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that improvement of bilateral ties and the
signing of a no-war pact between Pakistan and India could make the
investment environment friendly in the region and attract more
foreign capital which is badly needed by the two countries in
developing their economies.
</P>
<P>
The international community is watching closely whether
Pakistan and India will be able to put their political disputes
aside for a while and negotiate issues including economic
cooperation in a serious and result-oriented manner.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Further Open Banking Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
looking at allowing the entry of more foreign banks on concerns
that existing banks are behaving as a cartel in charging lending
rates to customers, Business World reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the move to further liberalize the banking
system was proposed by the Department of Finance and is part of
the reforms being drafted under the Philippines' long-term
development plan.
</P>
<P>
The country allowed 10 foreign banks to enter in 1995 as part
of its reforms to introduce competition in the industry and bring
down interest rates.
</P>
<P>
However, the banks failed to lower prime lending rates despite
the Central Bank's efforts in the financial crisis sweeping most
of Asia, prompting the Department of Finance to consider the new
proposal.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's auction, the interest rate of 91-day treasury bill,
the benchmark used by most banks to price their loans, surged
141.4 basis points to 18.18 percent from last week's level.
</P>
<P>
"Given the existing scenario, banks are behaving like
monopolies and they are squeezing their borrowers dry," a
government official said.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said that he would meet
with the representatives of commercial banks Friday, encouraging
them to lower the prime lending rates.

<HEADLINE> New Means of Recycling City Waste Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have found
improved technology to deal with a problem which has caused
pollution and degradation of the environment, the "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
The technology, approved by the State Science and Technology
Commission(SSTC)last August, is designed to convert discharged
waste into useful and recyclable resources.
</P>
<P>
It was experimented in Guanghan, Sichuan Province, last August
and its use will expand to other urban areas in China, the
department for social development under the SSTC told China Daily
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The use of the technology has yielded remarkable economic,
social and ecological results in Guangan, said Chen Congshun. Chen
is an official of the city's science and technology committee.
</P>
<P>
In the non-State-owned Guanghan Garbage Treatment Plant,
automatic separation is used to enable discharged waste to be
converted into organic compound fertilizers and plastic
products. The waste is used for heating and drying while producing
the fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
This technique means garbage can be made environmentally
friendly within 9-12 days, as opposed to the 40 days required for
burning garbage, said Wang Yingbin, the plant's manager.
</P>
<P>
The plant can treat 120 tons of garbage each day, converting 98
percent of it into useful resources.
</P>
<P>
The garbage recycling plant can earn 2.1 million yuan (253,000
US dollars) in profits each year from manufacturing organic
compound fertilizers and 400,000 yuan from plastic products.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, after separating the garbage, the
manufacture and drying of organic compound fertilizers consumes
only one ton of coal each day, compared with five tons per day
without waste separation.
</P>
<P>
South and Southeast Asian countries, such as Thailand, India,
Singapore and Viet Nam, have also shown interest in the
technique.

<P>
QUITO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- President of the National
Congress of Ecuador Heinz Moeller was appointed today as president
of the Andean Parliament for a two-year term, replacing outgoing
President Julio Cesar Turbay, a Colombian senator.
</P>
<P>
New vice presidents of the regional organization are Andres
Reggiardo Sayan from Peru, Felipe Montilla from Venezuela, Gonzalo
Valda Cardenas from Bolivia and Julio Cesar Turbay from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadoran Gilberto Vaca, Tito Nilton Mendozas, Patricio Viteri
and Carlos Torres and Lourdes Espinoza were elected as members of
the permanent commissions of the Andean Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The 13th term of the parliament was installed today in Quito
and it would aims to integrate Andean countries and to analyze a
plan of legal reforms with the objective that the members of the
parliament be elected by direct vote.
</P>
<P>
At the inauguration of the first plenary session, the chief of
the Ecuadoran parliament delegation, Heinz Moeller, who is the
president of the Organizing Committee, welcomed legislators that
make up the Andean Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The agenda for the three-day meeting includes the election of
new leaders of the regional organization and an analysis on
a project for legal reforms designed to elect members of the
parliament through direct vote.
</P>
<P>
Moeller pointed out that the meeting is basic for the full
integration of Andean countries.
</P>
<P>
The Andean Community should make real the ideal of hero Simon
Bolivar, who fought in the 19th century for the independency of
the region from Spain, said Heinz Moeller.
</P>
<P>
In order to reach that goal, the countries should start to make
important changes in decentralization, administrative and
financial deregulation of public institutions.

<HEADLINE> Employment Tops UK Agenda as EU President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The most important job for the
United Kingdom Presidency of the European Union (EU) for the first
half of 1998 would be to create more jobs, British Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs Robin Cook said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cook made the remark Monday afternoon in Brussels where he got
together with his EU counterparts to continue preparations for the
bloc's planned eastward enlargement ahead of an EU summit in
Luxembourg later this week.
</P>
<P>
After making a brief mention of jobs creation through education
and open market, the British foreign minister went on to call for
transparency of EU policies and institutions and "openness and
accessibility" of the EU through Internet.
</P>
<P>
He said the UK presidency would want to enhance the EU's fight
against organized crimes, particularly against drugs and computer
crimes.
</P>
<P>
He also said the EU presidency should assume the responsibility
for environment, adding that improvement of air quality was an
issue which deserved special attention.
</P>
<P>
On EU enlargement, Cook said that the "screening" of all the 11
applicants for EU membership would not slow down the EU's process
of negotiation with the six applicants in forefront -- the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and the divided island of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, proposed in
July that the EU start talks with the six applicants which were
considered most advanced in economic and political reforms.
</P>
<P>
But this would leave the other five applicants -- Latvia,
Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania -- in the EU's waiting
room.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg summit is expected to decide whether or not to
begin entry talks only with the six applicants on the fast lane or
with all the applicants.

<HEADLINE> Asian Economic Crisis Affects Canadian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Asian economic
crisis will slow down Canada's economic growth, with British
Columbia and Central Canada feeling the greatest effects,
according to a report released today by the Bank of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
The regions are most affected in Canada because of the exposure
to Asia of forest products, coal, base metals and the
transportation equipment and related sectors, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the economic growth prospects for Canada will be
reduced by 0.2 percentage points in 1998, it predicted.
</P>
<P>
Report attributes the impact to two main factors: a slowing in
growth in Asia and the appreciation of the Canadian dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, the report also noted that the Canadian financial
services sector could benefit from opportunities made available by
the reduced capabilities of Asian banks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the crisis is likely to accelerate the opening up
of Japanese financial services markets, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The origins of the Asian crisis are found in a deadly mix of
overvalued currencies, large current account deficits and problems
loans in the banking systems," the report noted.
</P>
<P>
"A long-term solution will require substantial structural
reform of the banking systems and the individual economies," it
said.

WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The overwhelming majority of
Americans consider drugs the most serious problem facing children
today, followed by crime and the breakdown of home life, according
to a survey released today.

A similar survey conducted 11 years ago also found drugs to be
the top concern.
</P>
<P>
But while the breakdown of home life was a close second in

serious problem today, according to the survey, which was
sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and conducted by
the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
While 28 percent of Americans were concerned about child and
sexual abuse in 1986, fewer than 2 percent of people mentioned it
this year.
</P>
<P>
This year's survey showed 24 percent of Americans concerned
with crime, which didn't register in 1986.

About 17 percent of people named poor quality education as a
top concern, up from 9 percent 11 years ago.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official held
talks with representatives from Afghanistan's Taliban government
at the State Department today.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley confirmed that Assistant
Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth met with Afghan Minister of
Mines and Industry Ahmad Jan.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the meeting with the Taliban delegation was part of
the U.S. policy of "being in regular contact with all Afghan
factions."
</P>
<P>
"The meeting with the Taliban leaders provideds us an
opportunity to reinforce our message of concern over Taliban
behavior, particularly on human rights and the treatment of women
and girls," he said.
</P>
<P>
When visiting Pakistan three weeks ago, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said the Taliban government behavior in dealing
with women and children was "despicable" and said the United
States has no intention to recognize it.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Satisfied With Iraqi Decision on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
United Nations Kofi Annan said here today he is not surprised
Iraq has agreed to carry out the third phase of the oil-for-food
deal, the Kuwaiti News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The deal is of great help to the Iraqis, and "I am happy for
them that the Iraqi government has made the decision," Annan said
at the Kuwait airport during a stopover en route to Iranian
capital Tehran to attend the summit of the Organization of Islamic
Conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. is doing whatever possible to make sure
that "the operation is run effectively and smoothly."
</P>
<P>
"The (U.N. Security) Council has never targeted the people of
Iraq. If the intention was to punish the people of Iraq, we would
have never had the oil-for-food scheme," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Iraq Monday agreed to cooperate with the U.N. Security Council
to extend the deal for another period of six months.
</P>
<P>
This implied a change of Iraq's position on this question since
it has said that it will not implement the deal until the
contracts signed during the first two phases have been
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
A Security Council resolution adopted in 1995 allows the
sanctions-ridden Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil
over every six months and to buy food and medicines. It was put
into effect a year ago and the third phase was set to start last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed after Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in
1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A new coalition government
came into being in Cameroun late Sunday night with Peter Mafany
Musonge retaining his post as prime minister, Radio Cameroun
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Camerounian President Paul Biya signed a presidential decree
announcing the formation of a government of national unity, which
is composed of 28 ministries and 47 members.
</P>
<P>
Bello Bouba, president of leading opposition, the National
Union for Democracy and Progress (NUDP), also joined the new
government and becomes the minister of state in charge of
industrial and commercial development.
</P>
<P>
Amadou Ali, former secretary-general at the presidency, was
appointed as defense minister while Kontchou Kouomegni, former
minister of state in charge of communication, becomes the
minister of state in charge of external relations.
</P>
<P>
Newly created are three ministries, namely the ministry of
towns, the ministry of public investment and regional development

two ministries -- the ministry of social affairs and the ministry
of women's affairs.
</P>

The reshuffle of the government of national unity came over 30
days after Biya was sworn in on November 3. He won the

<HEADLINE> Retired General Supports Affirmative Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman Colin Powell today expressed his support for
affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
The retired general said affirmative actions -- a formal effort
to provide increased employment and education opportunities for
women and ethnic minorities, to overcome past patters of
discrimination -- help reduce racial barriers to equal
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual National Council of Negro Women
Conference, Powell said that such programs are far better than
what went before.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen what the preference system that had been in place
for 250 years has done to us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Powell, a Republican, has differed often with the more
conservative members in his party on affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
The military provides the best example of how affirmative
action programs can broaden a pool of applicants in jobs and
education, Powell said. West Point, for example, tries to attain
various minority goals in its cadet population each year. Powell
said such efforts help promote minority participation for
children.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Defends Its Military Ties With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Defense Minister Ismet
Sezgin today reiterated that the Turkish-Israeli military
cooperation is not directed at any third party, the Anatolia News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin, also deputy prime minister, made the remarks prior to a
meeting with his Israeli counterpart Yitzhak Mordechai, who
arrived here today on a three-day visit, the first visit to Turkey
by an Israeli defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Turkey and Israel are two important countries in
the region, Sezgin said that their cooperation will contribute to
peace and stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to say once again that the military cooperation
between us is not directed against any other countries," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin expressed the belief that Mordechai's visit to Ankara
is bound to further strengthen friendship and cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Mordechai said that the Turkish-Israeli
cooperation is of strategic significance to the region, saying he
will discuss with Turkish leaders some issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly expanding Turkish-Israeli military alliance aroused
severe uneasiness among the Arab countries, which have repeatedly
urged Ankara to stop this sort of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel signed a defense industry pact and a
military training agreement last year, laying a foundation for
their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai also met with Turkish Chief of General Staff Ismail
Hakki Karadayi today. They exchanged views on cooperation between
the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed in principle on joint production of
long-range missiles, according to sources close to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Turkey has been planning to purchase
Israeli-made missiles.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking Turkish military delegation is to visit Israel
next January to discuss the details of this project, reliable
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense minister will also hold talks with Turkish
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin
during his visit.

<HEADLINE> EU, Mexico Sign Accord on Economic Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
Mexico here today signed an accord on economic partnership,
political coordination and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Global Accord was signed Monday by Mexican
Foreign Minister Angel Gurria, foreign ministers from the 15 EU
member countries and Manuel Marin, vice-president of the European
Commission, the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
Marin said at the signing ceremony that the accord opened a
"privileged relationship" between the two sides which were urged
to develop the "indispensable" political and economic ties in
order to face the future in the best possible conditions.
</P>
<P>
An interim accord on commerce and accompanying issues was also
signed Monday by the two sides in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The global accord aims to institutionalize the political
dialogue, reinforce the commercial and economic relations by means
of "bilateral and preferential, progressive and reciprocal
liberalization of exchanges" according to WTO rules and strengthen
and enlarge their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A joint council, which has been established to supervise the
implementation of the accord, will examine all the major issues
concerning the accord and all other bilateral and international
issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
The EU notes that respect of both democratic principles and
fundamental human rights also constitute an essential part of the
accord.
</P>
<P>
The formal relations between the EU and Mexico began with a
cooperation accord signed in 1975, which was aimed to develop the
economic and commercial relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation accord was replaced by another accord signed in
Luxembourg in April 1991, which extended the domain of their
bilateral cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Crown Prince Meets US Military Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan met
with Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Central Command Anthony Zinni
here today.
</P>
<P>
He discussed with Zinni issues of military and economic
cooperation between the two countries, especially U.S. military
assistance to meet the needs of the Jordanian armed forces, the
official news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Zinni arrived here Sunday for a five-day visit ahead of the
delivery of 16 U.S.-made F-16 jet fighters, which are worth 200
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The fighters are expected in Jordan on December 17.
</P>
<P>
The United States decided to grant Jordan 300 million U.S.
dollars worth of military aid in 1994 after the kingdom signed a
peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Jordan received 100 million dollars worth of
military equipment as part of the aid package, which included 18
helicopters, 50 tanks, 250 trucks, two personnel boats, air-sea
rescue boats, machine guns and 1,000 night-vision goggles.
</P>
<P>
Jordan ranks the fifth top recipient of U.S. aid.

<HEADLINE> US-Latin American Trade Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Improved economic conditions
and growth potential in Latin American economies are likely to
build confidence for continuing growth in trade between the
United States and Latin America, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports to South America's east coast will grow at an
annual rate of 7.5 percent and to its west cost at 5.4 percent for
the next five years, senior associate at Standard &AMP; Poors' DRI
trade forecasting service Bruce Lambert said recently.
</P>
<P>
Imports from the areas are expected to go up 4.2 percent and
5.4 percent respectively, Lambert was quoted by the Journal of
Commerce today as saying.
</P>
<P>
The impact of Southeast Asia's financial turmoil on Latin
America should not be felt beyond the first quarter of 1998, said
Mario Alfonso, an official with the logistics giant AEI Corp.
</P>
<P>
U.S. traders remain optimistic about their business with Latin
America for 1998 as they have seen a healthy 1997. "Overall, we
see the growth in Latin America continuing," Mario Alfonso added.
</P>
<P>
In the first half this year, U.S. exports of fertilizers and
telecommunications to the region through Florida showed growth.
</P>
<P>
Though Southeast Asian countries have an advantage of cheaper
exports to the U.S. because of their currency devaluation, their
exports of consumer goods are not supposed to pose competition to
Latin American exports of raw materials, analysts say.
