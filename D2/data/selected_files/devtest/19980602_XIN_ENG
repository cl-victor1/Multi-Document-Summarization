<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Japan Fails to Live up to Dock-Accord Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. shipping companies say that
Japan isn't living up to its agreement last year to make its ports
more hospitable -- an agreement that led Washington to drop trade
sanctions against Japan and end a chronic trade dispute.
</P>
<P>
Japanese waterfronts remain a trade barrier, U.S. operators
say, because dock work is slow, expensive, inefficient and unduly
influenced by a stevedoring association -- and Tokyo isn't doing
anything about it, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Those were the same charges that led the U.S. Federal Maritime
Commission last year to impose retaliatory penalties of 100,000
U.S. dollars per ship on Japanese vessels entering U.S. ports.
</P>
<P>
All this was supposed to have been solved after Tokyo agreed in
October to improve foreign access to Japanese ports, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
But today, "in all practical senses, the agreement is dead,"
says a senior executive of a foreign shipping line. Japanese ports
remain as closed as they were before the agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. shippers say the Japanese government is refusing to step
in. But the Japanese side says that a flawed agreement is not
going to produce any results.
</P>
<P>
Last year's dispute centered on a system called "prior
consultation." Ships docking in Japan had to get clearance from
the Japan Harbor Transport Association, an association of
stevedoring companies, for everything from docking dates to
choice of warehouses.

<HEADLINE> SAARC's Activities Unaffected by Nuke Tests: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The activities of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) will go ahead as
planned despite the nuclear tests carried out by India and
Pakistan, SAARC Secretary-General Naeem U. Hasan said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua at the Kathmandu-based SAARC
Secretariat, Hasan said that there is no indication that the 10th
SAARC summit will not take place as scheduled in July in Colombo,
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
He said that other meetings of the seven-nation grouping are
also going ahead as planned. "No member state has asked for any
change," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has just returned from Colombo, where he met
with Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga and discussed with
some officials about the arrangements of the summit.
</P>
<P>
"The exact date for the summit will be announced by Sri Lanka,
because they are still in touch with other member countries," the
secretary-general said. "As you know, to get the approval of all
the seven heads of state or government takes some time."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Sri Lankan foreign minister will visit
the other six SAARC capitals in one or two days. And he will be
able to announce the final date for the summit when he returns
home.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SAARC Secretariat is also going ahead with all
the arrangements for the summit, Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was on a tour of the region days before, and he will
set out again on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, other planned meetings are going on as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
For example, the SAARC commerce ministers met in Geneva as
planned on May 17 before the ministerial meeting of the World
Trade Organization began.
</P>
<P>
And last week, the SAARC Technical Committee on Education,
Culture and Sports met in Thimphu, capital of Bhutan, Hasan said,
adding that the Technical Committee on Health, Population
Activities and Child Welfare will meet in Colombo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Eminent Persons responsible for undertaking a
comprehensive appraisal of SAARC is to have its final meeting on
June 8-11 in the Maldives, the secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we have had some very important and serious developments
in South Asia in the last two weeks or so, but it is our hope that
these developments will not adversely affect the SAARC process,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan conducted six nuclear tests on May 28 and 30 in
response to the five nuclear tests by India on May 11 and 13,
raising fears of a nuclear arms race in the region and its adverse
impact on the SAARC's future.
</P>
<P>
Hasan said that in its 13 years' existence, SAARC has had some
ups and downs and difficulties. "I'm hopeful that we'll also be
able to overcome the present developments," he said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985, aims to establish a South Asian
Free Trade Area preferably by the year of 2001.
</P>
<P>
It now groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> GCC Urged to Improve Industrial Product Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Minister of Commerce
and Industry Abdel Aziz Dekheel Al-Dekheel Monday urged Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states to improve product quality to
live up to international competition.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of a seminar organized by the
Kuwaiti Public Authority of Industry, Al-Dekheel called on GCC
states to focus attention on the industrial sector, one of the
main sources of national income and basis for economic development.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance, comprises
six Arab countries, namely Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, the
United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister said the GCC states have made achievements
in putting more money into the industrial sector to diversify
sources of national income, create jobs and apply modern
technology to boost social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Doha-based Gulf Organization for
Industrial Consulting showed that investments by the GCC states in
the manufacturing rose to 74.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 from
28.5 billion dollars in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The production value of the manufacturing industries rose from
11.2 billion dollars in 1982 to 23 billion dollars in 1996, the
organization said.
</P>
<P>
The contribution of the sector to the gross domestic product in
the GCC states rose from 5.5 percent in 1982 to 9.6 percent in
1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said here Monday that an investigation on
the wealth of former government officials, including former
President Soeharto and his family, was going on.
</P>
<P>
He refused to disclose the details, saying that the
investigation needs a long time.
</P>
<P>
Soedjono said that he has assigned junior Attorney General to
carry out the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a survey result by the Indonesian
Business Data Center which was published here Monday, the assets
of Soeharto's family have reached 200 trillion rupiah (about 20
billion U.S. dollars). However, a foreign media once estimated
Soeharto's and his family's fortune is worth 40 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
addressing a gathering on Sunday at the Bogor Institute of
Agriculture in Bogor, about 60 kilometers south of the capital,
Indonesian Moslem leader Amien Rais has asked Soeharto to donate
his wealth to the nation and also called on Indonesians to forgive
the former president who had made great contribution to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who had ruled Indonesia for the last 32 years,
resigned on May 21 under the heavy pressure from the people
demanding for total reforms in political, economic and legal
fields.
</P>
<P>
The new government led by B.J. Habibie has promised to carry
out the reforms and to be free from corruption, collusion and
nepotism.

<HEADLINE> Intel Delays Shipment of Next-Generation Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's largest
computer chip maker, said that it has told its customers that it
is delaying production of its next-generation chip, code-named
Merced, by at least six months.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of computer and software companies tied their fortunes
to the long-awaited chip.
</P>
<P>
The new chip is also crucial to the company's effort to extend
its dominance from personal computers to the most powerful
machines used for high-end workstations and servers, the machines
that run computer networks. Merced had been expected to be
available sometime in the second half of 1999. On Friday, however,
Intel said it has to delay volume production of the
microprocessor, the heart of the computer, to mid-2000, due to the
complex involved in the new chip.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the delay is not expected to have a dramatic
impact on computer makers, most of which will offer high-end
systems based on chips other than Intel's.
</P>
<P>
Intel chips power nearly 90 percent of PCs worldwide. The
Merced is intended to help Intel make inroads into the high-end
computer market.
</P>
<P>
The chip will be Intel's first to use a 64-bit instruction
set, to process more computing instructions, vs. the current
32-bit instruction set in the higher-end Pentium II.

<HEADLINE> Chirac's Remarks in Lebanon "Not Helpful": Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac's
remarks that Israel should withdraw from south Lebanon without
conditions were "not helpful" for a solution to the problem, a
senior Israeli official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israel did not impose any conditions on its withdrawal from
south Lebanon while adopting the United Nation Resolution 425,
said David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Bar-Illan insisted that
the U.N. resolution itself, which calls for an "immediate and
unconditional" Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, "does have a
provision for a security arrangement."
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet endorsed the resolution on April 1, two decades
after it was adopted and then ignored, saying it wanted to quit
the 15-kilometer-deep self-declared security zone along the border
if Lebanon government made arrangements to prevent cross-border
guerrilla attacks against Israel's northern areas.
</P>
<P>
The offer was rejected by Lebanon, which insisted that Israeli
troop pullout should be unconditional under the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Beirut, the third in just two years, the
French president said on Sunday that he hoped for the
implementation of resolution 425 "immediately and without any
condition."
</P>
<P>
His position was utterly in line with those of Lebanon and its
powerful ally Syria, who held that the peace process on Lebanese
and Syrian tracks could not be separated and Israel should return
the Golan Heights it captured from Syria in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Illan, however, reiterated that Israel would not agree to a
unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon unless security
arrangments are worked out with Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Without such arrangments, the battlefield would only be pushed
back south Lebanon to Galilee in northern Israel, he said, adding
that "it would be meaningless."
</P>
<P>
In an earlier response to Chirac's remarks, Bar-Illan said on
Sunday that Israel would continue its effort to persuade Lebanese
government to facilitate the withdrawal of Israeli troops
and to make necessary arrangements.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Expresses Deep Concern over Lack of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday expressed deep concern over lack of functioning
government in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
"I urge all of the leaders to demonstrate their political will
to reach a settlement through practical and constructive
compromise," Annan said in his latest report on the situation in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Haiti has been without a Prime Minister since June 1997, and
with a virtually paralyzed parliament since this January.
Efforts to break the deadlock have been largely unsuccessfully.
</P>
<P>
"Haitian political leaders must quickly take concrete steps
to end the political deadlock, both with regard to the
installation of a new government and the holding of free and
fair elections to be organized by a new, credible Professional
Electoral Council so that the country' fragile democracy can be
consolidated and pressing national issues resolved," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The report warned that the political crisis is having a
destabilizing effect on Haiti's fledgling democracy, while also
harming economic activity and jeopardizing international assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General reported progress in modernizing the
Haitian national Police, but also expressed concern about
continuing reports of human rights violations, corruption and
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
"Professionalizing the police has to be complemented by a
functioning judicial system, for if the Haitian National Police
is to function effectively, it must do so within the context of
a credible judicial reform " said the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
He once again urged the Haitian authorities to move forward
expeditiously in the areas of judicial reform and called on the
international community to provide the necessary assistance in
that regard.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan's Economy on Track for Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's economy has shown some
encouraging signs in the first 10 months of the 1997-98 fiscal
year (July 1,1997 to June 30, 1998) with inflation down to 8.2
percent, trade balance improved by 54 percent and both
agricultural and industrial sectors recorded increase.
</P>
<P>
In the backdrop of these positive achievements, the annual
growth rate of Gross Domestic Product is estimated to grow by 5.4
during the current fiscal year, which will be the highest in the
last several years.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released by the government,
Pakistan's inflation rate, which has been running at double digit,
has declined to 8.2 percent in the first 10 months of the current
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
It is by no means a good news for the general public as this
south Asian nation has achieved a single digit inflation rate for
the first time in the last four years. And the 8.2 percent
inflation rate is also the lowest since the beginning of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture sector, which consists of about 25 percent of the
country's GDP, has recovered and is estimated to grow by 5.9
percent in the outgoing fiscal year, surpassing the target of 5.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
During the 10-month period, Pakistan has achieved cotton
production of 9.2 million bales. It may fail to meet the budget
target of 10 million bales due mainly to bad weather condition in
the last several months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Industrial output during the first three
quarters of the current fiscal year has registered a 7.2 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
The worrisome factor facing the government is the chronic
shortage of revenue collection. The target for the 1997-98 revenue
collection by the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) was fixed at
324.0 billion rupees (7.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, because of the unsatisfactory economic performance
during the first half of the current fiscal year, the revenue
target was later revised to 304.3 billion rupees (6.9 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
During the first 10 months of the current fiscal year the
revenue collection stood at 225.02 billion rupees (5.1 billion
dollars), which was 73.9 percent of the revised target.
</P>
<P>
Exports during the first 10 months of the current fiscal year
have increased by 4.6 percent, rising from 6.81 billion dollars to
7.13 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The growth in exports has come primarily from a 20.2 percent
increase of primary commodities exports and a 34.4 percent
increase in exports of other goods.
</P>
<P>
However, exports of textile manufacture, which consists of 60
percent of Pakistan's foreign exchange earnings, declined by 0.4
percent while other manufactures recorded nominal increase.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports during the same period have declined by
almost 13 percent to 8.45 billion dollars. Major decline comes
from industrial sectors including machinery, petroleum, textile as
well as agri-chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The balance of trade during the 10-month period stood at 1.32
billion dollars as against 2.90 billion dollars during the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. This amounts to
a 54.2 percent improvement in trade balance
</P>
<P>
The current account balance during the period has also improved
by almost 66 percent and stood at 1.127 billion dollars as against
3.288 billion dollars in the comparable period of the 1996-97
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Major contribution to this improvement has come from a
significant improvement in the trade balance, an 18.4 percent
increase in workers' remittances which stood at 1.175 billion
dollars and 54.9 percent increase in the inflow of Resident
Foreign Currency Deposits registering 1.485 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign private investment during the first three quarters of
the outgoing fiscal year amounted to 639.9 million dollars as
against 633.7 million dollars achieved in the same period of last
fiscal year, registering an increase of one percent.
</P>
<P>
Within foreign private investment, foreign direct investment
(FDI) has decreased by 2.7 percent from 448.4 million dollars to
436.1 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Almost 65 percent of FDI has come into the power, oil and gas,
and chemical, pharmaceutical and fertilizer sectors.
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that despite the East Asian crisis and general
loss of confidence in Asian markets by foreign portfolio
investors, Pakistan has succeeded in attracting 203.8 million
dollars of portfolio investment during the first three quarters of
the current fiscal year which is 10 percent higher than the
comparable period of last fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> British Diplomat on Contingency Plan for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- British High Commissioner to
Cyprus David Madden said here Monday that there is no travel
advice to British tourists against visiting this Eastern
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
His words came following a reported British "contingency plan"
to airlift 250,000 people from Cyprus on fears over war if Cypriot
government go on with its plan to deploy Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missiles later this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after an hour-long meeting with Cypriot Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides, Madden disassociated efforts to
settle the protracted Cyprus problem with a Cypriot government
decision to deploy the defensive S-300 missile system.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated British disagreement with the missile deployment,
but said Britain will continue its efforts for a political
settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the report by "Sunday Times," Madden said that
"contingency planning is one thing, risk assessment is another."
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides said Monday
in a written statement that leaking of information by the British
Defense Ministry over plans in the event of crisis in Cyprus does
not contribute to good bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Cypriot government decision to deploy the
anti-aircraft S-300 missiles, which pose a challenge to the rival
Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, would not change.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government ordered the missile system from Russia in
January 1997, which is expected to be delivered in mid-August. The
deal was opposed by the U.S., Britain and some others. Turkey has
threatened to destroy the missiles if deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third in the aftermath of a
pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has kept around 40,000 troops in northern Cyprus, which
was declared unilaterally in 1983 by Turkish Cypriots as a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," recognized only
by Ankara.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Monday received here the envoy of Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee, Brajesh Mishara, at the Elysee presidential
palace, said the French presidential office.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chirac again expressed the profound worry
of France and the international community over the nuclear tests
by India and Pakistan, as well as their impact on the future of
Asia and control of non-proliferation in the world.
</P>
<P>
He urged India to take "emergency measures to contribute to the
security of the region and the consolidation of the international
regime over nuclear non-proliferation."
</P>
<P>
For his part, Mishara delivered a letter from Vajpayee to
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the French presidential advisor on diplomatic affairs
Jean-David Levitte and other French diplomats held talks with
Mishara.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine will meet with the
Indian envoy on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chirac has proposed holding an international conference on
preventing India and Pakistan from making more nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Washington Post last Friday, Chirac
suggested providing security guarantee for India and Pakistan, as
well as sending aid in civilian nuclear energy in exchange for
their promise not to conduct any more tests.
</P>
<P>
If held, the conference will be attended by all the major
powers of the world, as well as India and Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Increases In April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Boosted by the largest increase
in commercial projects since last Summer, the U.S. construction
spending rose in April for the fifth consecutive month, the
Commerce Department reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 0.8 percent increase, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 630.1 billion U.S. dollars, followed gains of 0.1 percent in
March and 0.8 percent in February, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Construction spending has been growing since late last year,
supported by low U.S. interest rates caused as a side effect of
Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The April growth was led by a 2.3 percent gain in
nonresidential commercial projects, to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 167.3 billion dollars. Advances in construction of
offices, hotels and motels and shopping centers helped offset a
decline in spending on industrial buildings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, residential construction increased 0.9 percent, to a
seasonally adjusted rate of 285.8 billion dollars. However, it
didn't match the 1.5 percent advance in March and it was the
smallest since November.
</P>
<P>
Single-family construction advanced 1.2 percent and apartment
construction, 1.6 percent. Remodeling spending slipped 0.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Government construction increased 0.4 percent, only the second
gain in six months, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 136.3 billion
dollars. Increases in spending on schools and highways and streets
helped offset drops at military facilities, housing projects and
hospitals.

ways of improving their working relations, and Iraq had put

UNITED NATIONS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan is committed to extending all efforts of the United Nations
to relieve the suffering of the quake-affected Area in
Afghanistan, his spokesman said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A strong earthquake on Saturday hit Badakshan and Takhar
Provinces in Northeast Afghanistan, a region that has been
recovering from the severe effects of an earthquake which took
place in February.
</P>
<P>
The quake on Saturday was measured 7.2 magnitude, with death
toll estimated at 2000 to 3000, although the official figure was
not available.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. official told reporters here that the quake "was
certainly bigger" than the one in February which killed over a
thousand people. He said the magnitude of the latest one can be
compared with the 1988 Armenian earthquake and the large Iranian
quake in 1990.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. assessment team arrived in the affected area on Sunday
and five U.N. humanitarian flights are expected from Pakistan's

<P>
ALGIERS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan Monday expressed appreciation of Algeria's support
to Baghdad's call for a lifting of economic sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Algerian President Liamine Zeroual,
Ramadan told a press conference that he briefed Zeroual on the
situation in Iraq and the relationship between Iraq and the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Ramadan, envoy of President Saddam Hussein, arrived here Sunday
in an effort to seek international backing for the removal of the
trade embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council in
1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said that he conveyed a message to Zeroual from Saddam, who
called for Arab solidarity in confronting "U.S. plots and threats"
directed against Iraq and the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan underlined the necessity to step up efforts to have the
embargo lifted as Iraq "runs short of all what it had."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council will only lift the sanctions after
UNSCOM, which oversees disarmament in Iraq, certifies that the
country has eliminated all weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said that his visit to Algeria also dealt with ways of
promoting the bilateral ties.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has put the high costs of production resulting from poor
infrastructure as one of the main problems his country faces in
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing parliament session Monday afternoon, Museveni also
named poor management, tax evasion and deliberate dumping of some
imports and smuggling as the bottlenecks for development.
</P>
<P>
To improve management of revenue collection, he said, the
Uganda Revenue Authority has been restructured and the revenue
collection system is going to be computerized.
</P>
<P>
He described the improvement of road network as a necessity
for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has enough equipment to improve feeder roads in 39
districts and four million U.S. Dollars are still needed to buy
equipment for the remaining districts, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for trunk roads, he noted, work on the Sironko-Kapchorwa
Road has already been started and two others are expected to
begin by September 1999.
</P>
<P>
The government is also committed to improving efficiency in
the generation, transmission and distribution of utilities across
the country. This will be achieved by privatization, expansion
and utilization of efficient technology.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda Electricity Board should reduce its operation costs
by reducing the tariff, he added.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Iran React to Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia called on India and
Pakistan to show great self-restraint, saying that nuclear tests
conducted by both countries do not serve security and stability in
the region, Kuwait News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Information Minister Fuad Al-Faresi was quoted as
saying that his country understood the viewpoint of Pakistani
government as to safeguarding its security, but "we still calls on
both Pakistan and India to practice self-restraint and resume
negotiations to ensure security and stability in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
Al-Faresi made the remarks in a statement after the weekly
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also said his country hopes the international community to
avoid double-standard policy which turns a blind eye to Israel's
nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia supports a full ban of nuclear proliferation and
seeks to make the Middle East a region free of mass-destruction
weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, in response to India's nuclear tests on May 11 and
May 13, carried out six nuclear tests last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said on Monday
that Tehran is against any nuclear test intended for weapon
purposes, but favors civilian use of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
With Russian assistance, Iran is building a nuclear power plant
in Bushehr in the south. This has raised doubt that Tehran may be
seeking access to nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Iran wants the Middle East and the Persian Gulf to be free
from non-conventional weapons," Shamkhani said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran supports compliance with the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and Comprehensive Test Bank Treaty, but
holds that elimination of non-conventional weapons and disarmament
of Israel are prerequisites for banning proliferation of nuclear
arms.

testimony only on attorney-client privilege grounds.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-client privilege states that clients do not have to
disclose what they discussed with their lawyers, and may prevent
others from disclosing such confidential information.
</P>
<P>
The switch in legal tactics aims at countering Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's move last week seeking to bypass the
normal appeals process and ask the Supreme Court to settle the
dispute over the testimony of two White House aides in the Monica
Lewinsky probe.
</P>
<P>
The final decision was made at a meeting Monday between the
president and top lawyers, according to White House spokesman Mike
McCurry. McCurry said White House lawyers would file the response
today.
</P>
<P>
"The filing will confirm the president will not appeal the
district court's ruling on executive privilege," McCurry said.
"The filing will also confirm the legal counsel's intention to
appeal the ruling on attorney-client privilege."
</P>
<P>
The decision removes the barriers for Starr to question
immediately one of the aides, Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
The president's appeal will focus on blocking some testimony by
Clinton confidant Bruce Lindsey on grounds that he was functioning
as a lawyer and his testimony is covered by the right of clients
to keep their legal conversations confidential.
</P>
<P>
Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr said in a prepared speech
in Charlotte, North Carolina, today that such an appeal was
wrongheaded because courts have already concluded that government
lawyers don't have such a privilege in criminal cases involving
public officials.
</P>
<P>
A federal judge ruled last month that Lindsey and Blumenthal
had to answer grand jury questions they had previously refused.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors want to question Blumenthal about his sources of
derogatory information about Starr's office, and Lindsey on a
variety of matters, including his contacts with witnesses in the
Lewinsky probe.
</P>
<P>
In her ruling last month, U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson rejected the attorney-client claim based on earlier
rulings that while government lawyers have such a privilege it
can't be used to block their testimony before a federal grand jury
about possible criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
On executive privilege, Johnson ruled that while the privilege
applied to the disputed testimony, prosecutors' interest in the
information outweighed the president's right to keep his
conversations confidential.
</P>
<P>
White House lawyers reportedly viewed the latter interpretation
as a partial victory, and that led to the president's decision
Monday to focus the appeal solely on attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
Earlier there were reports quoting White House communications
director Ann Lewis as saying, "I don't think what Ken Starr is
looking for is assistance. What he's trying to find are more
reasons to explain why he really can't prove a case."

<HEADLINE> Laxities in Army Lead to Rebel Head's Escape: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Monday blamed the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) for their
internal laxities which led to the narrow escape of Joseph Kony, the
head of the rebels of Lord Resistance Army.
</P>
<P>
He made public this blame in a 18-page speech delivered to
parliament in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
He said some weaknesses on some levels of command, especially
at the middle level, are at least partly responsible for the
recent narrow escape of Kony when he was trapped by the army.
</P>
<P>
He promised to press the commanders to resolve all their
internal laxities and end this problem.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the rebels suffered heavy losses in their
encounters with the army. The first group of rebels headed by
Vincent Otti lost 32 members in their first encounter with the
UPDF soldiers and the second group spearheaded by Kony himself
lost 30 members in four consecutive encounters.
</P>
<P>
Since the rebel groups entered Uganda from their Sudan base a
few weeks ago, some 150 of them have been killed and about 100
have surrendered with guns.
</P>
<P>
The Kony rebels, estimated at 800, entered Uganda in May for
food and medicines. They used landmines to loot vehicles on roads
in Kitgum and Gulu Districts instead of abducting civilians as
they had done before.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Worried about the increasing
disorder at the medical market in Lagos, the economic and
business center of Nigeria, the state government has launched a
sanitization exercise.
</P>
<P>
The government said Monday it will continue to close down
illegal patent medicine stores, destroy fake drugs and prosecute
offenders until the state is free from their activities.
</P>
<P>
The state health ministry will not condone or compromise on
the matter, said Michael Ogungbesan, the Commissioner of Health,
quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"The task force (on health) gives periodic reports on the
situation and new methods of combating the menace," said the
commissioner, who appealed to the public to furnish them with
information on the presence of fake drugs to help the crack-down
exercise.
</P>
<P>
He also urged citizens of the state to report illegal
hospitals and quack medical practitioners to the appropriate
authorities for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"We may not be able to locate such hospitals. It is the public
that patronizes them so they should let us be aware," the
commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to reports of increasing tuberculosis cases in the
state, the commissioner said it is untrue that the disease "has
reached an epidemic level".
</P>
<P>
The health ministry and its agencies are doing everything
possible for control the spread of the disease and "so far, we
are succeeding," he added.
</P>
<P>
The official daily New Nigerian reported about a week
ago an upsurge in the number of TB cases in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a hospital source, it said the development was
indicative of the fact that the infection is on rampage.

WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
rethinking of a trip to India and Pakistan after the two South
Asian countries detonated nuclear explosions last month, the White
House said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry, asked about Clinton's
scheduled visit to India and Pakistan, said the president was
assessing the situation to determine whether he will go ahead

Clinton, who visits Texas on Tuesday, canceled plans to

</P>
<P>
Albright then will depart for Geneva for talks with other
foreign ministers about the developments in South Asia.

<P>
"The situation with respect to India and Pakistan is a

State Department spokesman James Rubin said that officials from
the G-7 nations are meeting over how to provide aid to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"There is an active dialogue now ongoing between U.S.
officials, officials from other G-7 countries, international
financial institutions to look at further reforms that will be
necessary, what financial needs there are in light of the current

U.S. President Bill Clinton said Sunday that the U.S. will

<P>
In a brief statement, Clinton expressed U.S. support for aid to
Russia from such multinational institutions as the World Bank and

</P>
<P>
"The United States endorses additional, conditional financial
support from the international financial institutions, as
necessary, to promote stability, structural reforms and growth in

<P>
He said he based his decision on his conversations with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and consultations among other U.S. and
Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
But the Clinton administration has offered few specifics about
the emergency aid and has said bilateral support from Washington
was unlikely.

"As President Clinton made clear, the action would be through
the multilateral system," Rubin said.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye officially launched parole national and
regional boards Monday here with a call to the public
to supplement government efforts to fight crimes.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said under the newly introduced system, prisoners who
have shown signs to repent will be set free under the tight
scrutiny by the society where they will be pardoned if they
behave like good citizens.
</P>
<P>
"Under the parole program, citizens have a vital role to play
especially in monitoring the prisoners that have been set free,
and offering needed assistance to the prisoners which will enable
them to fit in the society," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the parole system is adopted by the
government in an effort to reduce crimes in the society by
involving the citizens and easing congestions in prisons.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the representatives of prisons nationwide and
members from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and religious
leaders, the premier said it will be important if the board will
operate in fairly and transparently.
</P>
<P>
Onel Malisa, Commissioner of Prisons, said establishment of
the parole system is in line with the Parole Board Act passed by
the parliament in 1994. The board members are appointed by
President Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
"Under the parole system, the prisoners set free will be given
a grace period. If they do not change or show signs to change
their behaviors, they will be brought back to serve their
imprisonment terms," Malisa said.

The appeal came following the talks which took place here
Monday between Greek Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos and his
Italian counterpart, Walter Veltroni, who is in Athens to
participate in a public discussion on "Culture and Social Cohesion

</P>
<P>
Venizelos stressed that Europe was not only a currency, but a
continent with a strong cultural presence able to create an
industry to rival that of America's.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Veltroni said that a European version of the
Oscar awards agreed to recently by the 15 European Union (EU)
culture ministers would be broadcast across Europe, signifying the
excellent cooperation between cinema and television.
</P>
<P>
He added that today, as movie-goers increase in line with movie
halls, they had an opportunity to strengthen European cinema.

LUANDA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The new headquarters of the former
rebel force, the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) started operation in Luanda Monday.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Dembo, Vice-Chairman of UNITA said at the opening
ceremony of the headquarters that operation of the UNITA's new
office in the capital indicates UNITA's willingness to continue
its efforts for the peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
Dembo urged all Angolans to join hands in their struggle for a
real national unity and reconciliation, so as to win the total
independence, liberty and the enhancement of people's welfare.
</P>
<P>
Blondin Beye, United Nation's special envoy to Angola, said at
the ceremony that the operation of the new UNITA headquarters is
a historic event, indicating that UNITA has said bye to the past
and is determined to co-operate with the government.
</P>
<P>
After recalling all the major steps in the peace process, he
said that war is not the best way to solve problems, and the
correct way is to lay down their arms and get onto the way of
peace.
</P>
<P>
He urged UNITA to continue its effort for the final peace of
Angola, and make contribution the stability and development of
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Despite the opening of the headquarters, UNITA leaders,
including Chairman Jonas Savimbi have not moved to Luanda yet,
and the former UNITA headquarters of Bailundo and Andulo are
still under UNITA's control.
</P>
<P>
The moving of the UNITA headquarters to capital Luanda is one
of the major tasks laid out in the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Court Rejects Cases Against Abacha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Federal Court of Appeal in
Lagos Monday rejected two cases against the adoption of the Head
of State, General Sani Abacha by the country's five political
parties as their consensus candidate for the general election.
</P>
<P>
The court said it does not have the jurisdiction over the
cases filed by Alhaji Mohammed Yusuf, former national police
head, and Tunji Braithwaite, a Lagos-based lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Both Yusuf and Braithwaite had sought to run the presidential
elections scheduled for August 1 on the platform of the
Grassroots Democratic Movement, but the party, like the four
others, decided in April to have Abacha as their flag bearer.
</P>
<P>
Braithwaite said he will appeal to the supreme court.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Federal High Court in Lagos threw out a similar
case filed by the lawyer Gani Fawehinmi on the same ground: lack
of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, General Abacha is expected to arrive in Lagos for a
one-day working visit Tuesday. It is said to be his second visit
since 1994 to the former national capital, where his alleged
presidential ambition receives the strongest opposition.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed media reports said Abacha may finally speak out on
his presidential candidacy when he comes to Lagos Tuesday. He has
been silent on the issue all the time.

<HEADLINE> Russia Cuts Rosneft Auction Starting Price by Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government decided
Monday to auction 75 percent of shares in the Rosneft oil company
at a starting price of 9,862 million rubles (1,644 million
dollars), almost half the original starting price of May.
</P>
<P>
The move, ordered by Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, follows a
failed tender on May 26 when nobody bade. The total starting price
then, including investment obligations, was 2.5 billion dollars,
Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The failed auction of Rosneft was seen by some as a factor that
contributed to Russia's financial crisis late last month.
</P>
<P>
The Kiriyenko government has since then indicated that it would
lower the starting price to "take into consideration the true
situation on the market and the fall in world oil prices."
</P>
<P>
A number of Russian and foreign companies have expressed
interest in acquiring a 75 percent plus one share stake in
Rosneft, the last Russian oil giant still in state hands.
</P>
<P>
They include the alliance of Gazprom, Lukoil and Royal
Dutch/Shell, the Unexim-British Petroleum group and the
Yukos-Sibneft together with their financial groups.

<HEADLINE> India's IT Market Could Be Hurt by U.S. Sanctions: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 1 (Xinhua) -- India's information technology
(IT) market could be significantly impaired by U.S. economic
sanctions following the Asian country's recent nuclear test,
according to International Data Corp., a U.S. market research
firm.
</P>
<P>
While full details on the breadth of these sanctions have yet
to be announced, IDC said, there is the potential for strong
impact on the Indian IT market, as well as for U.S. IT vendors
with operations in or exports to India.
</P>
<P>
The United States, India's largest trading partner, was joined
by Japan, Germany and Australia in announcing tough economic
measures.
</P>
<P>
"How it will affect India's IT market is heavily tied into the
duration of the sanctions and the definite possibility that they
could extend to high-technology materials," said Lisa Cosmas, an
IDC Asia/pacific analyst.
</P>
<P>
In that instance, Cosmas said, not only will the Indian economy
suffer, but its IT market will experience a considerable slowdown
in growth. "U.S. IT vendors that have been increasing their
investments in this market will also feel the repercussions of
these sanctions," she said.
</P>
<P>
India represents the second-fastest growing IT market in the
Asia-Pacific. Prior to the imposition of economic sanctions, IDC
Asia/Pacific had predicted that from 1997 to 2002, India would
experience a compound annual rate of 15.6 percent, and domestic IT
spending would reach 5 billion U.S. dollars by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, IDC said, computer software and services exports
contributed 1.14 billion dollars to India's IT industry in the
financial year 1996-1997.
</P>
<P>
Today, approximately 60 percent of software services sourced
from India are by U.S. companies. Digital, Dun and Bradstreet,
General Electric, IBM and Oracle represent just a few companies
that have significant software facilities located in India.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Meets Jordanian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President (PNA) Yasser Arafat met with Jordanian Minister of
Justice Riyad Shakaa Tuesday in Gaza on the latest situations in
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of Palestine radio reported that Arafat discussed
with Shakaa the possibility of holding an Arab summit to
coordinate Arab stance on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
They also touched on ways of promoting the bilateral relations,
the radio said, without elaborating on details.
</P>
<P>
Shakaa was in Gaza for a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PNA Minister of Planning and International
Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath told the radio that "we want our Arab
summit to back us during our important battle with Israel and the
Arab nations should exert more efforts for convening such a
summit."
</P>
<P>
"Through the summit, we will tell our Arab nations, Israel and
the United States our patience will no longer continue before the
Israeli arrogance and attempts to destroy the peace process,"
Sha'ath said.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis have been
stalled since March 1997 when Israel started work on a Jewish
settlement in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the
capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has called for an emergency Arab summit to work out a
unified Arab stance to confront Israeli intransigence and hardline
policy on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Intensive consultations have been made among Arab countries,
most of which have reportedly agreed to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, has accused the PNA of violating the Oslo
Accords signed between the two sides by seeking to convene the
summit.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to resolve the differences between Israel and
the PNA is through direct talks, as prescribed in the Oslo
Accords," advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
David Bar-Illan told the Israel Radio on Monday.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's First Prime Minister
Ung Huot returned home Tuesday from his two-day official visit to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot and his party were welcomed by high-ranking government
officials and envoys of some foreign countries including Chinese
Ambassador to Cambodia Yan Tingai, at the airport.
</P>
<P>
On arrival, Ung Huot told reporters that his trip was

</P>
<P>
Ung Huot said his talks with Vietnamese Premier Phan Van Khai
had achieved common views on the border issues between Cambodia

</P>
<P>
Referring to Vietnamese immigrants to Cambodia, Ung Huot, also
minister for foreign affairs and iternational cooperation, said
the issue would be settled according to Cambodia's immigration law
and nationality law.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the overlapping maritime areas between the two
countries, Ung Huot said the Vietnamese government had agreed to
hold two-party talks between them, or tripartite talks among
Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam, to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Ung Huot held talks with leaders of the
Vietnamese government and exchanged views on issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China's Stamp Market Mired in Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- In sharp contrast to the brisk
salesroom atmosphere in Guardian's autumn stamp auction in 1997,
its spring sale last month was cold and cheerless.
</P>
<P>
With almost the same amount and quality of stamps sold,
Guardian, one of China's largest oldest art auction companies,
this spring earned only two-thirds of the transaction value of
last autumn's sales.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing's stamp market, nearly all the more than 10 stamp
versions issued this year are sold now at prices lower than their
face values, except for that for the Year of the Tiger (1998) and
that for the centennial of Peking University (now called Beijing
University).
</P>
<P>
China's first gold foil stamp sheet, issued last year to
celebrate the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, was also
left out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
The sheet, sold for 120 yuan, which was a lot more than its
face value of 50 yuan, was pushed as high as some 400 yuan in
the market last year but now can be obtained for a mere 80
yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The sluggish market now is an inevitable result of the
over-heated market last year," said an official from the Chinese
Philately Federation, who refused to give his name.
</P>
<P>
He said that many stamp collectors have been trapped by the
gold foil stamp sheet, while some big dealers, who have made
profits from the sheet, have shifted their capital to other
investment areas, such as the stock market and real estate.
</P>
<P>
More people seem to attribute the sluggish market to a rise of
the stamps' face value and enlarged circulation. The circulation
of the gold foil sheet, for example, has reached 20 million and
drawn more than two billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Cai Jiaming, a local stamp collector, said that he hopes that
the World Stamp Exhibition to be held in Beijing in autumn 1999
will stimulate the market, which is not expected to pick up in the
near future.

PARIS, June 2 (Xinhua)-- Eighth-seeded Venus Williams's road to

</P>
<P>
But Williams' compatriot, No. 2 seed Lindsay Davenport, moved
into the last four with a 6-1, 5-7, 6-3 victory over defending
champion Iva Majoli.
</P>
<P>
Hingis raced to a 3-0 lead with her deft touch and clever court
sense but Williams broke her in the fifth game for 3-2 as Hingis
twice double-faulted. Hingis then broke right back for 4-2 and
held on to win the set.
</P>
<P>
Williams had a chance to break Hingis for 2-0 in the second set
racking up three break points before Hingis won five straight
points to take the game.
</P>
<P>
In the crucial game of the set, Hingis broke Williams for 4-3
again on two double faults, this time by Williams.
</P>
<P>
Hingis has a masterful touch, moving opponents around the court
with precise groundstrokes while Williams count on purely power.

<HEADLINE> Pak Cabinet Discusses Measures for Austerity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The federal cabinet of Pakistan
met here Tuesday to discuss various measures for austerity,
economic self-reliance and increasing productivity and national
income in various sectors.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was
informed that Pakistan had achieved the wheat target this year
with a production of 19 million tons, according to a press release
by the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
The wheat production is 16 percent more than that of last year
and the target for next year is likely to be fixed at 22.3 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts are being made to increase the production of
palm oil and seed oil within the country to decrease reliance on
imported oil.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet held that the high rates of growth shown in the
agricultural sector should be further enhanced and maximum
facilities and incentives should be provided to farmers to enable
them to play a due role in the national construction.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided in principle to enhance agricultural
credits as well as to introduce modern technologies and farm
mechanization in this regard.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the cabinet agreed that efforts should be
made to improve performance of the industrial sector. The main
focus of these efforts would be on small and medium enterprises
which could play a very significant role in promoting the
country's exports.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also discussed policy framework for introducing
austerity, economy and efficiency in government sector as well as
in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
It also approved specific measures with respect to austerity
and efficiency in Pakistan's diplomatic mission abroad.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting also approved reduction in public holidays
from 20 to 11 a year.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Want Rodman to Beat Malone in Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman can seize a chance
to steal spotlight in the NBA Finals if he gets smart.
</P>
<P>
His matchup against the Utah Jazz tough-man Karl Malone will go
a long way toward determining the outcome of the best-of-seven
series starting this evening at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
But he has to do something otherwise than what he had done
during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Rodman was a non-factor in last season's finals, as he averaged
a pale 2.3 points and 7.7 rebounds in only 27 minutes an outing.
</P>
<P>
He was in constant foul troubles, and he lost his temper and
let his frustration get him frequently duriong the game. The Bulls
didn't really need him last year because they had Brian Williams.
</P>
<P>
Rodman proved his record against the Indiana Pacers in the
Eastern Conference finals, averaging 4.7 points and 9.9 rebounds
after averaging 6.1 points and 16.1 rebounds through the playoff's
first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls know they can't win their sixth NBA championship if
Rodman doesn't have a turnaround against the Jazz. He could very
likely get his starting job back because he has to be the primary
defender on Malone.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not concerned about Dennis," coach Phil Jackson said.
"Dennis comes to play. He is struggling with coming off the bench
and accepting what his role was last series. He will have a
different role in the games coming up. It is going to be his turn
to shine."
</P>
<P>
Malone, who averaged 23.8 points and 10.3 rebounds in last
season's NBA Finals against the Bulls, is a difficult matchup for
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
Rodman can't get into Malone's head and take him out of his
game, and he can't muscle him around. All Rodman can do is make
him work hard and play him tough in the low post so the Bulls
don't have to double-team him all of the time.
</P>
<P>
"Dennis' value in this series is going to be measured in his
energy," Michael Jordan said."He didn't have the greatest series
against Utah last year and we still won. But I think his energy
will be needed this year. I don't anticipate any problems from
Dennis. He knows what he has to do."
</P>
<P>
What Jordan said is right. Rodman knows where his position is
and is ready to do big to prove his image.

The report concludes that although Switzerland was Nazi
Germany's banker, other neutral nations, Sweden, Portugal, Spain,
Turkey and Argentina, provided materials to keep the war going.
</P>
<P>
"The cumulative trade of the World War II European neutral
countries helped to sustain the Nazi war effort by supplying key
materials to Germany essential to their conduct of the war," said
Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat at a press conference
here on the report.
</P>
<P>
The report doubles the former estimate of how much gold was in
a Nazi account in Switzerland that received deposits of wedding
rings, teeth fillings and other valuables of the victims.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.N. Sanctions Damage Libyan Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Libya has incurred losses of up to
23.56 billion U.S. dollars in all economic tracks since the United
Nations Security Council imposed sanctions in March 1992.
</P>
<P>
The economic and trade sectors alone have lost up to 5.856
billion dollars, according to a bi-annual report prepared by the
Arab Economic Unity Council (AEUC) of the Cairo-based Arab
League.
</P>
<P>
Harm done to the spheres of agriculture, industry, maritime
wealth and financial dealings, the drop in the export-import activity
and the freeze of Libyan funds abroad have attributed to the losses
in the economic and trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
Also at jeopardy were the energy, industry, mining and health
sectors, said the AEUC report.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been living under an air, arms and diplomatic embargo
after Tripoli had failed to hand over for trial two Libyan
suspects, charged with involvement in the 1988 bombing of a Pan-Am
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. The explosion killed some 270
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The report will be presented by the council's Secretary
General, Hassan Ibrahim, to its 67th ministerial session which
will be held here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will precede a visit to Egypt by Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi, who has postponed his trip to Cairo from the
first week of June to later this month.

<HEADLINE> China to Amend Law on Rural Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China is to amend the Law on the
Organization of Villagers' Committees, the introduction of which
ten years ago brought full democracy to over 900 million Chinese
farmers for the first time in history, a Ministry of Civil Affairs
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The law, which was adopted by the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, in
November 1987, abolished the age-old practice in China's vast
countryside that officials were hand-picked by governments at
higher levels.
</P>
<P>
It requires all members of the Villagers' Committee, the formal
village leadership, to be directly elected by the entire village,
and grants the farmers the right of self-government.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Mingliang, director of the Grassroots Power Building
Department under the Civil Affairs Ministry, said that, thanks to
the law, farmers in more than 60 percent of China's nearly one
million villages are now practising self-government, which means
that they not only elect their own village leadership, but also
monitor its operation and have a say in all major village affairs.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over the past decade most villagers'
committees across the country have held three direct elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang noted, since the law was formulated in the early
years of China's building of its legal system, it is far from
perfect and has many weak points.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the principle of "Four Democracies,"
which has been proved by experience over the past decade to be the
core of villagers' self-government, is not written into the
existing law.
</P>
<P>
Besides the democratic election (of the villagers' committee),
the other three democracies are democratic decision-making
(in village management), democratic management (of village
affairs) and democratic supervision (by the villagers over the
village leadership).
</P>
<P>
Though it has defined the basic principles for the direct
elections of villagers' committees, the existing law has failed to
provide for any concrete electoral methods and procedures, Zhang
added.
</P>
<P>
The existing law also overlooks possible problems that could
hamper the democratic nature of the elections, such as bribery,
fraud, disruption of the electoral order or influence from
officials at higher levels, and makes no relevant stipulations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The amendment is expected to add good experience from all over
the country for promoting rural democracy to the existing law, and
make the law more powerful and applicable," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The amendment has been listed in the NPC Standing Committee's
legislation plan for this year, he added.

<HEADLINE> Bilateral Agreement to Punish World Cup Thugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (xinhua) -- English hooligans guilty of
soccer-related offences at the World Cup in France will be
punished by further court actions back home under a new bilateral
agreement, British Home Secretary Jack Straw said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Straw said thugs who offend in France could now be charged in
England or Wales in addition to any other punishment they might
receive from the French judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Straw, addressing the headquarters of the football unit of the
National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), also announced a
continuing increase in the use of restriction orders, which bar
convicted hooligans from travelling to matches abroad.
</P>
<P>
Introduced under the Football Spectators Act 1989, these
restriction orders require their subject to report to a police
station in England or Wales during matches. Failure to do so can
face up to six-month imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Straw said the bilateral agreement with France came into force
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official also called for fans who had information about
planned hooligan activity to dial the Hooligan Hotline, based at
the NCIS and relaunched for the World Cup by Straw in February.

<HEADLINE> Bird Says His Return up to Pacers Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Larry Bird, coach of the Indiana
Pacers, is considering to quit his position after the team failed
to enter the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
Bird, in his first season coaching at any level, guided and
inspired his players brilliantly this season in pushing the
Chicago Bulls to the limit before losing 88-83 in Game 7 of the
Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
All of the team's ace players except center Rik Smits and point
guard Travis Best, who will be free agents this summer, are under
contract for at least the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers are deep and experienced. They could be ready to
replace the Bulls as the top team in the Eastern Conference unless
Bird leave the team.
</P>
<P>
Bird signed a five-year contract in May 1997, however, he has
not committed to next season after winning the title of the NBA
Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
"I'll talk to my players and see if they like what we're trying
to do," Bird says. "They can come to me and say they want somebody
else to lead them. I can move on. It's been an enjoyable
year. I'll talk with some of the players in the next couple of
days and get their feelings. Whether I'm back or not, I don't
know."
</P>
<P>
Six Pacers -- Reggie Miller, Smits, Mark Jackson, Derrick
McKey, Antonio Davis and Dale Davis -- were on the teams that lost
in seven games in the Eastern Conference finals to New York in
1994 and Orlando in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Pacers President Donnie Walsh has said he expects Bird to
return because "he is a man who fulfills his commitments."
</P>
<P>
Bird promised many times during the regular season that he
wanted to take the Pacers where they never have been. The team has
not reached the NBA Finals since joining the league for the
1976-77 season.
</P>
<P>
Bird did pretty well in coaching the team which set a record of
58 victories in the regular season, the second-best record in the
Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
It's all about winning the championship," Bird said." I didn't
get them where I wanted to take them."
</P>
<P>
But it is a clear fact that Bird can do much better next season
as the coach if he remains.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman on South Asia Post-Nuclear Test Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China is watching closely the
post-nuclear test situation in South Asia, said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao at a routine press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
China feels extremely anxious and upset about the nuclear arms
race in the region, Zhu said. China hopes that the countries
concerned will restrain themselves to the maximum extent and give
up their nuclear weapon development plans, so as to avoid further
deterioration of the situation in South Asia and benefit the
overall peace, security and stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
China hopes not to see any arms race in its close neighborhood,
including South Asia, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear tests and the resultant nuclear arms race that have
recently sprung up in India and Pakistan are not in accordance
with the historical trend, and greatly affect peace and security
in South Asia and even the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The current nuclear arms race in South Asia was triggered off by
India single-handed because Pakistan's nuclear tests were
conducted as a reponse to the Indian threat, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China strongly condemned India for its nuclear testing, and
meanwhile regretted deeply that Pakistan also carried out nuclear
tests, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the countries concerned to join unconditionally the
treaties on comprehensively prohibiting nuclear tests and nuclear
proliferation, and not to take any steps that may further endanger
the situation in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
China has a clear and consistent attitude toward the issue of
nuclear weapons, Zhu said. Ever since its acquisition of nuclear
weapons, the Chinese government has insisted that nuclear weapons
be completely banned and thoroughly destroyed, and opposed nuclear
weapons' proliferation in all forms.
</P>
<P>
China itself vows not to use or threat to use nuclear weapons
against countries or regions which do not have their own nuclear
weapons, Zhu said, emphasizing that this stance has never changed.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), Zhu
said that China is studying this international treaty, although
China did not participate in the drafting and revising of the MTCR.
</P>
<P>
"China has promised to observe some criteria and indices of the
MTCR, and will never go back on its words," said Zhu. "We hold a
clear-cut position on this issue," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the transfer of missile technology, Zhu said that
China has always opposed the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and their carriers, and therefore handles cautiously
and controls in a responsible manner export of missiles.
</P>
<P>
"The so-called proliferation of Chinese missiles and related
technology is out of the question," Zhu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Digital Equipment Corporation
(DEC) of the US set up the largest systems integration joint
venture in China here today.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Founder Di Cheng Information Technology Corporation
Ltd. is an equally held joint venture between DEC and Beijing
Founder Electronics Corporation Ltd., the top local systems
integrator in China.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture puts together the market strengths of the two

dollars). Founder alone occupies over 50 percent of China's
systems integration market for governmental institutions.
</P>
<P>
DEC sources said that the joint venture is to employ 1,000
people and hopes to achieve annual sales of 70 million US dollars
in two years.
</P>
<P>
At a signing ceremony for the joint venture agreement in the
Great Hall of the People here this afternoon, John Rando, senior
vice-president of DEC's Services Division, said that the joint
venture is definitely beneficial to both sides.
</P>
<P>
"The joint venture is a logical business step in DEC's
commitment to driving a world-class systems integration
organization that is able to respond to the needs of the global
market place," Rando said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhaodong, president of Founder, said that the joint
venture is a strategic step that the company took to become one of
the top 500 companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that Founder will take advantage of DEC's management
experience and expertise in network services and systems
integration so as to increase its competitiveness in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
"The joint venture will provide excellent services and
complete solutions to government, telecommunications,
bank, financial and manufacturing markets," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Iran for Early End to Afghan Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Iran on Tuesday
stressed the need for an early end to the long-running Afghan
conflict and agreed to intensify their efforts for the promotion
of the intra-Afghan dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The message was contained in a press release issued here by the
Foreign Ministry after a meeting between Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan and his visiting Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian delegation led by Kharrazi arrived here Monday for
a two-day visit, the first by a high-level foreign delegation
after Pakistan's detonation of six nuclear devices on May 28 and
30.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Gohar, Kharrazi also met with Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Siddique Khan Kanju Tuesday. During the meetings,
discussions were held on a wide range of issues including
bilateral relations and the Afghan situation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries underscored their determination "to further
develop close, mutually-beneficial ties in all fields of common
interest," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Afghan issue figured prominently in the talks.
The two sides agreed to intensify their efforts for the promotion
of the intra-Afghan dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The situation in South Asia in the aftermath of Indian nuclear
tests was also discussed.
</P>
<P>
It was emphasized that in view of the "grave threat" posed to
Pakistan's security as well as the Indian leadership's threat to
impose a military solution on Kashmir, Pakistan had no choice but
to take "appropriate measures" for the restoration of the
strategic balance in the region and "deterrence of nuclear and
conventional aggression."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif met with the Iranian delegation
earlier Tuesday and stressed that Pakistan was left with no option
but to take appropriate steps to offset the grave threat posed to
its security by India's nuclear tests and its "belligerent
attitude" on the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister affirmed his country's commitment
to a close Iran-Pakistan relationship as well as its readiness to
work with Pakistan for an early end to the Afghan conflict.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Warns of Damage to Turkish-French Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Tuesday warned of a damage to
the friendly Turkish-French ties if France could not handle the
alleged Armenian genocide motion in a cautious manner.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is closely following the issue because it is related to
Ankara's stance toward France, Turkish Foreign Ministry
spokesman Necati Utkan told a daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the French National Assembly unanimously adopted a
motion stating that "France publicly recognizes the Armenian
genocide of 1915." The motion now goes before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has denied that the deaths of some 1.5 million Armenians
in Ottoman Turkey between 1915 and 1923 constituted genocide,
insisting that massacres occurred on both sides as the result of a
civil war.
</P>
<P>
"France is not an enemy of Turkey. If such a motion is
adopted, then the interests of both countries will be severely
harmed," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all allegations regarding the so-called
Armenian genocide by Turks in 1915 were "unfounded" and France
should deal with this matter in a responsible way.
</P>
<P>
With regard to this issue, Turkey has said that thousands of
Armenians and Turks were killed in fighting between the two sides
in what is now eastern Turkey and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to stacks of history books and archives on the
rostrum, Utkan said that making a study of these historical
materials would prove that the alleged Armenian genocide is an
out-and-out lie.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Parliament has decided to lodge a strong protest
against the French legislature over the controversial motion put
forward by Socialist deputies.

WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton dropped the claims of executive privilege
he had invoked in the Lewinsky investigation, moving to reduce the
prospect of a quick Supreme Court review in the highly charged
constitutional clash between the White House and the independent
counsel. But the President continued to press claims of a
lawyer-client privilege to limit the question of Bruce R. Lindsey,
one of his closest confidants.
</P>
<P>
-- After three months of fruitless negotiations, Philadelphia's
largest transit union went on strike, shutting down a network of
buses, trolleys and subways that serves as many as 435,000 people
everyday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Mexican drug cartels, long regarded as peddlers of cheap,
low-grade heroin that accounted for only a tiny portion of the

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Pollution Control along Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The government stressed the
importance of pollution control along the Yangtze River today,
asking local governments, enterprises and residents to protect the
country's longest river.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) and
the Ministry of Communications (MC) will launch a one-month
large-scale program along the river to improve local people's
environmental awareness, beginning today.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA and the MC will also jointly inspect the
pollution-control efforts of the local governments, especially
along the Chongqing-Yichang and Wuhan-Shanghai sections of the river.
</P>
<P>
The two ministry-level departments asked local departments to
give wide publicity to the importance of pollution control along
the river in a notice.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA and the MC jointly issued a regulation at the
end of last year, asking provinces and cities along the Yangtze to
get rid of solid waste on the river banks and to strictly control
garbage dumping in the area.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA and the MC will inspect the local governments'
implementation of the regulation this month.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of the economy and shipping, the
number of ships has increased substantially on the Yangtze, at the
same time increasing the amount of garbage dumped in China's
longest river.

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- From 75 percent to 90 percent of the flights of Air France
are expected to be cancelled on Tuesday, the second consecutive
day of a strike by the pilots which reflects the anachronism of
the social and economic structure of the air company. The unions
of pilots and the management of Air France will resume talks

double standard of pays for the young and old pilots, and a deal
on salary reduction in exchange for the stocks of the company.

</P>
<P>
-- After seeing on Monday all his planes grounded, the
president and general director of Air France Jean-Cyril Spinetta
finally proposed Monday evening to have a meeting with the
striking pilots. He intentionally waited until the long weekend of
Pentecost to make his first step and the traffic of Air France is

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- After a black day for the passengers of Air France on

<HEADLINE> Inspection of Boeing-737s Finds No Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- No problem was found when China
conducted a special safety inspection on 18 Boeing-737 airliners
with a total flight time of over 20,000 hours, according to an
official from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).
</P>
<P>
This was in response to an order by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) of the U.S., issued on May 10, to launch
an urgent inspection of all Boeing-737 airliners that have flown more
than 40,000 hours, said Zhang Yongsheng, deputy director of the Air
Worthiness Department of the CAAC, in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Before this, an FAA official found two small holes caused by a
short circuit in wiring "sleeves" near an oil tank on the wings of
a Boeing-737 belonging to U.S. carrier Continental Airlines. The
event aroused great concern in the civil aviation sector.
</P>
<P>
China now has 141 Boeing-737 airliners, accounting for
nearly one third of the national air fleet. The oldest, however,
has so far flown only 32,000 hours, so China-run Boeing-737
airliners do not fall within the range of inspection required by
the FAA, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
But China has still inspected some airliners with a flight time
of more than 20,000 hours as of May 15, focusing on their tank
parts, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
This is a high-degree consideration for air travelers. Safety
is the top priority of civil aviation, he added.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the sound safety situation of China's civil
aviation to a set of strict and scientific management rules that
have reached world standards.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Raise Minimum Living Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital will raise the
minimum living standard of its urban residents per person from
190 yuan to 200 yuan starting next month, the municipal government
announced today.
</P>
<P>
This means that Beijing's urban families with a per-capita
monthly income of less than 200 yuan will be subsidized by the
municipal or district finances.
</P>
<P>
Beijing first implemented the minimum living standard system on
July 1 1996, when the standard was set at 170 yuan per person per
month. The minimum living standard was lifted to 190 yuan on June
1 of last year.
</P>
<P>
Some 11,000 Beijing families have benefited from the welfare
system, with the authorities extending more than two million yuan
in subsidies each month, according to an official at the Municipal
Civil Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Beijing began issuing grain and edible oil relief
cards to low-income residents on December 1, 1996. Card holders
have since then been receiving 20 yuan-worth of grain or edible
oil each month. Currently, more than 22,000 residents hold such
cards.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the grain and edible oil relief cards
will be maintained after the latest readjustment in the minimum
living standard.
</P>
<P>
An official survey indicates that beneficiaries of the welfare
system and the card program are mainly jobless people, laid-off
workers and workers in inefficient enterprises.

BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A veteran smoker in China may get
10,000 U.S. dollars if he wins an international contest for
smokers who quit the habit.
</P>

Lin Yafu, a 43-year-old resident of Liuzhou City, in southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, won a lottery to qualify
for the 1998 International Quit and Win Contest during a world

</P>
<P>
Lin, a chain smoker for 25 years, has kept away from cigarettes
for the past month, as the contest rules stipulate.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time for China, with the world's biggest
population of smokers, to take part into the international
contest. It was initiated by the Finnish Center for Health
Promotion, aiming to encourage more smokers to quit the habit.
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 smokers in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai
participated in the contest in 1996. A Tianjin participant became
the final winner of 5,000 U.S. dollars.

PARIS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Arantxa Sanchez Vicario swept into
the last four at the French Open on Tuesday after she scored a
6-2, 6-7 (5/7), 6-0 victory over Patty Schnyder of Switzerland in
just under two hours.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-seeded Spaniard, the champion in 1989 and 1994 and
three-times beaten finalist, will play either defending champion
Iva Majoli of Croatia or second seed Lindsay Davenport of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario had to present all the battling qualities for
which she is renowned by saving five set points in the second set
after Schnyder had staged a recovery from a nervous and
error-strewn opening set.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Fed Cup teammate of world No.1 Martina Hingis held a
6-1 lead in the tiebreak but almost let her opponent off the hook
before putting away a winner which skidded away from the
Spaniard's forehand.
</P>
<P>
Having spent almost three hours seeing off Serena Williams in
the previous round, Sanchez Vicario clearly didn't want another
marathon and she took the deciding set without dropping a game.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China aims to increase its trade
volume with Saudi Arabia to five billion U.S. dollars-worth within
five years, stated Shi Guangsheng, minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while holding talks with Osama Faqih,
commerce minister of Saudi Arabia, today.
</P>
<P>
Briefly reviewing the bilateral commercial ties, Shi said
that they lagged far behind the development of their economies.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the economies of the two nations are highly
complementary.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to make use of Saudi Arabia's oil resources, while
Chinese consumer goods are very popular in the Saudi market, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hoped efforts by both sides would bring the
bilateral trade relations to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
Shi welcomed Faqih's suggestion that the two sides should start
cooperation in the petrochemicals industry and technology
exchanges, and that Chinese enterprises should take part in mining
projects and power grid construction in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed China's undertaking of projects, export of
labor services and investment in Saudi Arabia, and extended mutual
support on the issue of World Trade Organization entry.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, whose trade volume with China reached 1.68
billion U.S. dollars-worth last year, was China's largest trade
partner in the Western Asia and Africa region.
</P>
<P>
Present at the talks were Saudi entrepreneurs accompanying
Faqih on his China visit, and representatives from Chinese trade
companies in the fields of petrochemicals, textiles and grain.
</P>
<P>
The guests will visit Shanghai and Shenzhen later.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM to Visit Iran to Improve Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
is to visit Iran within this month, Renewing the role of Rome as
the pioneer among European countries to better ties with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Though the date for Prodi's visit has not yet been finally set,
the daily Abrar reported Tuesday that his two-day trip might start
on June 18.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Prodi's coming visit marks a turning point in
Rome-Tehran ties as well as the relations between Iran and the EU
following the Rushdie issue in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Iran-EU ties have been strained since 1989 after Iranian
supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini issued a religious decree
to sentence British writer Salman Rushdie to death for his
controversial novel "The Satanic Verses."
</P>
<P>
Prodi will be the highest-ranking official from the EU member
states to visit Iran since then.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet Iranian President Mohammad Khatami,
Parliament Speaker Nateq Nouri and Chairman of the State
Expediency Council Hashemi Rafsanjani, the Abrar said.
</P>
<P>
During Prodi's visit, the two countries will sign a number of
agreements to boost bilateral trade and encourage investments in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
In March, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini kicked off the
exchange of visits at ministerial level between the EU and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Dini's visit came shortly after the EU lifted ban on
ministerial visits to Tehran imposed on Iran in April last year
after the Berlin court accused Iranian leaders of sponsoring
terrorist assassinations.
</P>
<P>
Recently, industrialists, investors and businessmen from EU
member countries have rushed to Tehran to find opportunities of
economic cooperation with the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
"Italy is a pioneer member of the EU and will do its best to
make Iran's relations with Europe better and better," Italian
Ambassador to Iran Lodovico Ortonag said last month.

PARIS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Thomas Muster, plagued with
a back injury, crashed out of the French Open here on Tuesday
against 15th-seeded Spaniard Felix Mantilla.
</P>
<P>
Muster, a winner three years ago, surrendered the game after
two hours and 27 minutes 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 to the 23-year-old
Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
Muster, the 30-year-old Austrian who was unseeded for the first
time here since 1992, was clearly in trouble right from the start
as his usually lethal groundstrokes lacked depth and penetration.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Mantilla will play either 12th-seeded compatriot
Carlos Moya or tournament favourite and third-seed Marcelo Rios
for a place in Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for Mantilla to beat Muster after two
previous losses. Their last encounter in Rome three weeks ago was
a stormy affair as both players refused to shake hands after
Muster won in three sets.

<HEADLINE> ``Search For Dark Matter May Raise Space Knowledge to New Level'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- He Zuoxiu, a 72-year-old
academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was very excited
to learn that the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer will be launched
tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
For 20 years he has been involved in research into dark matter
in space, and the launching of the spectrometer will provide a
golden opportunity to find out whether or not dark matter exists.
</P>
<P>
Besides common matter that gives out or reflects light,
scientists believe that another kind of matter that does not give
out or reflect light exists in space, and is called dark matter.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to be launched into outer space by a shuttle at 06:10
tomorrow from the U.S., the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is
designed to detect the presence or otherwise of anti-matter and
dark matter in space.
</P>
<P>
"If the existence of dark matter can be confirmed," said the
research fellow, "then research into theoretical physics will be
greatly pushed forward and the knowledge of mankind about space will
be raised to a new level."
</P>
<P>
He said that the theory of dark matter was first put forward
by a scientist from the former Soviet Union, and China's research
in this regard started shortly after that, and even earlier
than in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
But, according to the academician, currently only about ten
scientists are doing research on this subject, mainly in Beijing
and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"We can feel dark matter because it has gravitation. We believe
that it is the majority of the matter in space, and its weight
accounts for over 90 percent of the universe," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The more knowledge we have about space, the more opportunities
we will have to improve mankind's future," he said, adding that
the more knowledge we have about it, the more significance space
will have for mankind.
</P>
<P>
The cosmic ray detector will stay in outer space for about ten
days, but the initial results will probably not be obtained until
one or two years later, he said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Flays Officials for Poor Tax Collection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Tuesday flayed the tax service for its failure to boost tax
revenue and warned of a new crackdown on major nonpayers.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted Yeltsin as saying that tax
collection had got "not better, but worse, especially over the
past two months."
</P>
<P>
"Where can we get the money to pay miners, teachers, doctors?"
Yeltsin asked at the Kremlin while meeting with Deputy Prime
Minister Viktor Khristenko, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov,
newly-appointed State Tax Service chief Boris Fyodorov and the
heads of the tax police and customs service.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin castigated Fyodorov's predecessor, Alexander Pochinok.
He said he had dismissed him Friday for "complete inertia in his
work."
</P>
<P>
Tougher measures would be taken against the directors of major
debtor enterprises, Yeltsin said, warning that he would "dismiss
them from their posts by presidential decree and open up criminal
cases."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a cabinet's program to boost federal revenues has
been approved by the president.
</P>
<P>
After the Kremlin meeting, Khristenko said the president
strictly demanded proper control over the implementation of the
program.
</P>
<P>
The government would report daily to the president on its
implementation and would inform the public about it.
</P>
<P>
Khristenko said one of the stipulations set by the president
was that there should be no privileges or postponements of
payments, no indulgences.
</P>
<P>
The main failure in the past two months, Khristenko said, was
in the collection of taxes, not other payments.
</P>
<P>
Khristenko said the courts were now considering several cases
linked with tax defaults.
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov, the head of the State Tax Service, said, "Failure to
pay taxes is not simply an indecency, but a criminal offense."
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov said his main task is not to think up some greatly
superior steps, but to toughly implement the government's
decisions, and to do it in a way that was never used before.

<HEADLINE> Intellectual Property Rights Essential to Economic Recovery, Says HKSAR Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Improving protection of
intellectual property rights is vital to speeding the economic
recovery in Asia, Director of Intellectual Property Stephen Selby
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the three-day World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) Asian Regional Symposium, which started here
on Monday, Selby pointed out that intellectual property related
investments in Asia amounted to billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The present economic difficulties in Asia have forced us all
to take a long, hard look at how best to exploit our economic
resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "More and more economies in Asia now recognize
creative talent, inventiveness, and even folklore as a national
resource, and are looking to boost their protection of
intellectual property as a way to maximize their economic
potential."
</P>
<P>
"The symposium is a timely opportunity to exchange ideas. The
symposium attracts prominent intellectual property figures from
around the world. It is aimed at exploring the technical aspects
of implementing the Agreement on the Trade related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)," he said.
</P>
<P>
TRIPS is one of the subsidiary agreements of the Agreement
Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) and binds the 132
WTO members. TRIPS also expands the scope and protection of
intellectual property rights to trade related issues.
</P>
<P>
"Effective enforcement is the key to complying with the TRIPS
agreement," Selby said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been in de facto compliance since 1996, but
compliance is not mandatory until January 1, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Constitutional Council Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Constitutional Council
was sworn in Tuesday under the chair of Chea Sim, president of the
National Assembly, who was authorized by King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
Seven members of the nine-member council attended the
swearing-in ceremony in the palace, despite the absence of the two
other members.
</P>
<P>
The council is an influential legal body, which will have the
power to review laws passed by the National Assembly and to
determine whether laws comply with the spirit of the
Constitution. It can also rule on election disputes and interpret
the outcome of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the council has paved way for the elections
scheduled for July 26.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear why Chau Sen Cocsal Chhum and Son Sann, the
oldest members of the council who were named by King Sihanouk,
were absent, but speculation is that they were not satisfied with
the council.
</P>
<P>
Just before the ceremony, Chau Sen Cocsal Chhum released a
statement claiming that the council's creation was illegal.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the Constitutional Council had been delayed by
squabbles over its political composition. Prince Norodom Ranariddh
had insisted on opposition representation on the council before he
reached a deal last month with Cambodian People's Party (CPP).
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Council is expected to hold its first formal
meeting on Wednesday to elect the chairman of the council.

<HEADLINE> Deng Theory Training Class for Senior CPC Members Ends (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The second training class on Deng
Xiaoping Theory and the guidelines laid down by the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) for members and
alternate members of the CPC Central Committee closed here today.
</P>
<P>
At the closing ceremony, Chinese President Jiang Zemin, also
general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, called on Party
members to overcome all difficulties and score new victories with
the correct guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials must make persistent efforts to study Deng
Xiaoping Theory, and play an exemplary role in studying the theory
and carrying out the tasks set by the 15th CPC National Congress,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The 15th CPC National Congress incorporated Deng Xiaoping
Theory into the Party Constitution, which is a practical move to
arm Party members with the theory, a fundamental program to
improve Party building under the new circumstances, and a pressing
need to push the cause of building Chinese-style socialism into the
21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
The study of Deng Xiaoping Theory should be combined with study
of the report of the 15th Congress, Jiang said, explaining that
the Congress made a novel and thorough explanation of Deng
Xiaoping Theory on the basis of summing up China's achievements
since the 14th CPC National Congress, analyzing the domestic and
international situations in the march toward the new century, and
reviewing the country's development in this century, particularly
over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"It indicates that our Party has achieved a new level of
understanding of Deng Xiaoping Theory," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he noted, the Marxist style of combining
theory with practice must be carried on in the course of studying
Deng Xiaoping Theory. Such a style is a critical political issue
which is vital to the prosperity and success of the cause of the
Party.
</P>
<P>
The study of Marxism must be linked with the practical issues in
the country's reform, opening-up and modernization drive, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the introduction of the policies of reform and
opening-up, our Party has carried forward this fine style of
study, opened up new realms of Marxism and blazed a new trail for
the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that some leading officials still
maintain the bad habit of merely quoting Marxism out of context
and engaging in formalism, bad habits which hinder the
implementation of the Party's policies, tarnish the Party's
image, suffocate the Party's vitality and hamper the healthy
growth of Party members.

<HEADLINE> Deng Theory Training Class for Senior CPC Members Closes (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang urged the members and alternate members of the CPC
Central Committee to combine Deng Xiaoping Theory with summarizing
historical experience, especially that following the Third Plenary
Session of the Eleventh CPC Central Committee, in light of their
own local conditions, with the development of the reform and
opening-up drive, and with the resolution of existing social and
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
"We must respect the initiative of the masses, obtain a correct
understanding of objective laws, find effective ways and
approaches to solve problems and work in a creative manner," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping Theory is a powerful weapon" in transforming our
subjective world and our objective world as well", the leader said.
</P>
<P>
He asked leading officials to strengthen their Party spirit as
well as study the theory.
</P>
<P>
"We must combat various kinds of erroneous ideological trends
and decadent ideology, and solidify our conviction to build
socialism with Chinese characteristics," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, all Party members must stick to the ideological
guideline of emancipating people's minds and seeking truth from
facts, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the major historical turning point of the upcoming new
century, the Party must all the more adhere to this guideline when
facing a multitude of difficulties and severe tests.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with social progress, it is imperative to integrate
the courage of exploration and the spirit of seeking truth and
adhering to the principle that practice is the sole criterion for
verifying truth, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We must firmly and dauntlessly study the new circumstances,
address new problems and create a new situation in order to enrich
and develop Deng Xiaoping Theory," Jiang said.

<P>
Therefore, the Party can better adhere to and hold higher the
great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Party must lead the people in creating a new situation in
the reform and development, while withstanding all trials and
risks. The Party officials, especially leading ones, must have a
good style of ideology and work, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials at all levels must strictly act in step with
the CPC Central Committee in both ideologically and politically,
adhere to the Party's basic guideline and implement its policies.
They should also be good at mobilizing and organizing the people
and arousing the initiative of the people, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all Party members must stick to the organizational
principle of democratic centralism and make correct decisions in
accordance with different situations, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Party members should remain modest, prudent and free from
arrogance and rashness in their style of work, rely on the people
and keep a high sense of responsibility for the Party and the
people, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Party leaders must keep unity among themselves,
Jiang also stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, member of the Secretariat of
the CPC Central Committee and also the president of the Party
School of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the closing
ceremony of the training class, which started May 11.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of all the 41 members and 41 alternate
members of the CPC Central Committee in the class spoke at the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Blair in Belfast to Drive Peace Process in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
arrived in Northern Ireland Tuesday morning in his latest drive to
bring peace to the divided province.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Blair held talks with representatives from the
political parties involved in reaching the peace agreement to
discuss the legislative program for the assembly. This was Blair's
fourth trip to Belfast in five weeks.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was traveling to Belfast from Dublin, where
he held talks with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern over
bilateral relations and Northern Ireland peace deal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Belfast, Blair would also hold talks with
the Democratic Unionist Party and the United Kingdom Unionist Party
which, along with UUP dissidents, led the referendum opposition to
the pact.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Blair's talks would be of a general "catch-up"
nature, following the May 22 referendum in which a majority of
voters endorsed the peace accord reached on April 10.
</P>
<P>
Although the main Protestant and Catholic parties in Northern
Ireland have backed the deal, some Protestant politicians fear
that Sinn Fein, the political arm of the outlawed Irish Republican
Army (IRA), might get a role in a new ruling executive without the
guerrillas having to surrender their weapons.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Businessman Killed in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A Malaysian national has been
shot dead in Somali Telecommunications Service (STS) in Mogadishu
as security in the Somali capital has been worsened since
political settlement failed to materialize in May.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the Malaysian, Mohamed Rashid Musa,
was killed Monday evening by four men armed with Ak-47 and M-16
assault rifles as he descended from his office in the STS telecom
center, formerly the headquarters of the late Socialist Party
that ruled Somalia for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Musa was heading for the mosque to say his Makhrib prayers at
6:10 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses also said that the four men had opened fire
on Musa at once to made sure that he was shot dead before
leaving.
</P>
<P>
The assailants of Musa have not been identified, but the
eyewitnesses in the STS center said one of the company's
bodyguards was among the four who killed Musa and that they fled
on a Toyota Land Cruiser driven by a fifth man.
</P>
<P>
People in the area said the Land Cruiser has overturned as
they took to the turn of the former Italian cultural center close
to the former presidential palace of late Siad Barre.
</P>
<P>
All four killers had escaped unhurt, but the neighbors said
the driver who got injured was apprehended by militiamen loyal to
faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the killing is not known. However, there are
speculations that he had some financial quarrel with senior
officials in their joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Musa, a former colonel in the Malaysian army and now the boss
in the telecommunications joint venture, has been the operational
manager of a huge Malaysian telecommunications company known as
KUB that owned 70 percent of the telecom joint venture with the
Somalis who only own the remaining 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Musa had been serving in the United Nations Humanitarian
division during the large U.N. operation in Somalia in 1994-1995
before returning to Mogadishu as a civilian businessman dealing
with Somalis in establishing a telecom company and a Bank known
as Somali-Malaysian Commercial Bank which does little nowadays.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that two Malaysian nationals in Mogadishu are
considering to leave for their home country immediately.
</P>
<P>
As security is worsened in the capital, at least two buses and
three large trucks had been looted Monday in south Mogadishu
resulting in four people dead and several others wounded.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Efforts Being Mobilized to Save Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Arab and international efforts are
being exerted "massively" to salvage the moribund Mideast peace
process, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs Radio by
telephone from Beirut, Moussa said contacts are under way to
convene an Arab summit to break the peace-making stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Intensive discussions have been going on in several Arab
capitals in the past few days to hammer out an agreement on the
agenda, the venue and date of the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Moussa flew to the Lebanese capital Monday for a two-day
meeting with his Arab counterparts to chart a common strategy on
Israel ahead of a ministerial conference on European-Mediterranean
cooperation in Palermo, Italy, this week.
</P>
<P>
Israel will participate along with the Palestinian National
Authority and 10 other Mediterranean basin countries in the June
3-4 foreign ministers' conference, which will also be attended by
foreign ministers of the 15 European Union member nations.
</P>
<P>
"Europe can play an effective role in promoting the Mideast
peace process within the coming phase," Moussa said. He also
stressed the importance of the United States as one of the
co-sponsors of the peace march.
</P>
<P>
With an annual aid package of 2.3 billion U.S. dollars to the
Middle East, the EU is seeking a greater role in Arab-Israeli
peace-making efforts, which have been largely led by the
U.S. since 1991.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has rejected a recent U.S. initiative aimed at
breaking the year-old impasse in the Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that while Israel still resists the U.S. proposal
of a 13.1-percent second phase Israeli redeployment in the West
Bank, the Palestinians accepted it despite they want 30 percent in
line with the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
In the circumstances, "the world community should have a say in
rescuing the peace drive," he added.

<HEADLINE> Australia Hit by Asian Crisis as Current </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A huge 1.2 billion U.S. dollar
blowout in Australia's current account deficit provided proof
Tuesday that there was little Australia could do to escape the
influence of the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Tuesday announced the
current account deficit widened by 33 percent to a three-year high
of 4.66 billion U.S. dollars in the first three months of calendar
1998, from a revised 3.51 billion U.S. dollar shortfall in the
quarter ending on December 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Today's numbers confirm that the external account is firmly
impaled on a deteriorating trend - which is likely to gather
momentum as the full impact of the Asian slowdown negatively
impacts the export sector over the coming months," John Peters, a
senior economist with Australia's major bank Westpac, said.
</P>
<P>
"We think the export sector in 1998 will notch up its worst
performance since the early 1980s as East Asian demand for
Australian goods and services falls sharply over 1998."
</P>
<P>
The ABS also said Australia's foreign debts had grown to 139.19
billion U.S. dollars in the quarter ending in March from 137.748
billion U.S. dollars in the quarter ending on December 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Su-Lin Ong, a senior economist with Royal Bank of Canada, said
that the deterioration came at a time when demand and overall
growth were moderate, with exports suffering as a result of
external circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"Still, the current account deficit at such levels is clearly
not sustainable and it is likely to continue to come under some
pressure this year, as exports feel the wrath of the Asian
slowdown."
</P>
<P>
The widening also has very serious implications for an already
foundering Australian dollar and most economists said it ruled out
the possibility of the Reserve Bank of Australia changing its
stance on its monetary policy following its monthly board meeting
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, US Scientists Cooperate in Space Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A three-ton space explorer, jointly
developed by the United States, China and other countries will be
carried into space by the shuttle "Discovery", which is scheduled
for launch at the Kennedy Space Center at 6:30 (Beijing time)
tomorrow morning, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
The space explorer, known as the "Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer",
is designed to find anti-matter and missing matter in outer space,
according to CAS.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at CAS have produced a key component of the
explorer -- a piece of a permanent magnet, 1.2 m in
diameter, 0.8 m in length and weighing two tons.
</P>
<P>
CAS said that the design, production and environmental testing
of the explorer's mechanical structures have been completed by the
Chinese Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, meeting the strict
demands for the strength of the mechanical structure when the
shuttle is launched.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of High-Energy Physics of CAS has developed an
anti-coincidence counter for the explorer, which has proved to be
able to stand the pressure caused by massive acceleration and the
violent vibration of takeoff and landing of space vehicles, and
can operate for a long time in space.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 Chinese scientists, along with physicists and
engineers from Russia, France, Italy and other countries, have
been involved in the project, which is presided over by the
Chinese American physicist and Nobel Prize winner Prof. Samuel
C.C. Ting.
</P>
<P>
The explorer will be put into space for tests of its functions

"The explorer aims to find anti-matter and missing
matter in space, suggested by theoretical physicists 20
years ago, and will help mankind to know more about the

"But scientists will not be able to draw any conclusions
until one or two years later," he pointed out.

"This is the first time for China and the United States to

a CAS spokesman. "It will promote scientific exchanges
and friendship between the two countries."

<HEADLINE> Britain, Sweden Safest in EU for Motorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Sweden are named as
the safest places for motorists among European Union (EU) member
states, while Portugal and Greece are the deadliest.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat, the Luxembourg-based statistical office of the
15-nation union, made the assessment in its road safety report on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said the road deaths per million people in 1995 in Britain
and Sweden were 64 and 65 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Portugal and Greece, in comparison, registered deaths per
million as 217 and 195 in the same year, when the EU average
dropped to 119 from 148 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat said that Greater London, Stockholm and Hamburg are
the safest EU regions whereas the Luxembourg province of Belgium
was the worst with 416 road deaths per million people.
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat report said that almost 44,200 people lost their
lives on EU roads in 1995 but this was nearly 14 percent down on
1989. Improvements in road safety between 1989 and 1995 were made
in almost all EU member states with the biggest fall in road
deaths in Finland (by 40 percent), Sweden (by 37 percent) and
Britain (by 32 percent).
</P>
<P>
The biggest rise, however, was 119 percent posted by Greece's
Notio Aigaio. Only two Greek regions -- Peloponnissos and Voreio
Aigoio -- had improvements, Eurostat said.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes for Permanent MFN Status: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that the United States
government and congress will take a positive attitude to granting
China permanent Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status, instead of
repetitive annual review of the issue, a Foreign Ministry official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told a routine
press conference that the US government's annual argument over
whether to grant China MFN benefits or not hinders the smooth
development of the economic and trade ties between the two
countries, and introduces unstable elements into bilateral ties
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The granting of MFN status is a matter of mutual benefit, Zhu
pointed out, and the US should change its outdated practice as
early as possible and give China permanent MFN status, so as to
create a better atmosphere for improving relations between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> More Efforts Needed to Prepare for Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- More consultations are needed for
convening an Arab summit to save the Mideast peace process as the
talks between visiting Saudi crown prince and Jordan's King
Hussein Monday produced no tangible results.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the proposed Arab summit, the two sides
"affirmed importance of good preparation which will enhance Arab
solidarity, unify the nations' stands on crucial issues of the
peace process and finally guarantee the success of the summit,"
Jordan's official news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Jordan Times Tuesday said that the efforts
by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz for an Arab summit
were "bogged down" as he could not iron out the differences
between Syria and Jordan over the its agenda and venue.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of agenda, Syria insists the summit adopt a "clear
and firm" position that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
is responsible for the 16-month-old deadlock of the peace process,
while Jordan does not want to take "drastic steps" to show its
displeasure with Israel, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel have been cooperating in the fields of trade,
water supply and airport construction in accordance with their
1994 peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of venue, Syria wants the summit to be held in its
capital Damascus, an idea that Jordan firmly refused, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Arabic daily the Ad-Dustour Tuesday quoted Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Jawad Anani as
saying that Jordan prefers a mini Arab summit in Cairo, where the
Arab League is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted local political analysts as saying that Jordan
adopted such a hard-line stand in Monday's meeting because it
fears any submission to Syria's ideas might incur anger from its
peace partner Israel and its major aid-provider the United States,
which is the main sponsor of the peace process and reportedly
would not like to see such a summit happen.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi crown prince arrived here Monday from Syria. His
diplomatic efforts followed the visits of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
to garner support for such a summit aimed at forming a united Arab
front against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been deadlocked
since last March over Jewish settlement expansion in occupied
lands and long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The lastest U.S. efforts failed to bridge the gap between the
two sides, as Israel rejected a U.S. proposal of 13.1 percent
Israeli troops redeployment in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Keeps Organized Army: UN Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- United Nations special envoy in
Angola Blondin Beye has revealed that the National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) still keeps some "organized"
army units in certain provinces of the country.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here on Monday evening at a press
conference. However, he didn't reveal the number of soldiers
under UNITA's control.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the U.N. envoy pointed out that UNITA
has still got non-demobilized forces, echoing the viewpoint of
the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
Beye stressed that effective solutions must be found to this
problem so as to safeguard the highest interests of the peace
process. The Angolan government and UNITA signed a 1994 Lusaka
peace protocol to start the peace process and end the two decades
of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The news has sparked immediate reactions from the Angolan
government. Deputy Foreign Minister Joao Miranda told the press
that Angola is facing an extremely dangerous situation with
serious retrogression in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the admission of UNITA members to the
national assembly and the government of national unity and
reconciliation in March marks the political solution of the peace
process. However, he said, the settlement of political issues
have not resulted in the settlement of military issues as
expected by people.
</P>
<P>
If the fact that UNITA still keeps its army is not reverted,
Angolan people will suffer once again the disasters.
</P>
<P>
On the establishment of national administration in
UNITA-occupied regions, Beye noted that the UNITA leadership has
pledged to make new improvement on June 17 to 21.
</P>
<P>
Technical groups made up of representatives from various
parties will soon set for four sensitive areas including UNITA
headquarters in Bailundo and Andulo for observation and
inspection before the hand-over of authority to the government.

BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Governments at all levels should
take practical measures to curb the making of false statistical
reports and ensure the authenticity of statistical figures, so as
to let statistical work play its due role in the national economy
and social development.
</P>
<P>
It should be regarded as an important part of the efforts to
improve the work style of the ruling Communist Party of China
(CPC) and the government and to fight corruption.
</P>

Wen Jiabao, member of the CPC Central Committee Political
Bureau and Vice-Premier, made the remarks at today's national

State Council General Office asking governments and Party
committees at all levels to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
Fake statistical reports have been detrimental to the healthy
development of national economy, the image of the Party and the
government, as well as the Party's good tradition and work style,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Supervisory departments should make greater efforts to handle
cases related to false statistical reports, and officials who have
profiteered from making such reports must be removed from their

<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The administrative secretary of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tuesday
expressed confidence that Hong Kong enjoys good medium- and
long-term prospects though it will have to go through a very
painful adjustment period.
</P>
<P>
Anson Chan told the media after a meeting of the Executive
Council that to a very large extent the existing volatility in
Hong Kong's stock market and economy as a whole is a reflection of
what is happening in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a small externally oriented economy and it cannot
be immune from the contagious effects of these current financial
difficulties, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chan noted that the government announced seven measures to
stimulate Hong Kong's economy last week and it will take a bit of
time to see the effectiveness of the measures.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of her upcoming visit to Japan and the United States
starting Wednesday, Chan said she will brief Japanese and U.S.
officials on Hong Kong's situation after it returned to China on
July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Part of the purposes of this visit is on the one hand to
address concerns about the performance of the economy but to also
underline our economic fundamentals, our strength and why we feel
that we will be well positioned to come out of the shock rather
quicker than other countries," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that in Tokyo she will meet with representatives of
the tourism industry of Japan and try to increase the interest of
the Japanese people in travelling to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In Washington and in New York, Chan said, she will lobby for
the extension of the most favored nation (MFN) status to China.

MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Coast Guard divers
recovered 91 pieces of rusty live mortars and howitzers from the
sea in the central part of the country, an officer said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Officer Fernando Carmona of the Philippine Cost Guard said the
sunk explosives were found in the muddy sea floor some 21 feet
deep near the port of Batangas city.
</P>
<P>
The mortars and howitzers were believed to be manufactured in
the United States some four to six years ago, Carmona said, adding
that the explosives would still blow up if not handled properly.
</P>
<P>
Port officials said the explosives contained in broken wooden
crates were part of illegal shipment of arms for the rebels or
criminal syndicates in the country.
</P>
<P>
They said the explosives, a number of which had been discovered
by fishermen in 1993, were believed thrown into the sea by
smugglers to avoid apprehension by authorities.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Economy to Remain Sluggish in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean economy will remain
sluggish and unemployment will rise in the second half of this
year, Governor of the Bank of Korea Chon Chol-hwan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Though the South Korean current account balance will continue
to show a surplus, its exports would not grow sustainingly in the
period, Chon said.
</P>
<P>
At same time, export conditions would not improve because of
the Japanese yen's devaluation, Chon added.
</P>
<P>
The yen tumbled to 139.33 against the U.S. dollar Monday, the
lowest in seven years, after a seven week slide which, it is
feared, will trigger a new crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor predicted that inflation will go on
rising because of an increase in the tax rate and public expenses.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the country's monetary policy will be
flexible to prevent contraction of the economy as much as
possible, and to support industrial and financial restructuring,
which is a condition tied to the rescue loan of 57 billion
U.S. dollars from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank would do its best to help small and
medium-size companies and the export industry by providing loans,
said the governor.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has been in a serious financial crisis with 155.2
billion U.S. dollars in foreign debts.

<HEADLINE> Near-Term Outlook for Australian Dollar Seen Grim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The near term outlook for the
Australian dollar is pretty grim with shaky financial markets in
Asia and soft commodity prices weighing on the unit, currency
analysts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it was hard to ferret out anything positive for
the Australian dollar, with little evidence of support
materializing and the unit exploring the 61.00-U.S.-cent level.
</P>
<P>
There was no basis for the currency to stop there either, with
many expecting the local dollar to fall to 60.00 U.S. cents and
even lower.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar fell to its lowest point in almost 12
years Tuesday, hitting a new low of 61.10 U.S. cents, and it
recovered slightly to close at 61.23 U.S. cents from 62.02 U.S.
cents Monday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency is beset by two major factors, unsettled
financial markets in Asia which have contributed to a "sell the
Australian dollar as a proxy for the region mentality" and
worsening commodity prices.

<P>
"I really don't think you have to look much further than
Japan," Helen Camp, senior economist with Westpac Bank told the
Australian Associated Press Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, she noted that the instability in Russia, and the
implied threat to dump gold, aluminum and palladium have cast a
pall over commodity prices and been reflected in increased
pressure on the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Gold, a key barometer for the Australian dollar, has plunged to
trade around 288 U.S. dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
Other commodity prices offered no comfort Tuesday with nickel
prices in free fall on the London Metal Exchange Monday night,
hitting a 26-month low of 4,700 U.S. dollars a ton.
</P>
<P>
The Asian economic crisis has led to a crisis of confidence in
Australian business and its impact has been steadily undermining
the local economy and, in turn, the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"It's a murky picture," said David Moore, an economist with the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
</P>
<P>
However, both he and Camp agreed that more evidence was needed
that Australia's economy would head for a slowdown in the second
half before there was further pressure on the Reserve Bank of
Australia to cut interest rates further.
</P>
<P>
Lower rates would weigh on the Australian dollar, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
"The domestic story is not the main negative for the Aussie
(dollar)," Camp said.
</P>
<P>
She said the foreign exchange market was unlikely to settle
down until the yen reached more comfortable levels and the
economic situation in Japan settled down, but she did not expect
that would happen overnight.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar is now at its lowest level since the
giddy days of late July 1986. It traded down to an intraday low of
57.17 U.S. cents on the 28th of that month and closed at 59.60
U.S. cents on the 31st of July, 1986.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets U.S President's Security Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- It has been demonstrated that a
sound and improving Sino-U.S. relationship is of great importance
not only to the people of both countries, but to the stability and
security of the world as a whole, President Jiang Zemin said here
today.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang made the remark while meeting this afternoon
with Samuel Berger, assistant to the U.S. president for national
security affairs.
</P>
<P>
"When I visited the United States last autumn, President Bill
Clinton and I decided to make joint efforts to build a
constructive strategic partnership geared toward the 21st
century," Jiang said. He added that visits between Chinese and
U.S. leaders represent the strong aspiration of their peoples to
maintain friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Holding important responsibilities for the peace, stability and
prosperity of the world in the 21st century, China and the United
States and their leaders must show great foresight and proceed
from the fundamental interests of their peoples, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Only thus can they do away with all kinds of disturbances and
obstacles, and develop the Sino-U.S. relationship continuously,
Jiang emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to meeting President Clinton in Beijing,
and his visit to China will undoubtedly promote the bilateral
relationship in a sound and stable direction," said the Chinese
president.
</P>
<P>
Berger told Jiang that Clinton values the development of the
bilateral relations and regards his upcoming visit to China as the
most important event in his second term of presidency, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is also confident that his visit will score
important and positive outcome, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan, and Liu Huaqiu, director of the State Council's Foreign
Affairs Office, also met with Berger earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Berger, who arrived here Monday afternoon as guest of the
Chinese Foreign Ministry, will leave Beijing late this evening,
winding up his China trip.
</P>
<P>
Berger visited China in August last year to prepare for
President Jiang's state visit to the U.S. last fall.

<P>
PARIS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Romario was axed from the 22-member
Brazilian squad as the striker failed to recover from a calf
muscle injury sustained on May 6 in Brazil's training camp in Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil coach Mario Zagallo said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Emerson, a 22-year-old defensive midfielder of the German side
Bayer Leverkusen, was named by Zagallo as Romario's replacement.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old striker broke down in tears, saying he was
devastated as he faced the massed ranks of the Brazilian media.
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest disappointment of my life, but this doesn't
mean I won't play for Brazil again," Romario said.
</P>
<P>
Zagallo, his deputy Zico, the team doctor and physiotherapist
decided Romario would not make full fitness.
</P>
<P>
Romario shook off his demons in the last year to pass the
strict Brazil medical exams to make the World Cup squad, but the
injury ruled him out.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, in a
meeting today with Samuel Berger, assistant to the U.S. president
for national security affairs, said that President Clinton's
upcoming state visit to China is another important event in the
Sino-U.S. relationship since President Jiang Zemin's successful
U.S. trip last October.
</P>
<P>
As long as the two countries approach their relationship with a
view toward "wide-ranging and shared" interests and the 21st
century, joint efforts will certainly make President Clinton's
China visit a complete success, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that Berger's current visit to China is to prepare for
the presidential visit, to which the Chinese side attaches great
importance.
</P>
<P>
Berger said that he was delighted to have the opportunity to
meet with Qian again. He added that President Jiang Zemin's
successful visit to the U.S. last year has pushed forward the
bilateral relationship and has enabled the American people to gain
a better understanding of China and Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is here to lay groundwork for President
Clinton's visit to China, the first one paid by a U.S. president
in nearly a decade. He expressed the conviction that the visit
will help improve and develop bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian and Berger also exchanged views on the situation in South
Asia. Both believed that the international community must take
effective and feasible measures to halt nuclear arms race in the
region and prevent the nuclear weapons proliferation, in order to
restore and safeguard peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan met with and had a
working luncheon with Berger earlier today.

BRUSSELS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission cleared on
Tuesday an emergency humanitarian aid worth 1.5 million Ecus (1.65
million U.S. dollars) for victims of last week's earthquake in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The aid, to be managed by the European Community Humanitarian
Office, will enable humanitarian organizations to carry out
immediate relief operations in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The EU funding will cover essentials for survival and medical
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The tremor, measuring 7.0 on the open-ended Richter scale, hit
northeast Afghanistan on May 30 and humanitarian organizations
that stayed in the area since the last quake estimated that up to
3,000 people may have died and as many people have been injured.
</P>
<P>
EU officials said that since the area is still difficult to
access due to heavy rains and flooding, it is hard to estimate the
exact casualties and damage caused by the quake.
</P>
<P>
The officials cited an initial estimate as describing that up
to 40 villages had been destroyed by the quake.
</P>
<P>
An earlier earthquake hit the same area this February and the
most affected areas are Rustaq, Chah Ab and Shahr-e-burg in
Afghanistan's Takhar and Badakhstan provinces.

MAPUTO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican police have rounded
up 79 drug traffickers and seized 16.75 kilograms of Marijuana
and some narcotic injections in its code-named Colombia Operation
here, the National Police Service announced.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Abilio Quive made the announcement here
Monday, saying two drug supply bases have also been destroyed,
the Noticias newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Quive was quoted as saying that the operation was mainly
aimed at cracking down on the drug traffickers and users and
smashing up the supplying bases in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Quive pointed out that the 79 detainees will be interrogated
so that it can be decided how seriously each one has been
involved in drug dealing. Some of the detainees are Mozambicans.
And some others are from Tanzania, Nigeria, Malawi and Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to Quive, the crackdown operation has been
supported by the Mozambican armed forces because many of the drug
dealers are based in the military zones.
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman noted that the anti-drug operation will
go on at unlimited time since activities of drug traffickers and
drug users are still rampant in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in the last four years, more than 220
tons of various drugs had been transferred out of Mozambique
through the port, airports and postal parcels.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Working to Develop Climatological Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are working to
explore ways of untilizing climatological resources in northwest
China, which has long been plagued by sandstorms and dry spells,
according to researchers at the Lanzhou branch of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Developing wind and solar energy resources are key areas for
utilization of climatological resources. The solar energy reserve
in northwest China is only next to that in the Tibet Autonomous
Region, and most part of the region has over 3,000 hours of
sunshine each year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the region's wind resources also takes the lead in
the country, which covers nine parts including western Gansu,
northern Qinghai, and northwestern Xinjiang, covering an area of
155,000 sq km and with an installed power-generating capacity of
150 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
New energy research institutes and solar energy developing
corporations have been founded in Gansu Province and the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Forestry depletion has slowed down since Gansu Province
introduced the use of solar-fueled cooking stove in mid arid
regions. A solar power supply demonstration region has been set up
in Xinjiang, and the region also has made great progress in
generating power through wind.
</P>
<P>
The wind power plant in Dabancheng, Xinjiang, has a total
installed capacity of 2,000 kilowatts, and generates six million
kwhs of electricity each year.

<HEADLINE> Government Forced to Bring Gas Prices Back to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Strong protests by the opposition
have forced the Indian government to bring gas prices in the
country back to normal except for a 1-rupee increase as tax.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha announced the government move
at the on-going Lower House session here Tuesday in response to
the opposition parties' protests against the steep increase in the
gas price following the budget presentation Monday and demand for
its immediate withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Sinha of misleading the House, opposition members
contended that the prices have gone up by about 4 rupees per liter
of gas though he had announced imposition of a cess of 1 rupee per
liter for the development of roads.
</P>
<P>
The entire opposition staged a walkout after accusing the
government of being "irresponsible" with the budget and charging

<P>
The announcement by the minister failed to pacify the
opposition which maintained that the government was speaking in
different voices.
</P>
<P>
Janet Al leader Jail Reedy said here Tuesday that never in the
history of independent India had such a thing occurred.

<HEADLINE> Chittagong Stock Exchange Computerizes Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE)
in Bangladesh adopted an automated trading system Tuesday,
broadening its business horizon beyond Bangladesh's biggest port
city.
</P>
<P>
"The automated system will create a lot of confidence in the
country's capital market, not only among the locals but also the
foreign investors," CSE chief Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury said at a
ceremony held in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
After the opening-up of the country's capital market during the
first half of the 1990s, foreign investors put a substantial
amount in the emerging market.
</P>
<P>
But they deserted the market after a share scam in late 1996
which many felt was a result of the lack of transparency and
accountability in market activities.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors would feel encouraged to come back to
Bangladesh, because they want to see and invest in a transparent
capital market, Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
The automated trading system project is being implemented with
an 80-million-U.S.-dollar loan from the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
CSE stockbrokers from Dhaka and the northeastern city of Sylhet
as well as Chittagong will be able to place sell or buy orders on
the screens.
</P>
<P>
The system will be expanded to the country's northwestern and
southwestern cities of Bogra and Kulna later.
</P>
<P>
There are only two stock exchange centers, Chittagong and
Dhaka, in this South Asian country at present.
</P>
<P>
The CSE is the country's first to introduce a computerized
trading system and the Dhaka Stock Exchange is due to have its
automated trading system later this month.

<HEADLINE> China Investment Fair Opens in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A 220-strong trade delegation
from the Chinese mainland started face-to-face contacts with
potential overseas investors at the 98 China (HK) Investment and
Trade Fair, which opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth and the largest ever investment and trade
fair organized by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, composed of officials and entrepreneurs from 22
mainland provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, brought
more than 700 investment projects to Hong Kong, a major source of
overseas investment in the mainland, An Min, assistant minister of
MOFTEC, said here Tuesday at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
A large number of participants in this year's fair are from
China's central and western parts, which are less developed than
the country's booming coastal regions but abundant in labor and
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
"We are making efforts to attract more and more overseas
business people to invest in the vast hinterland," the assistant
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 738 projects available at the fair, a large proportion
are related to agriculture, infrastructure and hi-tech industry,
the fields which the Chinese government has encouraged overseas
investors to pour money into.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the first quarter of 1998, China had approved
more than 300,000 overseas-funded ventures and half of them have
gone into operation, statistics provided by the MOFTEC showed.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, the country has actually made use of
foreign direct investment exceeding 230 billion U.S. dollars and
Hong Kong accounted for 54 percent of the total, topping the list
of overseas investors in China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
As part of the fair, a half-day seminar was held here Tuesday
to provide a forum for high-ranking Chinese officials to brief the
Hong Kong business community on the latest investment environment
and policies in the mainland.

<HEADLINE> HK Conducts Public Consultation on Transport Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government Tuesday
released a consultation document on the Third Comprehensive
Transport Study (CTS-3) to invite public views on how Hong Kong
will be best served by its transport policies for the next two
decades.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said the projected population growth, an
enhanced housing development program and the increasing
cross-boundary traffic with China's mainland have pointed to a
need to update and refine Hong Kong's transport infrastructure and
policy framework.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, the government commissioned the CTS-3 in August
1997 to study our future transport needs," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
This will provide the broad parameters for the long-term
development of Hong Kong's transport infrastructure, for the
expansion of public transport services and for setting the traffic
management objectives for the future, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Initial tests are being conducted as part of the CTS-3," the
spokesman said. "We consider it useful to have public views on the
major initiatives being examined in the study so that these could
be incorporated in the detailed recommendations before they are
finalized in early 1999," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Public views are sought on matters such as providing transport
infrastructure in a more timely manner to meet anticipated
demands; according priority to railways, which are the most
efficient mass carriers, in the use of valuable land space; better
coordination of the services of various public transport modes;
rationalizing traffic demand and managing it in more
cost-effective ways through the application of new technologies.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Stock Market Brisk in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's stock market reported a
brisk business in the first quarter of this year, compared with
the last quarter of 1997, the Business Concord reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Nigerian Stock Exchange in Lagos recorded
a turnover of 389.9 million shares worth of 2.7 billion Naira
(about 90 Naira equals to one U.S. Dollar) in the first three
months.
</P>
<P>
This, it said, represents an increase of 25.8 percent and 11.7
percent, respectively, over the level of the preceding quarter.
</P>
<P>
The story will be different, however, if compared with the
first quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The total shares changing hands in the period decreased by 5.8
percent, while the total value of securities traded in the
Exchange was down by 1.3 percent, due to losses in equity prices
and the delisting of two distressed banks.
</P>
<P>
The All-Share Index closed at 6,298.5, down by 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Nigeria's stock market increased by 57.7
percent in the first quarter over the same period of 1997 to
reach 4.1 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
After consultations with dealing members, the Exchange in the
first quarter began the implementation of its Automated Trading
System, in an effort to make its service more efficient and
cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
The performance of the market in the rest time of the year
depends on the government's determination to go on with the
proposed privatization program and its capability to address the
lingering problem of irregular fuel and power supply, the report
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Asia's leading electrical

Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis' impact on Kenyan Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis has had
some effect on the local market of the Nairobi Stock Exchange
(NSE) as the market is driven by local forces, according to the
NSE boss.
</P>
<P>
The Asian crisis "impacted some fear in some major investors"
because NSE is not international, NSE's Chief Executive Job
Kihumba told the national daily Kenya Times last week.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from August last year, Kihumba said, foreign firms'
performance went down due to the impasse between Kenya and the
World Bank and the tense political climate before the General
Election held last December.
</P>
<P>
However, foreigners brought in 31 million U.S. Dollars to buy
shares floated by the Kenya Commercial Bank, he noted, adding
that these interests of foreigners indicated that their
suspicions about Kenya have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The total value of shares traded at NSE stood at 6.1 billion
Kenyan Shillings (about 100 million U.S. Dollars) last year,
compared with 3.9 billion Shillings (about 65 million U.S.
Dollars) in 1996, according to Kihumba.
</P>
<P>
In bonds, the total value traded at NSE last year recorded 15
billion Shillings (about 250 million U.S. Dollars) with the
National Bank of Kenya traded bonds standing at 10 billion
Shillings (about 170 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The number of traded transactions was 80,000 contracts last
year, compared to 60,000 contracts traded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that by mid 1999, the NSE performance will be
better as "we should have started to see positive signs of
economic development."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the future of the NSE will, more or less, depend
on the performance of the country's economy because companies
listed at NSE represent all sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The NSE boss pointed out that one of the biggest bottlenecks
in Kenya's economic development is the government expenditure
which has denied other sectors of the economy development
capital.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the Kenyan government has for the first time
acknowledged that it must reduce its expenditure, adding that if
the government pursued its cost reduction policy, it would end up
with surpluses to channel into other sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
In his view, NSE has become an important player in Kenya's
economy since the liberalization process was launched by the
government several years ago.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in Macao Drop 8.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of visitors to Macao in
the first four months of the year dropped 8.4 percent from the
same period last year, the latest official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Macao Census and
Statistics Department on Tuesday, visitor arrivals added up to
2,434,083 during that period.
</P>
<P>
In April, the number of visitors came to 649,966, down 1
percent from a year earlier. However, it means a slight recovery
from March, when 578,181 tourists arrived.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that the number of Hong Kong visitors, which
accounted for some 70 percent of all arrivals, rose 6.5 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
But tourist arrivals from the Republic of Korea, Japan,
Southeast Asian nations and Europe all plummeted by as much as 84
percent.
</P>
<P>
The drop in tourist arrivals is considered a result of the
financial storms which broke out in Asia last year. Macao received
7 million tourists in 1997, down 14 percent from the previous
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Forty-six member and observer
nations of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) signed a joint
statement here Tuesday, condemning nuclear testing by India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The signatories "are alarmed and deeply concerned at nuclear
testing by India and Pakistan," according to the statement drafted
by Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
There are 61 members in the Conference on Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"They condemn all nuclear testing and consider such acts to be
contrary to the international consensus which bans the testing of
nuclear weapons and other explosive devices," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The tests undertaken by India and Pakistan's decision to
respond with its own tests, blatantly undermine the international
regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," it went on. "The
actions of India and Pakistan threaten and undermine the process
of disarmament and the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons
altogether."
</P>
<P>
"The testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan is
totally irreconcilable with claims by both countries that they are
committed to nuclear disarmament," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The signatories called on India and Pakistan to resolve their
tensions "through constructive dialogue and negotiation".
</P>
<P>
The signatories in order of signature are Australia, New Zealand,
the Unites States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Austria,
Finland, Ukraine, Canada, Greece, Slovakia, Hungary, Sweden, Belarus,

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Accuses U.S., Ghana, S. Africa of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has accused
the U.S., Ghana and South Africa of collaborating to destabilize
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Alahji Wada Nas, Special Adviser to Head of State General Sani
Abacha, made the allegation at a press conference held Monday in
the Federal Capital Territory Abuja.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully aware of the collaboration between some
countries, namely America, South Africa and Ghana, with some
human rights and pro-democracy groups to destabilize Nigeria,"
Nas said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, an American group in Ghana organized a
meeting for that objective from May 6 to May 8 at Achimota Hotel
in Northern Ghana.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the Ghanaian government may not have
been aware of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nas alleged that the meeting was attended by no fewer than 14
human rights and pro-democracy groups. "The meeting was organized
by America, while the trainers were from South Africa and Ghana
was the host," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting adopted the strategy of defiance campaign, mass
protests, boycott rallies and intensive social mobilization to
destabilize the Abacha government, he said.
</P>
<P>
The special adviser alleged that at the end of the meeting,
each participant was promised a grant of 50,000 U.S. Dollars for
their activities between June and July.
</P>
<P>
Nas also accused the European Union of providing 250,000 U.S.
Dollars to a pro-democracy group known as the United Action for
Democracy (UAD). The money, he said, is to subvert any
pro-government activities and organize mass protests between June
and August.
</P>
<P>
He alleged that a group known as the Joint Action Committee of
Nigeria has planned to stage neighborhood rallies all over the
country on June 12.
</P>
<P>
The special adviser said the country's law enforcement
agencies have the full capability to maintain the law and called
on Nigerian people to shun all unpatriotic actions.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Tumbles to its Lowest Point in 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar tumbled to
its lowest point in almost 12 years Tuesday after the Australian
Bureau of Statistics reported a 2.0 billion Australian dollars
(1.22 billion U.S. dollars) blowout in the nation's current
account deficit.
</P>
<P>
A sinking Japanese yen also placed pressure on the battered
unit, which plunged almost one U.S. cent to its new low of 61.10
U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
After heading towards the 61.00 level, the currency recovered
slightly to close at 61.23 from 62.02 Monday.
</P>
<P>
St George Bank Manager of Foreign Exchange Trading Stuart Moore
said the unit could be expected to fall further in the short term.
</P>
<P>
A rampaging U.S. dollar/Japanese yen exchange rate and a soft
gold price was combining with the Asian economic crisis to provide
a worrying time for the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Moore said as the Japanese currency marched towards 140.00
against the U.S. dollar, market participants would be on the
look-out for intervention from the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Closer to home was the possibility the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) would jump into the market to defend the
Australian dollar if it dipped below 61 U.S. cents, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
The currency is now below levels that prompted RBA intervention
only a few weeks ago when the unit touched 61.69 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The RBA intervention in May was credited to a disorderly fall
in the Australian dollar and Moore pointed out that at present the
local currency was conducting a fairly orderly drop.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended the day here at 85.33 from 86.20
against Japanese yen and at 1.0906 from 1.1022 against German
mark.

eased the severe drought in most part of Vietnam, the Vietnam News
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The highest-recorded rainfall was 158 mm last week in the
catchment of the Da River which feeds Hoa Binh Reservoir in Lai
Chau province, 300 kilometers north-west of Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
The Central Weather Bureau is forecasting more heavy rains for
later this week.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily also said that heavy rains filled up
reservoirs at major hidro-electricity plants but raised the danger
of flash floods in mountainous regions.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh City in the south was hit hard by whirlwinds with
torrential rain last week.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds uprooted trees and swept away make-shift
iron-sheet roofing in the city.
</P>
<P>
Officials have warned coastal farmers to prepare for floods
caused by high tides in the south.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Bank Card Practices Banned in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
today issued a circular calling for an end to the practice of
using credit cards and other bank cards to defraud money from
residents.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the PBOC said that recently some people were found
to have been using bank cards and accounts to defraud funds from
residents in the capital of Beijing, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, the southwestern China city of Kunming, the northeastern
Dalian city and some other provinces, autonomous regions and
cities, which has not only seriously affected banks' normal
business but undermined banks' credit.
</P>
<P>
To protect China's financial order and the safety of residents'
money, the central bank has urged all commercial banks to handle
deposit business in strict compliance with the related
regulations. In handling bank card deposit businesses, the banks
must require depositors to produce their cards and codes,
otherwise the depositors' business applications will be turned
down.
</P>
<P>
Banks are empowered to reject depositors' business applications
whenever they found fund-raising illegal with bank cards, the
circular said.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels Monday
fired mortars at government troops in northwest Kunchukkulam and
at least eight rebels were killed when the troops retaliated with
mortars and artillery, a military spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Government troops engaged in Operation Jaya Sikuru (Certain
Victory) commenced advancing last Wednesday and recaptured
Tunukkai Town and Vellayankulam west of Mankulam Town Monday. They
have taken full control of the Mallavi-Tunukkai byroad.

<P>
The government troops have surrounded Mankulam Town, which is
strategic for rebels, from the south, west and east, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said heavy fighting raged Monday, causing heavy
casualties on both sides. More than 17 rebels were killed in the
fighting.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- This capital city of south
China's Guangdong Province is intensifying efforts to use overseas
capital in the reform of state-run small and medium-sized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The latest effort was a property rights transfer fair held in
Hong Kong recently, organized by the city government, said Liang
Zhengxiang, deputy director of the government's information
office, who attended the fair.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou prepared nearly 100 projects in the sectors of
chemicals, metallurgy, machinery and electronics, foodstuffs,
textiles, hardwares, and building materials. More than 350 Hong
Kong entrepreneurs attended the fair and signed some agreements.
</P>
<P>
The city worked out favorable policies to encourage overseas
participation in the reform of its small and medium-sized state
businesses. The historical debts of an enterprise, for example,
can be deducted from reassessed property values.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors are also encouraged to run service
businesses at their Chinese partners' old factory sites, or to
transform related enterprises elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Overseas involvement can take forms like purchasing,
acquisition, leasing or contracts.

<HEADLINE> Jilin Conducts Auditing of State-Owned Grain Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Jilin province
has been conducting auditing of the financial affairs of
state-owned grain companies in the province since mid-March in a
bid to find out the real causes for the companies' losses and to
work out countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
Auditors have so far successfully prevented more than 30
million yuan from possible losses by screening their operations
and financial accounts, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
Jilin, a well-known maize producer, has 1,445 state-owned grain
companies. Some of them have been suffering from economic losses
for years. The auditing operation will be completed by late June.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that state grain companies in China
have lost more than 100 billion yuan in the past seven years due
to bad performances and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji stressed the
inevitability and urgency to restructure the nation's grain
marketing system.
</P>
<P>
And the reform will be carried out in line with the principles
of cutting administrative functions from State-owned grain
companies, separating storage from management, central from local
responsibilities and new from old accounts, as well as improving
the pricing system for the grain market, according to earlier
reports.
</P>
<P>
The main problems in China's grain marketing system lie in the
fact that the state-owned grain companies play a dual role of both
storage and marketing, with a managerial mechanism that has failed
to operate in line with the laws governing market operation and
has resulted in severe financial losses.
</P>
<P>
For decades, China's grain firms have mixed government
functions and commercial roles, with the result that they have
been suffering from bad debts and financial losses for many years.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the state grain firms are trapped by planned
economic structures; they do not have the authority to make
managerial decisions on their own, and suffer from overstaffing,
high operation costs and poor economic returns.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Bank Plans More Housing Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Henan Provincial branch of
the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) will extend 800 million yuan
in housing loans this year to help boost economic growth,
according to a bank official.
</P>
<P>
A total of 150 million yuan has already been issued to housing
buyers, the official added.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth extension of housing loans, the branch has
formulated a number of documents on real estate development and
housing loans so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the branch will beef up loan supervision to make
sure that the loans are not used to develop luxury hotels, office
buildings, tourism resorts, high-class apartments or villas, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese bank branches have decided to increase the amount
of housing loans in an effort to activate the housing sector and
thereby boost economic growth. The central government has selected
housing as one of the major driving forces for economic growth
this year.
</P>
<P>
China plans an economic growth rate of eight percent this
year. However, the growth of the gross domestic product slowed
down to 7.2 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of this
year, partly due to insufficient domestic spending and slumping
exports.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Repeats Invitation to SEF to Visit Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-based Association For
Relations Across Taiwan Strait (ARATS) sent a letter to the Strait
Exchange Foundation (SEF) in Taiwan Monday, repeating its
invitation to SEF head Koo Chen-fu to visit the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that since early this year, ARATS has for
several times expressed its hope that Mr. Koo Chen-fu would lead a
delegation to visit the mainland or attend seminars or forums
jointly held by ARATS and SEF in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
SEF sent two letters to ARATS on Nov. 7, 1997 and Jan. 19 this
year, saying Mr. Koo would come "to visit in December or some time
later."
</P>
<P>
Responding to this, ARATS had invited SEF deputy
secretary-general to come to Beijing later April to make
arrangements for Mr. Koo's visit, including the time and subjects
for discussion.
</P>
<P>
"ARATS now reiterates it welcomes Mr. Koo Chen-fu to make a
scheduled visit at an earliest possible date. Please let us know
if SEF has any ideas about the meeting and its the time, venue and
subjects for discussion," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's letter, ARATS thanked SEF for its invitation to
ARATS' deputy secretary-general to visit Taiwan and said the
deputy secretary-general would make the visit at an appropriate
time and after ARATS has chosen some appropriate exchange
programs.
</P>
<P>
The letter concluded by inviting SEF's deputy secretary-general
to visit the mainland on the same terms.

<HEADLINE> Iran's MPs Question FM over Americans' Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Majlis (Parliament) members
have asked Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi for explanation over
the recent trips to Iran by several Americans, Jomhuri Islami
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Majlis members asked why the Foreign Ministry granted entry
visas to American citizens, political and security elements,
especially to Rupert Murdoch, "one of the main pillars of Zionism
and ringleaders of cultural invasion in the world."
</P>
<P>
They accused Murdoch of visiting various Iranian cities in
order to assess Iran's atmosphere to stage his cultural assault,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi is not available for comment at least for now.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the conservative Guardians Council Ayatollah Ahmad
Jannati on Friday also accused the Foreign Ministry of inviting
American and Israeli elements to visit the country.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry rejected the accusation Saturday, terming
Jannati's remarks as a "slip of the tongue."
</P>
<P>
Up to now, no Israeli individual has been granted visa and nor
will they be granted visa in the future, the Foreign Ministry
said, adding that they have no plans to issue visas to
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
Former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati Tuesday was quoted
as saying that Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was
"determined" that Iran would not resume relations with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The recent visits by some American citizens to Iran had
nothing to do with Iran's principled policy towards the U.S., said
Velayati, who is Khamanei's advisor on foreign affairs.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Laws for Intellectual Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China plans to revise some laws
concerning the protection of the intellectual property rights, in
a bid to further improve the country's law system in the field,
according to a latest report from the State Intellectual Property
Office (SIPO).
</P>
<P>
The SIPO will join the scheduled boost for revising Patent
Law. The work has been listed into the legislative agenda of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The would-be law revision aims to address the new issues which
occur in the market economy, the SIPO, the top official organ
which leads China's endeavor to protect domestic and overseas
intellectual property rights, said in its long-range development
program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the revised Patent Law should benefit the
newly-developed fields, such as microelectronic technology,
software engineering, data base and biological engineering, the
program said.
</P>
<P>
The revision draft of Law on Copyright will be deliberated by
the NPC Standing Committee around the end of the year, said Xu
Yulin, a senior official with the Legislative Affairs Office of
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the country will draft a new law to protect
business secrets for enterprises and individuals, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
"We must strengthen the legislation and law enforcement for IPR
protection," he said.
</P>
<P>
The SIPO also plans to receive 100,000 patent applications
annually around the year 2000. And the annual applications around
2010 will reach 150,000.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the SIPO will further boost the patent work in
enterprises, research institutes and higher-educational
institutes. But some related statistics showed that China's
research and higher-learning institutes lack the awareness of IPR
protection.
</P>
<P>
The nation has adopted trademark, patent and copyright laws as
well as regulations on the protection of computer software and the
law against unfair competition since 1982.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ethnic Minorities Benefit From Foreign Capital (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Uygur farmer Abli Memet never
expected that his family's poor living conditions could be
improved so greatly a year ago when he put up an iron plate -- the
sign for involving in a UNDP project -- on his door.
</P>
<P>
In mid-May of this year, however, Trine M. Lund-Jensen, UNDP
assistant resident representative to China, visited Abli's home
and spoke highly of his pioneering effort in improving his living
and production conditions.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Uygur got a 1,000-yuan low-interest loan from
the local UNDP project office last year, and used 600 yuan to buy
a timber processing machine, and 400 yuan for two lambs. Now, he
earns 15 yuan every day by processing timber, and has three heads
of sheep which his wife takes care of.
</P>
<P>
The farmer with only three years of schooling has learned to
make money by doing business, and more important, he has come to
know how to develop contacts with financial institutions through
signing contracts and paying off loans in installments, a local
economist said. But years ago, he never tried to invest his money
in production when offered subsidies for poverty relief.
</P>
<P>
Some remote areas in China, where ethnic minorities live in
compact communities, are economically underdeveloped due to
different causes, including limited traffic means. Few local
Uygurs have an awareness of a market economy due to the lack of
education, Ms Trine said.
</P>
<P>
"So, we are planning some poverty relief projects to help
improve their ability in doing business and managing money
matters," she explained.
</P>
<P>
UNDP started poverty eradication projects in China in 1994, and
has opened projects in 48 counties of 11 provinces and autonomous
regions, involving 87,000 households of 420,000 farmers, mostly
ethnic minorities.

<P>
Last year, the organization offered Xinjiang 1.8 million US
dollars in free aid, and the regional government was to provide
another 82 million yuan for the effort.
</P>
<P>
Local project offices charge very low interests of the loans in
a bid to teach farmers to do business in the process, Ms Trine
said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers receive free technical training before they are granted
such loans, and then they buy means of agricultural production
under the guidance of village and township officials.
</P>
<P>
In Abli's hometown of Hotan prefecture, 63,000 rural families
have the iron plate on their doors. In 1996, their per-capita
income was less than 600 yuan, but last year, half the families'
income rose to 650 to 700 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Hotan, on the southern edge of the Taklimakan Desert, the
world's second largest, is one of the country's most impoverished
areas, and local Uygur farmers know very little about the outside
world. But things are changing.
</P>
<P>
Not knowing a single written character, Abli learned to
understand what UNDP stands for. "The United Nations, linking up
all countries, is the right place to help solve various problems
of different ethnic groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The unique management methods adopted in implementing the
poverty relief projects have breathed new air into local efforts
to help the needy, and participating households have also set a
good example to others," said Fang Xinmin, a local official in
charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture plans to use government supporting funds to
expand the poverty relief practice to more areas.
</P>
<P>
China also uses capital from other international financial
organizations and governments to speed up its poverty relief
process.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank began in 1995 to join in China's nationwide
campaign to fight poverty. And by last year, it launched or
planned to launch poverty relief projects in 94 state-designated
poor counties, aiming to provide sufficient food and clothing for
8 million people, sources said.

<HEADLINE> 5 Ministers Sacked in Congolese Cabinet Shake-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Democratic Congolese President
Laurent Kabila sacked five ministers under probe for alleged
corruption and brought in 13 new ministers in a major cabinet
shake-up Monday, a report reaching here Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo read the new government list
on state television on behalf of President Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Ministers who have been detained pending inquiries into the
financial management of their ministries have all been fired,
Kongolo noted.
</P>
<P>
The ministers dropped include Planning Minister Etienne
Richard Mbaya, Energy Minister Lokombe Kitete, Information
Minister and Public Enterprises Minister Kambale Mututulo.
</P>
<P>
Among the 13 new ministers is Deogratias Bugera, former
Secretary-General of Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for
the Liberation of Congo whose forces helped topple Mobutu Sese
Seko. He becomes Minister of State in Charge of the Presidency.
</P>
<P>
All of the five sacked ministers are being questioned as part
of the probe into the allegations. They were taken in for
questioning since last weekend in relation to the management of
funds handled by their ministries, presidency sources said
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The directors of the state electricity, water and oil
companies were also being detained, one source added.
</P>
<P>
Kabila declared war on corruption shortly after taking power
in May 1997 following a seven-month war which toppled Mobutu who
had ruled the central African country for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Kabila has time and again warned his officials
that those abusing their positions for personal gain would be
punished.

<HEADLINE> Water Diversion Project Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China's project of diverting water
from the Yellow River, the second longest in the country, has been
proved to be a successful case in using loans from the World Bank,
a senior World Bank official said after a recent inspection tour
of the Wanjiazhai Water Control Project.
</P>
<P>
The bank is expected to grant loans to the second phase of the
Wanjiazhai project, part of the Yellow River diversion scheme, as
the bank was satisfied with the performance of loan management for
the first phase, said Daniel Gunarat Nam, chief resident expert of
the World Bank in China.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the Wanjiazhai Water Control Project, in
north China's Shanxi Province, is to diver water from the Yellow
River to Taiyuan, the provincial capital. It has cost an
investment of 12 billion yuan, of which 400 million U.S. dollars
were provided by the World Bank. The second phase will extend the
water channel from Taiyuan to Datong and Shuozhou.
</P>
<P>
During the tour, World Bank officials inspected project
progress, financial control, contract management, environmental
protection, arrangement of resettlers, performance of contractors
and other aspects in relation with the project.
</P>
<P>
They said the tripartite management mechanism of the project is
scientific and its practice of having unified management of
surface and underground water should be popularized in other parts
of the world.

TOKYO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rebounded in Tokyo
Tuesday on near across-the-board buying that helped recoup a large
part of Monday's nearly 350-point plunge.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected First Section issues
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 233.42 points or 1.52 percent
from Monday's close to finish at 15,554.45.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, gained 16.27 points or 1.36 percent to reach
1,212.97.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the major section decreased to an estimated 280
million shares from Monday's 320 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nikko Securities was Tuesday's most heavily-traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Brokerage dealers covered their oversold positions, believing
buying by public and pension funds is firmly supporting the bottom
at around 15,000 for the Nikkei, traders said.
</P>
<P>
But there was no incentive to chase higher prices as persistent
selling from institutional investors in an attempt to reduce their
cross-shareholdings remained capping the top, they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,335 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
outpaced losers 779 to 340, with 149 issues remaining unchanged.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said here Tuesday that his country had to conduct its
nuclear tests to restore the strategic balance in the region and
deter aggression.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was left with no option but to take appropriate steps
to offset the grave threat posed to its security by India's
nuclear tests and belligerent attitude on the Kashmir issue,
Sharif said while meeting visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharazi, according to official sources.

Meanwhile, Sharif laid special emphasis on the expansion of
bilateral trade and further deepening of mutual economic links

</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the situation in Afghanistan was also
discussed in detail.

The Iranian foreign minister affirmed his country's commitment
to a close Iran-Pakistan relationship as well as its readiness to
work together with Pakistan for an early end to the Afghan

peace process.

BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China's first national
high-accuracy global positioning system (GPS) network passed
assessment recently.
</P>
<P>
This marked major progress in the country's GPS application.
</P>
<P>
The nation-wide network has an error rate of one cm for every
1,000 km. It consists of five national satellite tracking
stations, 30 provincial level stations and 800 regional stations.
</P>
<P>
Wang Quan, director of the Modern Earth Surveying Institute
under the Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping, said that the
network can provide prompt and timely geographical information
about the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The GPS is an international electronic tracking system that is
supported by 24 satellites around the earth.
</P>
<P>
Feng Haiqing, general manager of the General Integrated
Technology Company under the China Great Wall Computer Group, said
that since GPS entered China at the beginning of the 1990s, China
has made big progress in research and application of the
technology.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese manufacturers of GPS equipment has
increased from few dozen to over 150.
</P>
<P>
The country has already used GPS technology in the fields of
aviation, surveying, telecommunications, transport, banking,
public security, fire fighting, emergency aid, exploration,
automobiles and defense.
</P>
<P>
A 150-million-yuan national priority project of earthquake
monitoring is under construction. The project is based on GPS
technology. It monitors the movement of earth plates around and
inside China so as to provide accurate evidence for medium- and
long-term earthquake forecast.
</P>
<P>
Li Yanxing, an official from the State Seismological Bureau,
said that the bureau conducted monitoring survey through a
regional GPS network around Beijing in the two consecutive years
of 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Results of the survey showed that earthquake activities in the
region were on the rise, which has been proved by earthquakes in
Hebei, Tangshan and Beijing recently.
</P>
<P>
Steve Smith, business development manager of Trimble Navigation
New Zealand Ltd., is among the foreign business persons attending
the China International Exhibition on GPS Equipment and
Application Technology that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese manufacturers can produce all kinds of GPS
equipment now. However, he points out that China is yet to develop
multi-frequency chips that will increase the accuracy of such
equipment by thousands of times.
</P>
<P>
He believes that China is yet to tap the huge potential market
of GPS application.

<HEADLINE> Studies of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Should Be Strengthened: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- An academician from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences has called on researchers to pay more
attention to the studies of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the
world's roof.
</P>
<P>
"The evolution and existence of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau has
a great influence on the natural environment in Asia and even the
earth, and researches on global changes will come nowhere if not
considering this fact," Li Jijun, a professor of geography
from the Lanzhou University, said at a seminar here today.
</P>
<P>
"The studies of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau will help us better
understand our ecological conditions and solve the current
environmental problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, studies in this regard has come to be a
hot-point for geo-scientists since the early 1980s, and
significant achievements are now expected.
</P>
<P>
However, the academician said, there is still a long way to
cover in order to reach the real truth.
</P>
<P>
"We have found close interconnections between the rising of the
Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the environmental evolution in China
and east Asia," Li said, adding that the Yangtze and Yellow
rivers, China's two longest rivers, were formed during the
process of the plateau's rising.
</P>
<P>
"China's western part would not be so dry, the east would not be
so wet, and the current farmland in the lower reaches of the
Yangtze River and south China would be deserts, if there were not
the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Draft More Accurate Strata Chronological Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are drafting a
chronological table that is expected to accurately tell the
geological age of earth strata.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and
Paleoanthropology attached to the Chinese Academy of Sciences have
started to make the world's first chronological table of
biological strata and magnetic strata.
</P>
<P>
Huang Xueshi and his colleagues are collecting biological
stratum samples in the Yuanqu Basin at the northern bank in north
China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Geologists said there has been so far not any authoritative
chronological table to determine the age of a stratum in research
of ancient biology and and history of geology.
</P>
<P>
They said researchers used to calculate the geological age of a
stratum based on fossils of organisms buried at the same place and
other chemical characteristics, adding the method often leads to
big errors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. scientists have been applying ancient geomagnetism in the
determination of the geological age of a stratum. However, the
method lacks fossil samples to support the calculation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists are combining the two methods to draft a
more accurate chronological table.
</P>
<P>
Yuanqu Basin is rich in fossils of ancient organisms and
clearly divided geological layers.

<HEADLINE> China's Laid-off Workers Apt to Have More Job Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- To Tang Feng, a laid-off worker from
a match factory in Jinan, capital city of east China's Shandong
Province, a career began at his 40s, when he went to settle in
Dajie Village, some 40 km from the city, to open a fish ground.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with local farmers, I'm advantageous to have market
information and expertise in fish breeding," said Tang, who
became confident after his half-year effort has transformed 40
ha. of waste waterlogged depression into 15 fish ponds where he
breeds salmon and soft-shelled turtles.
</P>
<P>
Dajie villagers have extended a welcome to Tang, saying that he
has made use of the idle land and spurring on local breeding
undertakings.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a mounting number of laid-off workers like Tang are
capitalizing on their chances in land exploration for cultivating
cash crops, vegetable and flowers of high economic value.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi
Province, the land-use right of a third of the waste land that
went through auctions held in recent years has been purchased by
laid-off workers. And at a recent auction for waste land-use right
around the city, 70 percent of the participators are factory
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
China's rural area shows a low per-capita share of arable land,
according to economists. And it is encouraging to see the inflow
of laid-off workers engaging in the exploitation of waste
mountainsides, polders and ponds.
</P>
<P>
The laid-off workers rushing to the rural sector have come
mainly from mid-sized and small cities, an official from the labor
department in Shandong Province said. Compared with those from
large cities, they have more advantages in doing farming related
jobs.

<HEADLINE> Temple Rebuilding Marks Noted Monk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A rebuilding project has started in
the Yuhua Temple of Tongchuan city in northwest China's Shaanxi
province, where Monk Xuan Zang delivered sermons 1,300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Xuan Zang is also the hero of a Chinese classic novel,
"Pilgrimage To The West", which is widely read across the country.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Yuhua Mountain of the Tongchuan City, the temple
used to be a temporary palace for Emperor Li Shimin's father of
the Tang Dynasty (618-907). It was turned into a temple in 651.
</P>
<P>
Master Xuan Zang, who was also a noted translator and traveler,
spent last four years of his life in the temple and died there in
664.
</P>
<P>
The rebuilding is expected to cost eight million yuan, and the
future temple will cover nearly two hectares and include main
halls, meditation rooms, corridors, a rostrum and a memorial
archway.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese Buddhist Association, once the project
is completed, a Buddhist theological institute and a charity
hospital are to be set up there.

<HEADLINE> 25 ADF Rebels Killed in Joint Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five rebels of the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) were killed last week in a joint army
operation launched by Uganda and the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
They were killed when fleeing the ambush which occurred some
30 kms inside the Congo border, military sources were quoted by
Tuesday's New Vision daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said: "following the hot pursuit by the two
friendly armies in the eastern Congo, Rwenzori mountains, some of
the ADF rebels are trying to cross to Ugandan border districts of
Kasese and Bundibugyo."
</P>
<P>
With the mounting pressure from the army, the heavily battered
rebels could no longer recruit, regroup or establish new
operation camps, they said.
</P>
<P>
To deny the rebels the opportunity to train some of their
victims, the two armies would meet every Friday to flush out and
wipe out the rebels and their remnants.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the joint efforts against the rebels, Nassur
Kibirige, the spokesman of the army second division stationed
along the western border, said: "we need each other in this
struggle to end this insurgency in western Uganda."
</P>
<P>
The border security pact signed between the two governments in
late April made these joint operations possible.
</P>
<P>
The western border areas are fields frequently haunted by the
ADF rebels and the remnants of the army of the former Zaire
regime. They looted villages and butched unarmed civilians,
posing a threat not only to these two countries but to their
neighbors as well.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to restore peace and rehabilitate the economy in
the northern and western districts, Ugandan President Y. Museveni
has ordered a reinforced military presence in the areas, forcing
the rebels to have a showdown with the army.

<HEADLINE> China Investigates Its Rural Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
initiated a massive investigation of the rural market in a bid to
find effective ways to expand rural demand and promote national
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the State Administration of Internal Trade said

provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions to do the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is designed to make clear the current
conditions of rural markets as well as their characteristics,
potentials and growing tendencies, and the findings will be used
to develop measures and policy proposals to promote rural markets.
</P>
<P>
The sources said market supply and demand conditions over the
past three years will be the key part of the investigation, which
mainly include the impact of market supply and demand, changes in
rural residents' incomes and their consuming ability, as well as
the characteristics and developing trends of consuming demands.
</P>
<P>
The operation of commercial enterprises will be another
important part covered by the investigation, which involves the
organizational patterns of commercial enterprises and their sales
channels and networks.
</P>
<P>
The investigation will also study the efforts made by local
governments and commercial departments in market development.

<HEADLINE> Mir's Orientation Restored, Gyrodynes Still Not Functioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The alignment of Russia's Mir space
station has been fully restored and its scheduled docking with the
U.S. space shuttle Discovery is expected to go ahead as planned,
Itar-Tass reported early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"No obstacles to the orbital station Mir's mooring with the
U.S. spacecraft Discovery now exist," a duty operator with the
Mission Control said.
</P>
<P>
However, the alignment was sustained by Mir's engines rather
than the gyrodynes that automatically keep the space station
oriented to the sun to ensure that the solar panels generate the
maximum amount of energy.
</P>
<P>
The gyrodynes stopped functioning following the crash of Mir's
main computer late Saturday. A new computer has been replaced but
ground experts and the orbiter's crew are still struggling to
revitalize the gyrodynes, which do not need fuel to operate.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. space shuttle Discovery is due to take off at 22:00
GMT Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, for her last docking
with the aging Mir.
</P>
<P>
It will bring home Andrew Thomas, the NASA astronaut who
started his space journey in January.

<HEADLINE> California Unveils Anti-Tobacco Advertisements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 1 (Xinhua) -- "Medical researchers believe
cigarettes are a leading cause of impotence," an advertisement
said. "Cigarettes. Still think they are sexy?"
</P>
<P>
This is one of the new anti-tobacco advertisements that radio
and TV stations begin airing next Monday throughout California.
</P>
<P>
Another advertisement features a man whose attempt to flirt
with a woman at a formal gala goes awry when the cigarette in his
mouth suddenly goes limp.
</P>
<P>
Such advertisements are aimed at getting through to a tough
audience, said Kim Belshe, director of the California Department
of Health Services, who believes American men care more for sex
than for health.
</P>
<P>
The concern over sex, not health, may get more men to stop
smoking, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Christopher P. Evans of the University of California
pointed to the fact that, in a Massachusetts study conducted in
1994, scientists discovered that smokers are twice as likely to be
impotent as nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
The new anti-tobacco advertisements are part of a three-year,
67.5-million-dollar campaign in California, which has the nation's
second-lowest prevalence of adult smoking -- 18.2 percent --
behind Utah.

<P>
HARARE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's several hundred students
demonstrating in Harare to press the government to hike their
payout increments have turned violent and destroyed property
worth thousands of U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman confirmed the Monday incident and said that
no arrests had been made by late Monday afternoon, the Herald
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Trouble started when the students failed to see Minister of
Higher Education and Technology Ignatius Chombo, after having
gathered at the offices for the better part of Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
After being told by ministry officials that Chombo was not
available, the students started singing revolutionary songs and
scolding government officials.
</P>
<P>
The students started pelting the police with sticks and
stones. The police then forced the students to disperse only to
reappear in small groups within the city.
</P>
<P>
The students regrouped and allegedly started destroying
property.
</P>
<P>
Several offices, including the Herald House, were stoned.
Shops along Jason Moyo Avenue at central city and several cars
were also damaged. The Chicken Inn at Construction House was
severely damaged and food was looted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry of higher education and technology has
advised students, who have been in the streets in Harare, that
their petition has been handed over to Chombo.

<HEADLINE> Leading Cotton Grower Successful in High-yield Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Remarkable results on the research
of high-yield cotton strains have been reported in the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, China's leading cotton grower.
</P>
<P>
The research program, initiated in 1995, is aimed at bringing
the cotton output of Xinjiang to 1.5 billion kilograms and raising
the country's total cotton output by 500 million kilograms in the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Through the research, Xinjiang agro-scientists have developed
two ne cotton strains highly resistant to blight which are
suitable for either growing in southern and northern Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Also as part of the efforts, the region has grown 760,000
hectares of cotton under wide-plastic sheeting, raising the per mu
(15 mu equals to one hectare) output to between 120 to 150
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have also sorted out ten high-yield,
fine-quality, and anti-decease varieties and two strains for
machine-picking. These fine breeds are expected to be widely
planted in other regions in northwest China.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Asian financial crisis is
taking a toll on southern California's 30 billion dollar tourism
industry, according to industry sources.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, only 400 out of 4,500 Indonesians who booked
vacations through American Vacations Inc. made the trip to the
United States, Ritwan Mursalim, marketing manager for American

Japan Travel Bureau, the largest seller of U.S. tours from
Asia, saw that 20 percent of its bookings to Los Angeles canceled
from October through January, said Frank Murakami, who heads the
firm's Los Angeles office.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese account for about one in every four travel dollars
spent by foreigners in California, according to Jack Kyser, chief
economist at Los Angeles County Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
"You are losing some big spenders and that will take the cream
off the market," Kyser said, adding that those who do visit may be
staying in cheaper hotels than in the past.
</P>
<P>
Many tourist-related businesses are struggling to cope.
</P>
<P>
Big hotels near Disneyland are reporting fewer bookings from
Asia, which means fewer people visiting Disneyland theme park
either.
</P>
<P>
Retailers from South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa to Rodeo Drive
in Beverly Hills are seeing a slump in sales as the number of
big-spending Japanese tourists tails off.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a year of economic chaos has created the worst
conditions in Asia in at least three decades, said some industry
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They believe businesses that depend on Asian travelers could
see a downturn of 20 percent or more this year and could still be
feeling a pinch into the next century.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is to take a package of
measures in an effort to build the country into a leading economic
and commercial center in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports Tuesday, Kuwaiti Crown Prince
and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdallah said that a bill on the
measures will be submitted to the National Assembly with a couple
of months for approval.
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of Kuwaiti dignitaries at a dinner banquet
monday, the crown prince said he was confident that by approving
and implementing the measures, Kuwait will "occupy a suitable
position" in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the set-up of a free trade zone at Shuwaikh Port,
near Kuwait City, is the first step toward converting the country
into a free trade zone. This "will be followed by many measures to
stimulate the national economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his government has instructed that procedures should be
simplified for issuing commercial licenses to allow foreign
businessmen easier access to the country.
</P>
<P>
Domestic fuel prices and public service charges are expected to
be raised to cut state budget deficit, he added. However, he
stressed that to accelerate economic reform needs "sincere
cooperation" of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the parliament's opposition to fuel price
hikes.
</P>
<P>
The parliament argued that the government should cut spending
first before making moves that aggravate the financial burden of
people with limited income.

<HEADLINE> Oil Reserves at Oil-Bearing Stratum in Qaidam Basin Determined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese oil and geological experts
say that the newly-found oil-bearing stratum in Lenghu area of
Qaidam Basin, northwest China's Qinghai Province, contains 1.7
billion tons of oil and 300 billion cu m of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
In early May, Chinese oil workers discovered the
1,727-meter-thick oil-bearing structure, which spreads over 23,000
sq km, in the northwestern part of the basin.
</P>
<P>
An official from Qinghai Petroleum Administration said Lenghu
area, with its huge oil and gas reserves, has been listed as one
of the major sites for exploration by Qinghai Oilfield.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a number of wildcats and several exploration
wells will be sunk this year in Lenghu area. So far, necessary
geological preparations have been made and prospecting workers
have started sinking wells in some areas or testing oil and gas
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Oilfield, which was founded four decades ago, has
produced more than one million tons of crude annually in seven
consecutive years. It has verified more than four billion tons of
oil reserves and 150 billion cu m of gas reserves.

<HEADLINE> Israeli El Al Airlines to Be Partly Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel will partly privatize the
state-owned airlines El Al in the near future by selling 49
percent of the company on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, local daily
Haaretz reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
El Al President Joel Feldschuh told the paper that it would be
possible to begin the process of privatization this year and
complete the sale in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The decision to sell part of El Al was made on Monday by a
ministerial privatization committee, led by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said the decision was one of the most important
privatization decisions the government has ever made.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom noted that the privatization
will increase state revenues.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, this ensures that El Al remains a
national company with 51 percent remaining in the government's
hands, and this is important from perspective of security.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The labor department in the Chinese
capital city of Beijing has launched special training of those who
wish to become "bosses".
</P>
<P>
Such courses were held using the experience of France for the
implementation of re-employment training projects. Trainees expect
to run their own businesses after being trained, said Che Zhigang,
an official from the training center under the Beijing Municipal
Labor Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Che said that related training will be carried out in three
steps:
</P>
<P>
One month will be devoted to lectures by experts and professors
who will teach trainees on industry and commerce, taxation, market
management, and related laws and regulations. Two months will be
used by experts and professors to teach trainees how to become
"bosses", and during a five-month period later on, experts and
professors will offer consultation and guidance for trainees who
are running businesses independently.
</P>
<P>
To date, the first group of trainees have started businesses of
their own after theoretical studies. Most of the businesses are in
catering and services.
</P>
<P>
Che said that the number of people who apply for the training
courses is on the rise.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Minister Slammed Public, Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Minister of Home Affairs
Dumiso Dabengwa has slammed the public, human rights activists,
and the courts for taking sides with college students following
the degeneration of Monday's demonstration into vandalism.
</P>
<P>
The minister took a swipe at the students and blamed them for
having an agenda of their own and playing to the tune of
"sponsors of violence and destabilization", the Herald reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of unruly students from Harare Polytechnic, Harare
Institute of Technology and the University of Zimbabwe have
participated in the demonstration organized by the Zimbabwe
National Students' Union, ending the relatively peaceful two-day
period and causing havoc in the city center.
</P>
<P>
Dabengwa said that police had always been uncomfortable with
student demonstrations in the city center and had only bowed down
due to pressure from both the public and the courts.
</P>
<P>
"Police have felt very uneasy about student behavior and hence
stopped them from marching into the city center," the minister
said, adding that "whenever violence erupted, police have been
blamed for igniting violence.''
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, police monitored the situation from a distance and
did not use tear gas. The students have made their point. They
want their allowances reviewed," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"And for them to embark on unprovoked violence illustrates
that they have other motives other than having their point
heard," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dabengwa added that the students had gone to the extent of
wanting to burn the national flag and had to be stopped from
doing so by police.
</P>
<P>
The students staged the two-day demonstrations in Harare to
press the ministry of higher education and technology to increase
their pay-out increments.

<HEADLINE> Bulls, Jazz to Fight again in NBA Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls and the Utah
Jazz will open their rematch in the NBA Finals at the Delta Center
of Salt Lake City on Wednesday night, with Michael Jordan and the
Bulls vying for their sixth title and Karl Malone and John
Stockton looking for their first.
</P>
<P>
The Jazz, who whitewashed Los Angeles Lakers 4-0 in the Western
Conference finals, have to overcome a 10-day layoff -- the
second-longest rest in NBA history -- before seeking a revenge for
their defeat last season.
</P>
<P>
"They're waiting, they're hungry and they feel the pain from
when we beat them last year," Jud Buechler said after the Bulls
beat the Indiana Pacers 88-83 Sunday night in Game 7 of the
Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
"We may be a little tired, but our hearts are not tired,"
Jordan said. Looking more like a marathoner stumbling across the
finish line than the soaring, Jordan wound up last night's
showdown with 28 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists.
</P>
<P>
"He's been the greatest and the playoffs have been his
showcase," Bulls coach Phi Jackson said. "This is one he won't say
is among his greatest, but it still shows the energy and emphasis
he gives this basketball team."
</P>
<P>
But the Bulls are not as overwhelming as they were in the early
1990s, or even two seasons ago when they won an unthinkable 72
games. Besides, the 35-year-old Jordan gets tired and misses shots
and commits errors he never used to.
</P>
<P>
"The ideal situation," Jordan said, "is to sweep every
series. But for a team that's trying to win for the third time
like we are, it's not uncommon to lose focus at times. We
probably came in a little cocky, and with a little swagger, but
nobody's taken anying away from us yet."
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Bulls have a little something for the Jazz, but
Utah had beaten them in both of the team's regular season
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Malone, who beat Jordan in MVP vote last season, won't have to
justify any awards this season. But he'll still be going for the
championship that has eluded him through an otherwise magnificent
13-year career.
</P>
<P>
The Jazz had the second-best home record in the league
(36-5), and their arena is one of the loudest.
</P>
<P>
Pacers coach Larry Bird said:"One time, I had eight days off
waiting for the championship, and there is no way to stay in
game shape."
</P>
<P>
The Jazz will also face problems trying to guard Jordan.
Bryon Russell and Shandon Anderson were given the task, but they
failed to do it well.
</P>
<P>
Coach Jerry Sloan decided not to double-team Jordan at the
end of Game 1 last year, and it cost him.
</P>
<P>
Jordan said:"We still have what we have and an opportunity
to maintain it."

<HEADLINE> China Turning Mt. Qomolangma into Tourist Attraction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China is turning Mt. Qomolangma,
the world's highest peak which previously attracted mountain
climbers only, into a new holy land for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Tibet Tourism Bureau said that some 7,000
tourists from worldwide visited the mountain last year, and the
number is expected to increase this year.
</P>
<P>
Usually, tourists can reach the base camp located some 5,200
meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
When this reporter visited the mountain last month, he saw that
Japanese-made land cruisers used for carring tourists scattered
near climbers' tents. Tourists were posing for pictures, or
hailing toward the peak which is several miles away from the base
camp.
</P>
<P>
The weather was not cold, and many people wore T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
The best season to make the pilgrimage is early summer
or autumn, when there are no snowfall and heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
The peak is covered by snow, like a white bear sitting
calmly. The sky is blue and stunning, and the thawing ice is
musical.
</P>
<P>
"Mt. Everest is the world's roof. That is why I've come here,"
said Nathale Stirniman, from Sweden.
</P>
<P>
"You can't imagine how beautiful the scenery is before you
arrive at the foot of the mountain," said Todd McWhirter, a
tourist from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Cao Xiaoyu, director of the Beijing Office of the Tibet
Tourism Bureau, said that China is turning the mountain into one
of the most attractive tourist sites in the world.
</P>
<P>
A natural reserve has been set up in the mountain region where
foreign-invested hotels are expected to be built, she added.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Qomolangma, the North Pole and the South Pole are
called the world's Three Poles. But only the mountain can be
reached by ordinary people, according to Cao.
</P>
<P>
"The journey to the mountain is an adventure. However, no
serious accidents have so far occurred," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the mountain and the Tibet region warmly welcome
foreign tourists, and there is no restriction on them.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that tourism industry is a key factor in
the economic development of Tibet, which is comparatively
backward.
</P>
<P>
Cao's office is a major organ in China to issue travel
permit for Tibet-bounded foreigners.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A five-member Israeli delegation
is due to leave Tuesday for Italy to participate a conference of
European Union (EU), North African and Middle East states which
will focus on economic cooperation, an Israeli newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The conference, to be held in Palermo, Sicily Wednesday, is a
follow-up of the 1994 EU-Mediterranean conference in Barcelona
attended by 15 EU member states and 11 countries on the
Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
At that conference, the participating countries held extensive
discussions on ways to improve cooperation in such fields as
culture, economics and security.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Eytan Bentsur, who
will head the delegation, was quoted by the Jerusalem Post as
saying that the conference "is not defined as a formal diplomatic
event" and thus the deadlocked Middle East peace process would not
be on its agenda.
</P>

But Syria and Lebanon are likely to "spare no effort" to bring
this issue before the participants, he said.
</P>
<P>
Libya will be the only North African state excluded from the
conference, which will be chaired by British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook, presumably due to its refusal to hand over to Britain
or United States two suspects implicated in the 1988 Lockerbie
air crash of a Pan American Airlines jet.

<HEADLINE> More Handicapped People Helped to Find Jobs in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Approximately 200,000 handicapped
people in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have
found jobs by the end of May with the aid of local governments and
various social circles.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 11,000 of them are workers of
the welfare factories, a kind of factories which enjoy
preferential treatment in terms of taxes, the supply of raw
materials, product sales and technical upgrading.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government urged enterprises and other
institutions to attach importance to protection of the disabled
people's rights to subsistence and work.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region has adopted a regulation concerning the
employment of the handicapped, which became effective on January
1, urging local enterprises and work units to employ at least 15
disabled people per thousand of their workforce.
</P>
<P>
To date, some 40,000 disabled people have been employed in
accordance with the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more local handicapped people become self-employed
with the assistance of local governments and various institutions,
according to sources from the Autonomous Regional Federation for
the Disabled. And 150,000 other handicapped people in the region's
rural areas basically have enough to eat and wear.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia has more than 960,000 disabled people, and over
half of them have working abilities.

<HEADLINE> More People Buying Apartments in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing offices of the China
Construction Bank have been crowded with people applying for home
mortgage loans these days.
</P>
<P>
A man named Cao, a worker of a local construction company,
said, "We're asked to buy public apartments before set dates. As
it's inconvenient to borrow money from relatives, we have to turn
to apply for bank housing loans."
</P>
<P>
The on-going housing reform is to change the welfare-oriented
public housing allocation system. Government departments and
state-owned enterprises are asking their employees who decide to
buy public housing to pay before the end of June. Those who do not
buy housing will have to pay higher rents later.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Zhao, a white-collar workers of a foreign company based in
Beijing, is another kind of clients of the bank. In April, he
bought a flat in Beijing's suburbs at 190,000 yuan (22,890 US
dollars), of which 120,000 yuan were bank loans with an annual
interest of 5.22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under this 10-year-loan arrangement, Mr. Zhao has to pay back
1,285 yuan every month. The loan is guaranteed by a local
insurance company for which Zhao paid 3,516 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Actually, many people have not made up their mind yet as
whether to buy or to continue to rent apartments. They go to the
bank just for consultancy.
</P>
<P>
Some low- and middle-income earners say that they can hardly
afford the 30 percent first installment for a new home. Others say
they can not pay for the over 1,000 yuan every month for a
ten-year housing loan.
</P>
<P>
At present, commercial apartments in Beijing, Shanghai, and
Guangzhou cost between 3,000 and 4,000 yuan per square meter and
in other cities around 2,000 yuan. Many people say they would
rather wait for the price to fall before deciding to buy an
apartment of their own.

<HEADLINE> All People in Ethnic Region to be Accessible to Drinking Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Government of south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region plans to provide clean water for all the
people in the region by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
By last year, the region had more than 3 million people who had
difficulties in drinking clean water. And late last year, it set
to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
By now, some 940,000 people in 28 poor counties have begun to
enjoy drinking water, through efforts of drilling wells, building
diversion works and cisterns.
</P>
<P>
Due to stony mountains and irregular rainfall throughout the
year, Guangxi has long been plagued by a lack of water. So it is
known as a place that has "many mountains, limited water sources
and farmland".
</P>
<P>
Some people used to store rainwater for drinking, said a local
official, who is in charge of local poverty relief work, adding
that a lack of water costs local people more time and money, and
as a result, affects their efforts to get prosperous.
</P>
<P>
The official warned that weak awareness of environmental
protection is at the same time worsening the situation of water
shortage.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has decided to provide 55 million yuan
to help fulfill this year's water supply plan, aiming to offer
qualified drinking water to the remaining population in 53
counties.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post
</P>
<P>
-- Defense officials Monday categorically rejected Pakistan's
charges that the Israeli Air Force had been on the verge of
striking from India its nuclear installations last week,
dismissing them as "nonsense, untrue, and completely baseless."
Pakistan had reportedly claimed that Israeli F-16s had landed in
India and were about to attack Pakistan's nuclear test sites
before the tests were conducted.
</P>
<P>
Maaretz
</P>
<P>
-- Arab countries could not reach agreement Monday on convening
a summit intended to press Israel to break the deadlock in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt are reluctant to have the summit to be held in
Damascus because they feared that Syria might call on all Arab
countries to freeze their ties with Israel. Several Arab countries
are also unwilling to attend a summit while the United States is
still mediating between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot
</P>
<P>
-- Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai departs for Cairo Tuesday
morning for a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
discuss the state of negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians and an offer for an Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Several attempts made in recent months to initiate such a
meeting have failed because of the tension in Israeli-Egyptian
relations over the deadlocked peace process.

efficiency."

In this regard, she stated, the government has started a
program with the help of the U.N. Development Program to train

<HEADLINE> Asia to Spend More on Internet Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Asian companies are expected to
spend more on Internet-intranet projects despite their economic
difficulties, said research company IDC Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand InfoTech Weekly quoted on Tuesday IDC Managing
Director Dennis Philbin as saying that while Asian companies are
cutting spending on information technology (IT), they are
increasing the portion spent on Internet-intranet projects from
6.2 percent in 1997 to 20 percent of IT spending by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Singapore-based Philbin said Asian companies have indicated to
IDC that though they need to cut costs, the threat of global
competition means they must forge better links with customers and
suppliers using Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
In response to the crisis, they will focus on doing more with
their existing computer systems instead of installing new
hardware.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan spent 50.2
billion U.S. dollars on IT, up 10 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to grow to 88.2 billion U.S. dollars by
2002, with China witnessing the highest growth.

<HEADLINE> Groundwater Level Drops in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The groundwater level of Beijing
has been dropping in recent years, causing cracks and dislocation
in some buildings.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the groundwater level was 1.6 meters
lower than that in the previous year, and 5.52 meters lower than
that in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that excessive pumping was the main cause of the
consecutive dropping of the water level, noting that the decrease
of rainfall accelerates the pumping.
</P>
<P>
Last year's rainfall was only 403 mm, 32 percent down from
the annual average of 600 mm, while the city pumped a total of
2,704 million cubic meters of groundwater, 254 million cubic
meters more than the annual average.
</P>
<P>
So far, the groundwater reserve has decreased by 2,826
million cubic meters, compared to that in 1980. As a result, the
ground level of Beijing sank at a speed of 10 to 20 mm. every year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has been long suffering from a severe water
shortage. The average water resource per capita is less than 300
cubic meters, one-eighth of the country's average.

<HEADLINE> Albania Calls for International Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government has called
on the international community to intervene to prevent a possible
bloody war at a time when thousands of ethnic Albanians are
flooding from the Serbian province of Kosovo into the northern
part of the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday, the Albanian government
attributed the new wave of refugees to the racial cleansing policy
implemented by the Belgrade authorities.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 ethnic Albanian refugees have streamed from Kosovo
into Tropoja on the northern border of Albania and the number is
on the increase, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government calls on the U.S. government, European
Union, Contact Group member states and other international
organizations to intervene effectively and immediately to stop the
ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, as the cleansing could be a forerunner
of a bloody war, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned that the dialogue between the two
conflicting sides in Kosovo may come to a premature end under the
current precarious situation.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, large-scale armed conflicts erupted in Kosovo,
inflicting casualties both on the Serbian police and the armed
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Kosovo
has decided to transport emergency supplies to the sheltering
region of refugees in northern Albania, the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Might Reach NATO Standards by 2010: Ex-U.S. Adverser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine could not "objectively" tally
with the criteria of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
until the year 2010, said former U.S. national security adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Brzezinski, who served as national security adviser from 1977
to 1981, said at a press conference here that a country seeking
NATO membership should meet four standards: stable democracy,
well-managed free market economy, efficient supervision of the
military by the civilians and freedom from border disputes.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has reached two of the four standards, Brzezinski said,
admitting that objective attainment of the standards did not
mean that Ukraine would subjectively decide to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
Leading a delegation of U.S. politicians, Brzezinski arrived
Ukraine on Friday for an eight-day tour.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, the
former U.S. national security adviser suggested the Ukrainian
parliament elect a middle-of-the-roader speaker in order to win
more support from the West and international finance organizations.
</P>
<P>
Brzezinski also told Kuchma that his visit is connected with
the United States' long-term policies towards Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he also met the Secretary of the State
Committee on Security and Defense, Vladimir Gorbulin, and Foreign
Minister Boris Tarasyuk.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Willing to Meet Indian, Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina is willing to visit New Delhi and Islamabad as soon as
possible to discuss with her Indian and Pakistani counterparts the
situation arising from the recent nuclear tests, a Foreign
Ministry official told Xinhua Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In separate letters to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Hasina said,
"Personally I would be happy to visit your great country at an
early date to discuss the situation arising out of nuclear tests
(conducted by India and Pakistan in May) and all issues of mutual
concern."
</P>
<P>
The letters were handed over to Indian and Pakistani high
commissioners in Dhaka, who were separately called to the Foreign
Ministry Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hasina was writing in reply to the letters she received from
her Indian and Pakistani counterparts separately in which they
explained their respective positions with regard to nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the imperative and priority for the countries
of the region were development and cooperation among themselves so
as to ensure a better quality of life and standard of living for
the South Asian people.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that an arms race involving nuclear weapons and
missile technology would be detrimental to these objectives and it
would also affect the atmosphere of cooperation and friendship.
</P>
<P>
"Our main concern nationally, at this point of time, is to
combat the pervasive problems of grinding poverty,
underdevelopment, disease, hunger and environmental degradation,"
she stressed in the letters.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that "every country will decide its own security
perceptions and take measures accordingly," she expressed her view
that "nuclear weapons did not enhance a country's security in the
post-Cold War and indeed, could diminish it."
</P>
<P>
There was a great realization the world over of the need for
nuclear disarmament, she added.
</P>
<P>
In her letters, the Bangladeshi prime minister also expressed
her confidence that all differences and problems could be resolved
through dialogue and discussion.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Forecasts Zero Growth for Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian tourism industry will
see a zero growth this year because of the ongoing monetary
crisis, a government official was quoted by local press Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It is practically impossible for the country's tourism sector
to record any growth this year, Director General of Tourism in the
Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture Andi Mappisammeng said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's tourism sector managed to bring in foreign exchange
of no less than 6.6 billion U.S. dollars last year, and such an
amount of foreign exchange was earned through the arrival of over
5 million foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
According to Mappisammeng, the tourism sector had experienced a
minus 15.4 percent growth rate in the first three months of this
year. As a result, foreign exchange earnings from the sector
dropped by 20.2 percent compared with that in the first three
months of last year.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that if such a situation continues until the end
of this year, the tourism sector will not even be able to record
zero growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that if the economic situation does not
improve in the coming months, it is likely that at the end of this
year the tourism sector will see a minus 15 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian tourism industry has suffered from the problems
of forest fires, economic crisis as well as unrest which shook the
capital and several other cities last month.
</P>
<P>
If things did improve in the second semester of 1998, the
sector still had the opportunity to see a brighter prospect as the
month of July is usually described as the beginning of the holiday
season, observers said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Rebels Use Women to Destabilize North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have sent a group of armed
women cadres to destabilize Jaffna Peninsula in the north of the
island nation, according to military sources here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jaffna Peninsula was recaptured from the LTTE by government
troops in May 1995 and since then the government has made efforts
to establish civilian rule in the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels however are opposed to this and are making
every effort to destabilize the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The women cadres who were sent there shot dead two soldiers at
Kondavil in the Chavakachcheri area Sunday. They had first thrown
grenades at them and later shot at them.
</P>
<P>
A subsequent search operation of the area only drew a blank.
</P>
<P>
However in another area government forces were able to
apprehend an LTTE woman cadre who with another colleague had
launched a similar attack on troops stationed at Sinnakadai near
Jaffna town.
</P>
<P>
Two more soldiers died in this incident as well while the
arrested woman cadre was injured, said the sources adding that her
colleague was shot dead by the troops.
</P>
<P>
The sources were confident that government troops would be able
to arrest more members of the group of LTTE women infiltrators
soon.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east in a war which began in
1983.

supervisors, Edgeworth said.
</P>
<P>
Besides 235 registration offices in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 35 have
been opened in Yugoslavia, and 30 in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The registration of voters is conducted by local staff, but
their work is under close scrutiny by OSCE representatives who

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Government Troops Surround Mankulam Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops were
finally able to surround the Tamil rebel-strategic Mankulam town
Monday after several days of heavy battle in their effort to
establish a supply route from north to south, a military official
here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In May 1997, over 20,000 troops set out to clear 75 kilometers
of main road through rebel-held territory to establish the supply
route in an operation code-named "Jaya Sikuru" (Certain Victory).
</P>
<P>
At the end of a year's fighting, they were able to clear only
45 kilometers and were held up at Mankulam for over two months
facing heavy resistance.
</P>
<P>
Last month, having overcome a severe manpower problem with
12,000 out of the 15,000 deserters returning in response to
amnesties, the offensive was reactivated, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The troops who commenced advancing last Wednesday, faced heavy
resistance in their progress and Sunday an army captain and 19
soldiers went missing and there had been no information about them
by Monday noon, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the troops were able to recapture Tunnukai town and
surround Mankulam town from the western, eastern and southern
flanks, he said, adding that this is considered a major blow to
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The troops claimed that they have been able to successfully cut
off supply lines to the rebels who have no alternative but flee
Mankulam town, if they do not receive supplies from outside, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Justice Minister on Possible Travel Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Justice Minister Muladi
said here Monday that his ministry is ready to impose an overseas
travel ban on former president Soeharto and his family upon the
request of the Attorney General's Office or the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"So far, the finance minister has not asked me to prevent them
from traveling abroad. But I will directly order the immigration
authorities to do so in case of a request from the finance
minister," Muladi was quoted by local press Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Attorney General Ismudjoko told reporters
here Monday that his office would not impose a travel ban on
Soeharto or any of his family members. He pointed out that his
office had received guarantees from the Soeharto family that they
would not leave the country.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto resigned from the presidency on May 21 under heavy
pressure from the people demanding for total reforms in political,
economic and legal fields.
</P>
<P>
The former president has been accused of amassing tens of
billions of U.S. dollars from corruption, collusion and numerous
shady business deals. The Indonesian Business Data Center
estimated the wealth of Soeharto and his family at 200 trillion
rupiah (about 20 billion U.S. dollars),
</P>
<P>
Asked about the list of the Soeharto family's wealth
circulating around, Muladi said it must be checked first.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he supports any investigation on the
Soeharto family's wealth, but this must go through proper
procedures. The investigation must be conducted fairly and
honestly and thus there must be a national policy on conducting
it.
</P>
<P>
The government has commenced an investigation into the personal
assets of Soeharto, along with several other ousted government
officials, Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not disclose when the investigation commenced,
nor did he disclose specific timeframe allocated to the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"The investigations are being conducted under the principle of
the presumption of innocence," Soedjono said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Attorney General Ismudjoko explained that while the
investigation was very urgent, it would take some time to complete

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Restructuring to Bring Capital Inflow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand will speed up
the process of debt restructuring to attract capital inflow into
the country, the bank's governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul has said.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank will let the debts owed by 56 troubled
financial firms go under the hammer as soon as possible so that it
can keep the debt restructuring process going.
</P>
<P>
"If we can restructure these debts, the expected amount of
foreign capital will flow into the country," said Chatu Mongol,
quoted by the Nation daily Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the new capital, in the form of joint-venture firms
such as steel or property loan management companies, is expected
to flow into Thailand during the next couple of months.
</P>
<P>
He said such inflow will help strengthen the local currency
baht and ease inflationary pressure to a certain extend.
</P>
<P>
Chatu Mongol did not disclose the amount of debts belonging to
the firms. But earlier media reports put the figure at more than 3
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Chatu Mongol said, the central bank is now
undertaking a study on debt restructuring to meet international
standards in accordance with the Office of the Currency Controller
(OCC), a supervisory department of the U.S. Federal Reserves
overlooking financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Thailand has
to go ahead with the debt restructuring and re-estimation of
collateral before mid-June.

<HEADLINE> International Car Smugglers Arrested in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian police have broken up a
well-organized international car smuggling ring, arresting 12
suspects and seizing 12 cars.
</P>
<P>
The cars were first stolen from Quebec, Canada, and then loaded
in containers, three cars in each, before being transported by sea
to Bulgaria, said an officer of the National Service for Organized
Crime Control (NSOCC).
</P>
<P>
Fake documents claimed the sealed containers were full of
fiberglass destined for a plant in Sofia.
</P>
<P>
The seizure included such brand names as Mercedes Benz, Volvo
and Nissan, each of which would cost up to 60,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The cars were sold to two dealers in Sofia, who had already
sold some of them, taking deposits of 30,000 dollars. Some cars
were destined for re-export to former Soviet republics via the
Bulgarian Black Sea port of Varna, the NSOCC said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian police also contributed to the success of the
operation by providing support to their Bulgarian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The alleged head of the criminal ring, a Bulgarian migrant in
Canada and now living in Bulgaria, was still at large. The police
have issued a national arrest warrant to bring him to justice.

<HEADLINE> China Enjoys International Balance of Payments in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The balance sheet of international
payments released Monday by the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange (SAFE) indicates that China achieved favorable balance
of payments in 1997 for a fourth year in succession.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that in 1997 both the current account and the
capital account had surplus, foreign exchange reserves rose
sharply, and payment ability further was enhanced.
</P>
<P>
In the year, the current account had a surplus of 29.72 billion
US dollars. According to international accounting standards,
China's exports totaled 182.67 billion US dollars, up 20.9 percent
from the previous year, while imports totaled 136.45 billion US
dollars, up 3.8 percent, with a surplus of 24.58 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The capital account had a surplus of 22.96 billion US
dollars. Direct investment remained the main form of foreign
capital inflow, with the net investment from overseas reaching
44.24 billion US dollars, up 10.1 percent. This shows that
overseas investors still favor China's economic prospects
despite the financial crisis in some Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
1997 also saw a big progress for China's direct fund-raising
from the international capital market, with the net inflow of
securities investment reaching 6.8 billion US dollars, up 290.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Trade surplus and capital inflow have pushed up the country's
foreign exchange reserves. By the end of 1997, China's foreign
exchange reserves had reached 139.9 billion US dollars, an
increase of 34.9 billion US dollars oover the previous year.

bilateral ties by enhancing cooperation and friendship.

<HEADLINE> More NATO Expansion May Harm Europe's Stability: Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Further expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) could threaten Europe's
stability, visiting Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Maksimovich
Primakov warned on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here that although Russia has no say
on the policies of other countries, it opposes NATO's eastward
expansion, especially toward the former Soviet Union's member
countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia enjoys good relations with NATO and is
willing to take an active part in cooperating with this
organization through various channels, Primakov noted.
</P>
<P>
On Russia's relations with Latvia, he reiterated the call for
Latvia to fully implement the proposals by Max van der Stoel, the
human rights representative of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, to normalize and develop bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Primakov welcomed Finland's proposal for Northern Dimensions
within the European Union aimed at strengthening the Nordic area's
economic cooperation with Russia and the Baltic countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the policy would help Russia get loans from
the European Investment Bank to improve transportation in
northwestern Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister arrived in Helsinki last Friday
for a three-day official visit to further develop the "model"
relations with Finland as well as cooperation with the EU, since
Finland is to serve as the EU's presidency in the second half of
1999.
</P>

Primakov had several talks with his Finnish counterpart Tarja
Halonen. He also met with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and

<HEADLINE> Thai Inflation Rate Hits 10.2 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's inflation rate in May
hit 10.2 percent compared with a rate of just 4.3 percent in the
same month last year, and 10.1 percent in April, the Bangkok Post
Tuesday quoted the Commerce Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, inflation, as measured by the
consumer price index (CPI), was running at 9.5 percent for the
first five months of this year, compared with 4.3 percent in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Prices of food and beverage items rose by 0.8 percent in May,
and non-food prices were up by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In May, prices declined in jasmine rice and fruit, but rose for
fresh vegetables, eggs, seafood, raw chicken and dairy products.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prices of some goods and services such as
electricity charges, transport fees and cooking gas remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The May inflation rate was up by 0.5 percent over April, slower
than the 0.7 percent month-on-month rise recorded in April, 1.1
percent in March, 0.7 percent in February and 1.1 percent in
January, said Vithun Tulyanond, deputy director-general of the
Business Economics Department.
</P>
<P>
Vithun also said that the country's annual inflation rate for
the year is expected to be less than 10.5 percent as projected by
the International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Negotiations Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States expressed its
deep concern on Monday about escalating violence in the Serbian
province of Kosovo and urged continuous negotiations to end the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the way to solve the problem is at the
negotiating table not the battlefield," State Department spokesman
James Rubin told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that thousands of refugees from Kosovo streamed
into neighboring Albania on Monday to escape some of the deadliest
fighting in months.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was trying to confirm the number of casualties,
reports of executions and numbers fleeing, but this was proving
difficult because authorities have closed off key areas of the
province, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
told President Bill Clinton in a meeting on Friday and Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright on Saturday he was prepared to engage
in continuous talks.
</P>
<P>
Rubin stressed the administration hoped that a political
solution can be found through such continuous discussions given
the urgency of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration, saying that it does not support
Kosovo's full independence from Serbia, upholds that the Kosovo
Albanians, which account 90 percent of the population in the
province, should be given more autonomy.

<HEADLINE> China Out of Contention Despite Win over Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BREMEN, Germany, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Defending runner-up China
edged Japan 94-93 but didn't make the quarter-finals on Monday,
the last day of the Women's World Basketball Championship second
run competition.
</P>
<P>
China won only one of five games and needed to beat Japan by at
least six points for a possible quarter-final berth.
</P>
<P>
Japan has a 2-4 record and is waiting the outcome of
Spain-Lithuania match. It could qualify if Lithuania wins late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
China opened with 22-12 and ended the first half with a 49-37
lead.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese 68-58 second half lead was erased by Japan as it
posted a 16-6 run to make it 74-all.
</P>
<P>
After six ties, Yang Li scored a three-pointer to put China
ahead 94-89 with 20 seconds left, but Japan, the 12th place
finisher four years ago, narrowed the gap with Chikako Murakami's
four straight points including two free-throws.
</P>
<P>
"We played very well in the first half, but not in the second,"
Chinese coach Ma Yuenan said. "We had poor defense and let the
Japanese score eight three-pointers at the second half."
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese gave us a lesson," Ma added.
</P>
<P>
China overcame Japan 82-65 four years ago, but was beaten both
in the 1996 Olympic Games and the Asian Championship last year.
</P>
<P>
Mikiko Hagiwara led five double-figure Japanese with a
game-high 29 points. Akemi Okazato scored 20, Takako Kato and
center Noriko Hamaguchi got 15 apeice and Chikako Murakami 14.
</P>
<P>
Center Ma Chengqing led China with 23 point and 7 rebounds,
followed by Mao Bo's 21 and Liang Xin's 20.
</P>
<P>
China will take part in the classification matches for 9-12
places starting from June 4 in Berlin.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Lift Men's Hockey World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Hosts the Netherlands had to
overcome a two-goal deficit on Monday before beating Spain to win
the men's field hockey World Cup in Utrecht.
</P>
<P>
The win was the third for the Dutch who had lifted the trophy
in the 1973 and 1990 tournaments as well.
</P>
<P>
Spain, which entered its first World Cup finals since 1971,
surprised the Olympic titlists with two field goals through Jordi
Arnau and Victor Pujol in the 18th and 55th minutes.
</P>
<P>
Dutch captain Stephan Veen pumped back some confidence into the
host side with a 58th-minute goal which helped the Dutch to find
its rhythm of play that soon materialized into the equalizer.
</P>
<P>
Bram Lomans saved the Olympic champions the humiliation to lose
on home turf to its Olympic underdogs by levelling the game in the
61st minute and forced play into the golden-goal sudden-death
overtime.
</P>
<P>
Lomans' shot off a penalty short corner just beat the reach of
Spanish goalkeeper Ramon Jufresa.
</P>
<P>
Both sides played cautiously in overtime until Teun de Nooijer
volleyed in a rebound for the match winner from keeper Jufresa who
dived to block out a shot from a penalty corner 13 minutes into
extra play.
</P>
<P>
Germany nipped Australia 1-0 earlier in the day to finish third
in the 12-team tournament while holders Pakistan defeated England
4-2 to land fifth, followed by South Korea that beat Canada with
another 4-2 scoresheet.
</P>
<P>
India downed New Zealand 1-0 to place ninth and Malaysia beat
Poland 5-4 on Sunday to wrap up the 11th position.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officials Asked to Use Plain English </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Monday announced a directive requiring bureaucrats to use plain
English and avoid jargon words in documents.
</P>
<P>
Starting October 1, officials are requested to use common,
everyday words, active, not passive voice, and short sentences,
according to the directive.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton ordered the change, which applies to all
new federal documents, other than regulations.
</P>
<P>
Federal regulations will be required to use plain English from
the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
"By using plain language, we send a clear message about what
the government is doing, what it requires and what services it
offers," Clinton wrote in announcing the initiative.
</P>
<P>
"Plain language saves the government and the private sector
time, effort and money," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Gore told a group of small business owners from around the
country, "Short is better than long. Active is better than
passive.... Clarity helps advance understanding."
</P>
<P>
Gore said that government rules that took 72 words to explain
will be chopped to around six. Unfamiliar phrases will be
simplified.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the Small Business Administration and the
Veterans Benefit Administration, which have made great progress in
rewriting their rules into plain English.
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission took the lead in cutting
jargon and convoluted language and began developing a plain
English rule several years ago with the mutual fund industry.
</P>
<P>
The commission adopted a rule in January requiring that key
sections of mutual fund prospectuses and similar financial
documents be written simply and clearly.

<HEADLINE> U.S, Bahrain Welcome Iran's "Moderate Tone" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Bahraini Emir Sheik Isa bin Salman al Khalifa Monday welcomed an
"emerging moderate tone" in recent statements by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Clinton held one-hour talks with the Bahraini leader at the
White House and they issued a joint statement, saying they
"welcomed the emerging moderate tone in Iran's statements." They
said they awaited signs of that moderation being reflected in
Iran's actions and relations with other nations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has expressed optimism about the prospect for change in
Iran since President Mohammad Khatami was elected last year and
offered to open a dialogue with the United States.
</P>
<P>
There have been several cultural and athletic exchanges,
including reciprocal visits this year by Iranian and American
wrestling teams.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also discussed with the emir of Bahrain their economic
relations and the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In their joint statement, the two leaders also called upon Iraq
to fully implement all U.N. Security Council resolutions,
"including full disclosure of its weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the U.N. resolutions on Iraqi weapons
inspections "must be enforced."
</P>
<P>
Bahrain is a key U.S. ally in the Gulf. It is home to the
Navy's 5th Fleet of 15 warships and about 1,500 U.S. service
members.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Air Force fleet of fighters, bombers and tankers that
has been on duty in Bahrain for several months is due to leave
this week. The aircraft were part of a U.S. buildup of forces in
the Gulf during a confrontation with Iraq over U.N. weapons
inspections.

<HEADLINE> Storms, Tornadoes Kill 17 People in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Powerful storms and tornadoes in
the northern Plains, upper Midwest and the Northeast of the United
States during the weekend killed at least 17 people, destroyed
hundreds of homes and businesses and shut down power for more than
1.3 million people.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, a tornado destroyed the town of Spencer,
South Dakota, killing six people and injuring some 150 others,
while three people died in Wisconsin and another three in Michigan
in storms.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, storms tore from Pennsylvania through New
England. Two men were killed in Massachusetts when a falling tree
crushed their car. One died in New York and two people were killed
in Pennsylvania in the storms, an Associated Press report said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 900,000 homes and businesses lost power in Minnesota,
Wisconsin and Michigan, with 330,000 in Pennsylvania and thousands
more blacked out in Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and
Kentucky. More than 130,000 homes in New York state were still
waiting for power restoration Monday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A tornado was attributed to the death of a teen-age girl and
the injuries of 30 others in Salisbury, Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
In Wisconsin, falling trees killed a 3-year-old boy and a man
in Wisconsin, while in Mechanicville, New York, about 15 homes
were heavily damaged by a possible tornado, and a dozen people
were injured.
</P>
<P>
There were reports of four tornadoes south of Syracuse and 18
near Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the storms to a collision between a cool,
dry air mass from Canada and hot, moist air over the northern
Plains, Midwest, and the Great Lakes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Outlines Purpose of Geneva Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Monday
that a foreign ministers meeting in Geneva due on Thursday will
discuss how to work out a concerted strategy to stop the nuclear
arms race between India and Pakistan, but not press for sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"This is not an attempt to gather support from China, France
and Russia and the United Kingdom for the draconian sanctions the
United States has imposed," State Department spokesman James Rubin
told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva meeting will be attended by the foreign ministers of
Britain, China, France, Russia, and the United States -- the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"The immediate focus of the meeting will be to consider ways to
reduce tensions between India and Pakistan and to try to avoid the
kind of provocative steps that have been taken in recent days and
weeks," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting will also examine ways... (how to) bring greater
stability and security to South Asia, including steps that can be
taken to encourage dialogue and reconciliation between India and
Pakistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to discuss ways to prompt the countries in the region
to avoid further provocative steps -- including additional missile
and nuclear tests, inflammatory rhetoric, and additional military
activity of a more conventional type," he added.
</P>
<P>
But the five countries will not invite representatives of India
and Pakistan to the meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the long term the United States wants a solution to the
problem of Kashmir, the divided mountain territory that has been
the major cause of tension, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The combination of the political tensions, including over
Kashmir, with the nuclear testing that has occurred is a volatile
combination, and... it's time to get on with resolving this
problem," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Optimistic About Russia's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Treasury official
expressed prudent optimism Monday about Russia's economy, saying
the country was on the right track with its reforms despite of the
current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Mark Medish, deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury, made
the remarks at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"I am bullish about the Russian Bear," said Medish. "I am
prudently bullish."
</P>
<P>
Russia was "basically doing the right things" to improve the
growth and vitality of its economy and had undertaken a number of
important reforms, such as privatization and legal and regulatory
changes, said Medish.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, worries about the economy and the stability of the
ruble prompted a more than 10 percent slide in the Russian stock
market.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that to restore investors' confidence,
billions of aid from international financial institutions would be
needed.
</P>
<P>
Medish described the nation as a victim of contagion from the
battered Asian economies of South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia should pay close attention to the lessons
learned from the Asian crisis, such as the need for governments to
share information with the outside world, even when the news was
bad.
</P>
<P>
Moving as quickly as possible on economic reforms would help
Russia weather the crisis by stemming growing speculation about a
currency devaluation, noted Medish.
</P>
<P>
"To use a basketball metaphor, Team Russia faces a shot clock,"
Medish said. "It needs to sink a three pointer, preferably with
some foul shots to boot."

<P>
NEW YORK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Blue-chip stocks on Wall Street
edged higher Monday, but technology shares took another plunging
as investors worried about computer industry profits due to the
delay of new Intel chip and the impact of a weak Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.42 points to 8,922.37
after retreating from an 81-point advance to within 20 points of
9,000. The Dow sank 215 points last week.
</P>
<P>
Broader indexes fell, with the technology-laden Nasdaq composite
plunging nearly 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Intel's shares tumbled nearly 5 percent following late Friday's
announcement that the chipmaker is delaying by at least six months
a powerful new microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
Dell Computer, Microsoft and Applied Materials also fell sharply
as the three most active Nasdaq issues after Intel.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite, plagued by renewed concerns about the
technology group's heavy exposure to Asian markets, has now tumbled
about 170 points, or nearly 9 percent, since setting a closing
record of 1,917.61 on April 22.
</P>

The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 0.16 to 1,090.98, and the Nasdaq
composite fell 32.06 to 1,746.81.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 536.57 million
shares as against 552.78 million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis:  Why Detained Kuanda Is Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's former President Kenneth
Kaunda, who has been detained for over five months and charged
with misprison of treason was released by the Lusaka High Court
Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 10 minutes after the opening of the trial of 82 accused
coupists, Attorney General Bovaventure Mutale declared the state
withdrew all the charges against Kaunda and Judge Japhet Banda
set him free.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, also leader of Zambia's largest opposition United
National Independent Party (UNIP), was first arrested last
December for alleged involvement in a foiled military coup last
October but transferred to house arrest several days later under
international pressure.
</P>
<P>
Investigations into Kaunda's connections with the coup has
never stopped. The police charged him with treason in January
this year but one month later formally charged him with misprison
of treason together with his security chief, accusing them of
concealing the knowledge of last October's coup plot.
</P>
<P>
However, the former president who led Zambia to independence
from Britain in 1964 and ruled the country for 27 years has been
denying the charges and insisted that he is "innocent" and always
described his arrest as a "malicious" political action against
him.
</P>
<P>
Abnormalities emerged at or out of the court Monday. The
supporters of the ruling Movement for Muti-Party Democracy (MMD)
who have usually attended such court proceedings in the past,
were absent from the scene, apparently for fear of clashing with
Kaunda's supporters.
</P>
<P>
Several prosecutors including Legal Minister Vincent Malambo
and Minister of State House Eric Silwamba who are supposed to
appear at the court were also absent from the trial, and there is
no witness to be called to testify against the accused.
</P>
<P>
All these suggested that there was a premediated backstage
deal. Some western diplomats believed that the release of Kaunda
was brokered by South African President Nelson Mandela, who used
to be Kaunda's guest in Lusaka during his struggle against South
Africa's apartheid under the white rule.
</P>
<P>
While Zambia's leading independent newspaper, The Post, quoted
Monday State House and UNIP sources as saying that President
Fredrick Chiluba has offered to release Kaunda from prison and
instruct Attorney General Bonaventure Mutale to enter a nolle
prosequi against the former head of state if he agrees to step
down from politics.
</P>
<P>
But in an interview with Xinhua immediately after Kaunda
walked to freedom, Professor Patrick Mvunga who once served as
vice-president in the Kuanda government and now a state counsel
in the defense team said that the release is a natural thing
because his client is "innocent", stressing that the state failed
to gather efficient evidence to prove Kaunda guilty.
</P>
<P>
Then what are Chiluba's considerations to Kaunda's release?
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that by this move, Chiluba can "kill two
birds with one stone." On the one hand, he can appease the
western donors and the southern African leaders that pushed him
to release Kaunda soon after the "Father of Nation" was arrested.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Chiluba may leave Kaunda alone and let him
run his course or be destroyed by some ambitious leaders in his
own party which has been bogged down in an internal fighting over
the party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, released Kaunda will not thank Chiluba who took power
from him in the 1991 general elections and was re-elected for
another five year term.
</P>
<P>
As Kuanda put it immediately after he walked freely out of the
court that he was born an "politician" and he will continue to be
a "thorn" in the side of Chiluba.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes British Newspaper Report About Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday criticized a British
newspaper report about a plan to evacuate British citizens from
Cyprus if Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles are installed
in the divided island republic.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times newspaper said in a report that London would
evacuate its citizens from Cyprus if the latter installed later
this year the missiles.
</P>
<P>
He described the report as "tendentious," saying that the aim
of the report was to pressure the Cyprus government into not
installing the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Any such pressure would bring no result, he said, adding that
Greece would fully support Cyprus in its efforts to strengthen its
defense.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greece's Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos Monday
said it was regrettable that certain countries which supposedly
wanted to contribute to the settlement of the Cyprus problem
should exert pressure on Nicosia not to install the missiles.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that if those countries really wanted positive
developments in the Cyprus problem, they should focus their
efforts in the direction of Turkey which was responsible for the
existence of a threat and destabilization.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greece's ambassador to Britain lodged
Monday a protest with the British Foreign Office over the report.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive-coup
backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
To bolster its defense, Cyprus had signed with Russia a
contract to purchase the S-300 missiles, but with the nearing of
the installation of the missiles, the tension in Cyprus has been
escalating due to Turkey's threat to stop Cyprus from doing so.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 175 Mln Dlr Stand-by Credit for Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) approved Monday a stand-by credit for Zimbabwe, authorizing
drawings of up to about 175 million U.S. dollars over the next 13
months in support of its 1998 economic program.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, about 52 million dollars is available
immediately. Subsequent disbursements, on a quarterly basis, will
be made available subject to Zimbabwe's meeting performance
targets and program reviews.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental goal of the economic program is to ensure that
the recent depreciation of the exchange rate is translated into a
substantial improvement in competitiveness. The 1998 economic
program is aimed at a reduction in the budget deficit, excluding
grants and privatization proceeds, to 5.5 percent of GDP. The
government will reduce its stock of domestic debt, which will
enable the Reserve Bank to tighten domestic credit and build up
its foreign reserves without constraining the availability of bank
credit to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The immediate task of the program is to replenish Zimbabwe's
foreign exchange reserves to at least 1.5 months of imports by the
end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe joined the IMF in September 1980. Its quota is about
349 million dollars equivalent and its current outstanding use of
the IMF's financing totals some 361 million dollars.
