<HEADLINE> Turkey Slams EU for Discriminative Attitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today accused the
European Union (EU) of taking a discriminative attitude towards
Ankara' EU membership issue.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly press briefing here, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Necati Utkan said that the EU's Luxembourg summit failed
to evaluate Turkey's application in the same framework as other
candidate countries.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-EU relationship can not gain a constructive
development unless the latter changes its stand, Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the EU to create a positive negotiation environment
which is beneficial to both sides, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit meeting, which wound up last Saturday, excluded
Turkey from the present EU enlargement process on grounds that
Turkey did not meet the standards of the European bloc.
</P>
<P>
This decision dealt a heavy blow to Turkey, which has been
making efforts for full EU membership. But so far no substantial
progress has been made due to its differences with the European
body on several issues.
</P>
<P>
Utkan said that the EU should display its virtue of not
insisting on the erroneous and harmful part that it has played so
far.
</P>
<P>
"The EU community in which Turkey will not have a place would
be one which defines and limits itself on the basis of
discrimination and intolerance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman also affirmed that Turkey will
maintain its will of seeking integration with the EU bloc
despite the position laid out at the Luxembourg summit.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said Sunday that
"the EU will never be addressed in any political negotiations,
but our bilateral relations with the EU states will continue."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Ankara can not afford to completely
freeze its ties with the EU, a major trade partner, although it
had suffered a severe setback in its membership bid.

<HEADLINE> OECD: Asia Economy Slows Down Overall in Second Half 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report said that a certain number of Asian countries,
notably Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, will inevitably
carry out economic adjustments in 1998 and 1999. But these
readjustments would tend to be less difficult than those of
Mexico, which experienced a financial crisis at the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
It said that the deficits and foreign debts in percentages of
the GDPs of Southeast Asian countries are smaller than those of
Mexico at that time, while savings still stay at high levels in
these countries.
</P>
<P>
Thailand should make the biggest economic readjustments and it
will continue to register negative economic growth in 1998, while
Malaysia and the Philippines could recover their economic growth
rhythm sooner than Thailand, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Southeast Asian countries can begin to experience
accelerated expansion principally due to improved competitiveness
of their exports following the depreciation of their currencies,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China, Singapore, Chinese Taiwan, and Hong
Kong of China will see the competitiveness of their exports
"degrade" in the face of those of the countries whose currencies
have depreciated.
</P>
<P>
The maintenance of the parity between the Hong Kong dollar and
the U.S. dollar will inevitably bring about adjustments in Hong
Kong, which will result in a slow-down of its economy in 1998
prior to a new moderate acceleration of growth in 1999, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
In China, a soft touchdown landing of the economy should
continue in 1998 and 1999, while the macro-economic policy of the
country will have a restrictive orientation, it said.
</P>
<P>
The balance of economic operations in China will remain stable
in 1998 and 1999, while inflation will be kept at a relatively low
level mainly thanks to the structural reforms and stabilization
programs, said the report.
</P>
<P>
But the acceleration of reform in the sector of state
enterprises will bring about massive lay-offs and could aggravate
the problem of unemployment in urban areas, if the creation of
jobs don't accelerate greatly in other sectors, it added.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Stock, Currency Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's stock prices and
the won currency rebounded sharply Monday as the government began
to inject funds into financial institutions, and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) showed its intention of advancing loans to the
financially-troubled country.
</P>
<P>
The leading Composite Stock Price Index rose 25.98 points to
385.80, with the trading volume and turnover went up to 79.94
million shares and 459.29 billion won (about 277.49 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Monday also saw the won rally to 1,563.9 against the dollar
around 4 p.m., compared with 1,737.6 won per dollar at Friday's
close.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the dollar hit a day's bottom since
daily permissible fluctuation was expanded from 2.25 to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea Monday announced a current account
surplus of 600 million dollars in November, the first surplus
since December 1993 when it stood at 560 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a sharp drop in imports resulting from the falling
won against the dollar, South Korea's current account balance
shifted from a deficit of 680 million dollars in October to a
surplus of 600 million dollars in November, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts here believe that the worst is over for South
Korea's financial crisis and the country's financial market has
begun to regain stability.

<P>
ABU DHABI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- France today clinched a
two-billion-dollar-worth military deal with the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) on exporting 35 Mirage 9-2000s in the coming three
years, French President Jacques Chirac announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, the visiting
French president said the contract was signed here today and
France will provide 35 Mirage 9-2000s, a new generation of the
Mirage 5-2000s, to the UAE air force from 1998 to 2001.
</P>
<P>
The warplane deal is worth some 2 billion U.S. dollars, Chirac
said.
</P>
<P>
He gave no further details, but an informed source close to
the French Embassy here said that the deal is part of an ambitious
warplane-purchase package by the UAE.

To beef up its air forces, the UAE now is busy conducting
negotiations with U.S. and French aircraft makers on buying 80
combat planes.
</P>

Chirac disclosed that besides the Mirage deal, his country is
also in talks with Abu Dhabi on exporting Raffle, another
France-made fighter and said the two sides' "cooperation" in this
matter is "considerable."

relationship with the UAE and hoped the two countries will further
develop such relationship to set up "true partnership."

France signed with the tiny Gulf country a defense agreement in
1995 to boost military cooperation. Chirac said that during his
visit, the two countries have agreed to "make amendments" to the
agreement, but he gave no details.
</P>
<P>

PARIS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The French government decided
Tuesday to build the central region of the Massif Central into a
model of good territorial planning with projects of lasting
development in industry, transport and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Environment and Territorial Planning, Dominique

<HEADLINE> More Forest Caught Fires in 1997: WWF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- More forest burned down across
the world in 1997 than at any other time in recorded history, the
World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said here today.
</P>
<P>
"1997 will be remembered as the year the world caught fire",
said Jean-Paul Jeanrenaud, head of the Forest program of WWF, at a
press conference on WWF's new report of world forest fires.
</P>
<P>
The report, which is released today, states that fires in
Indonesia and Brazil alone have already burned five million
hectares of forests and other land, an area greater than
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
WWF is currently carrying out a study to assess the economic
impacts of Indonesia's fires. Preliminary estimates put the costs
at over 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
New figures also show that in Brazil, forest fires have
increased by more than 50 percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although the fires in Indonesia grabbed the headlines, largely
unreported forest fires have raged on every continent, said
Jean-Paul Jeanrenaud.
</P>
<P>
According to WWF's report, large-scale fires also destroyed
vast areas in countries which include Papua New Guinea, Russia,
Colombia, Peru, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Congo and Australia.
</P>
<P>
As the latest country hit by forest fires, Australia in
December has reported 400 fires raging along its east coast.
</P>
<P>
After examining the causes of the fires, the report reveals
that majority of them are started deliberately and often
illegally, either to clear land for planting, to cover up illegal
logging or to open land for development.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been worsened in some countries by the El
Nino weather event, which has caused prolonged drought, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> New License Plate to Help Prevent Bicycle Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- With a casual glance, police
could spot a possible stolen bicycle among thousands rushing by
him.
</P>
<P>
This will become a reality in China, home to 450 million
bicycles, if a new license plate is widely adopted by March 1,
1998.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police say the new license plate has a detachable
middle part which can be taken with the owner. The middle part
must be replaced, police say, or the rider might be mistakenly
treated as a thief.
</P>
<P>
Cui Ziqiu, deputy director of the Public Order Department of
the Ministry of Public Security, revealed here today that "police
authorities regard the new license plate as a new weapon in its
crackdown against bicycle thefts."
</P>
<P>
He said that "the widespread adoption of the new plate is a
prerequisite for the scientific and standardized management of
bicycles."
</P>
<P>
The deputy director explained that the plate should be
prominently fixed on the front part of the bicycle, so traffic
police can spot possible thieves.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security has issued a notice that, in
addition to experimental regions, most Chinese cities plan to
begin the practice on March 1. Beginning then, all bicycle owners
are required to equip their bikes with this kind of license plate.
</P>
<P>
After June 1, 1999, bicycles without a proper plate cannot be
ridden in urban areas across the country, the notice says.
</P>
<P>
Cui says the experimental regions have shown that the adoption
of the new plate is effective in combating bicycle thefts.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Germany, Ukraine to Expand Defense Technology Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany and Ukraine signed a
framework accord Tuesday aimed at intensifying bilateral
cooperation in defense technology.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Bonn during a meeting between
visiting Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksandr Kusmuk and his
German counterpart, Volker Ruehe.
</P>
<P>
The first concrete step to implement the agreement could be
possible cooperation by the European Airbus Industry consortium,
Ukraine and Russia to jointly develop and manufacture a large
military transport aircraft, dubbed the Future Transport Aircraft,
the German defense ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The first feasibility talks on the project would be held within
the next few days, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Kusmuk also briefed Ruehe on Ukraine's plan to cut its armed
forces from 386,000 to 350,000 by the year 2005. They also agreed
to continue the existing cooperation between the two armed
forces. Germany was expected to invite 20 Ukrainian officers for
military training in Germany next year.

<HEADLINE>   France Stresses Need to Keep NATO Force in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- France today stressed the need
to keep a NATO military force in Bosnia after the departure of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's Stabilization Force in June
1998.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said at the NATO foreign
ministers' meeting in Brussels that the implementation of the
Dayton peace agreements calls for the presence of a NATO force in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new force in Bosnia should take up several
tasks, including the dissuasion of any inclination toward the
resurgence of violence, ensuring the surveillance of some very
sensitive zones such as Mostar and Brcko, controlling the
activities of the military forces of all sides and supporting the
civilian part of the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
The NATO foreign ministers today launched a plan in Brussels on
the sending of a new follow-up force to Bosnia after the
expiration of the mission of the Stabilization Force (SFOR), said
reports from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The new force should consist of European and American forces
sharing tasks and risks in the field, said Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
The NATO asked the military officers of its member countries to
work on four options presented by the United States on the new
force and submit a report by mid-January for final approval.
</P>
<P>
The options are: a total withdrawal of SFOR, a mission of
dissuasion on a reduced scale by SFOR to be enforced by the NATO
soldiers serving in SFOR in the field, a mission of dissuasion to
be reinforced with additional forces from NATO, and maintenance of
the equivalant of the SFOR force, which consist of 30,000
soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Conference Discusses Henan Province's Investment Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A conference attended by more
than 100 representatives from 88 Beijing-based foreign financial
institutions and central China's Henan provincial government was
held here today.
</P>
<P>
The conference, jointly sponsored by Henan Provincial
government and the Foreign Banks Association (FBA) in Beijing, is
aimed at opening more channels to pool capital for Henan's
economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yuan, vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, said in
a letter to the conference that the Chinese government has decided
to accelerate development in the central and western areas and to
encourage investments to those areas from home and abroad. China
has also decided to allocate more than 60 percent of the loans
from foreign banks and governments to its central and western
areas, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Dominique Casier, FBA chairman and chief representative of the
Beijing Office of the General Bank of Belgium, told the conference

<HEADLINE> State Councillor: Modernization Requires Skilled Personnel (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today that the key to the success of China's modernization
drive is fostering a large number of highly competent skilled
workers.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Li Guixian made the remarks at the opening
ceremony of a national conference organized by the Ministry of
Personnel.
</P>
<P>
"Skilled personnel is a resource of utmost importance to
economic growth and social progress," Li said. "Whether we can
foster a large number of high-quality laborers and specialists and
bring our advantage of a huge human resource into full play will
decide our country's destiny in the next century."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1995 China had a population
of 44.65 million people who either received education in at least
a technical secondary school or possessed a primary professional
title.
</P>
<P>
Among those people categorized as "skilled personnel" according
to Chinese standards, only 8.85 million had senior or intermediate
professional titles.
</P>
<P>
"At present, there remains a serious shortage of skilled
personnel in our country," Li said. "And due to an imbalance of
personnel distribution in different sectors and regions, a large
portion of our limited resource of skilled personnel has been
wasted."

<P>
He noted that a common complaint of enterprises across the
country is the difficulty of finding managerial personnel who are
highly competent in product development, new technology
applications, business operations and international trade.
</P>
<P>
Li suggested that developing China's skilled personnel
resources should focus on reforming the personnel management
system in the enterprises and social institutions which employ
most of the well-educated people.
</P>
<P>
He also urged leading officials of various departments to be
far-sighted and update their concept of investment by "spending
more money and making greater effort to foster skilled personnel".
</P>
<P>
Stressing the fundamental role a job market can play in the
distribution of skilled workers, Li said that personnel
departments at all levels should help develop special job markets
and create a series of relevant systems that cover personnel
proxy, skilled-personnel appraisal and arbitration of disputes.
</P>
<P>
Citing Shanghai's success, he suggested that job markets across
the country make full use of the modern information industry.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest city, this year connected the local
skilled personnel job market with the Internet. The market
received some 80,000 domestic and overseas visitors on the Net in
August alone.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese are becoming more
enthusiastic about investing, something that has been helped by
the prospect of good returns as the country moves to put more free
capital into its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
A recent report on urban investment by the Beijing Lingdian
(Zero) Survey Company shows that China is entering a period of
public investment.
</P>
<P>
Of the residents in five cities surveyed, 69.5 percent have
savings deposits, 20.9 percent invest in bonds, 20.8 percent buy
securities, and 12.3 percent invest in life insurance or other
social security systems. Others prefer collecting curiosities or
direct investment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The market economy has considerably expanded investment areas
for people at large and, more importantly, urbanites have large
amounts of extra money to invest.
</P>
<P>
By the first half of this year, savings deposits in China's
banks totaled more than 7.5 trillion yuan. Of that total, 4.2
trillion was from urban residents who still had 600 billion yuan
in cash on hand as well as 30 billion U.S. dollars in banks,
according to the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 23, China's central bank reduced interest rates on
loans and savings deposits for the third time since last year. An
increasing number of urbanites have begun to withdraw their money
from banks and have turned to other high-paying investment
areas.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF: Poor Nutrition Threatens Health of World's Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Malnutrition contributes to
the death of nearly seven million children in the world each year,
more than deaths from any infectious disease, war or natural
disaster, according to a report released here today by the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
When it does not kill, malnutrition can leave victims maimed,
intellectually impaired and suffering from a weakened immune
system, according to the 1998 State of the World's Children Report
of UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
The overall number of malnourished children is on the rise,
despite reductions in malnutrition in some parts of the world,
said UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, among the 12 million children 5 years old
and younger in developing countries who died of some avoidable
causes, half are related to malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
In China, poor sanitation and improper breast-feeding practices
result in the deaths of thousands of newborns each year. A report
on the state of Chinese children in the 1990s shows that 15.8
percent of the country's children under 5 suffered from middle and
high levels of malnutrition. In poor areas, more girls suffer from
malnutrition than boys, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Micronutrient deficiencies such as iodine disorders and iron
deficiency anemia exist broadly in China, said Keshab B. Mathema,
UNICEF's area representative for China and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Unless the Chinese government takes appropriate remedial
measures, the economic impact of poor nutrition will still be
considerable for China in terms of lost productivity and higher
health care expenses for illnesses related to malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
"Good nutrition is not just a matter of adequate food," said
Bellamy. "It requires nutritious food, good health care and
appropriate care of pregnant women and children."
</P>
<P>
Undernourished women who become pregnant give birth to children
who are also malnourished and whose ability to contribute to
society is diminished, she said.
</P>
<P>
She urged governments in poor and rich countries to support
actions to combat malnutrition, and warned that the price of
inaction is high -- malnutrition will harm millions of children's
health.

<P>
Private investors have also been looking for better investment
opportunities in recent years. In 1993, foreign exchange
transactions were opened to individuals. Now nine foreign
currencies are available to investors. By the end of June, China's
Bank of Communications Shanghai Branch had had 160 million
U.S. dollars of personal sales and purchases of foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Banks also are making a new effort to provide more service
choices. Last year, the Bank of China's Shenzhen Branch set up the
country's first "private money management center." By opening an
account at the bank, the investor can rely on the center for
personal savings deposits, foreign exchange transactions,
securities purchases and sales.
</P>
<P>
In May, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank opened a personal
finance department to introduce new services for individual
financial transactions, and to provide advice to increase the
value of private assets.
</P>
<P>
China's economic restructuring, the commercialization of banks
and the establishment of modern enterprise system require a
greater influx of public funds. This also has increased investment
channels for personal investors.
</P>
<P>
However, the foundation for increased personal investment lies
in the fact that 40 percent of the country's annual wealth is
saved in banks, said Mao Yushi, director of Beijing's Tianze
Economic Research Institute.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Development Zones Boost China's Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China's high-technology
development zones' total income will reach 500 billion yuan (60
billion U.S. dollars) by 2000, said Xu Guanhua, vice-minister of
the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC).
</P>
<P>
Xu said at a news conference here today that China's high-tech
development zones, similar to science parks in foreign countries,
are playing an increasingly important role in turning technologies
into a productive force. These zones introduce foreign capital and
advanced technologies, develop new industries and reform
traditional industries.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will focus on the development of products
with national intellectual property rights and encourage the
high-tech industries to enter the world market.
</P>
<P>
Since the country's first national high-tech development zone
was established in Beijing in 1988, 53 have mushroomed in 29
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
This August, the State Council approved Beijing, Suzhou, Hefei
and Xi'an to be China's first science parks open to members of
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the total technological, industrial and
trade income of the high-tech development zones increased to 230
billion yuan (27.7 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, 26 times greater
than 1991. And the zones earned foreign exchange of 4.3 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, a 36-fold increase over five years ago.
</P>
<P>
So far, 405 high-tech enterprises in the zones have exceeded
100 million yuan each in total output value. And 42 large
enterprises and groups have surpassed 1 billion yuan each in total
output value. They include Founder Group, Legend Computer Group,
Stone Corp., Qingdao Haier Group, Sichuan Changhong Group.

<HEADLINE> China's Poverty-Relief Efforts Need Int'l Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- State Councilor Chen Junsheng
today stressed the importance of cooperation with the
international donors, such as the World Bank, to carry out China's
poverty-relief programs.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by the state councilor, who is also Head
of the State Council Leading Group on Poverty-Eradication and
Development, at the Second China-World Bank Poverty-Relief
Projects, which was closed today in Yinchuan, capital of the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that China should learn scientific methods and
successful experience from international groups in
poverty-elimination, so as to enhance the ability of local people
and officials in dealing with the issue.
</P>
<P>
He praised poverty-elimination programs launched by the World
Bank, which are focused on helping poor families get enough food
and wears while promoting the social and economic development in
poverty-stricken areas as a whole.
</P>
<P>
According to the state councilor, in 1993, China started to use
loans from the World Bank for its poverty-eradication programs.
Since then, the programs cover 94 poor counties in nine provinces
and ethnic autonomous regions. When the programs are completed, a
total population of eight million will have enough food and
clothing.

<HEADLINE> Hang Seng Index To Trace More Red Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Two more China-affiliated
companies, whose shares are known as red chips, will be included
as the constituent stocks of the Hang Seng Index, which tracks the
performance of 33 blue chips listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom (HK) Ltd and Shanghai Industrial Holdings Ltd,
will be added to the Hang Seng Index with effect from January 27,
1998, replacing Shun Tak Holdings Ltd and South China Morning Post
(Holdings) Ltd, the HSI Services Limited, the compiler of the
Index, announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle would increase the market capitalization coverage
of the Index from 65.9 percent to 71.1 percent as calculated at
November 28 this year, and likewise, raise the turnover coverage
from 47.7 percent to 57 percent for the month of November.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Wong, chairman of the HSI Services Limited, said
today:" With a market capitalization coverage of about 70 percent,
the Hang Seng Index is able to achieve its prime objective of
reflecting the performance of the Hong Kong stock market through a
sample of large capitalization and liquid stocks."
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index usually covers 70 percent of the total
market capitalization, but the proportion has recently dropped to
around 65 percent. The turnover coverage of the Index, usually at
60 percent, also fell to a historic low of 24 percent in August
and rebounded to 47 percent in late November.
</P>
<P>
Wong noted:" The emergence of the red chips and H shares has
led to a structural change in the Hong Kong stock market. The
importance of the red chips and H shares will continue to grow and
cannot be neglected."
</P>
<P>
When the reshuffle takes place in January 1998, there will be
five China-affiliated companies being constituent stocks of the
Hang Seng Index. The other three are CITIC Pacific Ltd, Guangdong
Investment Ltd, and China Resources Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Based on a recent in-depth review, Wong said that there would
be no change to the number of 33 constituent stocks of the Hang
Seng Index.
</P>
<P>
"Being a market capitalization weighted index, the number of
constituent stocks is not the key factor in determining the Hang
Seng Index's ability to accurately track the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
The HSI Services Limited also revised its selection criteria
for new constituent stocks, which will no longer be required to
have a substantial business presence in Hong Kong and a listing
history of 24 months. "But they should not be a foreign company as
defined by the SEHK," Wong added.
</P>
<P>
The HSI Services Limited announced today that the new Hang Seng
100 Index will be launched in April 1998, which will cover the top
100 companies in terms of both market capitalization and turnover
on the SEHK.
</P>
<P>
The existing Hang Seng Midcap 50 Index, which was launched in
July 1995 to track the performance of middle capitalization
companies, will be restructured next April to mirror the
performance of the 50 stocks ranked from 101 to 150 in terms of
market capitalization and turnover.
</P>
<P>
HSI Services Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hang Seng
Bank, compiles and manages a series of indices, with the Hang Seng
Index as the key barometer of the Hong Kong economy.

<HEADLINE> Mass AIDS Tests for British Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Mass AIDS tests are being
carried out on soldiers at the Catterick base, Britain's largest
army base.
</P>
<P>
The tests are being undertaken following fears that two local
women have been deliberately infecting soldiers with HIV virus,
said army sources at the base in Yorkshire, northern England.
</P>
<P>
A memo had been circulated at the base, strongly advising
soldiers who had had casual sex with local women to seek medical
advice, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The memo said army officers had received confidential advice
that at least two women in the Catterick area have contracted the
AIDS virus and are HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
"The same females are believed to be liberal with their
affections, particularly to soldiers," it added.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 soldiers had sought medical advice in the past
week, local press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The garrison normally houses 5,500 military personnel but many
of the troops are currently serving in Bosnia and Northern
Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Floating Oil Pier Handles Over 10 Million Tons of Crude Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A 250,000-ton floating oil
pier in south China's Guangdong Province, the first of its kind in
the country, has handled more than 10 million tons of crude oil
after three years of operation.
</P>
<P>
The floating pier has helped the Maoming Petrochemical Company
build up the country's first 10-million-ton oil refinery.
</P>
<P>
The construction and operation of the pier have helped save
more than 300 million yuan in expenditures compared with the
traditional fixed wharfs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
At a cost of more than 600 million yuan, the pier was jointly
built in 1994 by the Maoming Petrochemical Company and a petroleum
company from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The pier has so far accommodated 65 super-tankers from a number
of countries in West Asia.

KUALA LUMPUR, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen said here today that China would not devaluate its
currency, the renminbi, nor is it necessary to do so to enhance
the competitiveness of its exports.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also foreign minister, told reporters that China
would take other measures to increase the competitiveness of its
products and to attract foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that to maintain the stability of China's
currency is helpful to Southeast Asian nations' efforts to
overcome the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
China's participation in the aid program for some countries
within the framework of the International Monetary Fund indicated
that China is willing to help some countries tide over the
difficulties brought about by the financial turmoil, Qian noted.

<P>
SHANGHAI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Experts attending a seminar
in Shanghai proposed new initiatives for developing the Yangtze
River Economic Belt through financial, transportation and trade
incentives.
</P>
<P>
The area covers seven provinces -- Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan,
Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang -- and the municipalities of
Shanghai and Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The area plays a big role in the country's economic development
due to its advantages in geography, natural resources, industrial
layout, human resources, market, transportation and policy, the
experts said.
</P>
<P>
This is the right time to accelerate growth as the river links
the developed eastern part of the country and the underdeveloped
western region, they said.
</P>
<P>
The experts said the capacity of the Yangtze River as a
major shipping channel should be further explored, while railways
and highways should be built along the river from Shanghai to
Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The building of Shanghai into an international shipping center
should also be expedited, they said.

<HEADLINE> Bird Flu Not Epidemic in Hong Kong: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The bird flu in Hong Kong,
which has killed two people, has not become an epidemic, a local
senior health official said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here, Director of the Health
Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
Margaret Chan said that the SAR government would take "a number of
 preventive measures to protect public health."
</P>
<P>
"The present cluster of cases detected in Hong Kong has not
reached epidemic proportions," she said. "The efficiency of
transmission from human to human should not be high or there
should be hundreds and thousands of such cases in the SAR by now,
according to past experience with other types of influenza," she
added.
</P>
<P>
However, "the transmission of the virus both from bird to human
and human to human is possible," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
She stated that the SAR health authority has been working very
closely with the World Health Organization and the Centers for
Diseases Control in the United States in dealing with the
investigation and study of this new strain of influenza A H5N1
virus.
</P>
<P>
For the public, she advised that the best way to combat
influenza infection is to build up body resistance by having a
proper diet with adequate exercise and rest.
</P>
<P>
"Good ventilation should be maintained," she said, urging the
public to maintain good personal hygiene.
</P>
<P>
Chan told reporters that initial assessment made by a Special
Working Group on Influenza A H5N1 noted an association with
poultry in some of the cases under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The inter-department Special Working Group was set up yesterday
to coordinate efforts toward the prevention and control of the
spread of the mysterious bird flu after three more people were
suspected last week of having been infected with the H5NI virus,
bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven.
</P>
<P>
A 5-year-old child died in May in the first known case of a
human contracting the virus. A 54-year-old succumbed to the virus
early this month, but a 2-year-old boy recovered after
hospitalization in November.
</P>
<P>
Three more people remain hospitalized for the illness.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, two more cases were classified as "suspected" by the
Department of Health, increasing to nine the total number of H5N1
cases in human, Chan said.

<HEADLINE> Most Guangzhou Workers Take Part-time Vocational Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A recent sample survey
showed that over 60 percent of Guangzhou's workers take vocational
courses in their spare time.
</P>
<P>
With the reform of employment, more and more workers in the
southern coastal city have changed their concept of "life-long
employment" -- a practice in the past planned economy. China is
now practicing a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Workers organized book-reading societies, knowledge
competition and symposiums for themselves.
</P>
<P>
In addition, concerned governmental departments supported
various vocational courses for in-service workers and
layoffs. More than 20,000 laid-off workers, who are about 45 years
old, have had the opportunity to learn more skills and found new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The city's young workers also favor self-study programs to
improve their educational level.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in a period between January and October,
educational expenditure for each worker averaged nearly 400 yuan
(about 48 US dollars), increasing by 16 percent over the same 1996
period.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF: Malnutrition the Major Cause of Child Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Malnutrition leads to the
deaths of nearly seven million children a year, more than any
infectious disease, war or natural disaster, says a report
released here today by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
Where it does not kill, malnutrition can leave victims
physically maimed, intellectually impaired and suffering from the
consequences of a weakened immune systems, said the report called
the "1998 State of the World's Children Report".
</P>
<P>
While there have been dramatic reductions in malnutrition in
some parts of the world, the report said, the overall number of
malnourished children is rising.
</P>
<P>
No less than half of all children under the age of five in
South Asia, and one-third of those in sub-Saharan Africa, as well
as millions of children in industrialized countries, are
malnourished.
</P>
<P>
Starvation of the kind arising from famines, war and other
catastrophes, although much covered by world media, is responsible
for only a tiny part of the worldwide nutrition crisis, the report
points out.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that deaths from diarrhoea can be reduced by 35 to
40 percent if children are given vitamin A supplements.
</P>
<P>
Other research shows that vitamin A could halve the number of
deaths among children suffering from measles. Vitamin A, is found
in such foods as eggs, butter, whole milk and liver.
</P>
<P>
Supplements of vitamin A and zinc may boost children's
resistance to malaria, which currently kills 600,000 young
children each year. Moreover, zinc supplements seem to have a
remarkable effect in reducing the toll of diarrhoea and pneumonia
cases in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the lives of at least 300,000 young children were
saved by vitamin A supplement programs in developing countries,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Over 35 countries now routinely provide vitamin A supplements
with immunizations or as part of health campaigns. UNICEF
estimates that more than half of all young children, in countries
where vitamin A deficiency is known to be common, received vitamin
A capsules in 1996, compared to about one-third in 1994.

<HEADLINE> ANC National Conference Opens in Mafikeng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAFIKENG, South Africa, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The 50th
National Conference of South Africa's ruling African National
Congress opened today in sweltering heat in Mafikeng, capital of
North-West Province.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, outgoing ANC President Nelson Mandela
defended his party's policy and fought back at criticisms of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
He listed the achievements of his government in the three and
half years since 1994, saying that the oppressed majority now
have access to houses, water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
He attacked the media and opposition parties' criticisms of
the ANC's failure to fulfill some of its election promises in
1994.
</P>
<P>
"We have succeeded to maintain the unity and territorial
integrity of the country, having guaranteed against any serious
tendency towards Balkanization," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
He said his country marched out of international isolation
after the 1994 election and South Africa's relations with the
rest of the world were developing well.
</P>
<P>
"During the period, we have also succeeded to resolve such
difficult problems in our international affairs as our relations
with the People's Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
Mandela declared last year that his country would sever ties
with Taiwan and recognize the People's Republic of China. The two
countries are expected to establish diplomatic relations by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela also noted his country's contribution
to the settlement of conflicts on the African continent and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
Mandela counter-attacked the media and opposition on the
question of crime. He said: "The propaganda the government and
police are doing nothing is entirely without substance."
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated firmly that his government would not
reintroduce the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The five-day gathering of more than 3,000 delegates from the
country's all nine provinces is expected to go down in ANC's
75-year history as one of the most important conferences.
</P>
<P>
Crucial policies, such as the macro-economic strategy, are
expected to be discussed and designed to take the ANC to the 1999
general election and the country to the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki is to step
into Mandela's shoes as party chief and in 1999, he is expected
to become the second black president of the country.
</P>
<P>
ANC National Chairman Jacob Zuma is the only candidate to be
Mbeki's deputy although he faces challenge from Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Madikizela-Mandela was not among the list of nominations for
the top six positions of the ANC, but she still has a chance to
vie for the powerful post through direct nominations from the
floor.
</P>
<P>
The post of the new ANC secretary-general is expected to go to
Kgalema Motlanthe, currently general secretary of the National
Union of Mineworkers.

<HEADLINE> 1997 a Year of Progress, Says NATO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO) Secretary General Javier Solana Tuesday
described 1997 as a truly remarkable year in the history of the
military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the beginning of the North Atlantic Council at
foreign ministerial level, Solana said that meetings held earlier
this year had laid the foundation of an inwardly and outwardly
renewed NATO.
</P>
<P>
"The new NATO is ready to meet the challenges of the 21st
century," he said as NATO foreign ministers gathered to discuss
options for follow-on forces in Bosnia after the United Nations
mandate expires next June.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance has to make its decision before
next March 1 over follow-on forces, or on a complete withdrawal
from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda of the foreign minister meeting are NATO's
internal and external adaptations such as the new command
structure, the Combined Joint Task Force and the European Security
and Defense Identity.
</P>
<P>
Later today, NATO foreign ministers are scheduled to sign the
accession protocols of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic
before the protocols go through the ratification process in the
parliaments of the 16 NATO member states early next year.
</P>
<P>
The protocols will then be ratified by the parliaments of the
three eastern European countries prior to April 1999 when the trio
can expect to become full members of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief also described the alliance's relationship with
Russia and Ukraine as having been put on a new cooperative basis,
and the creation of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council as
providing a political framework for wide-spread partnership
activities.
</P>
<P>
The NATO foreign ministers will also meet their counterparts
from Ukraine and Russia during the two-day meeting. Such issues as
nuclear transparency and military strategy toward each other are
expected to be discussed between the former Cold War foes.

<HEADLINE> China, Philippines Satisfied With Bilateral Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen and his Philippine counterpart, Domingo Siazon, today
expressed their satisfaction with the development of the relations
between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
They shared the view that exchanges and contacts in various
fields between China and the Philippines are increasing day by day
and bilateral economic and trade cooperation maintains a good
development momentum. But there exists more potential and the two
governments should encourage enterprises of the two countries to
seek new ways for cooperation and for increasing mutual
investments, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here, the two ministers also expressed the view
that after Hong Kong returned to China, chances for cooperation
between China and the Philippines have increased.
</P>
<P>
Both Qian and Siazon are here for an informal summit of East
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
On the South China Sea issue, Siazon said that on the whole,
the area has remained peaceful since April this year and this is
conducive to the relations and the enhancement of trust between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian agreed with Siazon's view on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also exchanged views on other issues of
common concern.

<HEADLINE> Trade Unions Launch Nationwide Aid-The-Needy Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- An aid-the-needy drive was
launched here today by the All China Federation of Trade Unions
(ACFTU) to ensure that "every worker's family has a good New
Year's holiday and a good Spring Festival."
</P>
<P>
The annual drive is part of the traditional "send-warmth
project" sponsored for years by the ACFTU, which focuses on
helping needy workers.
</P>
<P>
During the months around the two holidays, said Ni Haomei,
ACFTU vice chairperson and spokeswoman, the ACFTU will send 10
teams across the country to visit some of the needy workers. The
teams also will inspect local work relating to the "send-warmth
project," including establishment of a special fund for the
project and creation of files on needy workers, most of whom have
been laid off.
</P>
<P>
About 460 city trade unions, 2,100 county ones, and 150,000
grassroots groups have set up files on needy workers, Ni said, and
the total amount of "send-warmth" funds across the country has
reached 2 billion yuan (240 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"With a growing number of state-owned enterprises plagued by
sluggish business, helping laid-off workers find new jobs has
become an increasingly important part of the 'send-warmth
project,'" said Chen Zhigang, an ACFTU official in charge of
social security for workers.
</P>
<P>
There are about 11 million laid-off workers across China,
accounting for one tenth of the total employed, according to
figures released by the ACFTU.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the fund for this year's send-warmth drive, estimated
at several million yuan, primarily will go to the areas with the
largest number of laid-off workers -- northeast, northwest and
central China.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions throughout China so far have established nearly
500 job agencies and 1,300 job training facilities.

<HEADLINE> Movie "Seven Years in Tibet" Distorts History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The movie "Seven Years
in Tibet" distorts historical events and is based on invented
stories, a Tibetan scholar said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the movie at a press conference, Dotar, a
researcher at the China Tibetology Center, said "It distorts
history and historical events and portraits an untruthful picture
of the Tibetan natural environment."
</P>
<P>
"It is really cheap stuff and full of loopholes. I'm especially
irritated by the fact that it prettifies a Nazi while vilifying
Tibetans," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The ignorance of the movie makers is shocking. They seem to
try to cheat their audience."
</P>
<P>
"Tibetans are courageous people who fought a last-ditch battle,
for instance, with the British invaders in 1904," who are quite
different from the description by the movie as cowards, Dotar said.
</P>
<P>
Tibet in the movie was a land of peace, away from turmoil of
the world. But in fact, Dotar said, Tibet in the 1940s was under
serfdom, where feudal lords who constituteed only five percent of
the population possessed 95 percent of the means of production.
</P>
<P>
"They (serfs) were even more miserable than the black slaves in
the United States before the civil war. So Tibet was at that time
not peaceful at all because the struggles between the slaves
and their lords were very fierce," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also gave some other examples in the movie which do not
comply with the facts.
</P>
<P>
The movie, which is based on the leading character's memoir,
tells a story of a Nazi Austrian mountaineer who, in the fall of
1939, escaped from a British prisoner-of-war camp to Lhasa of
Tibet. He later made friends with the young Dalai Lama and became
his English tutor. He stayed there for seven years.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda to attend ANC convention in South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambian former president
Kenneth Kaunda will attend the convention of the African National
Congress (ANC) this week at the invitation of the ruling party of
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Information and publicity secretary of the United National
Independence Party (UNIP), Bwendo Mulengela, confirmed the
invitation here today.
</P>
<P>
UNIP leader Kaunda, who had been president of the country for
27 years until 1991, was a strong backer of ANC when it fought a
prolonged fight against apartheid and an old friend of ANC
leader, president Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda went abroad on the eve of the October 28 coup attempt
in his country and has not returned from his marathon trip to
lobby for international pressure on the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambia's ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy
(MMD) has also been invited to the convention, at which Mandela
is expected to quit his post as party president as a first step

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Outlines Building Materials Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
manufacturing center, has mapped out a plan for vigorously
developing the building materials industry in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the city will advance development of
seven major building materials which will include new-type wall
materials, chemical building materials, concrete, processed glass,
and glass wool.
</P>
<P>
Local experts explained that in its efforts to expand building
materials industry, Shanghai would mainly improve economic
performance of enterprises, develop more building materials
featuring land-saving, energy- and water-efficient, recycled use
of discarded materials by way of relying on science and
technology. The city plans to raise its technology in the building
materials industry to the advanced world level.
</P>
<P>
By the year of 2000, the building materials sector of Shanghai
is expected to generate 48.4 billion yuan of output value, more
than triple the 1995 figure, and to earn 1.2 billion U.S. dollars
from exports.
</P>
<P>
The city has also decided to set aside three billion yuan for
development and production of new building materials, and set up
more large professional building materials conglomerates and
increase cooperation with overseas companies in jointly developing
new building materials in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The city will also carry out technical upgrading of small and
medium-sized enterprises in this field, shut down some
energy-consuming, inefficient and pollution-causing cement plants
and enlarge cement output by relying on application of new
technology, said local sources.

<P>
TOKYO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Nagano Organising Committee
Tuesday said a record 2,593 athletes from 67 countries and regions
are planning to compete in next February's Winter Olympics in
Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
The United States will send the largest team -- 207 athletes --
followed by host Japan with 166 and Switzerland 163.
</P>
<P>
The number of countries attending is equal to the record number
set at the Lillehammer Games four years ago.
</P>
<P>
More athletes were expected in Nagano because three new sports
were added -- women's ice hockey, curling and snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
Organisers also said the number of competitors was likely to
fall slightly as some of the athletes had yet to met minimum
qualification standards set by international sports federations.

HANGZHOU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A 17.1-km highway bridge,
China's longest, was completed today in Wenzhou, a booming coastal
city famous for its thriving private sector in east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The Wenzhou Bridge, whose construction started on December 8,
1994 and cost a total of 1.179 billion yuan (about 140 million US
dollars), spans over the Oujiang, a major river in southern
Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
With a span of 270 meters over the river, the bridge's land
parts cover an area of over 18 hectares and help link four
counties and districts of Wenzhou.
</P>
<P>
Part of a major expressway across Zhejiang that is under
construction, the bridge, if opened to traffic, will enable
vehicles going to Wenzhou to cut their journey by 45 kilometers.
They used to have to go roundabout for a downstream bridge.

<TEXT>
<P>
Professor Woo observed that, located in South China with the
base in Hong Kong, HKUST should emphasize Hong Kong's character
and build on Hong Kong's unique strength.
</P>
<P>
But the "Hong Kong" he refers to is not limited to the 235
islands and one peninsula within the confines of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). He looks farther beyond to
the Pearl River Estuary -- the "backyard" of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To get his idea across, Professor Woo pointed at a map on the
wall of his office: "The estuary can be described as an
equilateral triangle with Shenzhen, Nansha and Zhuhai at its
vertices. The triangle encloses the mouth of the Pearl River."
</P>
<P>
In a few years, a bridge spanning Shenzhen Bay to connect Hong
Kong's western "New Territories" and Shenzhen's Nanshan district
will have been constructed, and so will much-longer Lingdingyang
Bridge linking Hong Kong and Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
At that time, the estuary will resemble the San Francisco Bay
Area of the United States as a metropolis of high finance, high
technology, strong service industries, and environmental beauty.
"Let's call it Hong Kong Bay Area," he ventured.
</P>
<P>
It is in the Hong Kong Bay Area that HKUST is building its home
base, and from the area HKUST will extend its contributions to all
of China, Professor Woo said.
</P>
<P>
It has forges close cooperation with many institutions in the
inland areas. Joint labs have been produced in HKUST with the
Chinese Academy of Sciences for research in such fields as biology
and biotechnology and micro-electronics. Some 250 postgraduates
from the inland areas are studying in HKUST.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- In September 1988, Professor
Chia-Wei Woo returned from San Francisco, USA, to Hong Kong and
took up his new position as the founding president of the Hong
Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).
</P>
<P>
Giving up the presidency of a major American university, he
took up the challenge of developing a third university in Hong
Kong into a pride for the region.
</P>
<P>
Since then he has witnessed every step made by fledgling HKUST:
the building of the terraced campus on the waterfront of Clear
Water Bay, the international recruitment campaign for top-rank
faculty, the opening of HKUST in October 1991 with the first
intake of 600 students from over 10,000 applicants, and so on.
</P>
<P>
Now "it has been almost six years since the opening of HKUST,
student enrollment has reached full size of 7,000 and our faculty
is very much in place. Teaching, research and service are
advancing right on the track," said the professor of physics.
</P>
<P>
He is very satisfied with the development of the university.
The strength of a university lies in its people, whether or not it
has years-old school buildings is of no significance, he said.
</P>
<P>
To coincide with the university's marching into a consolidation
period, Hong Kong has become an increasingly important economic
center of China with its return to the embrace of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Under the new circumstances, Professor Woo is contemplating on
national and international positioning of his university.
</P>
<P>
As of its place in China, Prof. Woo is determined that HKUST
should rank among China's very top universities, this is
particularly the case in the category of research-oriented science
 and technological institutions.

<P>
Either never do it, or do it best, Professor Woo said, and he
is proud that "each of our departments is a signboard."
</P>
<P>
During the past year, HKUST chose a small number of
interdisciplinary projects and allocated some research
infrastructure money to seed each project.
</P>
<P>
The initial batch of "high impact areas" includes China
business and management, construction and structural engineering
and electronic packaging and assembly.
</P>
<P>
Others will follow: Internet technologies, magnetic materials,
linguistics, ocean science and other fields spread across the
university's four schools.
</P>
<P>
Looking at Hong Kong's tertiary education which has been
largely expanded in past several years, Professor Woo noted, money
spent in education is never an expenditure, but an investment in
the future.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the language, both English and Chinese,
capabilities of university students should be improved, their
vision be broadened and their sense of responsibility for the
community be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
He is a keen advocator of four-year system for Hong Kong's
universities, instead of the existing three-year one, to allow
future graduates a more complete education.
</P>
<P>
As students of newly-inaugurated HKSAR, they should also get a
better understanding of their country, about her history,
geography, people and latest development, and in this regard civic
education is highly in demand, Professor Woo continued.
</P>
<P>
In the fifth congregation at HKUST this November, Professor Woo
told his students: "It must sound unfamiliar to you, our Class of
1997, to be addressed as the first graduates of China's Hong Kong
University of Science and Technology."
</P>
<P>
"But stop and think for a moment. How thrilling it must be --
for each and every one of you -- to mark history in this personal
matter."
</P>
<P>
Woo was born in Shanghai, received secondary education in Hong
Kong and acquired his BS, MA and Ph.D. degrees and postdoctoral
studies in the United States. In 1983, the then 45-year-old Woo
became president of San Francisco State University, the first
Chinese-American to head a major university in the U.S.

Looking beyond China, Professor Woo is ambitious to develop
HKUST into a world-class university.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the 16-member Association of East Asian Research
Universities was formally launched, grouping HKUST in Hong Kong
and most eminent universities from the Chinese inland areas,
Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
HKUST expects to strengthen its partnership, within the
framework of the association, with top institutions in the region
which will lead the world economy well into the next century,
Professor Woo said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being one of East Asia's top research
universities, HKUST must be a world-class university situated at
the cutting edge in all academic and research and development
fields which HKUST selects as "targets of pursuit", he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
"In fields that advance and change rapidly, one's work is
either first-class or without class. No mediocrity can be
tolerated," Professor Woo spoke of his philosophy.
</P>
<P>
"A university of our size must resolve to focus. The number of
specialties must be limited so that each chosen specialty can
achieve a critical mass," he explained.
</P>
<P>
HKUST chose to establish only 19 academic Departments,
including two called Divisions, and each Department limited to no
more than a few specialties selected on the basis of stringent
criteria.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The unseasonable El Nino
rainfall has caused a loss of 25 percent of unharvested maize and
30 percent of unharvested wheat in Kenya in October and November,
according to the data issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Further significant post-harvest losses are anticipated due to
higher than usual moisture content of the harvested crop,
according to the data contained in a report.
</P>
<P>
"National long rains maize output is estimated to be 1.95
million tons as compared to 2.06 million tons in 1996 and a
1991-1996 average of 2.22 million tons," the Daily Nation
newspaper today quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The current losses follow earlier yield losses that had
resulted from two uncharacteristic dry spells in May/June and
September during the crops' critical growing stages," the report
noted.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that famine and higher food prices will be
experienced next year.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rainfalls in the short rains season this year have
also resulted in severe flooding in the northern and eastern
pastoral areas and claimed lives of human beings and livestock.

<HEADLINE> Official: Engine Failure Crashes Tajik Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A UAE aviation official
said today that initial investigations showed Monday's Tajik plane
crash near the UAE city Sharjah was caused by an engine failure.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Abdullah bin Mohammed al Thani, chairman of Sharjah's
Civil Aviation Authority told a press conference in Sharjah held
this morning that the digital flight data recorder, commonly known
as the black box and the cockpit voice recorder were recovered
hours after the accident.
</P>
<P>
Through the initial studies, Mohammed said that the crash, in
which 85 Tajik passengers and crew members were killed and one
seriously injured, was caused by an engine failure.
</P>
<P>
He gave no details. Other officials, who did not wish to be
identified, suggested the plane might have exploded in mid-air,
although there was no official confirmation of this.
</P>
<P>
The plane, with 77 passengers and 9 crew members aboard
crashed in the desert about 30 kilometers northeast of Sharjah, a
city some 200 kilometers west of the UAE capital Abu Dhabi at
16:45 local time (12:45GMT).
</P>
<P>
Police and rescue workers only found two survivors after the
crash and one of them, a woman passenger died Monday night on way
to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Another survivor, a crew member identified as Roberto Serje,
43, and believed to be the pilot, has been admitted to the Al
Qassim hospital in Sharjah. He was said to be in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said charred bodies were strewn across the site of
the crash in the deserts and the wreckage was spread over an area
of nearly 800 square meters.
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen a more horrible sight than this. Charred
bodies were lying all around amidst the wreckage including
aircraft seats," a rescue official who were called in to assist in
rescue operations told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I saw limbs and legs in some places. Some bodies were
intact," he said.
</P>
<P>
N. Ali, a worker from the Sharjah Oil Company, who was working
near the crash site, was among the first to reach the site.
</P>
<P>
"I saw the plane coming down at a fast speed before crashing
into a sand dune. I ran to the aircraft and saw the main part of
the aircraft burning while pieces of the jet were strewn across
the whole area," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Saef al Hajiri, Director General of the Civil
Aviation Authority in Sharjah told reporters today that all the
87 bodies of the victims have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
Hajiri said the plane, known as Tu-154 "disappeared from
radar screen" minutes before it was ready to land at the Sharjah
airport.
</P>
<P>
He said the plane took off from Tajik city Khodzhent, 150
kilometers south of the Tajik capital Dushanbe and it belongs to
Tajik Air Company.
</P>
<P>
Hajiri said the pilot apparently made no emergency
communication to Sharjah control tower before it crashed.
</P>
<P>
The captain of another passenger plane which was flying near
the Tajik plane saw the crash and reported it to the Sharjah
airport.
</P>
<P>
A Tajik delegation composed of government officials and
experts has arrived in the UAE today to probe into accident, he

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The administration of justice
in China has improved in the last five years, according to Ren
Jianxin, the president of the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, China's courts have settled more than 20 million
cases, 14.73 percent more each year, on average, Ren said, and Law
appeals between January and October of this year were down 9.54
percent from the same time five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Some 97 percent of cases have been finished within the time
allotted by the law, he said, explaining, "Our courts have greatly
improved their efficiency and overall quality of case-handling."
</P>
<P>
Various courts have also finished 18 million civil, economic,
maritime and administrative cases over the past five years,
involving about 850 billion yuan in property, or 102.4 billion US
dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
There has also been a reform in civil and economic trial
procedure in the court system. The Law on Judges went into effect
on July 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the five-year period, 122 courts were awarded prizes and 93
judges won awards by the Supreme People's Court, Ren said.

<HEADLINE> Markets in Central China More Mature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- After years of construction,
market places in east China's Anhui Province have grown more
mature and specialized, according to sources with the provincial
Administrative Bureau of Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Statistics by the bureau show that the province now has more
than 4,100 diversified markets, which handle trade worth 56
billion yuan (6.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the total, five markets each have an annual trade volume
exceeding one billion yuan (120 million dollars), and 48 ones each
exceeding 100 million yuan (12 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
More than 870 of the markets in the province are specialized,
which have greatly helped the development of relevant production
in localities. There are also large markets which have grown
toward potential business centers integrating services of
warehouse storage, information consultancy and catering industries.
</P>
<P>
Market development in Anhui also features rational
distribution. Agricultural and sideline product markets are close
to production bases, while most of industrial product markets are
located in cities.

<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman
Tang Guoqiang reviewed China's diplomatic work in 1997 at today's
news conference, saying that China's independent foreign policy of
peace has resulted in abundant achievements.
</P>
<P>
China's smooth resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over

</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and other Chinese
Communist Party or government officials visited more than 60
countries on five continents this year, he said, and more than 30
heads of state or government leaders visited China. This shows
that China's friendship and cooperation with the rest of the world
is deepening, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's good-neighbor relationship with
surrounding countries has improved, cooperation with other
developing countries has been consolidated and relationships with
western developed countries have been upgraded.
</P>
<P>
"China has actively participated in multilateral diplomacy and
regional coordination, played a unique and constructive role in
both international and regional affairs, and made its own

<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,500 bomb-like
devices were unearthed in the downtown area of Beijing during
construction work, according to today's "Beijing Youth Daily".
</P>
<P>
Initial analysis shows that the 20-centimeter rusty devices

recently.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan's Ruling Party Adopts Tax System Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party Tuesday adopted a package of tax system reforms
for fiscal 1998 starting next April 1, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The tax system reforms, which include 750 billion yen (about
5.7 U.S. billion dollars) in national tax and 100 billion yen
(about 76.3 million dollars) in local tax, are aimed at putting
the stalled Japanese economy back on a recovery track.
</P>
<P>
Main features of the reform include reducing the basic
corporate tax rate to a postwar low of 34.5 percent from the
current 37.5 percent, abolishing the securities trading tax in two
stages by the end of 1999, and drastically easing land-related
taxes.
</P>
<P>
The tax cuts are expected to result in an average real
corporate tax cut of 200 billion yen (about 1.5 billion dollars)
annually for fiscal years 1998 through 2003.
</P>
<P>
The proposal forces the government of Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to back away from plans to reduce the issuance of
deficit-covering bonds by 1.25 trillion yen (about 9.5 billion
dollars) annually to cut the country's fiscal deficit to three
percent or less of gross domestic product by fiscal 2003.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM: EU Membership Decision a Disappointment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem said today that the European Union's decision to reject
his nation as a candidate for EU membership is a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
During an early morning press briefing just prior to the
scheduled North Atlantic Council at foreign ministerial level, Cem
said: "The summit decision, on certain point, was unfair,
sometimes biased and sometimes with the connotation of double
standards. Sometimes it was based on exaggerated allegations."
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) at its last weekend summit in Luxembourg
decided to invite Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Slovenia and Cyprus to start accession talks early next year.
</P>
<P>
Five other nations -- Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and
Slovakia -- were put on a slower negotiating track by the
15-nation union, leaving Turkey, a 34-year applicant, completely
in the cold.
</P>
<P>
The result of the summit was disappointing for Turkey, but "It
was not an obsession for Turkey and we will not treat it as an
event that will have an impact on the course of Turkey," said the
foreign minister, adding that his nation did expect to have a
better place within the EU.
</P>
<P>
Furious over the rejection as a candidate for EU membership,
Turkey refused to continue its political dialogue with the union
by turning away an offer from EU on Sunday to take part in a
pan-European conference which the EU heads of state and government
expected to serve as a means of keeping Turkey within its
enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said the pan-European
conference, slated for next March, had lost its meaning for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But the Turkish foreign minister said at the press briefing:
"The European Union is a goal for Turkey and we will try our best
to attain that goal."
</P>
<P>
Observers here were afraid that the EU decision would sour the
relations between Turkey and other NATO member states, especially
Greece, on their disputes over the east Aegean Sea and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Turkey reached an agreement with Greece on
the military flight issue over the east Aegean Sea area which
finally moved one of the remaining obstacles for the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization to agree on its internal adaptation
for a new, streamlined command structure.
</P>
<P>
The Turkey-Greece regional dispute was started in 1957 and was
aggravated by their dispute over the island state of Cyprus.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin today described the exchange and cooperation in various
areas between China and Singapore as active and mutually
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong here, Jiang
said that in recent years, the Sino-Singapore relations have
maintained a good development trend.
</P>
<P>
Goh said the economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries is good and Singapore attaches special importance to the
cooperative projects between the two countries in the Suzhou
Industrial Park in China. He expressed the hope that the two sides
cooperate closely to solve the existing problems of the projects.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Goh, both in Malaysia to attend an informal summit of
East Asian countries, also discussed the current financial turmoil
in Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Goh noted that the difficulties faced by some ASEAN countries
have had unavoidable impacts on other ASEAN countries. He called
for efforts to actively seek ways and means to solve the problems
and hoped that China would play its role in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, "The reason behind the financial turbulence is
complex. We understand the difficulties some countries are facing.
The financial turbulence has taught us a lesson: Economic security
should cover financial security and while a country is opening up,
it needs to maintain its own rational economic structure and
coordinated development of infrastructure and manufacturing."
</P>
<P>
"We have confidence in the future of the economy in Asia,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders also gave positive assessments to the East Asian
summit which concluded here today.

<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) said in a perspective report published on Monday that the
"financial turbulences" which are shaking Southeast Asia have a
double effect, causing less economic growth and less
inflation. The growth of European Union countries risks to be
amputed by 0.3 percent in 1997 and 0.8 percent in 1998 because of
the Asia financial crisis. Meanwhile, inflation will be reduced by
0.3 percent in EU countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
-- The international terrorist Carlos, who has been appearing
since last Friday before the Assize Court of Paris for the murder
of three people in 1975 in rue Toullier in Paris, continued his
strategy of provocations by presenting himself as "international
revolutionary." The defense lawyer of Carlos decided on Monday
to withdraw from the process with the pretext that the court did
not give her the means to ensure the defense of his client.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde:
</P>
<P>
-- French experts in charge of treating drug addicts have urged
a revision of the law of December 31, 1970, which makes all drug
addicts law-breakers by imposing prison sentences and fines for
the simple use of drug whatever its nature is. They made the
appeal after attending the first national meeting on drug abuse
and addiction on December 12-13 at the State Secretariat of
Health. In 1996, some 12,000 people were condemned in the name of
the repressive anti-drug law in France.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesian Rupiah Drops to new Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah fell by
almost 16 percent Monday to a record low of 5,800 against the U.S.
dollar, and closed at 5,600 to 5,900 with thin volume.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the Indonesian currency has been the hardest
hit by the regional financial crisis which broke out following the
Thai baht's devaluation in July this year, dealers here said.
</P>
<P>
The value of the rupiah has dropped by more than 100 percent
against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Economists and analysts have attributed the drastic fall of the
rupiah to, among other things, weak regional currencies and
lingering unfounded rumors about the health of President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The currencies of the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and
Singapore as well as South Korea have all dropped in recent days
to record lows against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here believed that the main reason for the
weakness of the rupiah is fears over President Soeharto's health.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the rupiah plummeted by almost 15 percent to a new
low, crashing below 5,000 to the dollar after the government
announced that Soeharto canceled plans to attend the ASEAN
informal summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on the advice of his
doctors.
</P>
<P>
The announcement sent a chill through the country's financial
markets. The main price index on the Jakarta Stock Exchange closed
at a four-year low at 339.53 points Monday, down 118 percent from
its highest level of 740.93 points on July 7 this year.
</P>
<P>
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said the president's health
had been restored, but his doctors advised him against travelling.
The president had also canceled a planned visit to the grave of
his wife, Mme. Tien Soeharto, in Solo, Central Java, over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
"If he takes a long journey, his health will diminish and it
will take time to restore it again," Moerdiono explained.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was ordered by doctors to take a full 10-day rest
after a four-nation tour last month.
</P>
<P>
The president, 76, attended the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) leaders' informal meeting in Vancouver, Canada,
and visited Namibia, South Africa and Saudi Arabia, from November
18 to 29.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, economists and analysts here said that the rupiah
exchange rate against the greenback will improve if the government
implements economic reforms and deregulation measures consistently
and not partially or half-heartedly.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Anwar Nasution, an economics professor with
the University of Indonesia, observers have the impression that
the government is half-hearted about implementing economic reforms
or doing so only partially. This causes doubts from businessmen
and traders, he said.
</P>
<P>
In mid-October, the Indonesian government asked the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank for help and received a 23 billion U.S. dollars
bailout financial package. Other bilateral agreements were also
made available to supplement the financial package.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken several financial reform measures
since November, including the closure of 16 private banks in the
country.
</P>
<P>
World Bank country director for Indonesia Dennis De Tray on
Monday also urged the Indonesian government and the private sector
to provide credible information to help restore public confidence
in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on Indonesia's macro-economy. De Tray
said the government needed to show a strong and quick sign of its
implementation of reform measures to cope with the currency
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"The government has to deal with the crisis in a highly
efficient way by using models of global rules," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia's monetary crisis, unlike Thailand's, was
largely driven by domestic factors rather than by overseas
factors.
</P>
<P>
He believed Indonesia would be able to come out of the monetary
crisis if it stuck to the short- and long-term measures in dealing
with the monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS) Mari E. Pangestu shared De Tray's
view, saying that the monetary crisis stemmed from the lack of
confidence in the market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Umar Juoro, an economist at the Institute for
National Development Studies (INDES), linked the latest drop in
the rupiah exchange rate to the fact that the public at large has
no idea what actions the government plans to take in the wake of
the IMF deal.
</P>
<P>
"If the government is committed to economic recovery under the
IMF scheme, it should make clear quickly what areas will be
subject to economic reform, the budget or infrastructure for
example, and explain publicly what further steps are to be taken,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Opposition Slams Idea of ANC-IFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
opposition parties have slammed the idea of a merger between the
African National Congress (ANC) and the Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP), warning that such a move could lead to a one-party state.
</P>
<P>
The warning followed South African President Nelson Mandela's
remarks on Sunday that the fusion of the two parties would be a
crucial first step in bringing about unity in South Africa, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he would be very happy if Buthelezi were made
deputy president of the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Mandela appealed to the Pan Africanist
Congress, Azanian People's Organization (Azapo) and the IFP to
join the ANC.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders expressed their concerns in separate
comments about a possible merger of the two major black parties.
</P>
<P>
National Party leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk said: "It is
very important to have a strong black party, like the IFP,
staying outside of the ANC's sphere of influence."
</P>
<P>
He believed that Buthelezi would not be lured by the proposal.
</P>
<P>
"I would be very surprised if the IFP accepts the ANC
proposal," van Schalkwyk said.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party leader Tony Leon described such attempts as
dangerous to South Africa's budding democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Simply trying to give the ANC a monopoly of political power,
either by default or by design, is inherently unhealthy and a
very dangerous idea."
</P>
<P>
The ANC already had far too much power, both in the public
service and the political realm, Leon said.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Front, the PAC, the Azapo, and the United
Democratic Movement also voiced their opposition to a possible
merger.
</P>
<P>
The IFP said Monday that it had not been approached officially
by the ANC on the matter.
</P>
<P>
It said it was not considering such a move because it was busy
preparing for the 1999 general election.

<HEADLINE> 85 Killed in Tajik Aircraft Crash in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Eighty five people were
killed and one was seriously injured when a Tajik civil plane
crashed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Monday afternoon,
latest reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The plane, with 77 passengers and nine crew members on board
crashed in the desert 32 kilometers northeast of Sharjah, a UAE
city some 200 kilometers west of the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi
at 16:45 local time (12:45 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Police and rescue workers only found two survivors after the
crash and one of them, a women passenger died on the way to
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Another survivor, a crew member identified as Roberto Serje
and believed to be the pilot, has been admitted to the Al
Qassim hospital in Sharjah in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Saef al Hajiri, Director General of the Civil
Aviation Authority in Sharjah told reporters that police and
rescue workers have found 55 bodies of the victims and they are
trying to search more.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said charred bodies were strewn across the site of
the crash in the deserts and the wreckage of the aircraft was
spread over an area of nearly 800 square meters.
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen a more horrible sight than this.
Charred bodies were lying all around amidst the wreckage
including aircraft seats," a rescue official who was called in
to assist in rescue operations told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I saw limbs and legs in some places. Some bodies were
intact," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hajiri said the plane, known as Tupolev 154 "disappeared
from radascreen" minites before it was ready to land at the
Sharjah airport.
</P>
<P>
He said the plane took off from Tajik city Khodzhent, 150
kilometers south of the Tajik capital of Dushanve. All victims are
Tajik citizens, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hajiri said the pilot apparently made no emergency
communication with Sharjah control tower before it crashed.
</P>
<P>
"When we suddenly lost radio contact, we realized that
something was wrong with the plane. The crash must have taken
place a couple of minutes later," Sheikh Abdullah bin Mohammed
al Thani, President of the Civil Aviation Authority in Sharjah
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The captain of another passenger plane which was flying
near the Tajik plane saw the crash and reported it to the
Sharjah airport.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have found the digital flight data recorder,
commonly known as the black box and the cockpit voice
recorder.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed al Thani said his authority will hold a press
conference today to "explain all aspects of the accident."
</P>
<P>
A Tajik governmental delegation will arrive in the UAE today
to investigate all details of the accident, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Tu-154 Tajik airliner's crash is the second recorded
air disaster in the UAE involving passenger aircraft.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM, Iraq Fail to Agree on Access to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief arms inspector
Richard Bulter announced last night that Iraq has made its stance
clear that it would never allow U.N. weapon monitoring team to
enter its presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
Bulter, Executive Chairman of the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, made the remarks at a news conference held here
late Monday here.
</P>
<P>
"Iraqi side insisted that we would never be able to inspect
presidential sites," said Butler, stressing that the Iraqi
decision "did constitute the derogation from the (Security)
Council's insistence that UNSCOM should be able to go anywhere,
at any time."
</P>
<P>
Butler said Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, the top
negotiator on Iraqi side, told him "make it clear to the Council
that we would defend that in front of the Council."
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM chairman, who arrived in Baghdad last Friday and
held three rounds of talks with Iraqi officials, said he would
leave here Tuesday and report to the Security Council the results
of their talks this Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We had a long discussion about what would constitute a
presidential site, I was given no clear answer," said Butler,
adding that his requirement that Iraq provide UNSCOM with a list
or map of the presidential sites had been turned down by the
Iraqi side, which argued that "might help those who wish to bomb
Iraq do so more precisely."
</P>
<P>
The chairman also said that the report given by Aziz
during Sunday evening's technical talks on Iraq's biological
program was "nothing new."
</P>
<P>
However, when being asked whether his talks with Iraqi side
could be characterized as a failure, Butler said he wouldn't
readily use the word.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been some progress in technical issues
disarmament during their technical talks in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
"I have agreed in principle that we can in the future
subject the difference of opinions to technical examination
meetings," he said.
</P>
<P>
With respect to access, the two sides also made some progress
by clarity of definition, said Butler, explaining that the great
bulk of Iraq would be open, and he obtained an agreement from Iraq
that access to those sensitive sites declared by Iraq would be on
better bases than in the past.
</P>
<P>
"We'll have more people, a short period of time before we
are let in, their two are very important considerations," said
Butler.
</P>
<P>
On the question of "Iraq's unilateral decision" to say that
presidential sites will be off limits forever, Butler said
that is something he cannot deal with, and that he would
refer it to the Council for its view and judgement.
</P>
<P>
Butler said he agreed to come back to Baghdad on January
19, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: No Dialog With Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has ruled out any dialog with terrorist groups, saying "there is
no question about that."
</P>
<P>
"The state won't enter into dialog with the groups of killers
who have violated religion and the law," he told the religious
weekly Akidati on its sixth year of publication on Monday.

The Egyptian government has rejected several ceasefire
proposals by jailed militant leaders earlier this year.

<P>
But reports have sprouted up recently about secret mediation
through a journalist between the government and militant groups
after Usama Rushdie, a leader of Egypt's largest Islamic militant
group Gamaa Islamiya offered an olive branch to Cairo and proposed
the opening of negotiations last month.
</P>
<P>
The Gamaa Islamiya leadership condemned the massacre in Luxor
less than two weeks after the organization claimed responsibility
for Egypt's bloodiest terrorist attack since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The brutal slaying of 62 people in the southern tourist city of
Luxor on November 17 was carried out by six Gamaa members without
getting instructions from the leadership, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The president reaffirmed that perpetrators of brutal attacks
were not Muslims and regretted the "exaggeration by some foreign
media" in linking terrorism to Islam.
</P>
<P>
He added that fighting terrorism was the task of the whole
society.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also assured the security of Egypt and the ability of
Egyptian security agencies to crack down on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"To have some security personnel neglecting their duty does not
encompass the whole apparatus," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lax security has been widely blamed for the fatal incident as
Mubarak called the arrangement there "a joke."

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of jobseekers in
Israel rose 1.2 percent in November to a total of 151,600,
compared to 149,800 in October, today's The Jerusalem Post
reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli Employment Service as saying that
there was also a 0.1 percent increase in the number of new
immigrant jobseekers last month to 11,000.
</P>
<P>
Since July this year, Israel's unemployment has risen
continually. And the third-quarter unemployment rate had jumped to
8.1 percent, the highest in three-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Finance Minister Ya'akov Neeman has declared
unemployment as the number one problem facing the Israeli economy.
</P>
<P>
A group of ministers, including Neeman and Industry and Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky, is currently preparing documentation on
unemployment for consideration by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Israel's Trade Union leader Amir Peretz said he
will lead an unwavering battle against jobs being eliminated.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government to establish an emergency fund
with 1 percent of the budget, or 1 billion shekels (about
290 million U.S. dollars), that would be earmarked to fight
unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Falls to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso plunged
further to a record low of 40.214 pesos against the U.S. dollar in
today's trading on the Philippine Dealing System (PDS).
</P>
<P>
The peso was averaged at 39.910 to the greenback in morning
trading on the PDS, the electronic currency exchange, down 1.563
pesos from Monday's reference rate of 38.347 pesos.
</P>
<P>
The trading was suspended according to a system of volatility
bands which limits daily fluctuations in the peso-dollar rate to
no more than 4 percent from the previous day's average level.
</P>
<P>
The peso struck all three volatility caps today with a thin
transaction volume of 7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the consecutive falls of the peso to a
plunge in the Thai baht which they expected will push the peso
down further in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Executive Secretary Ruben Torres said in an
interview today that the peso depreciation was just a temporary
aberrations triggered by the heavy importation and big demand for
foreign currencies during the Christmas season.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Bans Transport of Caspian Oil Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will not allow the
transport of the Caspian oil through the Turkish Straits due to
security and environment concerns, local newspaper Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
State Minister Metin Gurdere was quoted as saying that
transporting oil through the Straits might not only endanger the
residents in Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey, but also
pollute the environment of the city, which is a famous historical
and cultural center.
</P>
<P>
The most economical and practical route is to transfer the
Caspian oil via the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline to the Mediterranean,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a energy-starving country, has to import large
amounts of oil and natural gas from neighboring countries to
meet its domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Straits is now a major route to transport oil
and other oil products from the Black Sea countries to the
European markets.
</P>
<P>
Some environment organizations have been urging the Turkish
government to take measures to protect the beautiful straits
from increasing pollution.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Azerbaijan are reportedly discussing to build a
pipeline from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the port
city of Ceyhan in southern Turkey to export the Caspian
oil.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade still
has momentum this year following last year's relatively low
growth, said Wu Yi, Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the People's Daily, the country's leading
newspaper, Wu said that trade in the first 11 months of this year
was worth 286.8 billion US dollars, an increase of 14 percent over
the same period of last year, and she described four
characteristics of this year's trade:
</P>
<P>
-- Steady development with relatively rapid growth. Trade this
year was up 11.7 percent in the first quarter, 14.3 percent in the
second, and 14.9 percent in the third, from last year's
figures. The increase for the fourth quarter is expected to be
about 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
-- Greater recovery from the relatively low growth last
year. Trade in the first half of this year was up 13.1 percent and
13.8 percent from the same periods in 1996 and 1995, respectively.
</P>
<P>
-- Conflicts in the foreign trade mix have declined remarkably,
as seen in the rapid increase in exports by China's state-owned
enterprises, import increases, an improvement in the foreign trade
products mix, and more diversity.
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign trade has played an increasingly important role in
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Use of overseas investment continued to grow this year, Wu
said, and China had used 35.598 billion US dollars of investment
in the first 10 months, an increase of 8.27 percent over the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, China had approved a combined total of
more than 300,000 overseas-funded enterprises with a total of 510
billion US dollars in investment, over 210 billion of which is
being used, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there has been progress in economic and
technological co-operation with other countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, China's average tariff rate has fallen 60.6
percent, from 43.2 percent to 17 percent, she said, and President
Jiang Zemin committed himself to a further lowering to 10 percent
by the year 2005 during APEC's fifth informal meeting not long ago.
</P>
<P>
She said she believes this will prove attractive for overseas
investment, bring advanced technology and equipment for
state-owned enterprises, increase Chinese competitiveness in the
international market, and create favorable conditions for overseas
products to enter China's market, thereby increasing imports and
reducing China's foreign trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
For next year, she said that there are both challenges and
opportunities. The former are the negative impact on the world's
economy from the financial turmoil caused by the financial crisis
in Southeast Asia, the similarity of export products of China and
Southeast Asian nations, the increasing trade protectionism
against China, and trade conflicts caused by China's foreign trade
surplus.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that in 1998, China will continue to increase exports
and improve the trade products mix and market orientation, and
work for a trade balance.
</P>
<P>
She estimates that China's foreign trade next year will
continue to increase by a higher rate than China's national
economy, and China will attract more overseas investment and
provide preferential policies for high-tech products,
overseas-funded projects, and imported technology and equipment.

<TEXT>
<P>
The global multi-lateral trade system and regional economic
groups are growing and their effect on world trade has drawn
people's greater attention.
</P>
<P>
Regional economic groups like the European Union (EU) and the
North America Free Trade Area (NAFTA) have adopted totally to the
open market and free trade among their members, she pointed
out. This allows for the free flow of goods, services, capital,
and labor, she said, and is good for the effective allocation of
resources and economic growth in these regions.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, the top priority of these regional economic
groups is to have relatively favorable policies and various levels
of free trade inside the regions. They maintain the original
tariff or non-tariff policies outside the region, giving rise to
discriminatory trade barriers and investment practice.
</P>
<P>
"If this goes on for a long time, discriminatory trade barriers
and investment practices will inevitably affect the economic
development of other countries and regions with increasing
international trade conflicts and by eroding multi-lateral trade
systems," she said.
</P>
<P>
As long as these regional trade groups stick to an "open
regionalism" and have non-discriminatory principles, they will not
give rise to new trade and investment obstacles, and existing
trade and investment barriers will gradually be lowered or even
eliminated in the process of liberalization and will facilitate
trade and investment, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific region has become the most vigorous region for
China's economic growth. China's trade with the region accounts
for 80 percent of the country's total foreign trade and 90
percent of its overseas investment is from the region, she added.
</P>
<P>
China has always actively supported and participated in Asia
Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC), she said, and that one of
APEC's main items this year, the liberalization of certain trade
sectors, will promote liberalization of trade and investment in
APEC.
</P>
<P>
She said that China will participate in discussions about the
liberalization of trade sectors, while taking the progress of its
own reforms and opening up and economic growth into
consideration.

There has been progress in talks on China's WTO membership this
year, both in bilateral talks and multilateral panels, and China
has negotiated bilateral market access since August, she said.
</P>
<P>
More than ten countries, including New Zealand, the Republic of
Korea and Hungary, have talked with China about goods trade and
service trade and nine have signed agreements with China.
</P>
<P>
Trade talks about goods trade between China and Japan are
finished, and service trade talks are underway, and talks between
China and Europe have reached the final stage.
</P>
<P>
During the Sino-US summit in Washington this October, the US
side reiterated in the Sino-US Joint Statement that it would speed
up talks with China on China's entry into the WTO at an early
date. The Chinese delegation also discussed this in detail in
Geneva this month.
</P>
<P>
The WTO working group on China has held three meetings this
year, but market access is still a difficult point, and the
Chinese have said that they are ready to take action with a
flexible attitude toward the demands of WTO members in bilateral
talks.
</P>
<P>
If the major WTO members have an active, flexible and pragmatic
attitude toward problems with China's WTO membership, instead of
making exorbitant demands, talks will make progress.
</P>
<P>
There is an imbalance in trade with the US, but in recent
years, China has taken steps to try to balance that trade by
encouraging Chinese enterprises to import from the US, and China
has sent several trade missions and bought nearly 10 billion US
dollars worth of goods.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese market is more open and trade partners will all be
treated equally. China is willing to see the US expand its exports
to China, and hopes the US side can reduce its controls on exports
to China and take steps to encourage US enterprises to export to
China.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been a conduit for foreign funds into China and
for foreign trade, and after its return, this role has not and
will not change.
</P>
<P>
According to China's customs, from April to June of this year,
trade between inland areas and Hong Kong was worth about 13
billion US dollars, and after the return, trade from July to
September was similar and amounted to 12.8 billion US dollars
worth. Hong Kong is still the inland areas' biggest export market
and second biggest trade partner.

<HEADLINE> World Largest Stibium Mine Free From Silicosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The life expectancy of the
10,000 miners working at the world's largest stibium mine in
Xikuangshan in central China's Hunan Province has been lifted from
30 in 1949 to 68 today.
</P>
<P>
The Xikuangshan mine used to be plagued by silicosis, a disease
caused by the intake of dusts.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the high incidence of the disease was caused by
poor ventilation. Statistics showed that from 1897 to 1949 the
disease claimed 90,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
In Tongjiayuan Village near the mine, about 120 men died of
silicosis.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the 1950s, the local government has invested
large amounts of money to improve the ventilation facilities of
the mine. The content of dust in the air has been cut to within
two milligrams per cubic meter.
</P>
<P>
Xikuangshan's first hospital specialized in curing silicosis,
built in 1951, could only hospitalize a dozen patients. Since then
the mine has built several other hospitals, and improved their
medical instruments.
</P>
<P>
The local government allocates 250,000 yuan (about 30,000 US
dollars) every year to organize physical check-ups among the
miners.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of silicosis has dropped to under one
percent. According to statistics, there have been only 57 cases of
silicosis reported in the mine since 1958.

among major science and technology projects of the State Science
and Technology Commission during the country's ninth five-year
development plan period (1996 to 2000).
</P>
<P>
They estimated that one newly developed cotton picker could do
as much work as that of 300 or 400 cotton picking workers.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural Science,
Xinjiang Agricultural University, China Agro-Technical Institute
have spent more than one year for the development of cotton
pickers.
</P>
<P>
They said 70 percent of parts of self-propelled cotton
picker is made in China.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ANC Conference Eyes 1999 Election and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The 50th national
conference of South Africa's ruling African National Congress
(ANC) will discuss crucial policies and prepare for the 1999
general election to lead the country into the next century.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be held from today to Saturday in
Mafikeng, capital of South Africa's North-West Province.
</P>
<P>
At the five-day gathering, ANC Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
will step into President Nelson Mandela's shoes as ANC leader and
in 1999 become president of the country. He is left unchallenged
for the top ANC job.
</P>
<P>
ANC national chairman and the party's provincial leader of
Kwazulu-Natal, Jacob Zuma, won the support of the country's all
nine provincial structures of the ANC to take the post of deputy
president.
</P>
<P>
Mandela on Sunday heaped praises on his successors.
</P>
<P>
"He (Mbeki) is a man of exceptional gifts, very respectful,
very warm, very sensitive to the suffering of our people."
</P>
<P>
He referred to Zuma as an "outstanding leader, generous, full
of self respect and highly talented."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who has already been left to run the day-to-day affairs
of the government and preside over cabinet meetings, is now
actually the de facto president of the country.
</P>
<P>
Besides the election of a new leadership after Mandela's
retirement, the conference is also expected to prepare the ANC
for the 1999 general election without Mandela, which is believed
to be harder than the first all-race election in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that the ANC is losing members because its
failure to fulfill some of its promises before the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also give the ANC an opportunity to
reflect on its past three and a half years in office. But party
leaders have repeatedly said that there would not be big changes
in its policy.
</P>
<P>
The country's macro-economic policy is expected to be a hot
issue at the conference as the country is still facing the same
problems during the apartheid years: unemployment and social
disorder.
</P>
<P>
With a new election only 18 months away, the ANC has so far
failed to deliver on its promises of houses, jobs and better life
for the black majority.
</P>
<P>
The government's Growth, Employment and Redistribution (Gear)
macro-economic program started in 1996 also failed to reach its
target. According to the ambitious plan, the economy should grow
at an annual rate of about six percent, but the actual
achievement this year was only about two percent. Instead of job
creation, the country is losing jobs, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
Another hot issue at the conference might be the role in the
ANC of the party's most controversial figure, Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Madikizela-Mandela, president of ANC Women's League and member
of the all-powerful ANC National Executive Committee, also eyed
the post of deputy presidency.
</P>
<P>
The former wife of President Mandela was excluded from a list
of nominations for the top six jobs of the ANC revealed last
week, but she still has a chance through nominations directly
from the floor.
</P>
<P>
Her ambition may be further curtailed as the party has
announced that the percentage of approval required for floor
nominations could be increased to 25 or even 30 percent from the
present 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Her reputation suffered a damaging blow after a nine-day
hearing of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission implicated her
in more than a dozen cases of murder, abduction and torture
during the apartheid era.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Many restaurants in Shanghai,
China's industrial and commercial city, are building their
reputation with large size.
</P>
<P>
Most large restaurants opened in the city this year are
successful. A typical example is the Hongziji Restaurant,
Shanghai's largest restaurant serving Chinese food which can seat
up to 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Large catering places are drawing customers from small ones
nearby. And, of the 25,000 restaurants in Shanghai, less than 800
have over 500 seats.
</P>
<P>
Many restaurants are trying to strengthen their position
by adopting new service items and creating appealing dining
environment in a bid to narrow the gap between themselves and the
international style.
</P>
<P>
Offering dainty local food or special cuisines from other
places of the country without losing their distinctive
characteristics is deemed by many Shanghai restaurants as a way to
survive in the ever intensifying market competition.
</P>
<P>
These trends are predicted to go on well into early next
century.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Big Powers Readjust Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The year 1997 has been a busy
year witnessing very active diplomacy by the world big
powers. Leaders of China, the United States, Russia and Japan as
well as those from Western Europe have engaged in frequent
bilateral or multilateral contacts. This is a situation rarely
seen in world history of diplomacy and reflects the fact that
relations among big powers are undergoing a profound and
significant readjustment.
</P>
<P>
One salient feature in this readjustment is that, proceeding
from their own strategic interests, the big powers attached
importance to the common interests, but did not give up their self
interests. They admitted the existence of contradictions or
disputes among them, but spared no efforts on building strategic
partnership towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The China-U.S. relationship enjoyed an improvement after
suffering a period of ups and downs. Chinese President Jiang Zemin
visited the United States from October 26 to November 3. In the
China-U.S. Joint Statement, signed during the visit, the two
countries announced their commitment to the establishment of a
constructive strategic partnership oriented toward the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Through joint efforts, they also concluded a package of trade
and economic cooperation agreements and initiated actions on the
program of peaceful use of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-Russian relations were also further
expanded. Jiang's visit to Russia in April and Boris Yeltsin's
November visit to China added new contents to their existing
21st-century-oriented strategic relationship of equality and
trust: the signing of a joint statement on world polarization and
the establishment of a new international order, and the singing of
an agreement on the reduction of military forces in their border
areas. These documents provided the world with new modes of proper
handling of relations among nations and of building regional
security and stability systems, modes worthy of promotion and
different from the Cold War thinking.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Russia, China and Japan as well as China and France
all have worked hard this year in pairs for partnerships geared to
the next century. During his visit to Russia in early November,
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Yeltsin approved a
plan on bilateral cooperation in politics, economy and finance,
and also agreed to make efforts to conclude a peace treaty before
the year 2000 and move towards a "real partnership."
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, Chinese Premier Li Peng visited Japan and,
together with Japanese leaders, re-affirmed their commitment to a
21st-century-oriented good-neighborly cooperative friendship
between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Before Li's Japan visit, French President Jacques Chirac
arrived in China in May. During his stay, Chirac and Jiang
promised to establish a long-term comprehensive partnership
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States decided to establish a strategic
partnership as early as in 1994, but contradictions between them
were deepened because of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
eastward expansion, the center issue of many meetings among
leaders of Russia, the United States and west European
countries. Although they have reached a sort of compromise over
the issue, contradictions remain.

<HEADLINE> China's Oldest Oilfield Stabilizing Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Yumen
Oilfield, the country's oldest, has stabilized its annual crude
oil output at 400,000 tons since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Oil exploration experts of the oilfield in Gansu Province said
that the output can be kept through the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yumen Oilfield, known as the cradle of China's oil industry, is
responsible for petroleum exploration and development in a
500,000-sq-km area that covers west of Helan Mountains, east of
Dunhuang City, south of Sino-Mongolian border and north of Qilian
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
It was first discovered in 1939 and exploration was also
carried out the same year. Five small oilfields have been built in
Yumen Oilfield where petroleum reserves have been verified at
90.06 million tons, with recoverable reserves estimated at 32.46
million tons.
</P>
<P>
As New China's first oil production base, the Yumen Oilfield
has so far pumped a total of 26.64 million tons of crude oil. It
has reported decreases in oil output ever since it produced its
record output of 1.4 million tons in 1959.
</P>
<P>
To curb the decrease, engineers have been busy doing more
research on late-period development at Yumen Oilfield, while
applying ten new exploration techniques.
</P>
<P>
Scientific progress has helped increase Yumen Oilfield's annual
oil output by 26,000 tons at present, up from 19,000 tons in
1990.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Big Powers Readjust Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Readjustment of relations among big powers this year manifests
the following characteristics.
</P>
<P>
-- It is based on the common interests of different levels,
instead of military cooperation. The common interests are of
global, regional and bilateral nature in the fields of politics,
security, trade, economy, energy, environmental protection,
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Of them, the economic interest is playing an increasingly more
important role in the big-power relations. Trade volume between
China and the United States, and that between China and Japan, in
1996, reached as high as 42.8 billion and 60 billion U.S. dollars
respectively. Mutual complementary and great potentiality have
become one of the most powerful motive forces for the improvement
and development of China-U.S. and China-Japan relations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to join efforts on the exploration of natural
resources in Siberia, Russia, has laid a foundation for
reconciliation of relationship between Japan and Russia, while
China and Russia have agreed to strive to bring their bilateral
trade volume up to 20 billion dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
-- It advocates settlement of existing differences and disputes
through the means of dialogue rather than confrontation.
</P>
<P>
No pair of big powers can be free from disputes even when they
enjoy a strategic partnership. It is, however, important for them
to follow the two principles when dealing with their dispute.
</P>
<P>
One is the principle of dialogue or consultation on the basis
of equality and mutual respect, and the other the principle of
seeking common ground while reserving differences. If the
differences cannot be removed for the time being, just shelf them
and never let individual cases affect the overall situation.
</P>
<P>
To make sure the observance of the principles, some big
countries have already established mechanism for regular meetings
between their leaders.
</P>
<P>
-- It does not pose any "threat" to a third party.
</P>
<P>
Opinion in some of the Western countries that strategic
partnership between big powers represents a kind of alliance
against a third country is utterly groundless. Both China and the
United States made it clear that their aim to build a constructive
strategic partnership is to promote world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-Russian strategic friendship of cooperation is
characterized by "non-alignment, non-confrontation and targeting
at no third parties," and is designed to help maintain a balance
of power and establish a stable, just international political and
economic order of peace.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the China-France long-term comprehensive partnership
is aimed at bringing about a more prosperous, stable, secure and
balanced world.
</P>
<P>
-- It does not prevent any country from developing relations
with a third party, rather it helps improve ties among big powers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's U.S. visit has not only played a positive role in the
improvement of China-U.S. relations, but also started a chain
reaction on relations of other pairs of big powers.
</P>
<P>
Following Jiang's nine-day U.S. tour, Hashimoto visited Russia,
Yeltsin visited China and then Li Peng visited Japan. All these on
the whole pushed forward the development of Japan-Russia,
China-Russia and China-Japan relations, as well as helped improve
the less-than-satisfying Japan-Russia relations in particular.
</P>
<P>
Partnership emerges among big powers not by accident, but is a
phase manifestation of readjustment of big power relations in the
post-Cold War world polarization process.
</P>
<P>
After the collapse of the bi-polar pattern, the world is
becoming multi-polar instead of single-polar. Every big country is
struggling to strengthen its comprehensive national power so as to
jockey for position in the future pattern of a multi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of strategic partnership among big powers
since the beginning of 1997, whatever their subjective aims, is in
fact a confirmation of the trend of world polarization and is
beneficial to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
However, going against this trend, the United States has never
given up its scheme of a U.S.-dominated single-polar world, busy
strengthening strategic cooperation of military alliance by
promoting NATO expansion in the West and U.S.-Japan defense
cooperation in the East. Such U.S. insistence on Cold-War thinking
has brought in complicating factors into the current big-power
relations.

<P>
SHANGHAI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- This largest trade and
financial city of China is expected to export 15 billion US
dollars worth-of goods this year, according to the Shanghai
Municipal Government.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's exports reached 13.8 billion dollars in the first 11
months of this year, up 13.8 percent from the same period of last
year, according to the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded enterprises have become a driving force behind

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pudong New Area has also scored a substantial
increase in exports, with its exports rising 7.44 percent and
accounting nearly one fifth of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
A success has also been made in expanding overseas markets for
Shanghai-made products. Shanghai exported a total of 9.45 billion
dollars worth of products to Hong Kong, Japan, the United States,
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, Shanghai should take measures to improve the quality
of its export commodities, and reform its export growth mode, said
Zhu Xiaoming, director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Next year Shanghai will grant 100 more enterprises the

<HEADLINE> Southwest Chinese Province Has Plenty of Prehistorical Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered even more Early Stone Age relics near the city of
Guiyang, the capital of southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
The discovery brings the number of relics locations in the city
to at least 80, and the earliest date of human inhabitants has
been pushed back another 10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 stone tools and fossilized bone are from the later
Early Stone Age or from early in the Later Stone Age, the
archaeologists said.
</P>
<P>
According to one researcher from the provincial museum,
Guizhou's characteristic karst formations have left many limestone
caves, some of which were used by early man.
</P>
<P>
The prehistorical relics were first discovered in Guanyin cave
in western Guizhou in 1964. Many of the sites have a large number
of relics, and thousands of stone tools have been found in one
place.
</P>
<P>
Six of the sites are under the state-level protection, and 15
others are under provincial-level protection.

<HEADLINE> State Farms in Northeast China Report Good Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Heilongjiang Reclamation
Area, one of the largest groups of state farms in China, harvested
8.5 billion kg of grain and soy beans this year, double the 1994
figure.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of corn and rice to the area's farm produce output
has risen from 15 percent in 1994 to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
A Heilongjiang Provincial Government official attributed the
good harvest to large-scale land improvement and the application
of modern techniques in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The area has invested 3.1 billion yuan improving 666,600 ha
of low- and medium-yield farmland, checking soil erosion on
333,300 ha and undertaking a number of irrigation and seed
processing projects.
</P>
<P>
The drive to spread the use of new techniques in recent year
has raised the average per-ha output of grain and beans to 4,695
kg, 84 percent more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
So far, 18 agriculture-related enterprise groups have been
formed, with their combined industrial output value expected to
reach 6.2 billion yuan this year, up nearly 50 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the policy of reforms and opening to the outside
world, the area has approved 25 foreign-funded enterprises
involving 48 million U.S. dollars in overseas funds over the past
three years.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Reduce Number of New Drug Addicts: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister's Office
Minister Jurin Laksanavisit said on Monday that the government
plans to reduce the number of new drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
Jurin said if the plan is successful and the number of new
addicts are reduced, drug traffickers will have difficulty finding
customers and the drug trade would die "a natural death."
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the drug situation in the country has worsened
this year and that the economic crisis has forced otherwise
law-abiding people into making fast and dirty money through
selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, police have stepped up the crackdown on
teenager drug abuse. In the past month alone, police arrested 128
teenagers who tested drug positive, in raids on two night spots
where hundreds of teenagers were holding what are known as "drug
parties."
</P>
<P>
Police are in particular watchful for youngsters' birthday
parties, where teenager drug addicts sometimes gather.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, deputy interior minister Vatana Asavahame said on
Monday that the country lacks prison space for the 140,000
inmates, of which 40,000 are drug offenders, the largest group of
inmates in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry plans to spend 50 million baht (1.1
million U.S. dollars) to convert a number of former Vietnamese
refugee centers in the northeast province of Nakhon Ratchasima
into a prison for drug convicts.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Companies Employ Child Labor in Fields and Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- About 123,000 children aged
14-17 work in America's fields, according to an unreleased Labor
Department survey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least 13,100 children worked illegally last year
in garment industry sweatshops -- factories that repeatedly
violate federal wages and hours laws, according to study
commissioned by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Many of America's working children are not the ones you see.
They are not the teen-agers who flame-broil Double Whoppers at
Burger King or bag groceries at Food Lion, though they are
governed by the same laws, said an AP report.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal law bars children under 16 from working while
school is in session. Outside school hours, anyone 14 or 15 may
work in farm jobs that the U.S. Labor Department deems safe.
Younger children, those 12 or 13, can work only on farms and at a
few other specific jobs.
</P>
<P>
Many of the children working in America are frequently
underpaid, often unaccompanied and largely unprotected -- a shadow
generation made prematurely adult, moving from coast to coast,
border to border.
</P>
<P>
Some kids want spending money to buy into the consumer culture
they see as necessary to being American. But many, especially
migrant children, work because their parents don't earn enough.
</P>
<P>
"If adults were paid a living wage, we wouldn't have child
labor," Ann Millard, a Michigan State University anthropologist
who studies migrant labor, as saying. Three out of four migrant
families say they earn 5,000 dollars or less yearly according to a
national database of 54,000 families compiled by a farmworker
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
In some Manhattan garment shops, children eat lunch in dank,
urine-soaked stairwells. Others sleep in overcrowded apartments or
houses. Pennsylvania mushroom picker Rigoberto Rosales, 17, shares
a house with more than 25 other Mexicans and carves a certain
privacy for himself by erecting a cardboard box around his bare
mattress, the report says.

<P>
MINSK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Belarus's Prime Minister Sergei
Ling said Sunday that Belarus plans to cooperate with the United
States based on the principles of "equality and mutual benefit."
</P>
<P>
Ling made the remark during the U.S. delegation's visit to
Belarus. He stressed that enhancing foreign cooperation is crucial
to the country's economy, and Belarus has an open economy, with
two thirds of its production exported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation, headed by Steven Sestanovich, who is a
special counselor for the Secretary of State, made a one-day visit
to Belarus on Sunday. The two countries expressed hopes to
overcome the obstacles between them through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Ling emphasized that Belarus has played a "role of stability"
in eastern Europe. Belarus will seek to resolve all problems with
the U.S. through "the way of civilization," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is an important trade partner of Belarus. The
trade volume between them in 1996 reached 212 million
U.S. dollars, up 45 per cent compared to the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Belarus established diplomatic relation with the U.S. on
December 28, 1991, since then more than 20 documents of
cooperation have been signed between them. But bilateral relations
on politics has met with some trouble recently, due to problems
such as the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Jiang's Speech at Informal China-ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has all along attached great importance to developing its
relations with ASEAN and is in favor of a positive role by ASEAN
in regional and international affairs. In the past decade, China's
relations with each ASEAN country and ASEAN as an organization
have both made considerable progress and reached a new level
following the establishment of China-ASEAN partnership of full
dialogue. The two sides have frequently exchanged high-level
visits. They steadily expanded economic relations and trade,
broadened contacts in various fields and intensified co-ordination
and cooperation on some major international and regional
issues. Facts have proved and will continue to prove that
developing the friendly relations and cooperation between China
and ASEAN is not only in the interests of our two sides but also
benefits the Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Our two sides have agreed to establish a good-neighborly
partnership of mutual trust oriented toward the 21st century. To
reach this goal, I would like to offer my following observations:
</P>
<P>
-- Make the best use of the existing mechanism of all-round
dialogue and cooperation between China and ASEAN to broaden our
exchanges and cooperation in all areas, at all levels and through
all channels and strengthen the exchanges and contacts between
leaders and people from all walks of life of our two sides so as
to enhance our mutual trust, expand common ground and promote
friendship.
</P>
<P>
-- Give priority to our economic relations and trade,
scientific and technological cooperation between our two sides in
accordance with the principle of drawing on each other's
comparative advantages and mutual benefit and reinforce the
cooperation in the areas of resources, technology, market,
banking, information, human resources development and investment
so as to promote common progress.
</P>
<P>
-- Intensify two-way dialogue, co-ordination and mutual support
between our two sides on major regional and international issues
and in the UN, APEC, ASEM and ARF with a view to jointly
safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the developing
countries and promoting their fair and equal participation in the
international economic decision-making and operation without
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
-- Continue our efforts in handling the existing differences or
disputes through friendly consultations on an equal footing and
seek a progressive solution to the problems. Those differences
that cannot be solved for the time being may be shelved
temporarily in the spirit of seeking common ground while putting
aside differences so that they will not stand in the way of the
establishment and development of the good-neighborly partnership
of mutual trust between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Unswervingly pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace,
China takes peace as the ultimate goal of its foreign policy. As
the largest developing country in the world with a relatively low
level of productive forces on the whole, China needs a long-term
peaceful international environment and a good neighborly
environment in particular to realize its modernization program
through decades of arduous struggles. Even when China is
developed, it will continue to adhere to the Five Principles of
Peaceful Co-existence and live with other countries in amity in
the spirit of mutual respect and treating others as equals. China
will never seek hegemony. China will always be a staunch force in
maintaining regional and global peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
In retrospect of the 20th century, the rise of China and ASEAN
countries and their friendly relations and cooperation today
represent a distinguishing feature in the course of history of
Asia and the world as a whole. Looking into the 21st century, we
are convinced that there lies an even brighter future for the
development, prosperity, friendship and cooperation between China
and ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
China will forever be a good neighbor, a good partner and a
good friend with ASEAN countries. Let's join hands and work
together for the establishment and development of the
good-neighborly partnership of mutual trust oriented to the 21st
century between China and ASEAN.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Jiang's Speech at Informal China-ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full
text of a speech delivered on Tuesday by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin at the first Informal China-ASEAN Summit.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Toward a Good-Neighborly Partnership of Mutual Trust
Oriented to the 21st Century," the speech reads as follows:
</P>
<P>
I feel more than happy to have the opportunity to gather
together with leaders of nine ASEAN countries for the first time
to discuss and explore the development of China-ASEAN friendship
and cooperation oriented toward the 21st century. First of all, I
wish to offer my warm congratulations to ASEAN on its 30th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
This meeting, I believe, marks the beginning of a new stage of
development in China-ASEAN relations.
</P>
<P>
With the purpose of active participation, broadening common
ground, enhancing mutual trust and strengthening cooperation, I
have come here to explore together with ASEAN leaders the
objectives and guidelines for the development of our future
relations.
</P>
<P>
At the important historical juncture on the eve of the new
century, we should approach and handle our bilateral relations
from a long-range strategic perspective and forge a China-ASEAN
good-neighborly partnership of mutual trust oriented to the 21st
century. This is not only in conformity with the trend of the
times and in the fundamental interest of China and ASEAN
countries, but also facilitates the establishment of a just and
rational new international order and the advancement of the lofty
cause of peace and development of Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese and the ASEAN people are industrious and
courageous people full of wisdom. Since ancient times, they have
created brilliant civilizations and built up fine cultural
traditions full of oriental colors on their own land, thus making
important contributions to the progress of humanity. Joined
together by mountains and rivers or facing each other across the
sea, China and ASEAN countries have developed a profound
traditional friendship among the people in the course of their
age-old contacts and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Since the modern times began, profound changes have taken place
in both China and ASEAN countries. Through a century-long struggle
and sacrifice, the Chinese people won their national liberation
and gave birth to the new China. With decades of efforts, they
have built China into a socialist country with initial
prosperity. Through protracted and arduous struggle, the people of
ASEAN countries have also shaken off the yoke of colonialism and
won their national independence and have scored commendable
achievements in their course of nation-building.
</P>
<P>
At present, both China and ASEAN countries, seizing
opportunities presented by history, have formulated development
strategies in light of their own national conditions and continued
to develop the productive forces and maintain a sustained economic
growth. China has accelerated the development of a socialist
market economy, socialist democracy and socialist culture in its
efforts to become a strong, prosperous, democratic and culturally
advanced modern country by and large by the middle of the next
century. ASEAN, on the other hand, is also pressing ahead with its
process to attain industrialization, modernization and
integration. The ASEAN Vision 2020 you have drawn up has set clear
steps and mapped out a grand blueprint in this regard. China and
ASEAN countries will continue to be dynamic throughout the world
in growth.
</P>
<P>
Both committed to the promotion of regional and global peace
and development, China and ASEAN countries are in favor of
building up their mutual trust, expanding their common ground
while reserving differences and proper handling of their
differences through friendly consultations and candid cooperation
so as to secure regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The time-honored traditional friendship, similar historical
experience and common desire for peace and economic development
constitute an important basis both in history and at present for
the enhancement of the good-neighborly relations of mutual trust
and friendly cooperation between China and ASEAN countries.

<HEADLINE> Russian Economy Sees Recovery: Chubais </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia's financial situation,
seriously influenced by the recent international financial crisis,
is starting to improve, first deputy Prime Minister Anatoly
Borisovich Chubais said today at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The most threatening period to the Russian economy is finally
over, Chubais said.
</P>
<P>
The bond interest rate in Russia's financial market continues
to decline, while stock prices have maintained growth momentum
since early December, Chubais said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Chubais said, the Russian government is
paying close attention to future changes in the financial market.
</P>
<P>
Russia's inflation rate will exceed the estimated figure to
reach 11 percent, with a 1 percent increase occurring in December,
Chubais predicted.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998 is expected to grow by
2 percent, which means the Russian government could overcome the
financial turmoil in the end, the deputy prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Russia will no longer need new credits from foreign banks from
this December to January next year, Chubais indicated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chubais doesn't rule out the possibility of getting
a loan worth 2 billion U.S. dollars from the West's four major
banks.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government will also pay off the default wages of
the workers, Chubais added.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Says National Objectives Remain Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's national objectives
remain unchanged despite a recent reconstitution of the
government, said Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General Tin Oo.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar formed the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC)
after dissolving the former State Law and Order Restoration
Council in a major reshuffle of the government on November 15.
</P>
<P>
Addressing military officers at the Ministry of Defense Monday,
Tin Oo, second secretary of the SPDC, said the objectives remain
as non-disintegration of the union, non-disintegration of national
solidarity, perpetuation of sovereignty and building a peaceful,
modern and developed nation, official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Tin Oo, who is also chief of the Bureau of Special Operations
and chief of staff of the Army, said the SPDC was formed "in
response to the time and circumstances of the nation's
situation."
</P>
<P>
He also said that SPDC will transfer state power to the people
in whom it was initially vested, adding that the present
government is trying to build firm political, economic and social
foundations.
</P>
<P>
On Myanmar's foreign policy, he stressed the need to maintain
the  good relations with all countries and the friendly ties
with other ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member
nations on equal footing.
</P>
<P>
On the country's economy, he said the recent currency crisis of
Southeast Asian countries also affected Myanmar to some extent,
prompting a rise in commodity prices following an increase in the
exchange rate of the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government is taking measures to promote the
country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Regarding national re-consolidation endeavors, he said 23
anti-government armed groups have made peace with the government,
leaving only two still in insurgency.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government, the people and the army to work
cooperatively for the accomplishment of the national objectives
and build the nation into a strong and powerful one.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Proposes Steps to Strengthen Partnership With ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin Tuesday proposed four steps to build and develop a 21st
century-oriented good-neighborly partnership of mutual trust
between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
In a speech here at the first Informal China-ASEAN Summit,
Jiang said that China and ASEAN countries should first make the
best use of the existing mechanism of all-round dialogue and
cooperation to broaden their exchanges and cooperation in all
areas, at all levels and through all channels.
</P>
<P>
They should also give priority to promoting their economic
relations, trade and scientific and technological cooperation and
reinforcing their cooperation in resources, technology, market,
banking, information, human resources development and investment,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that they should intensify their dialogue,
co-ordination and mutual support on major regional and
international issues and in regional and international
organizations. By so doing, he said, they can jointly safeguard
the legitimate rights and interests of the developing countries
and promote their fair and equal participation in international
economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Finally Jiang proposed that China and ASEAN countries should
continue to handle their differences or disputes through friendly
consultations and seek a progressive solution to them. If some
differences cannot be solved for the time being, he said, they
should be shelved temporarily in order to seek common ground.
</P>
<P>
He assured in the speech that China will always be "a good
neighbor, a good partner and a good friend with ASEAN countries."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Remove Large Tumor From Man's Leg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A 5.5 kg malignant tumor on the
bone of a young man's left leg was removed recently by doctors at
the Xijing Hospital in Xi'an, the capital of northwest China's
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Fusheng, 25, from the city of Qinhuangdao in north China's
Hebei Province had asked many large hospitals to help him, but
they refused because of the size of the tumor for the fear that
the operation would be too risky, and suggested that the leg be
amputated.
</P>
<P>
By the time the man began to receive treatment at Xijing
Hospital in November, the tumor was 80 cm. in circumference and he
was given six days of chemotherapy before the operation.
</P>
<P>
The chief surgeon, Wang Zhen, explained that after the tumor
was entirely removed, the bone was replaced with a metal alloy
used for artificial limbs.
</P>
<P>
The ten-hour operation saved both the leg and the patient's
life, and he is in satisfactory condition.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said that the hospital has performed about 50 such
operations, but that the size of the tumor was quite rare.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Foreign Reserves Above IMF-Required Minimum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's foreign reserves
stood at 26.3 billion U.S. dollars in November after dropping 2.1
billion dollars in the last two weeks of the month, the Bank of
Thailand said Monday.
</P>
<P>
At 26.3 billion dollars, Thailand's foreign reserves were the
lowest since August, when reserves stood at 35.9 billion dollars.
But they were well above the minimum of 23 billion dollar Thailand
must maintain this year to meet the International Monetary Fund
(IMF)'s requirement.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's foreign reserves had been swelled in recent months
by drawing on a 17.2 billion dollar bailout fund organized by the
IMF for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand Monday said it settled forward-currency
obligations totaling 2.1 billion dollars in the last two weeks of
November, bringing its net forward obligations down to 18.3
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
These obligations were incurred as a result of the Thai central
bank's interventions early this year to defend the baht against
speculators. The defense was abandoned on July 2 when the baht was
floated. Since then, the baht's value has been on the decline
against the U.S. dollar. On the day before the float, the mid-rate
was 25.79 baht to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Monday, the Thai currency lost 2.75 baht in a single day to hit
an all-time low of 48.10 to the dollar in local spot trading. The
Bank of Thailand set the reference rate Monday at 44.99 to the
dollar.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Hails China's Relations with ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said Tuesday that China's relations with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its members have reached a new
level since the two sides established a partnership of full
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the first Informal China-ASEAN summit
here, Jiang said, "In the past decade, China's relations with each
ASEAN country and ASEAN as an organization have made considerable
progress and reached a new level following the establishment of
China-ASEAN partnership of full dialogue."
</P>
<P>
China and ASEAN have frequently exchanged high-level visits,
steadily expanded economic relations and trade, broadened contacts
in various fields and intensified co-ordination and cooperation on
some major international and regional issues, the Chinese
president said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has all along attached great importance to
developing its relations with ASEAN and is in favor of a positive
role by ASEAN in regional and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proved and will continue to prove that developing
friendly relations and cooperation between China and ASEAN is not
only in the interests of our two sides but also benefits the
Asian-Pacific region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the two sides have agreed to establish a
good-neighborly partnership of mutual trust oriented toward the
21st century. The current summit meeting marks "the beginning of a
new stage of development in China-ASEAN relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The time-honored traditional friendship, similar historical
experience and common desire for peace and economic development
constitute an important basis both in history and at present for
the enhancement of the good-neighborly relations of mutual trust
and friendly cooperation between China and ASEAN countries, the
Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Both committed to the promotion of regional and
global peace and development, China and ASEAN countries are in
favor of building up their mutual trust, expanding their common
ground while reserving differences and proper handling of their
differences through friendly consultations and candid cooperation
so as to secure regional peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
He said that at the important historical juncture on the eve of
the new century, China and ASEAN should approach and handle their
bilateral relations from a long-range strategic perspective and
forge a good-neighborly partnership of mutual trust oriented to
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"Looking into the 21st century, we are convinced that there
lies an even brighter future for the development, prosperity,
friendship and cooperation between China and ASEAN countries,"
Jiang said. "China will forever be a good neighbor, a good partner
and a good friend with ASEAN countries."

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Swears In New Minister of Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Freddy Rojas Parra was sworn in as
the new Minister of Finance in Venezuela, replacing the outgoing
Minister Luis Raul Matos Azocar.
</P>
<P>
Rojas Parra was the Minister of Industry and Foreign Commerce
before he was appointed to his new post by President Rafael
Caldera.
</P>
<P>
Caldera said at the swearing in ceremony that Freddy Rojas has
always been devoted to the arduous task of managing the country`s
economy.
</P>
<P>
Matos Azocar stepped down on December 11. Azocar said in his
written resignation that his action was to avoid further
confrontation between the executive and the legislative branches.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the heavy criticism that a minority
parliamentary group had cast upon him. The group was also
proposing a vote of censorship against him in the Congress.
</P>
<P>
President Caldera accepted -- on that same day -- Azocar's
resignation while praising him for his three years of hard work as
Finance Minister.
</P>
<P>
The head of state described as "unjust" the campaign that had
been conducted against Matos Azocar.
</P>
<P>
The Congress accused the former Minister of having committed
fraud against the country. He allegedly used 9.47 million dollars
of federal funds to pay an Italian company Samana.
</P>
<P>
The motion of censorship charged Matos Azocar with negligence
and concealment because he allegedly ordered the suspension of a
probe in the case.

WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Monday it would be deeply concerned if French troops were not fully
carrying out their responsibilities to arrest war crimes suspects
in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal, had said French forces have refused to testify against
or arrest suspected war criminals.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at press briefing, U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said U.S. officials were aware of Arbour's remarks but
had not had an opportunity to assess them.
</P>
<P>
But Foley said he expects that France and other countries with
troops in the area will detain war crimes suspects if they
encounter them.
</P>
<P>
The Stabilization Force (SFOR) troops in Bosnia, including the
French and Americans, were authorized to arrest those war crime
suspects, including former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
when they met them.

<HEADLINE> Reno Rejects House Panel Demand for Independent Counsel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno rejected on Monday a Congress' demand for an immediate
independent counsel probe to investigate President Bill Clinton
over the denial of a casino license to Indian tribes in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
Reno, however, reminded Republicans that a separate ongoing
investigation of Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt could lead to an
independent investigation of the same activity.
</P>
<P>
The Republican demand for an independent investigation of the
president centers on allegations that Babbitt, on orders from the
White House, denied a casino application for poor Indian tribes in
Wisconsin because rival tribes in Minnesota opposed it. The rival
tribes also sponsor gambling and contributed heavily to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Reno sent a letter Monday to House Judiciary Chairman Henry
Hyde, a Republican, giving her reasons for rejecting the
Republican demand. Hyde and other Republicans on the committee had
sent a letter to Reno on November 13 putting forward what they
believed was cause for an independent probe of the president.
</P>
<P>
Reno was required by law to answer the letter Monday.
</P>
<P>
In her letter to Hyde, Reno said that the letter from
congressional Republicans "points to allegations that...lobbyists
for Indian tribes opposed to the casino application allegedly
mentioned the...issue to President Clinton..."
</P>
<P>
Reno wrote, "We are also aware of other evidence that the
president was aware of and inquired of his staff about the status
of the casino matter, and are aware that some White House staff
were monitoring the matter and inquiring of the Department of
Interior concerning it."
</P>
<P>
But Reno concluded, "Information that the president was aware
of a regulatory matter under review by an executive branch agency
does not, however, in and of itself indicate criminal wrongdoing
by the president."
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's rejection of the Hyde demand does not
affect a separate 90-day investigation into allegations against
Babbitt in the matter. That probe could lead to an independent
counsel, and ends February 11.
</P>
<P>
Hyde said today, "How much longer the spirit and letter of the
independent counsel law can be ignored by the nation's chief law
enforcement officer is an increasingly critical question."

JAKARTA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires this year in
Indonesia have destroyed more than 165,000 hectares of forest,
causing an estimated loss of 132 billion rupiah (26.4 million U.S.
dollars), a senior official said.
</P>

"Forest burning also damaged the soil as it killed all the
useful microorganisms which made the land productive," Minister of
Forestry Djamaludin Suryohadikusumo said in Karang Joang, East
Kalimantan, Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure did not include the financial losses of timber
estates and plantation companies, local press today quoted the
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The forest fires, which started from mid August this year in
Sumatra, Kalimantan, Java and Irian Jaya islands, have also caused
haze in the country as well as in Malaysia and Singapore. The haze
have affected the health of more than 20 million people in the
region.
</P>

"It will take a very long time and a lot of money to

<HEADLINE> OECD, IMF Say Italy Will Meet Euro Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Italy will successfully cut its
budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) as
required for the European single currency, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in an annual
report today.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
confirmed that Italy will not require supplementary budgets for
1997 in a report presented today to Italian Bank Governor and
Economic Minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the OECD, Italy's GDP will rise by 1.3 percent by
the end of 1997, but will not show an exceptional rise in 1998,
even if investments and exports increase.
</P>
<P>
GDP growth should come in around 2 percent in 1998, the OECD
report said.
</P>
<P>
This modest rise will result in marginal reductions in
unemployment levels, which are expected to fall from 12.3 percent
at the end of 1997 to 12.2 percent in 1998 and 12 percent in 1999,
the same as the rate in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The OECD noted a decrease in Italy's long-term interest rates
after the Bank of Italy lowered discount rate last June, strongly
raising Italy's chances of entering the EMU as a first-round
participant.
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates and the one-off "Euro-tax" helped Italy to
reach its 3 percent budget deficit goal in 1997 for joining the
Euro, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the IMF gave Italy's finance a vote of confidence
today when it announced that the country would not need a
supplementary budget.
</P>
<P>
"Italy has come a long way," the IMF delegation's
second-in-command Alessansdro Leipold said today at the end of its
two-week study. "But now it shouldn't slow down."

<P>
HAIKOU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China's island province of
Hainan has just built a 15-hectare gene bank for rare tropical
trees in the town of Fengmu in Tunchang County, to help protect
rare species.
</P>
<P>
The gene bank has 800 different species of trees and shrubs, 70
of which are found only in Hainan, and 60 of which are endangered
ones. An example is Hainan sindora clabra, a very rare tree
which is believed to be effective in treating blood cancer.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has 1,400 species of trees and shrubs overall, or 28
percent of the total number in China, 458 of which are under state
protection, and some of which are on the verge of extinction,
according to the Hainan Forestry Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Although trees have gradually been replaced by other materials
in ship-building or things like handicrafts, their role in the
ecology or in medicine is irreplaceable, the institute says.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah and
loccal stock prices continued their uncontrolled free falls Monday
due to weak regional currencies and lingering unfounded rumors,
dealers and stockbrokers said today.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, which opened at 4,900/5,100 against the U.S. dollar
in the spot market, fell almost 16 percent to a record low of
5,800 and closed at 5,600/5,900.
</P>
<P>
Stock prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange lost 7.2 percent,
with the composite index closed down 26.317 points at 339.536.
</P>
<P>
Clear signals that President Soeharto had begun to gradually
return to work Monday after rest on medical advice failed to
impress the currency market, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
"People are really losing confidence in the rupiah as they
continue to buy dollars at the current rate, which is believed to
be too expensive," a local bank dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers said if the rupiah continued to weaken or stay at
the current level, it would push more companies toward bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost more than 100 percent of its value against
the U.S. dollar since early this year.

TAIYUAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Fresh fish are now available
in the diets of ordinary folk living on the Loess Highland of
north China's Shanxi Province, something that was seldom seen in
the past.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the fish business has become quite profitable in the
arid province, which now has about 20,000 ha of ponds for raising
fish.
</P>
<P>
The province has established 40 state-run fish farms, and
farmers have added about 500 more, providing 20,000 tons of fish
annually.
</P>
<P>
In addition to ponds and reservoirs, farmers are using areas
along the Yellow and Fenhe rivers. And by using technology, the
varieties of fish have gone from half a dozen to more than a
dozen. More important, carps now provide more than 80 percent of
the province's aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, soft-shelled turtles and shrimps have also
become available in local markets.
</P>
<P>
Government officials attribute all this to improvements in
local people's standard of living.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Prime Minister to Visit China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko will make a five-day official visit to China on
December 22 to help forge economic links with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine and China have expressed the wish to conduct
cooperation in many areas," said Pustovoitenko, who will lead a
delegation of about 30 officials and businessmen. "The main
objective of my visit is to find ways and means to cooperate."
</P>
<P>
He added that the two nations will sign a declaration on
enhancing trade, investment and science cooperation, an agreement
on tariff matters and a protocol on military technology
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Since China and Ukraine established diplomatic relations in
January 1994, trade volume between the two countries has increased
slowly, reaching 955 million U.S. dollars in the first nine months
of 1997, a 109 million dollar increase since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has also enjoyed a surplus of 781 million dollars
during the first nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Its major exports to China are mostly raw materials including
metals and fertilizers, Pustovoitenko said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that Ukrainian tractors, harvesters,
excavators, planes and fishing boats could win a comfortable
market share in China.
</P>
<P>
"Bilateral trade is growing, but there is still a lot of room
for improvement," the Ukrainian prime minister said. He said he
hoped the trade turnover between the two countries could increase
to five or six billion U.S. dollars before 2000.

<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The China Nationalities'
Central Song and Dance Ensemble is to add more realistic
characteristics to their performance on the basis of colorful
ethnic cultures, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
This will make them more appealing to modern audiences, said
Director Li Yushan at a press conference held yesterday to mark
the 45th anniversary of the ensemble's founding.
</P>
<P>
As the only national ethnic song and dance troupe, the ensemble
was designed to preserve ethnic culture and entertain ethnic
people.

<P>
Chinese ethnic songs and dances have recently been very well
received both at home and abroad. The ensemble has been a big hit
this year, despite the lull in the performance market.
</P>
<P>
Li attributed this to the efforts of superb and wonderful
ethnic artists in the ensemble. They have developed traditional
ethnic songs and dances to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, his ensemble will perform new songs and dances
this weekend in Beijing to mark the ensemble's 45th founding
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
In the past 45 years, the ensemble, partly financed by the
State, has performed for ethnic people on meadows, hills, and
playgrounds, and in tents in the most remote border towns.

<HEADLINE> Improving Workers' Quality Crucial To Finding New Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Finding employment for workers
who have lost their jobs largely has to do with personal
qualities, according to an article in today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, workers with university education
account for only two percent of the Chinese labor force. About 30
percent of the new workers in recent years have never received any
vocational training, and only half of the 140 million urban
workers have higher technical skills, while two-thirds have basic
technical skills, the story said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the Beijing Labor Bureau found that 6.23
percent of laid off people have vocational training, and 38
percent of in-service workers have training.
</P>
<P>
In job applications filled out for a Shanghai company, 67.9
percent of the laid-off people said they can only do physical
labor.
</P>
<P>
In China's re-employment projects, many government offices
concentrate on providing job opportunities, and not on improving
workers' quality. Statistics show that 1.6 million laid-off people
received training in recent years, but more than one million
workers needed new jobs every year from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing, however, is changing unemployed
workers' attitudes about re-employment.
</P>
<P>
A women's vocational education center in Shanghai helped build
confidence among its trainees, most of whom had been laid off, and
China will promote re-employment through practical and regular
training, according to Zhang Xiaojian, a Ministry of Labor
director.
</P>
<P>
The country will support training projects for ten million
unemployed people from 1996 to 2000, the story said.

<HEADLINE> Control of Dumping At Sea to Be Tightened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China's State oceanographic
Administration (SOA) is to strengthen supervision of the dumping
of rubbish in the ocean, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
It has decided to introduce a system of recording apparatus on
ships dumping waste.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 50 million cubic metres of solid waste is
discharged each year into the oceans. If each ship were to carry
700 cubic metres on average, there would be more than 70,000 ships
dumping garbage into the sea.
</P>
<P>
In recent decades, the SOA has invested much money, equipment
and personnel in improving the management of ocean-dumping
activities, according to an SOA official.
</P>
<P>
The official said the country had designated special areas for
dumping garbage, and there were regulations on dumping at sea
under the country's Oceanic Environmental Protection Law.
</P>
<P>
To effectively implement the regulations, the SOA and its
branches nationwide have organized technical training for relevant
monitoring and supervision personnel, drawn up management
regulations on the method of implementing a system for recording
dumping at sea.
</P>
<P>
Under the system which will take effect on january 1 next year,
dumping recording machines must be installed on ships before
application can be made to the SOA for dumping certificates, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The recording apparatus will keep a full record of the
navigation routes of ships dumping waste, thus preventing them
entering undesignated areas, and better protecting the ocean
environment and maritime resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
A set of preliminary regulations on the use of equipment
recording the course of dumping ships in the Yellow Sea and Bohai
Bay came into effect on November 19 this year.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that ships designated for dumping in
these two seas must install navigation recording apparatus
approved by the SOA, otherwise the ships will lose their dumping
certificates.

<HEADLINE> Central China Provides "Green Cards" to Laid-off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-three laid-off workers
in Lengshuijiang, a city in central-south China's Hunan Province,
started selling snacks on Jinzhu West Road, converting it to a
well-known "Food Street."
</P>
<P>
These workers, who had been laid off from state-owned
enterprises, are the first to receive "green cards" from the local
government.
</P>
<P>
Issuing "green cards" is one concrete measure taken by local
government in the city's re-employment efforts.
</P>
<P>
The green cards are actually accommodation papers given to
the laid-off workers who have difficulty in supporting themselves.
</P>
<P>
With the papers, cardholders can be self-employed laborers who
enjoy simple formalities and preferential policies from industrial
and commercial, public health and environmental protection sectors.
</P>
<P>
Each year, cardholders pay 1,000-to-3,000 yuan less. Because
the cover is green, laid-off workers call them "green cards".
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhenxi, a green-card holder, said: "All of us are quite
satisfied with it."
</P>
<P>
Lengshuijiang, an important energy and raw material center in
Hunan Province, has more than 50 state-owned enterprises and 7,000
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The city government has issue 500 green cards since March this
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region,
which is home to 2.4 million people, currently has about 60
libraries with a total of one million books.
</P>
<P>
The earliest library after the liberation of Tibet was founded
in 1952 on the basis of an army reading room. In 1958, the first
formal library in Tibet was established, which became the library
of the Tibet Institute for Nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Following that, a number of libraries were established by
research institutes, institutions of higher learning and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
In May of 1995 the Tibet Library, at a cost of 18.43 million
yuan (2.2 million U.S. dollars), became the first regional library
accessible to the general public.
</P>
<P>
The modern library has seven reading rooms with 300 seats, and
the books are catalogued in both Tibetan and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Libraries and publishing houses, and individuals as well, have

<HEADLINE> Vieira Disappointed with Iranian Football Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The temporary head coach of
Iranian National football team Brazilian Valdeir Vieira has
expressed his disappointment to the attitude of Iranian football
officials towards him after the Iranian team obtained the entry
permission to the World Cup 1998 under his guidance.
</P>
<P>
"I found it disappointing when the same people who said to me
that if we qualified, I would go to France were now looking for
other people," Vieira said in an interview with Iran News
published today.
</P>
<P>
Vieira was chosen by head of the Iranian Football Federation as
head coach of the Iranian national football team after Iran was
defeated by Qatar. The Iranian team was qualified for the World
Cup 1998 after it drew the Australian team in Melbourne with 2-2.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't ask for money or anything else but asked for being
kept with the team and go to France if we qualified for the World
Cup finals," Vieira said, and the Iranian football federation
made the promise.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Iranian football officials for their manners with
him, saying that "probably many people here would like to have a
coach they could use like a puppet," but "I have my own principles
and don't let anybody to interfere in my work."
</P>
<P>
Vieira believed that he could promote the capabilities of the
Iranian football if he would stay as its head coach, saying that
the Iranian players play from their very hearts but they use only
20 percent of their brains.
</P>
<P>
"So what I want to do is to extend this brain participation to
40 percent," he added.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the reports that he would find a job in the United
States, saying that "I have some offers at hand but I assure that
America is not in our plans."

<HEADLINE> Friendship Booms between Chinese, Foreign Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- During the last 24 years, 200
Chinese cities have formed more than 800 pairs of sister city
relationships with foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
In 1973 Tianjin formed China's first sister city relationship
with Kobe, Japan, according to a recent meeting on China's
friendly exchanges with foreign countries, which was held in the
capital city of central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
"At that time (such a relationship) implied heavy official
approval, but now the forming of sister cities serves as a major
channel for non-governmental relations," said Bi Huiluo, an
official with the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with
Foreign Countries.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 80 percent of such Chinese cities are located in
the economically booming coastal areas, with Jiangsu and Shandong
provinces accommodating the most.
</P>
<P>
However, with improvements in transportation and investment
conditions in the country's central and western areas, more cities
in wider areas are establishing sister city relationships.
</P>
<P>
Sister cities have enhanced mutual understanding and
friendship, and fostered exchanges and cooperations in industry,
agriculture, economy and trade, and cultural and educational
undertakings, Bi said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 600 trading exhibitions were
held across China during the last five years, with an overall
transaction volume of 6 billion U.S. dollars and nearly 10 billion
U.S. dollars in foreign investment introduced.

The province has used 127 million U.S. dollars of Singaporean
investment in real terms and is expected to share 40 million
U.S. dollars of trade with Singapore this year.

<P>
The Singapore Keppel Fels Company, Ltd. is now cooperating with
the province's Hong Kong-based Jingfeng Company to invite five

</P>
<P>
Hubei will improve the bilateral trade and investment liaison
system, provide good service for investors, and guide Singapore
enterprises to participate in local reform, said Wang Guoyao, a
provincial government official.

<HEADLINE> HK New Airport Marathon Set for Runway Finish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Amateur
Athletic Association (HKAAA) announced here today that it will
organize an international marathon race next February, which will
finish at Hong Kong's New Airport at Chek Lap Kok, Lantau.
</P>
<P>
The HKAAA joined forces with Standard Chartered Bank, the New
Airport Projects Coordination Office and the Airport Authority to
announce that its annual marathon will make a historic departure
from its cross-border tradition to commemorate the new airport
project.
</P>
<P>
The Standard Chartered '98 New Airport Marathon on February 22,
 1998, is expected to attract a record-breaking field of more than
 7,000 local and international athletes, including top-class
runners from Kenya, Canada, Britain, New Zealand, the United
States, China, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
That would make it the largest ever athletic event in Hong
Kong, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The marathon race will be one of the public events leading to
the opening of the new airport.
</P>
<P>
From the eastern end of the Tsing Ma Bridge - the world's
longest road-rail suspension bridge at 1,377 meters, across Lantau
 Island to the end of the new airport runway, the course of the
1998 race will set a spectacular new standard for staging
world-class marathon, HKAAA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since the first Hong Kong-Shenzhen race in 1992, the marathon
has consistently attracted a strong international field. Next
year's race, the first since Hong Kong's handover on July 1, goes
beyond the traditional focus with its landmark setting at the new
airport, Hong Kong's future gateway to the world, according to the
 organizers.
</P>
<P>
And, in addition to the grueling challenge of a full-length
marathon, a shorter, 10-kilometer race will also be staged and
contested along the new airport's runway.
</P>
<P>
On May 4 this year, an international marathon race was staged
from the Tsing Ma Bridge, which is one of the projects of the
overall New Airport Program, and attracted a field of 1,000
runners from home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Irish Prime Minister Predicts Peace Accord by March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern said today that there will be a new political deal for the
British-run province of Northern Ireland by March.
</P>
<P>
The draft of an agreement would include provision for a new
assembly and political linkups involving parliamentarians from all
the parties involved, said Ahern after a 50-minute meeting with
U.S. President Bill Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, optimistic after getting full support from
Clinton, said all sides to the dispute had to make compromises in
order to reach a balanced settlement.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking to reporters after the meeting, Clinton said he
would remain "personally involved in this," and Ahern called him
central to the process.
</P>
<P>
"I intend to stay personally involved in this in whatever way
I can be helpful. I will do anything I can," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Ahern told reporters that he expected parties to the talks to
agree on an agenda of key issues and lay out a format for
addressing it before the Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Ireland have set a deadline in May next year for a
settlement on the dispute over Northern Ireland between
pro-British Protestant and pro-Irish Catholic parties in order to
end the conflict on the province.
</P>
<P>
"There are difficult, difficult decisions that have to be
made, but that's what people who occupy positions of leadership
are hired to do, and the time to do it is now," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between Protestants, most of whom want the
province to remain part of Britain, and Catholics who want
unification with Ireland, has killed more than 3,000 people since
1969.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Northern Ireland Office of Britain announced
that parties to the peace talks for the first time have agreed to
meet in London on January 26 and in Dublin on February 18.

<HEADLINE> Homelessness, Food Requests Grow in US Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Demands for emergency food
and shelter are continuing to increase despite the booming
national economy and low unemployment, according to a report
released by the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing this year that a rising tide doesn't lift all
boats," said Joseph Riley Jr., mayor of Charleston, South
Carolina, and chairman of the task force on hunger and
homelessness for the mayors' organization. "Some aren't seaworthy,
others leak and others have persistent problems that require
support."
</P>
<P>
However, there is one positive note in the study -- that
requests for emergency housing rose this year by just 3 percent,
the smallest increase in the survey's 13-year history.
</P>
<P>
But demand for emergency food rose an average of 16 percent,
the largest increase since 1992. Low wages and high housing costs
were among the factors cited for the surge in grocery requests.
Nearly all the cities expected demand for food and shelter to rise
next year.
</P>
<P>
The study, based on self-reporting by 29 cities, found:
</P>
<P>
-- Emergency food assistance requests increased in 24 of the 29
cities surveyed;
</P>
<P>
-- About one-fifth of emergency food requests were estimated to
have gone unfulfilled;
</P>
<P>
-- Seventeen of the cities saw shelter requests rise, while the
number of emergency shelter beds among all the cities decreased an
average of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Charleston, South Carolina, was cited as a success in reducing
the ranks of the homeless.
</P>
<P>
More common in the report, however, are tales of reduced bed
spaces and tougher eligibility requirements in some homeless
shelters.
</P>
<P>
Of the homeless population, about 47 percent are single men, 36
percent families with children, 14 percent single women and 4
percent minors, the survey found.

<HEADLINE> US Supports Turkey's EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States, reacting
to a decision of the European Union not to accept Turkey as a new
member, said today that Turkey is in Europe and should be in the
EU.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a briefing, U.S. State Department spokesman James
Foley tried to play down the gravity of the dispute, in which both
sides are Washington's close allies.
</P>
<P>
"This may have been a setback in recent days.... We would not
want to draw definitive conclusions from what happened last week,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Turkey's place is in Europe.... We believe
that Turkey ought to have a strong and open perspective on
membership of the EU and we hope that progress can be achieved on
the road," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
The EU, citing human rights, the treatment of minority Kurds,
the Cyprus dispute and cultural differences as obstacles to
Turkish membership, last week decided not to put Turkey on the
formal list of potential candidates for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
However, Cyprus, the greater part of which is run by Greek
Cypriots hostile toward Ankara, is on the list.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to cut its ties with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Foley said EU membership for Cyprus could promote the search
for a settlement on the Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
"The EU accession process offers positive incentives for a
Cyprus solution. And in this regard we take note of the EU
summit's statement language that favors Turkish-Cypriot community
participation in the accession talks," he said.

<HEADLINE> Living Tissues Have Been Grown in Space: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- For the first time, full
living tissues from cartilage-like cells have been grown in
near-zero gravity aboard the Russian Mir station, the Washington
Post reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Although the tissues were viable, but smaller, weaker and more
spherical than its equivalents cultivated on Earth, wrote Lisa E.
Freed, of the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Science and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
Astronaut researchers on board the Mir station last year
isolated several million calf cartilage cells and planted them on
meshes of suture material inside a bioreactor, which kept the
cells supplied with nutrients and removed wastes. They grew for
three months on Earth. Then from September 16, 1996 through
January 22, 1997, some were flown aboard Mir.
</P>
<P>
It is well known that prolonged spaceflight weakens or changes
musculoskeletal tissues in the human body. But "after more than 25
years in space, we still can't explain this," Freed said. The
experiment provides a model for future cultivation of human bone,
muscle and other tissues in space, she said, which could help
scientists understand the mechanisms.

<HEADLINE> US Oil Industry Official Opposes Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Laws prohibiting U.S.
companies from doing business with Libya, Iran and other countries
do more damage to the U.S. economy than to those at which the
sanctions are aimed, a U.S. oil industry official said.
</P>
<P>
"The net outcome is that the United States is restricted from
competing around the world," the local newspaper Journal of
Commerce today quoted American Petroleum Institute chief executive
Red Cavaney as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions have a "quantifiable impact that directly relates
to U.S. jobs and revenues," Cavaney told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The official said the sanction policy sends a warning to other
nations that the U.S. "may not be a reliable business partner for
the future."

<HEADLINE> US Denies Bilateral Contacts With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States has been
having quiet negotiations with Iran on ways of ending the Afghan
civil war, the Washington Times said today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the move indicated a breach of the U.S.
long-standing policy of containing Iran.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley confirmed that
Washington had participated in meetings that the Iranians had also
attended at the United Nations over the issue of the Afghan civil
war.
</P>
<P>
But he denied it was a departure from the U.S. existing policy
toward Iran, saying, "We both belong to the United Nations and
would ordinarily find ourselves in the course of work present in
the same room."
</P>
<P>
Foley said the United States attended meetings because it
supported U.N. Special Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi's initiative to find
ways to bring peace to Afghanistan, and it was nothing to do with
bilateral relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"This is a completely separate issue... about bilateral
contacts" with Iran, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Washington Times, under the auspices of the
United Nations, ambassadors from the United States, Russia, China,
Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekestan and Tajikstan and Iran held
three rounds of talks in New York on the issue of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
With regards to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's call for
dialogue with the American people, Foley said the United States
welcomed the remarks.
</P>
<P>
"We have welcomed the new tone we have begun to hear from the
Iranian president," he said. "We regard the remarks... as a
positive statement."
</P>
<P>
Foley repeated three issues, President Clinton defined earlier
today as the basis for any possible dialogues, which he said were
"support for terrorism, sponsorship of violent opposition to the
Middle East peace process and efforts to acquire weapons of mass
destruction," which the Iranian government has repeatedly denied.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry also said the Clinton
administration welcomed the remarks by President Khatami, saying
"we consider them having been made in a positive way."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Season Visit to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will make a visit to American troops in Bosnia next week, and to
make a case for keeping some forces there beyond the June
withdrawal deadline.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to leave Sunday and most likely go to Tuzla
and Sarajevo Monday to meet U.S. troops and leaders of the Bosnian
federation government, White House spokesman Michael McCurry said
today.
</P>
<P>
The president will be on ground for 12 to 14 hours. He will
give a speech in Sarajevo declaring that an international force
will probably be needed in Bosnia on a "continuing basis,"
officials said. Details of the trip are yet to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance to highlight what's been done and to make people
realize that we have made a real contribution there," a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing I'm doing is going to Bosnia to thank the
American military personnel for being there and for spending their
Christmas there and for the sacrifices they've made to bring peace
to Bosnia and to tell them why it's important," Clinton told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Stabilization Force (SFOR), including 8,000 American
troops, is scheduled to leave Bosnia next June, but Washington and
its allies are considering a follow-on force beyond the deadline.
</P>
<P>
"The president has been with his advisors, thinking about the
future of Bosnia, thinking how much better positioned the future
will be because of the current Stabilization Force mission that's
deployed there," said McCurry.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman told reporters that no decision has been
made on whether to extend the U.S. mission in Bosnia. But he
reaffirmed that there is "a developing consensus" that an
international presence should be in Bosnia beyond June next year.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has been caught between pressure
from Congress wanting a timely pullout and Europeans saying peace
will collapse if all the troops get out.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also visited U.S. troops in Bosnia in January 1996. The
president traditionally makes an appearance with military
personnel during holiday seasons.

DAMASCUS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad held talks here today with visiting U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for Middle East affairs Martin Indyk on the
latest developments particularly the Mideast peace process.
</P>

climate to develop them.
</P>
<P>

at pushing the regional peace efforts forward, especially on the
Syrian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
Indyk arrived in Damascus at noon today as part of his Mideast
tour which covers Syria, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and the
Palestinian Authority territories.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa had earlier had a
meeting with Indyk right after his arrival in Damascus. They
discussed the developments of the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Government Wins Confidence in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government today
won confidence with 51 votes in favor in the 80-member newly-formed
Lower House of Parliament after two-day debate.
</P>
<P>
The 51 members were from pro-government parties and tribes,
Jordan's official news agency, Petra, reported, adding that 15
members voting against were independent Islamists, nationalists
and leftists.
</P>
<P>
Twelve members of the 78 members present abstained in the vote,
Seven of whom were ex-cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
During a speech after the vote, Prime Minister Abdul Salam
Majali said that his government would carry out the king Hussein's
directives and serve the whole kingdom in its best way.
</P>
<P>
Amid the discussion, more than 20 members criticized the
government for normalizing ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Most of the members pressed the government to side with Arab
countries, especially the Palestine, Syria, Iraq and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The current government was appointed in March this year to
supervise the parliamentary election in November.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties and professional associations boycotted the
election and accused it of irregularities, a charge firmly
denied by the government.
</P>
<P>
After the election, King Hussein said in a letter to Majali
that he had full confidence in his prime minister who signed the
1994 Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty during his first term as
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Majali was expected to reshuffle his cabinet to include 12
new members, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Unlikely to Delay New Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., the world's
software giant, is unlikely to delay any products or lose much in
the way of short-term profit because of last week's preliminary
ruling by the U.S. District Judge, the Wall Street Journal
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, in response to a lawsuit by the Justice Department,
prohibits Microsoft from forcing personal-computer makers to
bundle Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser with any Microsoft
operating systems, including the coming version called Windows 98.
That product, which tightly integrates the browser technology is
expected to generate roughly 3 billion U.S. dollars in revenue in
its first two years and is the issue of most concern to investors.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that the ruling would prevent Microsoft
from issuing Windows 98 and Windows NT 5.0 in schedule.
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, a Justice official said the agency would be
satisfied if Microsoft offers a simple and economical way for PC
makers to delete Internet Explorer, even if the product is
shipped together with the current Windows 95 or with Windows 98,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Such a move would give PC makers a choice between Microsoft's
product and Netscape Communications Corp.'s browser, which is
rapidly losing market share, it said.
</P>
<P>
But most manufacturers, including Compaq Computer Corp.,
Hewlett-Packard Co., Dell Computer Corp. and Packard Bell NEC,
said they plan to keep using Internet Explorer along with
Microsoft's operating systems. For one thing, the Microsoft
browser is free, while Netscape charges them an estimated 1 U.S.
dollar to 10 U.S. dollars a copy for its browser.
</P>
<P>
A Microsoft spokesman said that it is still studying whether to
appeal the ruling, but the company believes the preliminary ruling
shouldn't cause it to delay the shipment next spring of Windows 98
in any case.

<HEADLINE> US Airlines to Equip New Ground Warning Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. airlines announced
today that they are installing improved warning systems on their
planes to caution pilots when they approach mountains or are too
close to the ground.
</P>
<P>
The "enhanced ground proximity warning systems" are already in
use in 175 airliners, and will be installed in some 4,300 more by
2003, said Carol B. Hallett, head of the Air Transport
Association.
</P>
<P>
The systems combine a massive worldwide database of terrain
with a Global Positioning System that tracks an aircraft's
position using a set of satellites.
</P>
<P>
The systems calculate the plane's position with great accuracy
and compare that position, altitude and course with the terrain
data to determine if any hazards are nearby.
</P>
<P>
The new systems can issue an advisory of approaching terrain 11
to 16 kilometers ahead. At about 6 kilometers it provides a yellow
display on a screen with an audible warning "caution, terrain,"
and at about 3 kilometers the screen turns red and the voice says
"terrain, pull up."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is planning to require
all domestic airlines and foreign planes flying to the United
States to install the systems.
</P>
<P>
Currently, ground warning systems use a plane's radar to detect
when the ground is too close and warn the pilot to pull up.
However, in some cases the warming was too late for a pilot to
have enough time to recover.
</P>
<P>
A Korean Air Boeing 747 struck high ground and crashed on
landing approach in Guam last August, killing all 226 people
aboard and in December 1995 an American Airlines Boeing 757 struck
a mountainside in Colombia, killing all but four of the 163
aboard.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 10 years there have been 36 crashes killing 2,400
people worldwide that were classified as "controlled flight into
terrain."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Not to Execute Fifth Jordanian: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has informed Jordan
officially that the fifth Jordanian man sentenced to death on
charge of smuggling car parts will not be executed, officials of
the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi decision was conveyed by Iraqi Ambassador to Jordan
Nouri Elwayess to Jordanian Secretary-General of Foreign Ministry
Ibrahim Nagawi during a meeting held Sunday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to spare Ammar Ghaleb Shehabeddine's life came
after Jordan expelled seven Iraqi diplomats in retaliation for
Iraq's execution of four Jordanians last Monday on the same
charge.
</P>
<P>
Car parts are in short supply in Iraq due to the U.N.-imposed
sanctions against its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The seven Iraqi diplomats expelled are scheduled to leave Amman
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Iraq used to be firm allies before and during the
Gulf crisis. However their bilateral ties suffered setbacks after
the Gulf war as Jordan was eager to distance itself from Iraq to
end international alienation.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader: Talks on Cyprus Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Northern Cyprus leader Ruaf
Denktash said today that the intercommunal talks between Turkish
and Greek Cypriots have been killed by the European Union (EU), the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported from Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Tenktash said that the idea of federation is no more at the
agenda after the EU decided to start full membership negotiations
with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Denktash as saying that northern Cyprus will
not hold contacts with the United Nations regarding the
intercommunal talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots,
adding: "EU Representative to Cyprus Jilles Anouil's mission has
come to an end in northern Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
He said, "The Greek Cypriot side tries to claim responsibility
over Cyprus by ignoring the rights of the Turkish community. There
are two states in Cyprus and they have to set up good neighborhood
relations and respect each other's rights, so that they can open
the way for re-unification."
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Denktash added, "Those who accept
our state will come and meet us, and it is just a waste of time
to meet those who do not recognize our state."
</P>
<P>
The EU summit held on December 12-13 in Luxembourg decided
to start negotiations with five central and eastern European
countries--Estonia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Slovenia--as well as Cyprus from next spring on the adhesion
of these countries to the union.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into a southern Greek Cypriot community
and a northern Turkish Cypriot community in 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
Mediterranean island after an abortive pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been making efforts to seek
a solution to the protracted problem, but no tangible results
have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Russia Opens New Page in Ties: Yilmaz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said here today that Turkey and Russia agreed to refrain
from behaviors and attitudes which could threaten the economic
interests and territorial integrity of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz made the remark at a joint press conference with his
Russian counterpart Victor Chernomyrdin following three-hour-long
talks and a signing ceremony of several agreements between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said that his talks on bilateral relations, regional
and international issues with Chernomyrdin, who arrived in Ankara
this morning for a two-day official visit, were "very useful."
</P>
<P>
He said: "We have shared the same points of view to make joint
efforts in developing our economic and trade cooperation as well
as our political relations."
</P>
<P>
He believed that the signed agreements will open a new page in
Turkish-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said that he had accepted the invitation by
Chernomyrdin to pay a visit to Moscow in 1998.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Chernomyrdin said their signed agreements would
enhance bilateral relations, adding that through his contacts with
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and high-ranking officials,
Russia and Turkey have established a basis for dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Under one of the signed agreements, the two countries will join
efforts in the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Russia
to Turkey via under the black sea.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is expected to invest 3.3 billion dollars in the
project, which involves increasing the capacity of an existing
pipeline through Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria as well as laying a
new one from southern Russian under the Black Sea to Turkey's
northern coast.
</P>
<P>
The undersea pipeline, known as "Blue Stream," will pass at a
depth of 2,100 meters under the Black Sea waters.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin will go to Istanbul Tuesday to attend a meeting
with businessmen and will leave Turkey Tuesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE>   Clinton Plans Season Visit to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- United States President
Bill Clinton will make a whirlwind visit to Bosnia to cheer
American troops away from home at Christmas, and to make a case
for keeping some forces there beyond the June withdrawal deadline.
</P>
<P>
Clinton may leave as soon as Sunday night for a day's visit to
Tuzla and Sarajevo, and to meet U.S. troops and leaders of the
Bosnian federation government, administration officials were
quoted as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The president will be on ground for 12 to 14 hours. He will
give a speech in Sarajevo declaring that an international force
will probably be needed in Bosnia on a "continuing basis",
officials said. Details of the trip are yet to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance to highlight what's been done and to make people
realize that we have made a real contribution there," a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
The Stabilization Force (SFOR), including 8,000 American
troops, is scheduled to leave Bosnia next June, but Washington and
its allies are considering a follow-on force beyond the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also visited U.S. troops in Bosnia in January 1996. The
president traditionally makes an appearance with military
personnel during holiday seasons.

<P>
PARIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- France today called for the
continuation of dialogue between the European Union (EU) and
Turkey, after Ankara cut all political dialogue with EU in protest
of its refusal to include Turkey in its enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
France also asked Britain, which will take over the presidency
of EU from January 1, 1999, to solve the problem between EU and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"For us, one should continue the dialogue between EU and
Ankara, and we count on the future British presidency to take the
appropriate initiatives in this regard," said French Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit held on December 12-13 in Luxembourg decided to
start negotiations with five central and eastern European
countries -- Estonia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and

Turkey protested the EU decision and announced the cutting of
political dialogue with EU, the boycott of the EU conferences, and

<HEADLINE> Turkish Chief of Staff Visits Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Chief of General Staff
Ismail Hakki Karadayi arrived here this evening on a four-day
visit to Egypt at the invitation of his Egyptian counterpat
General Magdi Hatatah.
</P>
<P>
He will have talks with senior Egyptian military officials on
means of boosting military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries at the just-concluded Islamic summit in Tehran
had been critical of Turkey's controversial defense cooperation
with Israel. President Suleyman Demirel withdrew from the meeting
one day ahead of schedule to avoid facing concerted bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has joined these countries in voicing grave concern over
the rapidly growing military ties between Ankara and Tel Aviv. The
alliance was capped by a three-day visit by Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to Ankara early this month.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a predominantly Muslim but politically secular state,
has said that its move to develop military cooperation with Israel
will not produce negative impact on its friendship with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel signed two defense and military training
agreements last year to allow joint warplanes exercises in each
other's airspace and use Israel's technology to update Turkey's
tanks and missiles.

<HEADLINE> Britain Set to Ban EU Beef Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- British Agriculture Minister
Jack Cunningham said today the government was set to ban all beef
imports from Europe which fail to meet British health standards.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a decision by EU veterinary experts earlier
today to delay the introduction of new anti-BSE controls at
abattoirs across Europe for three months.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham told BBC radio he would table orders in parliament
this week "to ensure that no beef comes into Britain from January
1 unless it has been subjected to the same rigorous standards as
our own beef."
</P>
<P>
"We took this decision quite properly in July in the council of
agriculture ministers. There was a Commission decision which was
effectively EU law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to implement it unilaterally on behalf of the
United Kingdom to make sure beef coming in is as safe as the beef
we have at home," he added.
</P>
<P>
The British government is under heavy pressure from farmers
because of low beef prices, largely due to the continuing EU ban
on exports of British beef.
</P>
<P>
The EU could no longer justify its ban on UK beef exports, he
stressed. The ban was imposed by the EU in March of last year
after the existence of mad cow disease was announced by the
British government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Continues Surging in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. industrial
production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities
increased 0.8 percent in November, the Federal Reserve said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted growth pushed the industrial operating
rate from 82.9 percent of capacity to 83.2 percent, which is the
highest rate since September 1995.
</P>
<P>
This report comes just one day before Federal Reserve
policy-makers are scheduled to meet to set short-term interest
rates. Most economists believe the Federal Reserve is likely to
retain rates steady into early next year.
</P>
<P>
Propelled by gains in the output of computers and motor
vehicles, the November production advance was the sharpest since
July and marked the 20th month without a decline.
</P>
<P>
"Information processing equipment and parts used in
high-technology equipment contributed notably to the gain," the
Federal Reserve said. "In addition, the production of motor
vehicles, which had declined some in October, increased sharply."
</P>
<P>
Output of appliances, carpeting, furniture, aircraft, chemical
products, construction supplies, lumber, electrical machinery and
food products also picked up.
</P>
<P>
Production at factories alone rose 1 percent, the best
performance since April 1996. Output at mines and oil wells fell
0.2 percent and at utilities, 0.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> UK's Butchers Petition Parliament over Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Angry butchers presented a
petition to parliament today in a last ditch bid to stop the
government from banning sales of beef on the bone.
</P>
<P>
The petition was signed by 100,000 consumers wanting T-bone
steaks, ribs and oxtails to remain in their dinner tables. The
government decided last week to ban the beef on the bone for fear
of mad cow disease. The order will come into effect on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Federation of Meat and Food Traders Chairman, John
Fuller, told reporters the number of signatories was "very
encouraging," especially given the short space of time available
to arrange it.
</P>
<P>
The conservative MP, Bill Cash, who supported the protest, said
the new order to ban the bone beef was panic measure which
undermined confidence in British beef and meat producers'
livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham is
meeting fellow European Union agriculture ministers in Brussels to
discuss plans to lift the ban on British beef exports which was
imposed by the EU in March 1996.

<HEADLINE> Air France to Sell One Third of Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- France's national carrier Air
France will sell one third of its stocks to its employees and
investors in stock markets in an unprecedented privatization
project which is expected to begin in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Air France president Jean-Cyril Spinetta told the press today
that his company will sell 20-25 percent of the stocks in stock
market to obtain "a stable quotation" and ensure the value of the
stocks to be owned by its employees.
</P>
<P>
The employees can also choose to subscribe to the stocks when
they are sold in the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The company will have to obtain the green light from the
Ministry of Economy before it can sell its stocks to the market,
and the exact amount of the stocks to be sold by the company is
unknown yet.
</P>
<P>
An earlier refusal by the Socialist government to privatize the
company resulted in the resignation of its former president
Christian Blanc three months ago.

<HEADLINE> Global Diabetes Cases Forecast to Double by 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of diabetes cases in
the world is forecast to nearly double to reach 220 million by the
year 2010, according to a report published today.
</P>
<P>
The report by the British Diabetic Association (BDA) said that
in 1995 the number of people with the illness was estimated at 123
million, but over the next 13 years, the cases will increase
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
It said that the main reason for the rise is a rapid change in
lifestyle and population demography, with growing obesity,
Western-style diets, less physical exercise and a rising elderly
population all contributing.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that in Asia and Africa diabetes could
become two to three times more common than it is now, and by 2010,
it is forecast that Asia will be home to 61 percent of the total
global number of people with diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Paul Zimmet, one of the authors of the report, said that "with
the unrestrained forces of economic globalization and
industrialization, the prevalence of diabetes is likely to
dramatically increase in the next millennium".
</P>
<P>
He added that the corresponding burden of complications and
premature mortality resulting from diabetes will constitute a
major public health problem for most countries.

<HEADLINE> Baimler-Benz, Ford, Ballard To Join Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Daimler-Benz AG of Germany,
Ford Motor Company of the United States and Ballard Power Systems
of Canada announced today that they would pool their resources and
know-hows to accelerate the development of fuel-cell technology to
power future vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The three companies signed a memorandum of understanding today
in Stuttgart, Germany, with the expectation that final agreement
will be reached within a few months.
</P>
<P>
With the agreement, Ford would participate in the existing
partnership between Daimler-Benz and the Canadian company which is
the world leader in the development of proton exchange membrane
fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
Fuel cells, which generate electricity from hydrogen and oxygen
to power vehicles, have the potential to provide the size, range,
roominess and speed of conventional cars and trucks while emitting
almost only water vapor into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
With the new alliance, the three companies aim to bring to
market the first complete fuel-cell system for vehicles by the
year 2004.
</P>
<P>
"This cooperation is an impressive evidence of the fact that
the fuel cell represents a serious and promising alternative to
the conventional combustion engine," said Daimler-Benz leader
Juergen Schrempp today in Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
Ford Chairman Alex Trotman also said: "With our collaborative
efforts, we think we can accelerate the commercial viability and
implementation of fuel cell vehicles."
</P>
<P>
Ford is planning to invest about 420 million U.S. dollars in
the joint project. Daimler-Benz and Ballard are expected to put a
combined investment of more than 331 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents Claim 167 Lives Since December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite South African
traffic authorities's effort to stem the high number of deaths on
roads during the festive season, accidents have already claimed
the lives of 167 since the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
In one of the worst accidents, nine people were killed when a
minibus taxi was involved in a head-on collision with two other
cars at Cambridge, near East London, in Eastern Cape Province on
Saturday, Arrive Alive Information Center (AAIC) spokesman Joshua
Raborifi said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Raborifi said that road accidents have claimed the lives of
1,084 people since October this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the AAIC was appealing to pedestrians to be cautious
when crossing traffic lines and to wear bright colored clothes
when walking at night.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-six pedestrians had been killed since December 1.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is believed to be the kingdom of automobiles in
Africa. However, the developed and busy traffic have also
resulted in heavy casualties throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Major contributory factors to the high number of casualties
were related to overspeeding, driving under the influence of
alcohol, not wearing seatbelts and fatigue.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Urged to Curb Official Privileges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
been urged to take measures to drastically curtail the
extravagant lifestyle of government officials which is
undermining the national economy.
</P>
<P>
In a front-page story today, the official newspaper New
Nigerian quoted National Economic Intelligence Committee Chairman
Sam Aluko as complaining that "their consumption habit only helps
to boost the economies of other nations where our wealth is
repatriated".
</P>
<P>
Slamming such wasteful privileges, Aluko said the proficiency
of public officers showed in their long fleet of cars, number of
hours and the size of estacodes, which are the allowances given
to them for their travel outside the country.
</P>
<P>
All these are maintained at the public expenses, according to
the chairman, whose committee is a government agency mandated to
supervise the country's economic activities and give consequent
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the former Zaire, Nigeria had the highest estacode
in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Even the United Nations doesn't pay as much as the over 360
U.S. dollars a night which Nigeria pays its officials!" Aluko
told a recent New Nigerian forum.
</P>
<P>
"A situation where ministers travel out with more than 200,000
dollars as estacode is not obtainable even in the most developed
economies of the world," he said, adding that available records
show that the highest amount the United States and United Nations
pay officials is about 180 dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
The chairman cited his committee's discovery, saying that what
public officials spent on "invisible services" in the first
quarter of this year alone was equal to the spending on similar
services throughout last year.
</P>
<P>
He wondered how the budget deficit could be curtailed if such
attitude persisted.
</P>
<P>
Aluko also condemned the practice of travelling out with a
retinue of officials, "including some members of the press who
only come back to sing the praises of the officials".
</P>
<P>
The flamboyance of the public officers only adds to the drain
on the country's resources, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"If we plug some of the leaks in the system, we will be one of
the richest in the world," the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
He thus suggested drastic curtailment of official privileges,
saying that public officials should use their own cars and be
made to pay their rents.
</P>
<P>
"With the exception of the head of state and the chief of
general staff who should be accorded all the protocol and
privileges of office, all other public officials should pay their
rents and telephones," Aluko said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Form New Cabinet within Two Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's military leader
General Sani Abacha will form a new cabinet by the end of this
month, a senior military leader has said.
</P>
<P>
Rear Admiral Mike Akhigbe, chief of the naval staff, made the
assurance on Sunday while paying a visit to the Bayelsa State
Administrator, Navy Captain Omonyi Caleb Olubolade.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe, who was there to endorse the list of the executive
council (cabinet) nominees submitted by the state, explained that
the presidency is taking its time in screening the nominees,
especially as the transition to civil rule program is now at a
critical stage.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha sacked his cabinet on November 17, the fourth
anniversary of his leadership. He explained that this was
necessary to ensure the success of the transition program and to
allow some cabinet members to contest in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Three ministers were immediately renamed, which included
Financial Minister Anthony Ani, Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi and
Lieutenant-General Jeremiah Useni, Minister of the Federal
Capital Territory. But the delay in naming other cabinet members
has caused wide concern.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Will Make S. Africa Prosperous: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
has expressed confidence in his deputy Thabo Mbeki as his
successor to lead South Africa into prosperity as both president
of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and of the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Mandela said Mbeki was a man
of "exceptional qualities who would put the ANC at a level that
it has never reached before", adding that "Unlike me he is a
diplomat."
</P>
<P>
Mandela will step down as president of the ANC at the party's
annual congress due to be started Tuesday in Mafiken, capital of
North West Province. Mbeki is the sole candidate for the
position.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has also put his stamp of approval on the current ANC
national chairman Jocob Zuma's candidacy for the deputy
presidency of the ANC. Zuma was an "absolutely outstanding
leader," Mandela noted.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that the 50th ANC national conference
is crucial to the transformation process that will take South
Africa into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the five-day meeting would offer the ANC a chance
to reflect on the party's achievements and drawbacks since it
came to power in the 1994 general elections.
</P>
<P>
In addition to setting up the party's new leadership, more
than 3,000 delegates will also discuss other important issues,
including economic and social transformation, the role of the
state and governance, peace and stability as well as
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
They will also work out strategy to prepare for the 1999
national elections without Mandela.

ABU DHABI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- France and the UAE are
expected to sign a billion-dollar-worth warplane deal during
French President Jacques Chirac's two-day visit which began here
today, an informed source said.
</P>
<P>
The source, close to the French Embassy here, said the UAE has

<P>
The warplane deal is worth some 3 billion U.S. dollars and it
is part of a UAE 80-fighter package, said the source.
</P>

its air force.
</P>

MOSCOW, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia launched another
military satellite of its series into orbit from the Plesetsk
launching site in northern Russia at 18:40 local time on Monday,
according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The satellite belongs to the Yantar subseries of the Kosmos
series. Fitted with photographic equipment, Yantars are used to
monitor international accords to limit or reduce armaments.
</P>
<P>
Yantars, which are developed by the Central Socialized Design
Bureau in Samara, have undergone at least two upgrades since the
first Yantar went into space in December 1974.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s the Soviet Union launched six or seven
Yantars a year. This made possible practically continuous
monitoring since each satellite stayed in orbit for 55 to 59 days,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, because of recent financial problems, Russia launched
only two satellites in 1994, another two in 1995 and only one last
year.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's State Assembly Election Sparks Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The National Centre Party of
Nigeria (NCPN) has rejected the results of last Saturday's state
assembly election and threatened to reconsider its participation
in the military government's transition to civil rule program,
media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
NCPN is the second of Nigeria's five political parties that
has voiced their protest over the election, which saw a landslide
victory for the United Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP).
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party of Nigeria (DPN), which came the second
in the election, Friday threatened to return its registration
certificate to the government in a protest over alleged
manipulation of the election.
</P>
<P>
The party is reportedly under pressure from its state chairman
to boycott the rest of the transition program.
</P>
<P>
The NCPN's decision was made at a national caucus held at the
weekend in Abuja to review the election.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued after the meeting and signed by its
national chairman Magaji Abdullahi said the NCPN "observed with
regret that the outcome of the elections during this transition
period has become so manifestly predictable and lopsided in favor
of one of the five political parties."
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the party has decided to hold a national
consultative forum Thursday in Abuja "to review its position and
participation in the rest of the elections during the transition
program".
</P>
<P>
In a related development, reports said the Transition
Implementation Committee will meet in Abuja today to hear the
report of its members who has monitored the election.
</P>
<P>
The committee is expected to discuss the latest development
after the election and to make its recommendations to the
government, reports said.

The schemes include a World Food Program (WFP)-sponsored food
aid to the displaced in the northern districts of Kitgum and Gulu
and other employment and income generating activities such as

The Ugandan government, non-government organisations and U.N.
agencies and the displaced people are all in favour of the
food-for-works schemes, according to the newspaper.

CAIRO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Switzerland today
signed an agreement to secure a loan of 80 million Swiss francs
(some 54.75 million U.S. dollars) to Egypt for development
projects, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Egyptian Minister of State for
Planning and International Cooperation Zafer el-Beshri, and,
representatives of the Swiss Federation Council and the Swiss
Banking Group.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be extended to Egypt in two phases - the first 40
million Swiss francs will be presented as a grant, the remaining
40 million francs as soft credits from Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
The money will be channeled for development programs such as
the setting up of blood banks, water pumps in southern Egypt, and
electricity projects.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a Swiss representative after the signing
ceremony as saying that the agreement showed his government's
keenness to maintain cooperation with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The November 17 "regrettable" terrorist attack that killed over
30 Swiss nationals will not affect the traditional relationship
between Swiss and Egyptian peoples but will rather provide an
incentive for them to face up to such crimes with strength and
determination, he said.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Switzerland, Britain, Japan and Scandinavian
countries discouraged their citizens from travelling to Egypt on
the heels of the Luxor massacre which killed 58 foreign tourists
and four Egyptians last month.

freshwater resources, continued momentum to protect the oceans
and an environmentally sustainable global energy strategy need
more than urgent consideration in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
As the world's freshwater resources are both finite and
irreplaceable, the report said, wider inter-governmental dialogue
on fresh water is now long overdue if the most vital of natural
resources are to be preserved.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the unique "fair share" approach currently being
pioneered in Africa should serve as a model for the wider
international community.
</P>
<P>
The approach, based on environmental protection, economic
development and social equality, is designed to ensure adequate
and clean water supplies for all.
</P>
<P>
On the protection of the oceans, the report pointed out, a
Global Program of Action for the Protection of the Marine
Environment from Land-based Activities is being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
As 1998 marks the International Year of the Ocean, the world
community needs to think about the inter-relationships between
new action on the oceans, the UNEP regional seas programs, the
International Law of the Sea and the urgent need for
environmentally sustainable fisheries management.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the global energy strategy, the report noted that
energy is a key to development but at present its by-products are
the main drivers of global warming, damaging the air quality in
cities and polluting the oceans.
</P>
<P>
It stated that UNEP should enhance its work in the field of
cleaner industrial production and at the same time continue to
test environmentally sound technologies and share the results
through a clearing-house.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, "to date no environmental issue has
emerged which is beyond the capacity of humankind to resolve."
</P>
<P>
In order to tap this human ingenuity, the report said, UNEP
should above all build the will to affect environmentally
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
In the view of the report, "the strongest weapon available to
environmentalists is an informed and concerned civil society."
</P>
<P>
UNEP will continue to promote changes in lifestyle, enabling
world citizens to understand that "their daily choices are, in
the end, what will decide the future of the planet."

<HEADLINE> Israel Cautiously Welcomes Khatami's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli leaders cautiously
welcomed today the moderate remarks made by Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami calling for dialogue with the American people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing in the Knesset (Parliament), Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel welcomes any substantive
changes coming out from Iran, adding that it is still too early to
see whether there will be such changes.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu noted that Iran's ballistic and non-conventional
missile threats on Israel still exist, so Israel would continue
making every effort to eliminate such threats.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, a moderate who came to power in the May presidential
elections, told a news conference in Teheran Sunday that he had
"respects to the great people of the United States" and hoped to
begin a dialogue soon with American people in order to get closer
to peace, security and tranquility.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after attending a meeting of the Knesset
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai said he welcomed the moderate remarks made by Khatami,
noting that he expected real changes in Iran's policy toward
Israel.
</P>
<P>
"While we don't find any changes (in Iran's policy), we're
glad to see there will be any changes in Iran, especially we have
to follow on to see if there are any real changes in the
directions. We'll be glad if that will happen, I'm not sure,"
Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
While avoiding publicly naming Iran as Israel's enemy,
Mordechai pointed out that Iran still has a strategy to threat
and destroy Israel. He said he hoped one day this will be
changed.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Levy is reported to convene a meeting within
his ministry to deliberate Khatami's intended rapprochement with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, the Foreign Ministry noted that Khatami still had made
some strong anti-Israeli statements during the recent summit of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference held on December 9-11
in the Iranian capital Tehran.
</P>
<P>
If Iran changes its hostile policy toward the U.S., it is
expected to have dramatic implications on Iran's relations with
Israel, which has been listing Iran as the No. 1 threat to its
existence.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been making strenuous efforts to try to prevent Iran
from developing long-range ballistic and nuclear missiles that can
reach Israel in case of an attack.

<HEADLINE> Fast Train Delayed on Second Day of Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The 300-kilometer fast train
service starting from Brussels was delayed today on the second day
of its inauguration due to a strike waged by train conductors.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing trains were delayed by some 30 minutes, according to
local television RTBF reports.
</P>
<P>
The commercial service, known as Thalys and started on Sunday,
linked Brussels with Paris, Amsterdam and Cologne with greatly
reduced travel times.
</P>
<P>
The delay was caused by the strike after SNCF, the French
national railroad company, refused to reconsider the claims by
train conductors to have their pays raised.
</P>
<P>
The strike came unexpected as the fast train service was
inaugurated grandiosely by Belgian King Albert II and Queen Paola
last Wednesday first in Belgium and then in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The fast train service, with departures every hour in each
direction, cut the travel time from Brussels to Paris by more than
half an hour to one hour 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
It is hailed by the European Union as a showcase of its
improvement of the single market infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The upgrading of the train is part of a collaboration among
Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Germany to overcome national
borders and make the train competitive with air travel.

<HEADLINE> 60 S.Leonean Refugees Feared Drowned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- About 60 fleeing Sierra Leonean
refugees were feared dead after the canoe they were using to
cross the Mano River to reach Liberia capsized over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The independent star radio in monrovia, capital of liberia,
today quoted one of the survivors as reporting that the victims
of th weekend tragidy are mostly women and children, who seemed
screaming for help after the canoe overturned.
</P>
<P>
The refugees were fleeing with renewed fighting in
northeastern Sierra Leone between troops of the military junta
and traditional hunters known as Kamajors.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corporation today reported that one
of the bodies of the dead had been found but it is not yet clear
whether rescue workers have managed to get to the scene of the
accident.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted eyewitnesses as saying that the junta forces
had attacked the Kamajor positions at several points over the
past couple of days in eastern Sierra Leone, burning down a
number of villages.
</P>
<P>
The latest upsurging fighting has forced hundreds of Sierra
leoneans to flee across the border, swelling the liberian border
town of kango.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, jet fighters belonging to the Liberia-based west
African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG were reportedly seen
flying to the direction of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, ECOMOG warned the illegal regime in Sierra Leone
to stop its unprovoked attacks on civilians or face consequences
of its actions.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Makes Headway in Sugar Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- South African sugar
production has increased in the 1996/97 season, according to a latest
survey by the South African Sugar Association.
</P>
<P>
Th survey shows that in the 1996/97 season, 2.2 million tons
of sugar was produced by the country's 47,000 growers. Of this,
1.2 millions was consumed domestically and 995,630 tons exported.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings for the season were worth 229 million U.S.
Dollars.

Mainly due to drought, South Africa exported just 123,173 tons of
sugar in 1992/93, nothing in 1993/94, 347,507 tons in 1994/95, and
375,653 tons in 1995/96.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A two-day conference on
intergrated development in southern Africa opened in Chinhoyi,
north Zimbabwe today, urging countries in the region to support a
new form of regional collaboration which is people oriented and
encourages genuine development.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Chairman of the Zimbabwe Intergrated

region should adopt policies that were people centered, eradicate
poverty and promote a compatible educational system which aims at
promoting regional collaboration among people at the grassroots
level.

''The history of collaboration is largely apparent at the
levels of heads of states and the governments through such
organisations as the Southern African Development Community
(SADC),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The governments, he said, must mostly ensure that poverty
eradication and full employment are achieved as that will improve
opportunities for people to interact.
</P>
<P>
The conference, being attended by more than 100
representatives from Botswana, Zambia and the Democratic Republic
of Congo will discuss, among other things, the prevailing low
income levels and poverty, constraints to regional intergration
and the severe deterioration of national economies.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches, the participants agreed that while
intergrated development in the region could be persued by the
governments and institutions, the governments should draw their
policies mandate from regional collaborative processes to realise
genuine intergrated development.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM: Turkey's Reaction to EU Decision Unwise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioanuis Kasoulides said here today that Turkey's reaction to the
European Union's (EU) decision to exclude Turkey from enlargement
process is not wise.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Kasoulides said the EU decision is
historic for Europe as well as for Cyprus. "We are fully
satisfied because the decision officially reaffirms the EU
commitment of March 1995 to begin accession talks six months
after the end of the Intergovernmental Conference," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that if Turkey accepts the European
principles, then this would provide the framework for a Cyprus
solution and good neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
"A positive response on the part of Turkey would contribute
toward conditions of security and stability in the region,"
Kasoulides added.
</P>
<P>
On Turkey's threats to annex the northern part of Cyprus, he
said Cyprus and Greece will deal with any Turkish reaction within
international law and order.
</P>
<P>
"We are dedicated to the start of accession talks, and we
believe and expect these will begin as scheduled for March
1998," Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit decided on Saturday in Luxembourg to exclude
Turkey from the present enlargement process on grounds that it
does not meet the standard of the European bloc.
</P>
<P>
But the EU invited Turkey to attend the European Conference
scheduled to be held in Britain in March. However, the invitation
was rejected by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz announced Sunday that
Turkey will cut off its political dialogue with the EU and speed
up its integration cooperation with the Turkish Cypriots on the
Cyprus island if the EU starts accession negotiations with the
Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated South and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled North since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today he was "quite encouraged" by Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami's call for dialogue with the American people so as to
cover relevant issues that separate Iran and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I was quite encouraged by Mr Khatami's statement, and it was
welcomed," Clinton told reporters during a photo session with
visiting Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
"I would like nothing better than to have a dialogue with Iran,
as long as we can have an honest discussion of the relevant
issues."
</P>
<P>
Clinton defined those issues as "sponsorship of terrorism,"
"violent attack on the Middle East peace process" and the
"development or acquisition of weapons of mass destruction," which
were categorically denied by the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Khatami called for a "thoughtful dialogue" with the American
people in Teheran Sunday, saying, "I take this opportunity to pay
my respects to the great American people, and hope to have a
dialogue with the American people and about the United States in
the not too distant future."
</P>
<P>
His remarks were seen as the most conciliatory by an Iranian
leader toward the United States since the 1979 Islamic revolution
that led to severing of its diplomatic relations with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said the Clinton administration would
consider an authoritative proposal to see if it would lead to a
"positive dialogue." But he said the key to any relationship would
be changes in Iran's actions, which he did not define.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Makes Progress in Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) has made significant achievements in
the implementation of the decisions adopted at the Earth Summit
held in Brazil five years ago.
</P>
<P>
A Biennial report for 1996-1997 issued here today by the UNEP
Secretariat said that with fewer resources than before, UNEP had
addressed increasing problems of environmental degradation during
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The report listed major achievements towards the
implementation of Agenda 21 adopted at the summit as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- UNEP published its first Global Environment Outlook at the
beginning of 1997, which ushers in a new era in environmental
assessment and international scientific collaboration on data
collection.
</P>
<P>
-- It has advanced a broad-based chemicals agenda to greatly
enhance the protection of the world's peoples and environment
from potentially dangerous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
--The organization has been at the forefront in the
implementation of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the
Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete
the Ozone Layer.
</P>
<P>
-- It has supported the launch of 188 national, sub-regional
and regional cleaner production initiatives in 61 countries as a
part of its program of sustainable production in industry.
</P>
<P>
-- It has encouraged financial services institutions to
incorporate environmental considerations into their business.
</P>
<P>
-- The organization has prepared International Technical
Guidelines for Safety in Biotechnology which were finalized and
adopted in Buenos Aires at the 1996 Conference of the Parties to
the Convention on Biological Diversity.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the mandate for the environmental
body has been renewed and strengthened during the 1996-1997
biennium.
</P>
<P>
The special session of the U.N. General Assembly for overall
review of the implementation of Agenda 21 held in June this year
decided that UNEP should be an effective coordinator for all
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the role of UNEP in his report to the 51st U.N.
General Assembly, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that
UNEP should serve as "focal point for harmonization and
coordination of environment-related activities".

<HEADLINE> Clinton Names Lee Civil Rights Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite Republican
opposition, U.S. President Bill Clinton named Bill Lann Lee acting
assistant attorney general for civil rights at a White House
ceremony today.
</P>
<P>
Under threat of retaliation, Clinton did so instead of making
the more controversial recess appointment that bypasses the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
Republicans had blocked Lee's confirmation procedure because of
his support of affirmative action programs -- a formal effort to
provide increased employment and education opportunities for women
and ethnic minorities, to overcome past patterns of
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who was also designated counselor to the attorney general
for civil rights enforcement, can serve as acting head of the
division until the end of Clinton's term.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Lee, 48, who has served since 1989 at the Legal
Defense and Educational Fund in Los Angeles of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), will
have the same authority as if he was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he will send Lee's nomination to the Senate again
early next year and he remained hopeful that after senators see
Lee in action, they will vote to confirm him.
</P>
<P>
He said he still looks forward to "to striking the word
`acting' from his title."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said there is "no one whose life story or impeccable
credentials" make him better suited for the nation's top civil
rights enforcement job."
</P>
<P>
Lee, the son of Chinese immigrants, will become the first
Asian-American to hold the civil rights position.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he made the acting appointment rather than a
recess appointment to help Lee's chances of getting confirmed
later.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today urged new approaches to be taken to solve the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan also called for
new approaches for the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities to start a sustainable process of negotiations as
early as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I remain convinced that it is essential to adopt new
approaches and ensure that the two community leaders will enter up
a continuing and sustained process of negotiations that will focus
on the preparation of the actual legal instruments that will
constitute the settlement," the secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Annan gave details of UN sponsored talks held at
Troutbeck, New York, from July 9 to 12, and at Glion, Switzerland,
from August 11 to 15, between the the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since 1974 when Turkish
troops took over the north of the island in response to a coup in
Nicosia engineered by the military junta then ruling Greece.

</P>
<P>
The plane, with 77 passengers and nine crew members on board

<HEADLINE> Over 600 Nigerian Policemen Arrested for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- About 650 policemen and 52
customs men across Nigeria have been arrested for corrupt practices
since a crack squad was set up in February 1994 by the
inspector-general of police.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 206,000 naira (about 2,600 U.S. Dollars) has
been seized extorted from people, the News Agency of Nigeria reported
today, quoting police sources.
</P>
<P>
Also apprehended are 46 vehicle inspection officers, 26 road safety
inspection marshals, 29 immigration officers and 19 local government
staff, with their extorted money.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the police announced the dismissal of 350 men and
officers for various offenses ranging from extortion to flagrant abuse
of office.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation of corrupted practices among officers in
uniform is still grave in the country, partly due to the poor quality
and pay of the police force.
</P>
<P>
To make things better, the police announced earlier this month the
setting up of in-house anti-corruption squads in its renewed bid to
identify and cleanse the force of bad eggs.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, corrupt officers will be dismissed if
0h_irmed.

<HEADLINE> Iran Confirms Arrest of Freedom Movement Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian official news
agency IRNA this evening confirmed the arrest of Secretary
General of Iran's Freedom Movement Ebrahim Yazdi.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted "reliable sources from the Judicial branch" as
saying that Yazdi was under detention according laws and norms
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Movement issued a statement earlier today saying that
Yazdi was summoned by the Islamic Revolutionary Court Sunday for
investigations and was put into Tehran's famous prison of Evin
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It said that so far no official charges were announced
against Yazdi, former Iranian foreign minister of the interim
government led by late former prime minister Mehdi Bazargan
after the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian informed source told Xinhua through a telephone
call that Yazdi was arrested possibly on a charge of having
"illegal political activities" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Movement was founded in 1961 by Bazargan and
fought against the former Iranian Shah regime. It joined the
first government after the Islamic Revolution but withdrew from
it due to some differences with the late Iranian Supreme Leader
Ruhollah Mosavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim Yazdi was elected as secretary general of the party
in January 1985 after Bazargan's demise. However, the party was
not granted formal permission to have activities since the
country announced to register political parties and organizations
in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Military Conflict With Turkey Not Possible: Greek Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos today ruled out the possibility of a military
confrontation between Greece and Turkey, saying that it was "an
ineffective way" to resolve problems.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki today,
Tsohatzopoulos said that if they avoided provocative actions,
showing that they were in control of whatever situation arose,
conflict was not the most effective way to resolve issues and no
reasonable person would ever suggest it.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that a conflict would be unavoidable if Turkey
tried to overturn Greece's sovereign rights in the region and
violate its national space.
</P>
<P>
The recent increase in violations of Greek airspace by Turkish
fighters would be resolved within the framework of the new NATO
structure agreed upon in Brussels last week, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new NATO structure, he said, would act as "a safety valve"
since no aircraft belonging to any member state would be able to
enter Greece's national security area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
today that Turkey's threats, including that to annex northern
Cyprus, were seen in a negative light by the European Union and
were "a dead-end policy."
</P>
<P>
Turkey made the threats after it failed to be named candidate
for the EU membership in recent days.
</P>
<P>
As for the experts of committees set up in May by the two
countries to review their differences, the spokesman said that the
process was now frozen.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Announces Anthrax Vaccination for Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen has decided that the American military's 1.5 million
men and women should be vaccinated against anthrax as a
preparation against germ warfare, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
The inoculations will include six shots over 18 months. About
2.4 million people will be vaccinated over a six month period
because of the movement of men and women in and out of the force,
the Pentagon said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The first shots will be given this coming summer to about
100,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines deployed to "high
threat" areas.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon made the decision based on America's concern of
biological or chemical warfare threat against U.S. troops at home
or overseas.
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 of the more than 500,000 U.S. troops in the Gulf
War in 1990 and 1991 were given anthrax vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration and
has been in use since 1970.

<P>
ANKARA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Twelve people were killed and
eight others injured today when a minibus hit a land mine in
southeastern Turkey, local private TV Star reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the minibus was shuttling between two
villages in Mardin town in the region when it hit a land mine
early this morning reportedly planted by the rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Among the people who died in the explosion were women and
children, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish security forces launched a large-scale
operation against the PKK late Sunday in and near Mountain Cudi,
close to Sirnak province linking northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The operation began after a tip-off that a group of PKK
militants had infiltrated into Mountain Cudi from northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government troops have been carrying out a
cross-border operation in the area for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
Turkish fighter planes heavily bombarded Mountain Cudi and
nearby areas late Sunday while the Turkish security forces began
a ground operation early Monday with the aim of blocking all
escape routes the PKK rebels from Turkey into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>

autonomy in eastern and southeastern Turkey, which has claimed
over 28,000 lives since August 1984.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's chief
pro-British Protestant leader, David Trimble, said today he had no
intention of meeting with his rival leader Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
"I have no intention this week, next week, next month, so far
as one can see into the future of having a private meeting,"
Ulster Unionist (UUP) leader Trimble told reporters, scotching
speculation that he might hold talks with Adams, leader of the
Irish Republican Army's political wing Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
Trimble and his delegation are in talks with most of the
province's parties to devise ways of ending years of guerrilla
strife in Northern Ireland. But they refuse to have direct talks
with the Sinn Fein party.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair held a historic meeting with Adams
last week in Downing Street to demonstrate his wish to keep up
momentum in the search for a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards Sinn Fein leaders said the next key stage in
cementing a fragile peace must be a meeting with Trimble.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hopes of a breakthrough in the Northern Ireland
peace talks suffered a setback with another deadline passing and
no accord was reached.
</P>
<P>
The parties held their last meeting for this year today but
failed to finalize a list of key issues for next year's talks.

DAR ES SALAAM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian former
President Julius Nyerere today called on Sub-Sahara African
leaders to unite and promote regional economic integration in a
bid to get rid of Western influence.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the international conference on "Reflections on
Leadership in Africa: 40 Years after Independence" in Dar es Salaam,
Nyerere said that African continent would develop only if its future
leaders practice self-reliance and exploit its own abundant resources
in the coming 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said that the leaders should be selective in taking the
investment to boost their economy instead of those to devastate it.

Praising South Africa as the engine of African economic
development, the veteran African politician said that most of the 53
nations in the continent were in south Sahara and were too small to
stand on their own.
</P>
<P>
"If the number of the countries is power, Africa would be one of
the most powerful continent in the world," he said. "Hence, we need
co-operation."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Repatriate Three Congo (K) Generals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is
considering to repatriate three former Zairean generals who had
allegedly planned to overthrow the new government of President
Laurent kabila, police said today.
</P>
<P>
Investigating officer inspector Thethiwe Ntjana said the three,
Mavua Madima, Kpama Baramoto and Ngbane Nzimbi, would be repatriated
to their country of origin, unless they applied for refugee status in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The three former generals were arrested near Johannesburg
Saturday following an extensive South African inv'4c3pwnYwto
=YZ9Pctivities.
</P>
<P>
They are being held on charges relating to entering South Africa
with illegal passports.
</P>
<P>
"We have no jurisdiction to put them on trial here," Ntjana said.
"They are prohibited persons, which means they are in the country
illegally."
</P>
<P>
Intelligence Ministry spokesman Helmut Schlenter said in Pretoria
that the probe into the three generals was launched after Kabila in
August presented the South African government with a list of names of
former Zairean military personnel who fled to South Africa after
Mobutu Sese Seko was overthrown in May.
