<HEADLINE> Levy-2ndadd: Netanyahu Regrets Over Levy's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua)-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has expressed regret over resignation of his Foreign
Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement broadcast by local radio this evening,
Netanyahu hoped Levy would reconsider his decision to leave the
government.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy announce Sunday in Tel
Aviv his resignation from the government led by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, creating a political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Levy said he will send his
resignation letter to Netanyahu right after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Levy said he made this decision after serious considerations
and he is no longer a cabinet member after sending his resignation
letter to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Giving his reasons for resignation, Levy said the proposed
1998 state budget does not address the country's social and
economic problems, particularly the sufferings of the low income
families and these people really needed for support.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the government for ignoring the promises made
to him last Summer in formulating the the state budget and
for lacking the positive intention in moving the Middle East
peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
In his agreement reached last Summer with the government,
Netanyahu promised to allocate about 100 million U.S. dollars as
special budget for Levy's Gesher (bridge) Party to address the
problems of development towns and underprivileged neighborhoods
in the 1998 state budget.
</P>
<P>
Levy also said that another reason for his resignation is that
many cabinet members did not support his policy of resuming peace
talks with the Palestinians, particularly the implementation of
the Hebron Agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, Levy's resignation would come into effect 48
hours after his resignation letter to the prime minister. So the
prime minister still has two days to persuade him to change his
mind. But it seems that Levy would be unlikely to go back as he
had made very harsh criticisms of the government.
</P>
<P>
With the resignation of Levy from the government, Netanyahu
only enjoys a marginal majority of 61 seats in the 120-member
parliament. Levy's Gesher Party has five seats in the
parliament in which Netanyahu has escaped narrowly several
no-confidence motions in the past several months.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition the Labor Party has already announced that
it would make another no-confidence motion in the parliament
against Netanyahu next week. If the Labor succeeds in winning the
motion, elections would be held within two months.

today issued a notice on the abolition of 29 administrative
fees on Chinese enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions August First
Rockets kept their lead in the Chinese first division basketball
league from the season most scoring game in the 12th round on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rockets won in the road 110-63 over the struggling Zhejiang
Squarrels thanks for illustratious performance of Wang Zhizhi and
Linan, both in the national squad.
</P>
<P>
But American Mike King pulled back for the Squarrels to shorten
the gap to 10 points midway in the first half before the
star-stunned Rockets pulled away to finish the half with 54-30.
</P>
<P>
With the start center Yu Leping absence for injury, Squarrels
surrendered the inside to Wang, who is the best and most potential
center in China.
</P>
<P>
The Shandong Flaming Bulls were still in the touch with a
well-deserved 69-56 win over Beijing Ducks, trailing the Rockets
with one point on the standings.
</P>
<P>
The Ducks played a turnover-plagued game in Jinan, Shandong
province, while the home team steered from a 14-all tie to lead
all the way to the final victory.
</P>
<P>
Playing with double-center tactics for both, Flaming Bulls
proved more steady on Ji Minshang and Gong Xiaobin after Ba Teer
was benched for four fouls earlier in the second half, leaving
teammate Shan Tao struggling in the inside in vain.
</P>
<P>
No surprise sparked in the debuts in a new year of the national
top basketball league as all the winning teams underlined the
second stage with their superiority over rivals in the first round.
</P>
<P>
All the hosts lose their advantage of the local partisans and
arenas except for Shandong, seeing Jinan Army Pegasus beaten by
Liaoning Hunters 60-57, Sichuan Pandas trounced by Guangdong
Tigers 81-72, Shenyang Lions overpowered by Jiangsu Dragons 80-65,
and Lianhang Eagles edged by Shanghai Sharks 72-62.

<P>
ANKARA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) is expecting a positive reply to its peace
call from its rival Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), Turkey's
Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a PUK statement as saying that PUK leader
Jalal Talabani sent a letter to KDP Chairman Massoud Barzani
Thursday, seeking a broad reconciliation in a bid to set up a
permanent peace in northern Iraq, but had so far received no
answer from the KDP leader.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Talabani expressed his hope that
Barzani will give a "positive reply" for the future and freedom
of the Kurdish people in the region.
</P>
<P>
In the letter to Barzani, Talabani also proposed a high-level
meeting between the two factions to sort out their disputes.
</P>
<P>
The two groups agreed on their latest ceasefire in November
after Talabani's forces attacked KDP positions.
</P>
<P>
The two contenders have been fighting for the control of
northern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War when the Iraqi government
was rendered ineffective by the U.S.-led allied forces to exert
influence there.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's UNIP Condemns Continued Detention of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's largest opposition
party, the United National Independence Party (UNIP), today
condemned the continued detention of its leader and former
president Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing at UNIP's headquarters at the Freedom House
here, UNIP National Chairman General Malimba Masheke told
journalists and more than one hundred party cadres that his party
"strongly condemns the continued and unjustified detention of Dr.
Kaunda."
</P>
<P>
He said shifting Kaunda from prison to house arrest has not
improved Kaunda's conditions and that Kaunda's house has been
turned into a prison because the former president is not free to
see his family members or to communicate with the party members.
</P>
<P>
The government wanted to associate Kaunda with the abortive
military coup and tried to make the nation believe that he is
involved in the coup attempt so as to justify his detention, said
Masheke.
</P>
<P>
It is "intolerable and unacceptable" to imprison an "innocent"
person, said the UNIP national chairman.
</P>
<P>
As for the on-going state of emergency, Masheke said that the
ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) and its political
leaders as well as the police take advantage of the state of
emergency to "settle old scores and neutralize the opposition".
</P>
<P>
UNIP called on the government to lift the state of emergency
and stop using it to "harass" the opposition and the media,
Masheke stated.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was arrested last December for alleged involvement in
the country's coup attempt and was later shifted to house arrest.
Earlier reports said that Kaunda's party has threatened to send
the "old man" back to prison because of his present "worse"
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Besides the 73 year-old former president, 90 people have been
detained under the state of emergency declared by President
Frederick Chiluba following the October coup which aimed to
topple the government.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Breeding Chinese Fish to Control Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is breeding a Chinese
fish species for the purpose of curbing the weed menace at
Harare's main water supply source, Lake Chivero, some 40
Kilometers outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
Troubled for years by the water weed, particularly the
Hyacinth, authorities at Lake Chivero have tried many ways to
save the water body from choking without much success.
</P>
<P>
On-going experiments have proved that the Grass-Cup fish would
be effective in controlling the weed as the laboratory pond is
free from grass, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Manyame Fishing Cooperative Chairman Millias Chimutu today
said the fish eats up all sorts of weed, but has to be strictly
controlled as it could grow into a menace itself.
</P>
<P>
An official of the national parks said controlled breeding is
being done in a laboratory and periodic checks would be done to
ensure numbers do not exceed a certain limit.
</P>
<P>
''If we allow the fish to breed more than we can control it
can upset ecology in the lake and we will be very careful,'' he
said.

<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said today negotiations between the European Union (EU) and
central European countries which have applied for the membership
may be completed by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks would be more difficult than those which led
to Austria, Sweden and Finland joining the EU in 1995, Cook told
BBC television in an interview. It took three years for the three
countries to complete negotiation on the membership.
</P>
<P>
"Those were prosperous countries, small countries, all of them
net contributors (to the EU budget)," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"It is going to take at least that timescale to bring in the
larger countries of central Europe who are of course poorer and
raise particular difficulties for the European budget because of
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
A 15-member EU summit meeting in Luxembourg last month invited
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus
to begin negotiations on joining the union.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary also said his country wanted to set a
"people's agenda" for Europe during its sin-month presidency of
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Britain wanted to "tackle issues that worry people -- jobs,
crime and the environment -- and show Europe can be part of the
solution to the problem," he added.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Welcomes US Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat today expressed welcome to
the U.S. efforts in moving the Middle East peace process forward,
the Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC) reported,
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who presided over the PNA cabinet meeting in Jericho,
an self-rule city in the West Bank, said that he was delighted
that the U.S. government decided to send its Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross to the region at such a critical time, adding
that he will discuss with Ross problems the peace process faces
next week when they meet.
</P>
<P>
JMCC, an East Jerusalem-based Palestinian news center, also
quoted Arafat as saying that he will travel to Washington on
January 22 to hold talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on the
Middle East peace process, particularly the issues concerning the
Israeli second troop's redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
During the Washington talks, he will explain in detail to the
U.S. Administration about the PNA's stand relating to the Israeli
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Sha'ath, PNA Planning and International Cooperation
Minister, told a press conference in Jericho today that maps
prepared by Israel about the redeployment could pose serious
dangers to the security of the PNA and the neighboring Arab
states, because Israel's intention of protecting Jordanians from
a Palestinian state is an attempt to damage the relations between
the Jordanian and Palestinian peoples.
</P>
<P>
According the redeployment plan proposed by Israeli National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, a 20-kilometer-wide security
zone must be set up in the Jordan River Valley, separating the PNA
and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath strongly denounced this plan, saying it is like a knife
being put onto the back of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Ross has reportedly postponed his visit to Israel and
the Palestinian self-rule area from Monday to Tuesday at the
request of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu due to
political crisis in the Israeli government.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Moi Declared Re-Elected as Kenyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Electoral Commission (EC)
of Kenya declared today that incumbent President Daniel arap Moi
has won his final five-year term in the just concluded general
elections.
</P>
<P>
The president elect will be sworn in here tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
Official results based on 201 out of Kenya's 210
constituencies showed that so far Moi has garnered 2.446 million
votes (40.12 percent), followed by Democratic Party (DP) Chairman
Mwai Kibaki with 1.896 million votes (31.09 percent). National
Development Party leader Raila Odinga took the third place with
only 665,725 votes.
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old Moi who has been in power since 1978, has also
managed to win 69.38 percent of the votes in Rift Valley
Province, 73.08 in North Eastern Province, 44.67 in Western,
61.05 in Coast, 35.87 in Eastern, 23.52 in Nyanza, 20.56 in
Nairobi and 5.59 in Central Province.
</P>
<P>
Moi holds the record as the longest serving president, vice
president and member of parliament in the history of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"Moi is like a giraffe, while others are like ordinary small
animals. When they are busy grazing down there, the giraffe is
seeing very far," said late opposition FORD-Kenya Chairman
Jaramogi Odinga.
</P>
<P>
"Moi is a person who can stand on a tight rope, juggle with 20
balls and still manage a smile when the pressure is on," the
Kenya Times newspaper quoted an authoritative international
magazine as saying.
</P>
<P>
Also described by the western press, Moi is the last of
Africa's "Big Men" who believe that Africans have always had
their own way of dealing with issues and need no advice from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Moi has made his own footprints in the sands of time," said
former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during her visit
to Kenya in January, 1988.
</P>
<P>
He is also seen as a prominent peace-broker and active
regional cooperation advocate in the Great Lakes region and
eastern Africa --with his famous Nyato philosophy -- peace, love
and unity.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Tugen sub-group of the minority Kalenjin
ethnic confederation, Moi was born to the first wife of Kimoi
Chebi on September 2, 1924 in Kurieng'ewo village, Sacho, Baringo
district in Rift Valley Province.
</P>
<P>
He was the fourth and last child and named Toroitich. After
two years of his birth, his father passed away. Moi was brought
up by his mother and one of the elder brothers.
</P>
<P>
At 10, he walked some 28 miles (45 kilometers) every day to
reach Kabartonjo Africa Inland Mission School, and, after the
long walk home, he helped his mother tend the cattle and goats
daily.
</P>
<P>
It was in Kabartonjo that in October 1936, shortly before he
changed schools, Toroitich was baptized into Daniel as a
Christian.
</P>
<P>
First he transferred to another African Inland Mission School
at Kapsabet in 1938 and later to the Government African School,
Kapsabet, where he was the School Football Team Captain.
</P>
<P>
In 1939, Moi took up his first salaried job when he was hired
to drive two head of cattle from Kabarnet to Kapsowar, some 75
miles away. The pay was 2.50 Shillings. "I used it to buy a
Bible," Moi recalled.
</P>
<P>
In 1945, he went to the nearby Kapsabet Teachers Training
College after which he was posted to Kabarnet Intermediate School
as a teacher and became headmaster there in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Moi made his political debut in October, 1955 at the age of 31
when he was nominated as a member of the Legislative Council
which then only included five Africans.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU) party was
formed in 1960 and Moi became chairman.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed Education Minister in the pre-independence
coalition government of 1960/61.
</P>
<P>
When KADU was dissolved in 1964 following a merger with the
Kenya African National Union (KANU) led by late President Jomo
Kenyatta, Moi was appointed Home Affairs Minister.
</P>
<P>
Since January 1967 when he was appointed as Kenyatta's vice
president, he had became almost colorless member of the cabinet
who rarely "put a foot wrong," and operated in the deep shadow of
the larger-than-life Kenyatta until August 1978 when Kenyatta
died in Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Moi succeeded to the presidency peacefully with vows that he
would follow in Kenyatta's footsteps. As an astute chess master
in politics, he included his political foes in his cabinet and
thus quelled their hostility toward him as he built a solid base.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, an attempted coup led by Kenya Air Force officers was
crushed by forces loyal to Moi in just three hours.
</P>
<P>
Moi bowed reluctantly to pressure from donors and opposition
groups and introduced multi-party politics in 1991, but bitterly
blaming it for what he perceives to be an upsurge in tribalism,
violence and other social evils.
</P>
<P>
However, he won the first democratic multi-party elections in
December 1992 with 36.8 percent of the vote against seven rivals.
</P>
<P>
Moi is a regular church-goer and is said to start his working
day as early as five in the morning every day.
</P>
<P>
Father of two girls and five boys, he divorced his wife in
1976 and has not remarried.

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes Jordan for Observing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran today criticized Jordan for
its decision to send observers to the forthcoming Israeli-Turkish
maneuvers in the Mediterranean, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said that
Israel wanted to regionalize its expansionist policies through the
military cooperations with regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan made the decision to observe the Israeli-Turkish
military exercises in the Mediterranean at a time when most Muslim
countries announced their opposition to the joint maneuvers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the Islamic Republic of Iran
expressed its unpleasantness towards the decision of the Jordanian
government and believed that the joint maneuvers would fail to
achieve the objectives.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite military exercises of Israel, Turkey and the
U.S. is scheduled to be held in the eastern Mediterranean on
January 5-9 in accordance to a military cooperation accord signed
between Israel and Turkey in February, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Iran and most Arab countries have expressed great concern
over the military cooperation between Israel and Turkey and the
Eighth Islamic Summit held here last month adopted a resolution
calling for reconsideration of military cooperation between
Islamic countries and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's recent decision to take part in the maneuvers as an
observer has drawn strong attacks from the Islamic countries,
particularly its neighbors such as Syria.
</P>
<P>
They believed that Jordan's move would help Israel to continue
its aggressions against Arab and Islamic countries and the peace
in the region.

<HEADLINE> Head of French Liberal Democratic Party Rules Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Alain Madelin, the president of
Liberal Democratic Party, a splinter party from the Gaullist PRP,
said Sunday that his party will not ally with the extreme-right
National Front (FN) in the regional elections in March.
</P>
<P>
"There will not be agreement on the table or under the table
with the National Front," said Madelin, who was finance minister
under the former government of Edouard Balladur, in a television
interview.
</P>
<P>
He also said that one should "fight one by one the ideas of
the National Front in a calm and tranquil way" and not "yield to
an anti-FN hysteria."
</P>
<P>
He suggested addressing the supporters of FN "with the weapon
of reason" during the regional elections.
</P>
<P>
Madelin also linked the adoption by France of the Amsterdam
treaty with the issue of controlling immigration, as France is
preparing for a constitutional amendment in order to sign the
Amsterdam treaty which predicts an enlarged European integration
in political, social and economic fields.
</P>
<P>
Some French political groups have called for a referendum on
the Amsterdam treaty, as they argue that the treaty concerns the
sovereignty of France in the field of immigration, border and
asylum.
</P>
<P>
"If the government wants that we move forward constitutionally
toward the Amsterdam treaty, it should reverse the Chevenement law
on immigration," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new liberal immigration law presented by Interior Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement and adopted by the left-dominated National
Assembly last month has met with strong opposition from the
rightwing parties.
</P>
<P>
However, Madelin judged it unnecessary to hold a referendum on
Amsterdam treaty prior to a constitutional amendment, because he
said it is not "a fundamental point" like the adoption of the
Maastricht treaty by France in 1992.
</P>
<P>
President Francois Mitterrand organized a referendum on
Maastricht treaty in September 1992. A weak majority of 51 percent
of the French voters supported it.

<HEADLINE> Levy-Writethru: Levy's Resignation Deals Fatal Blow to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The days of the Israeli
government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might be
numbered following today's dramatic resignation of Foreign Minister
David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Levy, Netanyahu's long-time leading political rival who has
threatened to leave the government for six times since
mid-1996, made it clear today that he was no longer crying
wolf this time.
</P>
<P>
Although technically, Netanyahu still has 48 hours to
persuade Levy to change his mind, Levy said his decision was
final, thus shutting the door tight for possible reversal of
his action.
</P>
<P>
He cited two reasons for his decision: the government's
violation of social principles by ignoring the plight of
increasing number of the poor and underpreviliged, and its
inaction to push forward the peace process according to the
signed peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Levy's resignation culminated the current crisis triggered by
the stormy debate and inner wrangling within the coalition over
the proposed 1998 budget, which includes massive cuts in public
welfare expenditure. Levy's Gesher Party has been lobbying for
support among the poor population in order to increase its
political clout.
</P>
<P>
The burst of Levy's anger toward Netanyahu came after he
found out that he was largely ignored by the prime minister
who was preoccupied with wooing several influential religious
parties within the coalition by promising fat deals.
</P>
<P>
While it is still too early to pronounce the end of
Netanyahu government at the time, politicians and analysts
believed this is the beginning. In the absence of the Gesher,
which has five seats in the 120-member Knesset (Parliament), the
coalition's majority will be reduced down to the minimal 61
votes needed to keep going.
</P>
<P>
At present, even if Netanyahu fails to keep Levy within
his government, he could still get the budget passed during
the scheduled Monday vote in the Knesset because he has
secured the two votes of the rightist Moledet Party in the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
The only problem is whether the three hardline members from
Netanyahu's Likud Party, Zeev Begin, Uzi Landau and Reuven
Rivlin, will cross the party line in order to pressure
Netanyahu to be tougher on deciding the pending troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But even Netanyahu survives the blow by Levy's resignation,
no one doubts the chance of early elections in Israel has
greatly enhanced. Mark Heller, a political researcher from the
Jaffa Center of Strategic Studies of Tel Aviv University, said
the Netanyahu-led coalition was far more vulnerable than before
due to Levy's resignation.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
Michael Kleiner, a Gesher lawmaker who strongly backed Levy's
action, agreed that the chance for ousting the Netanyahu
government was greater than ever now.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Beilin, lawmaker of the leading opposition Labor Party,
also said that likelihood of early elections is much closer
following Levy's resignation. He appealed to Netanyahu to step down
automatically, citing that he would not last for long since he
would be subjected to more blackmailing by the hardliners within
the government in future.
</P>
<P>
Heller analyzed that it is more likely that 80 lawmakers
will line up to oust Netanyahu to hold new election only for
the prime minister without dissolving the Knesset. Most lawmakers
are more willing to hold early election for only the prime
minister while retaining their Knesset seats. The Israeli law
stipulates that if 80 lawmakers vote against the government,
only new election will be held only for the prime minister
without dissolving the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
So the options for Netanyahu to keep his rule are limited
now: either postponing the budget vote to buy more time to
calm Levy's anger, or surrendering to more pressure of the
hardliners on issues concerning the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli law, Netanyahu can put off the budget
vote until March 31. This will allow him to gain more
maneuvering room to solve the budget crisis by adjusting the
allocation of funds. It will pay off if he could convince
Levy to rescind his resignation.
</P>
<P>
If resorting to the second option, Netanyahu will be again be
cornered soon when the government has to deal with the explosive
issues on the second troops redeployment in the West Bank and the
Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The United States is demanding for urgent actions by the
Israeli government to push forward the stalled peace process. If
Netanyahu bows to pressure of the hardliners, other moderates
within the government, such as the popular Defense Minister
Yithzak Mordechai and The Third Way's Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani, will also be forced to quit over further
stagnation in the peace process and bring down the government
consequently.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan and Tajikistan reached
five accords on Sunday, in particular an intergovernmental
agreement on mutual payments for the delivery of goods and gas
supplies in 1998 and Tajikistan's national debt, according to the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a one-day visit by Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov to Tashkent Uzbek President Islam Karimov told a press
conference that the Tajik debt reached 180 million U.S. dollars by
January 1, 1997. But now "it is more a matter of mutual payments
than of debt payment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik debt fell by nearly 30 million U.S. dollar in 1997,
the president said.
</P>
<P>
Karimov said the two sides had an understanding on all issues
such as the internal settlement in Tajikistan, the situation on
the Tajik-Afghan border, the status of Russian troops and regional
security.
</P>
<P>
They also signed a joint communique and agreements on
cooperation in public health, culture, humanitarian aid, science,
technology and information.
</P>
<P>
The Uzbek president meanwhile noted that Tahskent does not want
Tajikistan to become an Islamic state, which would be dangerous
for the people of Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov arrived to Tashkent this morning on a one-day working
visit to Uzbekistan.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Promised to Combat Illegal Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said here today that Turkey was ready to cooperate with Italy
to combat the illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in response to his Italian counterpart
Lamberto Dini's letter concerning latest illegal immigration of
Turkish nationals to Italy.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that the current problem is a case of illegal human
smuggling which is an extremely serious form of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
"This criminal activity is based on the exploitation of the
understandable desire to have a better life," Cem said, adding that
Turkey has consistently sought multilateral cooperation against
all forms of organized crime and international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to cooperate with our Italian counterparts on
all possible joint efforts," Cem said.
</P>
<P>
Cem said "We are taking all measures needed to stem illegal
immigration as an organized crime, through or from Turkey."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Turkey has started to investigate
whether the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) is involved in
the illegal traffic of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war in southeastern
Turkey since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
On December 27 of last year, the Turkish vessel Ararat
with 800 Kurdish refugees on board reached waters near Catanzaro,
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Interior Minister Murat Baseskioglu said that Turkey
had taken measures on its borders and was negotiating with the
Italian authorities to resolve the problem, adding that Turkey
was ready to welcome back Turkish citizens.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that around 2,000 Kurdish refugees had
arrived in Italy's Adriatic coast since September.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Incumbent Daniel arap Moi is
scheduled to be sworn in as president for the next five years,
the Kenya News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Commission of Kenya today declared Moi the
winner of the presidential race of the 1997 General Election
which took place on December 29 and 30.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and
President Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania will attend the swearing-in
ceremony to be held at Nairobi's Uhuru Park.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after a Sunday service in Nairobi, President Moi told
worshippers today that the just-ended General Election was free
and fair, and asked the opposition leaders to accept the election
results.
</P>
<P>
Three local election observers' organizations said Saturday
that although there were enormous logistical and administrative
problems, "the results do on the whole reflect the wishes of the
Kenyan voters."
</P>
<P>
After Moi was officially declared the winner of the
presidential election, three defeated presidential candidates
rejected the results, claiming that the poll had been rigged.
</P>
<P>
But, Mwai Kibaki of Democratic Party, Raila Odinga of National
Democratic Party and Charity Ngilu of Social Democratic Party
said that they had not yet decided what course of action to take.
</P>
<P>
Moi was due to meet British Prime Minister Tony Blair tonight
when Blair was expected to make a stopover in Nairobi on his way
home from a holiday in the Seychelles.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Erupts in S. Leone's Second City </HEADLINE>

<P>
LAGOS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting broke out this
morning in Sierra Leone's second city Bo in the southeast with
exchanges of artillery fires between forces of the military junta
in power and their Kamajor militia opponents.
</P>
<P>
Casualty figures are yet to be known and there are conflicting
reports from both sides, with each saying they are in control of
the city, according to the British Broadcasting Corporation
monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors claimed that several soldiers of the military
government force were killed and fighting was still raging.
</P>
<P>
However, sources closed to the government maintained that the
four-hour fighting had been over before the Kamajors were
repelled. They said the city was now quiet and that there was no
casualty of the government troops.
</P>
<P>
The military government in the capital Freetown also said
reinforcements would be sent to Bo immediately.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors, a group of traditional hunters fighting for the
restoration of ousted president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, launched a
new offensive against the junta just before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The civil defense group, active in areas near the border with
Liberia, also threatened to cut off all the main roads of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Iran Breaks Post-revolution Isolation (by Rong Song) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The year 1997 saw an Iran
reaching out to its Arab neighbors and countries in Europe,
scoring marked successes in breaking the isolation it had been
trapped in since its 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
This all started with the change of leadership in the
country. A moderate clergyman, Mohammad Khatami, was elected as
the country's president by a landslide in May. The new president
gave Tehran a face-lift, and, with unprecedented popular support,
held out the olive branch to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
He did exactly what his predecessors had done before, but this
time his message was duly received and positively responded.
</P>
<P>
First came the Europeans. The European Union (EU) decided in
November to end a half-year-long diplomatic standoff with Iran by
returning their ambassadors to Tehran. The diplomats had been
recalled in April in unison as a sign of protest, after a Berlin
court accused Iranian leaders of involvement in the murder of
Kurdish dissidents in Germany five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the U.S,, which persisted in isolating and containing
Iran, the European countries preferred an approach of "critical
dialogue" to keep their traditional relationships with the oil-
and gas-rich country they see as a business bonanza.
</P>
<P>
There followed the Arabs as well as Islamic leaders across the
world. The Eighth Summit of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) held December in Tehran provided a god-blessed
opportunity for that to happen.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the summit, Khatami sent his foreign minister, Kamal
Kharrazi, on a historic mission to regional states to roadshow
Iran's foreign policy and lobby for their leaders' presence at the
OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi went out of his way to convince the Arabs that Iran
poses no threat to them, but rather can be a good neighbor. With
equal, if not more, zeal, he tried to drive a wedge between the
Arabs and the U.S., by citing the tattery Middle East peace
process as a proof of U.S. ulterior motive in the region.
</P>
<P>
This effort paid off. More than 30 presidents, vice presidents,
emirs, crown princes and prime ministers gathered in Tehran on
December 9-11 to discuss the challenges and problems facing the
Muslims, as well as the role of Islamic countries in the future
world.
</P>
<P>
Iran further tapped the summit to its full. Bilateral talks
on improving ties were held with old foes and long-standing
estrangers across the board. Iraq was eager to be one, and Saudi
Arabia and Egypt, the two close allies of the U.S. which oppose
Tehran's export of Islamic revolution, were also on the list.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Tehran lost no time to boast "there is a new
amicable atmosphere in the region for Iran to develop friendly
relations and cooperation with the regional countries."
</P>
<P>
Ironically though, the Americans actually helped in Iran's
drive to break isolation. Failing to exert more pressure on Israel
and push forward the Middle East peace process, the U.S. was blamed
by many Arabs for its biasedness and double-standardness.
</P>
<P>
Its credibility was further hurt by trying, in its revised
d'Amato act, to tighten the extra-territorial screws on foreign
companies that are found to pump more than 20 million dollars into
Iran's oil and gas projects.
</P>
<P>
The arbitrary and high-handed U.S. stance drove an infuriated
Europe rebellious. In September a consortium led by France's oil
giant Total clinched a gas-development accord worth 2 billion
dollars with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). Paris was
quick to the aid of Total by countering the U.S. threat of
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Tehran's global-warming diplomacy is also felt in the ice age
of relations between Iran and the United States. There already
have been advices for U.S. policy changes toward an Iran under a
new and moderate leadership.
</P>
<P>
What becomes obvious is that it is not in the interest of the
U.S. to continue or worsen the present situation of relations
between the U.S. and Iran, now that Washington's isolation and
containment have proved ineffective, observers warned.
</P>
<P>
Rhetorics aside, Washington and Tehran have started sending
signals and taking tentative steps to whittle down hostility. On
November 14, Khatami expressed hope to have a dialogue with the
"great American people," to which U.S. President Bill Clinton
responsed "I would like nothing better than to have a dialogue
with Iran as long as we can have an honest discussion of all the
relevant issues."
</P>
<P>
This past year marked a good beginning of the Khatami
government in Iran, most conspicuously in the field of foreign
relations. But it is without doubt that doubled efforts are
required to keep the current course from roller-coastering.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Industry,
Economy and Finance Dominique Strass-Kahn said Sunday that France
will see good performance of its economy in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We should have a very good year in 1998, not for all the
people because there are jobless people in very difficult
situation, but globally, the French economy will have a good year
in 1998," said Strauss-Kahn in an interview with TF1 television
station Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
He predicts "good consumption, good investment and in the
second half of the year a very considerable drop of unemployment
rate."
</P>
<P>
"There can always be the difficulties but I think that at the
point where we are today, we are on a good slope," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the economic outcomes of the months which have
just passed supported the economic policy adopted by the Socialist
government since last June.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn also expressed his confidence that the draft law
on 35 hour work week plan presented by the Socialist government
will be adopted by the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Israel to Hold More Maneuvers in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Israel are planning to
hold more joint maneuvers in the Mediterranean in an effort to
enhance their coordination, the Anatolia News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the Turkish General Staff, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, were quoted as saying that Turkish and
Israeli military officials are to discuss the details of the
exercises in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
They said that the naval exercises involving Turkey, Israel and
the United States, which are scheduled to start on January 9, have
been code-named "Reliant Mermaid I."
</P>
<P>
The three-way exercises, which have been postponed several
times, prompted harsh criticism from Iran and the Arab countries,
which accuse Ankara of forming military alliance with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been trying to play down the significance of the
joint exercises, describing them as "a routine search-and-rescue
operation."
</P>
<P>
Two frigates, one helicopter along with 800 sailors from the
Turkish Navy are to participate in the upcoming maneuvers,
military sources said.
</P>
<P>
One destroyer and one helicopter from the United States and
two Israeli warships will be involved in the long-expected naval
war games.
</P>
<P>
Jordan announced Sunday that it would take part in the
Turkish-Israeli-U.S. maneuvers as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has also received an invitation to send observers,
refused to attend the disputed war games apparently due to fears
that its image in the Arab would be damaged if it was involved in
the maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The quickly growing Turco-Israeli military cooperation has
aroused uneasiness among the Arab countries, which termed Turkey's
move as a betrayal of the interests of the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, however, has repeatedly stated that the Turkish-Israeli
military cooperation is not directed against any third country,
saying that such a cooperation is aimed at promoting peace and
stability in the region.

<HEADLINE> French Minister Backs Early Voting Age at 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of National
Education Claude Allegre Sunday expressed his support to early
voting age giving all the youths of France the right to vote at 16
instead of 18.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made at Europe 1 television channel, Allgre said
that the youths of today are different from those of the 1950s, as
they become mature earlier now and have a greater need to be
recognized, to express themselves and to get involved in things.
</P>
<P>
"At 16, we should ask them to choose their nationality. At 16
equally, when they commit offenses, we stress their
responsibility, and we thus treat them as citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
The French government will start from January 15 an
experimental plan to check violence in schools in several chosen
rough urban areas across the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is to prevent first... and then hold dialogue and make
effort on civic moral education," he said when talking about the
program. "But it is also to remove the troublemakers from the
place where they exercise violence."
</P>
<P>
As for how to deal with the delinquents, Allegre said that it
is "simply to educate them and reinsert them (in society)"
rather than "excluding them and turning them into savage
beasts."
</P>
<P>
In his New Year good wish speech, President Jacques Chirac said
that there is too much violence in schools, streets and public
transport trains and buses in France.
</P>
<P>
Riot by teenagers took place in the eastern city of Strasbourg
on New Year's eve, which greatly shook the country.

<HEADLINE> Playwright Pens Chinese Version of "Schindler's List" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Shu, a member of the China
Film Association, suggests the production of a Chinese version of
"Schindler's List" to reflect the efforts of foreigners to rescue
local residents during the Nanjing Massacre approximately 60 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also a playwright, has completed a script outlining the
experiences of 20-odd foreigners living in Nanjing in December
1937 when Japanese troops savagely massacred 300,000 Chinese
citizens living in the city.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, the foreigners, including John Rabe, the
German social activist who witnessed and recorded the fascist
atrocities in his diary, helped to rescue a greater number of
people than Schindler, a man who helped thousands of Jewish people
escape Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Schindler's exploits were adapted into an Oscar-winning movie
in the 1990s, and his name has since been universally
acclaimed. Nonetheless, the deeds of Rabe and a number of other
foreigners in China remain virtually unknown, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the foreigners then living in Nanjing were
real heroes. For example, one American rescued more than 1,000
wounded Chinese soldiers, while another American protected an
untold number of Chinese women from rape and death, and in turn
encouraged them to challenge the bitter hardships.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts to prevent and guide against the revival of militarism
is a very important international subject," according to
Zhu. Critics hold that the subject matter of Zhu's proposed film
bears equal importance with that of "Schindler's List".

<HEADLINE> Nagano Winter Olympics Receive 71 Entry Forms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 71 countries and
regions have submitted entry forms to take part in next month's
Nagano Winter Olympics, organisers said in Nagano on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It would make the Games the biggest in terms of the number of
participating countries and regions if all of them send athletes
after qualifying the standards set by international winter sports
federations.
</P>
<P>
A record 67 countries took part in the last Winter Olympics in
Lillehammer, Norway, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Nagano Games will also be the biggest in terms of the
program -- 68 sports including three new events like women's ice
hockey, curling and snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, Mongolia and Portugal have recently asked for the
qualifications of their athletes approved for the Games which were
held from February 7 to 22, the Nagano Olympic Organising
Committee (NAOC) said.
</P>
<P>
Final confirmation of the number of countries would be made
after January 26 when national Olympic committees submit the names
of the athletes they plan to field.
</P>
<P>
A total of 82 committees initially accepted invitations to take
part in the 18th Winter Olympics, the second to be held in Asia
after the 1972 Games in another Japanese city -- Sapporo.

<P>
SOFIA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- People are swarming into ski rinks
in Bulgaria, making this season the best for the country's ski
industry after years of recession.
</P>
<P>
Pamporovo, one of the biggest ski resorts in Bulgaria, reported
having received over 10 thousand skiing fans each day since
January 1, the highest record in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
As a result, restaurants and hotels around the ski resort are
packed with tourists who, as in the past, are mostly from other
countries. But the number of Bulgarians there is also on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Tourism in winter, an important revenue source for the ski
industry, is known as "white business" in Bulgaria, and this time
of the year is just the beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
However, business was on the decline in past several years.
</P>
<P>
To bring back the business, local authorities late last year
repaired travel and business facilities at ski resorts, and
stepped up oversight on business practices there.

<HEADLINE> Blatter Warns of Exploitation from Commercials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- FIFA general secretary Joseph
Sepp Blatter warned of television exploitation on the world most
popular and lucrative sport at the Footbal Expo 98 here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have to portect the game," Blatter said to delegates at the
soccer's first international trade fair. "There is a danger that
our marketing partners are trying to take over the rights of
football associations or clubs."
</P>
<P>
He said the sport has spawned a 200 billion U.S. dollars annual
industry, and directly or indirectly, created 1.2 billion jobs
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
And it may well be that the figures are to be grown with the
advancing of the World Cup which features the most ever 32 tems in
France.
</P>
<P>
But Blatter described the over-involvement of the commercials
and spornsors as "a danger which we have to be careful of" in the
sport, which draw 45 billion viewers every month.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said the ruling on the Jean Marc Bosman's case by the
European Union was "the worst case of political intervention" in
sport.
</P>
<P>
"Football is at risk of losing its local or regional face," he
added when he talked about clubs putting players under a six-year
contracts and selling them after two years.
</P>
<P>
"Please never gamble with our game because it is not just a
game. It is about life," Blatter pleaded.

ISLAMABAD, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said here Monday that his government would set up
committees to address social ills such as corruption and
injustice.
</P>
<P>
"The country cannot make progress when social evils like
corruption, injustice, inequality and dishonesty continue to deny
people their right to progress," Sharif said while addressing a

</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by more than 700 delegates from all

</P>
<P>
Sharif said the committees will on the one hand evaluate the
government's performance and on the other set the pace for durable
progress based on justice and equality.
</P>
<P>
Members of the committees will be people with genuine desire to
serve the nation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to police excesses, Sharif said, "We want to remove
demerits from the system so that the deserving and the qualified
come forward and serve the nation."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the committees would look into complaints against
the police as well as the services of government departments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sharif expressed his confidence that PML-N workers
would lend their fullest cooperation in materializing the plans
undertaken by the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. adventurer Steve Fossett
failed to complete his fourth attempt to pilot a balloon nonstop
around the world as he was forced to land the balloon on the edge
of the Black Sea early today because of low winds and equipment
problems.
</P>
<P>
After flying about a third of the way on his trip, Fossett
decided to end the attempt and land after crossing the Black Sea,
his control team at St. Louis said. He landed at 6:27 a.m. EST
(1127 GMT) about 110 kilometers north of Krasnodar, Russia,
covering about 11,680 kilometers and lasting about four and a half
days.
</P>
<P>
Russian Officials told Fossett's St. Louis control center that
the landing was smooth and Fossett was "OK."
</P>
<P>
"It's just a really, really difficult task to accomplish,"
mission control director Alan Blount said. "We're getting closer."
</P>
<P>
Fossett, a 53-year-old Chicago commodities trader, took off
from St. Louis on Wednesday. He began running into trouble
Saturday when equipment failures caused problems with heat in the
cockpit and directional controls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one of the two propane burners that are fired
whenever the hot-air portion of his helium and hot-air craft must
be heated for extra lift was malfunctioning. Fossett was forced
to crawl through the bubble top of his gondola to fire them
manually, allowing more cold air inside.
</P>
<P>
A significant problem was the inability to get the balloon into
the fast-moving subtropical jet stream farther south.
</P>
<P>
Fossett decided to cut short his attempt Sunday evening St.
Louis time, while crossing the Black Sea, Blount said.
</P>
<P>
Fossett still had hoped he might break his own record of
traveling 10,361 miles (about 16,000 kilometers) in a balloon in
six days and two and a half hours. He set the records in January
1997, when he was forced to land in a mustard field in India
because he ran out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
Before 1997, Fossett tried to fly around the world in January
1996, but was forced to land in Canada. In 1995, Fossett had
become the first person to fly solo across the Pacific in a
balloon. Ground control said that he didn't announce it at the
time.

MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania will try, as ever, to
join the European Union, NATO and develop friendly relations with
Russia, President-elect Valdas Adamkus told reporters in Vilnius
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency reported that Adamkus stressed that

cooperation with such a big neighbor as Russia, which is
Lithuania's main economic and trading partner."
</P>

In response to a question on the status of Russia's Kaliningrad

<HEADLINE> Ramos Dismisses Opposition's Claim About Power Outage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Monday dismissed the opposition's claim that the Presidential
Palace was behind the power outage on the entire Luzon island on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"They (the opposition's claims) have no foundation, no bases in
fact," Ramos said, branding the opposition's claim as "baseless"
and "a pure fabrication."
</P>
<P>
The opposition said on Sunday that the Presidential Palace was
behind the blackout in a bid to cancel the May presidential
elections this year.
</P>
<P>
Ramos should step down in June this year as his six-year single
term ends. His supporters last year tried in vain to amend the
Constitution to extend his term of office.
</P>
<P>
The power failure caused by a technical problem resulted in a
blackout on the Luzon island, one of the three main islands of the
Philippines. It took the technicians almost 12 hours to restore
power supply to Metro Manila.

<HEADLINE> California to Have Longer School Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The school year for public
school students in California, now one of the shortest in the
United States, will be prolonged by eight days starting this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal by Governor Pete Wilson, schools are
required to provide 180 days of instruction, the U.S. national
average, instead of the current 172 days minimum.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made after polls show education is considered
a top priority for residents in California, where students' scores
have ranked low in recent national exams.
</P>
<P>
Schools are required to offer summer, after-school or weekend
classes for students with below-average reading scores.
</P>
<P>
The 180 days of education, said state officials, is still far
below the averages in Japan and Germany, where students spend more
than 200 days a year in the classrooms.

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>

Sunday said they would oppose an emerging administration
initiatives to offer Medicare benefits to younger retirees and
predicted the proposal would be rejected by the Congress.
</P>
<P>
-- In their drive to win back the House in 1998, Democrats are
counting on Latino distrust of the GOP to unseat Republican
incumbents in San Diego and a half-dozen other districts
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- White House officials said President Bill Clinton wanted to
put in place a plan to shore up social security, which is expected
to run out money by about 2030.
</P>
<P>

<P>
The Wall Street Journal:

<HEADLINE> Over 3,000 S. Korean Busnesses Bankrupt in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 South Korean
businesses collapsed in December 1997 due to the financial crisis,
the Bank of Korea said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that 1,226 out of the ill-fated companies were
based in the Seoul area.
</P>
<P>
Stringent monetary policy, high-interest rates and other stiff
terms imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its
loans to South Korea were blamed for the record high number of
failed businesses in the month.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has suffered an economic meltdown triggered by the
failure of conglomerates and bad loans of financial institutions
since late 1997, which witnessed the nation's per capita income
drop to 9,400 U.S. dollars from the 10,548 dollars of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the economic woes would deepen in 1998 as the
nation, under an agreement with the IMF for rescue loans of 57
billion dollars, will have to completely open its financial
market, shut down its ailing commercial and merchant banks and cut
its budget.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country, with foreign exchange reserve
reportedly standing at 9 billion dollars, has to return 25 billion
dollars in foreign debts before February.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province has
used 840 million US dollars of loans from the World Bank to
develop its basic industries.
</P>
<P>
The province has so far signed contracts to introduce more than
one billion US dollars of WB's loans for 33 projects.
</P>
<P>
Most of the WB-funded projects are related to the leading
industrial and infrastructure sectors.
</P>
<P>
The expressway from the provincial capital of Jinan to the
coastal city of Qingdao has been built with a loan of 110 million
US dollars of the WB and has a daily handling capacity of 40,000
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The expressway has greatly boosted the economic development
along its way, bringing in five billion yuan in economic returns
to the local people annually.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of 310 million US dollars of WB's loans has
helped the Zouxian County Power Plant increase its annual power
output by 7.8 billion KWh, thus greatly easing power shortages in
the province.
</P>
<P>
WB's loans have also been used on the development of local
agriculture, animal husbandry, tidal zones and aquiculture.

<HEADLINE> No "Bird Flu" Case Detected in Macao: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Macao government official
said on Sunday that there had been no "bird flu" case detected in
Macao "up until now."
</P>
<P>
Alarcao Troni, secretary for social affairs and budget, told a
medical seminar here that no human being or animal had been found
to have been infected with the disease.
</P>
<P>
The official said the government was making vigorous efforts to
prevent the disease. A number of "bird flu" cases have been found
in Hong Kong in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Health Department officials said earlier that not even a
suspected case was found in Macao. There was also no case of
chickens being infected with the H5N1 virus.
</P>
<P>
However, officials have stepped up inspection of imported and
locally-raised poultry. Local hospitals have also bought enough
medicine for 200 such patients.
</P>
<P>
Haunted by fears of the deadly virus, many local residents have
turned to pigeons, geese and pork as substitutes for chickens,
prompting a drop in the sales of chickens in Macao.

ZAGREB, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal sets eyes on Croatia
Zagreb's glittering star Robert Prosinecki, the local newspaper
reported on Monday.

But Zagreb made no final decision to release the player, whom
they brought back from Sevilla on a one year contract worthing one
million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Porsinecki, 28, who served at Red Star Belgrade, Real Madrid,
Real Oviedo, Barcelona and Sevilla before went back home, played a
core role in Croatia's qualification for their first World Cup.
</P>

The struggling Asenal, which is sixth in the league standings
with 34 points from 20 games, is seeking for strengthening their

<HEADLINE> Fossett Landed and Ended His Adventure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- American Steve Fossett landed
safely in southern Russia and abandoned his third attempt to
become the first man to fly round the world non-stop in a balloon,
an air traffic controller said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The lone 53-year-old adventurer brought down his "Solo Spirit"
balloon some 50 kilometers north of Slavyansk-in-Kuban at 1127
GMT, four days 12 hours and 23 minutes after he launched his craft
from a sports stadium in St. Louis, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
Before the landing, Fossett had spent several hours searching
for a suitable landing site over the Black Sea resort of Anapa.
</P>
<P>
Fossett's spokesman at the Solo Spirit mission control center
in St. Louis could not immediately confirm the landing but Russian
air traffic officials said they had no doubt the balloon had
landed safely in the Krasnodar region.
</P>
<P>
During the day, Fossett's craft had developed a number of
mechanical problems, including a malfunctioning heater inside the
gondola and a broken remote control on one of the gas burners
controlling lift.
</P>
<P>
The malfunction left him freezing and feeling no well and
ensuing consumption problems and unfavourable winds finally led to
his decision to abandon the adventure.
</P>
<P>
Alan Blount, mission control director, told reporters, "The
fact that he hasn't gotten around the world is a disappointment.
But this is a significant achievement. Nobody can diminish that
achievement."
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Fossett has already a record on this trip for the
fastest crossing of the Atlantic by balloon -- 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Last January, Fossett set a duration and distance record of
more than six days and 16,000 kms when he put down in India.

<HEADLINE> China to Clamp Down on Illegal Capital Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China will strive to improve
supervision and control over foreign exchange in 1998, and will
mete out severe punishment for any acts involving the illicit flow
of domestic and international capital.
</P>
<P>
An official from the State Administration for Foreign Exchange
recently told Xinhua that the move is designed to consolidate the
achievements of the nation's financial reform effort and safeguard
the stability of the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China achieved the conditional convertibility of
Chinese currency under current accounts. However, illegal profits
have since been earned from some foreign capital entering the
country.
</P>
<P>
For example, some companies and individuals have evaded the
payment of customs duties or have otherwise smuggled foreign
capital through local foreign trade firms by using fake clearance
documents.
</P>
<P>
In addition, various foreign trade firms have earned
commissions from illegal business transactions.
</P>
<P>
China will work hard to further improve the related laws,
decrees and regulations governing the control of foreign exchange,
so as to help stablize the country's financial order, according to
the official.

ADDIS ABABA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean president Isaias
Afwerki has expressed the confidence of the people and government
of Eritrea to continue their forward march in the new year to
promote all-round reconstruction and development.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of English weekly "Eritrea
Profile", the remarks were made by the president in a new year
message to the Eritrean people.
</P>
<P>
In review of the major accomplishments during 1997, presidnet
Isaias took note of the formulation and subsequent ratification
of the national constitution which, he said, would serve as a
weapon to further consolidate achievements in the political arena
and create a favourable atmosphere for more socio-economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Isaias said, the past year witnessed important achievements in
the field of infrastractural development, adding that the economy
has now surpassed the rehabilitation phase and the country is
actually in the process of planning and launching far-reaching
development projects.
</P>
<P>
"It is becoming increasingly obvious that visible growth in
most sectors will soon contribute to the development of economy,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the president pointed out that due to the vagaries of
nature, the country could not realize set objectives in the
agricultural sector which is the main source of livelihood for
the majority of the population.
</P>
<P>
He spoke the need to revise the nation's agricultural policy
and launch a specific, wide-ranging national campaign to meet the
challenge in this regard, particularly as regards intensified
soil and water conservation program.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined that Eritrea should continue to work for
the promotion of economic and trade relations with Ethiopia and
other neighbouring countries.

Two government soldiers died in the Daima Songa fight, he
said, adding that the army was able to flush out the Kamajors at
their mini base at Dodo.
</P>
<P>
According to Milton, two attempts to ambush government
soldiers were made at the outskirt of Bo and Giondama between
Saturday and Sunday, both of which were foiled by the military
forces.
</P>
<P>
"The road is no longer closed and commercial vehicles are now
going through," he said.
</P>
<P>
Early today, said Milton, Kamajors attacked government troops
position at Tongo field but were repelled. The army, he said,
captured 15 Kamajor militiamen. There were no losses on the
government side, he added.
</P>
<P>
There are reports of Nigerian troops with the west African
peacekeeping forces known as ECOMOG in neighboring Liberia,
"making their way towards villages on the border with Sierra
Leone" to team up with the Kamajors to launch attacks on Sierra
Leone government soldiers."
</P>
<P>
He said Nigerian troops are also being lifted in large numbers
to Jui, east of the Sierra Leonean capital and the Freetown
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
"These movements are in complete violation of the Conakry
Peace Agreement which outlawed any troop movement or violation of
the ceasefire. They are bent on derailing the ceasefire," Milton
added.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Calls for Curbing Influx of Kurdish Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Germany Monday reiterated its call
on its European partners, especially Italy, to tighten border
controls to prevent a mass influx of Kurdish refugees from Turkey
to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation as "threatening", German Interior
Minister Manfred Kanther insisted that Italy and Greece should
take considerably tougher measures against illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
Kanther made the remarks after an influx of would-be
immigrants, most of them Kurds, have reached Italy's coast from
Turkey during the past few weeks. More ships carrying thousands of
Kurds are reportedly en route.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that many of the Kurds would finally head for Germany,
which has a large Kurdish population and a more liberal asylum
policy, Kanther said that Germany has already reinforced police
forces at its southern border and would send back those immigrants
who slipped illegally into Germany.

HARARE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean stockmarket, the
second largest one in Africa, opened the year more active with
the key industrial index gaining a massive 326 points to close at
7,522 today.
</P>
<P>
The market which plunged dramatically in the last quarter of
last year continued with its recovery on the back of rising share
prices in a number of counters.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the rains that have been lashing some parts of
the country in the past few days coupled with the disbursement by
the world bank of one billion Zimbabwe dollars (60 million U.S.
dollars) in balance of payments support last December appear to
be lifting investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
"Investors are coming back from the holidays and taking
advantage of the value that has been created in the market in the
last few weeks," said an analyst with quincor stockbrokers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Vows to Boost Economy in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian military government
has geared up for economic development to ensure a smooth
transition to civil rule by October this year.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the 1998 budget Sunday night, Head of State General
Sani Abacha announced that the government has set the growth rate
of gross domestic product at "not less than 5.5 percent" for
1998, the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
Although "the estimated growth of the economy in 1997 was 3.77
percent", lower than the set target, Abacha said "It represented
a marked improvement from the 1.3 percent recorded in 1994; 2.2
percent in 1995 and 3.25 percent in 1996," he added.
</P>
<P>
This year, Abacha said, "the government will therefore adopt
measures to encourage productive activities in various sectors,"
including private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the government will take measures to reflate the
economy in order to raise the purchasing power in the system."
</P>
<P>
The government will try to maintain inflation rate at nine
percent to obtain stability in price and exchange rate in 1998,
while carrying out guided privatization of the existing
state-owned enterprises, economic liberalization and changes in
taxation.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the budget also include employment creation,
sustained fiscal discipline, appropriate monetary and credit
policy stance, human capital development, improvement of social
and economic infrastructure and sustained transparency,
accountability and comprehensiveness in the conduct of
governance.
</P>
<P>
To meet these goals, Abacha announced an increase in personal
income tax allowances, the abolition of excise duty, continued
incentives for export promotion and civil service reforms, among
other things.
</P>
<P>
All the policies are made apparently by taking recommendations
of the report by the Vision 2010 Committee, which recently
presented the country's first long-term socio-economic
development program toward the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget, the country's gross revenue is
estimated at 424 billion Naira (about 5.3 billion U.S. dollars)
and total expenditure at 329 billion Naira (4.11 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
That means a budget surplus of 95 billion Naira (about 1.19
billion dollars) for the current fiscal year ending December 31,
1998, which Abacha did not mention in his pre-election speech
read in the country's television and broadcasting network.
</P>
<P>
The head of state, however, admitted that his government
suffered a deficit of five billion Naira (about 62.5 million
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The gross revenue estimated for 1998 include 257 billion Naira
(3.2 billion dollars) from oil sources and 167 billion Naira
(2.09 billion dollars) from non-oil sources.
</P>
<P>
The total expenditure could be broken down as 143 billion
Naira (1.79 billion dollars) for capital expenditure, 117 billion
Naira (1.46 billion dollars) for recurrent expenditure, 44
billion (550 million dollars) reserve for foreign debt, 22
billion Naira (275 million dollars) for domestic debts and three
billion Naira (37.5 million dollars) for local contractors.
</P>
<P>
In its 1997 budget, the Abacha administration projected gross
revenue at 404 billion Naira (5.05 billion dollars) and total
expenditure at 247 billion Naira (3.09 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
As usual, a breakdown of the budget spending is given by the
finance minister several days after the release of the budget.

<HEADLINE> Schools Still Closed in Sierra Leonean Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of primary and
secondary schools in Sierra Leone's capital Freetown remained
closed today despite urgent appeals by the military government to
reopen to start classes.
</P>
<P>
Tuition has been paralysed since the May 25, 1997 coup which
toppled the civilian government of Tejan Kabbah. The Sierra Leone
Teachers Union (SLTU) had ordered all teachers "to stay away from
classes" until democracy is retored in the west African state.
</P>
<P>
"We are utterly shocked over the development as the Department
of Treasury had fully met one of the conditions of the teachers
which is the payment of all delayed salaries. We now owe them
just the salary for December," senior officials from the
Department of Education told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Parents, however, blamed many teachers on "just not turning up
for classes while saying it is the parents who had not sent their
children to schools."
</P>
<P>
Alpha Timbo, secretary of the SLTU, told Xinhua that "problems
still remain which are hampering the commencement of effective
schooling."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the government should pay school and
examination fees for all students who were unbale to sit for
public exams because of the coup.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the students forfeited their cash because they could
not go to the various examination centers due to insecurity at
the time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Timbo said the government must either pay or provide a loan to
the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) to facilitate the
marking of examination papers and payment of invigilators.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, education officials have published the 1998
educational program under which the first term for primary
schools will run for a 14 week period from January 5 to April 8,
second term from April 20 to June 30 with a break between July 1
to 10 and third term from July 13 to September 18.
</P>
<P>
Secondary schools will be in session from January 5 to April 8
with Easter break from April 10 to 14.
</P>
<P>
The second term will be from April 20 to July 30 and third
term from August 4 to September 18.

<HEADLINE> British Royal Family Focuses on Public Opinion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Queen Elizabeth has called in
market researchers to tell members of the Royal Family what the
public really thinks about them.
</P>
<P>
The Queen's private secretary, Sir Robert Fellowes, has
commissioned the research company, MORI, to undertake an extensive
survey of attitudes toward the monarchy, a Buckingham Palace
spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project, which has the full approval of the Queen, was
commissioned about two months ago, shortly after the death of
Princess Diana when the Royal Family was harshly criticized for
appearing unresponsive to the national outpouring of grief.
</P>
<P>
MORI set up what is known as "focus groups" around the country
involving a carefully selected demographic spread.
</P>
<P>
The data has now been completed and MORI's final conclusions
will be presented to Sir Robert shortly. The results, however,
will not be made public.
</P>
<P>
"It is not just a case of another opinion poll. This is
qualitative rather than quantitative research designed to explore
the public's views in a wider context," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Family was keen to ensure that its work was suited to
the interests and concerns of the British people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Queen and heir to the throne Prince Charles have made
strenuous efforts to become closer to the people in the past three
months and have been praised by the media for adopting a more
relaxed tone in their public engagements.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Boosts China's Agricultural Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Increasing agricultural links
China established overseas during 1997 have helped the nation's
agricultural sector maintain the rapid momentum of all-round
sustainable growth, according to the International Business Daily.
</P>
<P>
Gan Zuofu, deputy-director of the International Cooperation
Department under the Ministry of Agriculture, was quoted as saying
that China signed bilateral agreements and memoranda for
agricultural cooperation with more than 20 countries during
1997. China currently conducts agricultural cooperation with more
than a hundred countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China also formed joint committees for agricultural
cooperation with Thailand, Guinea, Egypt, the Netherlands and
Russia, in addition to carrying out scientific and technological
exchanges in the agricultural sector with the World Bank, the
Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), World Food Program and International Fund for
Agricultural Development.
</P>
<P>
China has imported more than 100,000 varieties of food grain,
cotton, oil crops, fruit, vegetables, herbs, and aquatic, animal
and poultry products, with dozens of said products earning
relevant sectors over one billion yuan (120 million US dollars)
each.
</P>
<P>
China's agricultural sector used foreign funds totalling 5.88
billion yuan from 1991 to the end of 1997, with a large portion of
said funds going for agricultural development in underdeveloped
provinces in northwestern China, including Qinghai and Gansu
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China jointly established demonstrations centers with
other countries in 1997 as part of an effort to introduce advanced
techniques, equipment, specie resources and capital.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands invested five million US dollars in a
demonstration hog breeding center in Beijing, as well as a
gardening center in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation provided three million US
dollars to set up a state-of-the-art gardening center in Beijing
to produced vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Chinese technicians sent to Guinea have also achieved excellent
results in operating a 400 hectare farm. And a program jointly
funded by China and the FAO has helped to improve food production
in Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Moi Sworn in After Winning Multi-Party Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Incumbent Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi was sworn in today with pledges to curb
corruption and revitalize economy in his fifth and final term
till 2002.
</P>
<P>
Presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Benjamin Mkapa of
Tanzania attended the inauguration ceremony for the 73-year-old
Kenyan leader along with thousands of cheerful ordinary Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
"Today marks yet another milestone in our political
history...It was a win-win situation for all. KANU (the ruling
party) won, Democracy won, and all Kenyans won," said Moi in his
inauguration speech. He has already been in power for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
The president elect claimed that he would fulfill the pledges
he made in the campaign to improve infrastructure, tackle
poverty, enhance health and education systems, stimulate economic
growth, create more jobs and improve governmental efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"We will be steadfast in our determination to eliminate
corruption," Moi stressed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted heads of state in eastern Africa "are all
deeply committed to the process of East African Cooperation and
the development of a single market for our three countries."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he ruled out the possibility of forming a
government of national unity as demanded by the opposition, since
his Kenya African National Union (KANU) also won a majority in
the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
He urged the opposition, whose main leaders did not show up at
the ceremony, to accept his victory instead of engaging in
"divisive tribal based politics."
</P>
<P>
Moi asked all his fellow people to try hard to build "a
united, peaceful and prosperous Kenya" under the new government
he is expected to announce soon.
</P>
<P>
In a speech later at the ceremony, the Ugandan president
backed Moi's stance and called on Kenyan opposition parties to
accept the polling results so as not to fuel civil turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"I understand civil strife better than anybody else here. You
start war only if there are no options, but Kenya has options for
changing governments, the option of elections," said Museveni who
took power in 1986 after a five-year guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
His Ugandan counterpart also echoed the idea, saying that the
Kenyan elections were not rigged and should be accepted.
</P>
<P>
"You (Kenyans) should now move forward and develop your
country," said Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
Moi has garnered at least 2.446 million votes or 40.12 percent
in the country's second multi-party poll held on December 29 and
30. He was followed by Democratic Party Chairman Mwai Kibaki with
1.896 million votes or 31.09 percent.
</P>
<P>
So far there are nine constituencies whose polling results are
yet to come but they "would not make any differences" of the
final outcome, according to Kenyan Electoral Commission Chairman
Samuel Kivuitu.
</P>
<P>
A total of 9,031,141 Kenyans registered for the vote to elect
one president, 210 parliamentary members and 2,955 local
councillors for the next five years starting from 1998.

will be about 2.1 billion US dollars in 1997, which is almost on a
par with 1996.

"The demand of the domestic market had been growing steadily
last year, and the market share of the domestic products,
especially those made by state-run enterprises, had begun to
increase," he added.
</P>
<P>
China has also made progress in drafting and improving the
pharmaceutical legal system, with a series of administrative
regulations concering the management of medicine fairs and
pharmaceutical production issued.

"This year, China will focus on accelerating the adjustment of
the pharmaceutical industrial structure, promoting reforms in
the circulation system of the pharmaceutical industry, and
strengthening the administrative inspection," Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Supreme Court to Hear 13th Amendment Case Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Supreme Court will
on January 12 hear again two petitions challenging the 13th
Amendment to the Constitution which took away the power of the
country's president to dissolve the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A five-member bench headed by Chief Justice of the apex court
Ajmal Mian will hear the petitions filed by Naveed Malik and Iqbal
Haider, according to the official Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The petitions were filed in November 1997 when confrontation
between the government and the judiciary was at its peak.
</P>
<P>
On December 2, 1997, a three-member bench headed by the then
Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah heard the petitions and issued an
interim order to suspend the 13th Amendment, re-empowering the
president to dissolve the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, a 10-member bench of the Supreme
Court heard petitions against the appointment of Sajjad as chief
justice, declaring that his appointment was improper and his
decisions after November 26, 1997, had no validity and no legal
effect.
</P>
<P>
Only hours after the two benches issued their orders, the then
President Farooq Leghari announced his resignation, thus ending
the four-month-long confrontation between the government and the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Sajjad has asked for a two-month leave and he will retire in
February this year.
</P>
<P>
Mian was sworn in as chief justice of Pakistan on December 23,
1997.

<HEADLINE> Alatas: ASEAN Needs "Renewal" to Face Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) should make a "renewal" to enable it to cope
with the challenges both inside and outside the region, Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In a very real sense, what we are witnessing today is a
manifestation of the continuity of the mission of ASEAN as well as
its capacity for renewal," he said at the ceremony marking the
turnover of the post of ASEAN secretary-general from Ajit Singh of
Malaysia to Rodolfo C. Severino of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Severino, who will serve from 1998 to 2002, officially assumed
office Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN, Alatas said, has been facing a tough time in
expanding its membership, in facing the ASEAN Free Trade Area and
other developments outside the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
The grouping should thus ensure the continuity of its mission
and at the same time adopt a proactive stance in the face of
profound changes in its political and economic environment.
</P>
<P>
He said the ASEAN has succeeded in bringing political stability
to the region and in stimulating economic cooperation among its
members and dialogue partners.
</P>
<P>
The minister however noted that the recent financial and
monetary crisis has strained the economies of East and Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The ASEAN region has taken a severe blow and we must now
summon the faith, the courage and the creativity that attended the
founding and growth of the association to cope with the current
crisis and anticipated challenges and move toward our ultimate
goals," he added. "This means renewal and we are called upon today
to make that renewal."
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Suifenhe, a border city in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province neighboring on Russia, has
emerged as a favorite trade channel linking China, Russia, Japan
and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in today's International Business Daily,

The border city's total trade volume in whole the year is

<P>
The increase in cross-border trade has been attributed, at

Russia, the Republic of Korea (ROK), Japan and the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). The agreement call for
northeast China to transport goods directly to Japan, the ROK, the
HKSAR and Russia via Suifenhe and Nahodka, a major Russian port. A

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Discussed Current Political Crisis With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu held consultations Monday morning with Knesset
(parliament) members of Likud and coalition parties on the current
political crisis erupted following the resignation of the Foreign
Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
During the consultations, Likud Knesset member Gideon Ezra
proposed to Netanyahu that he should appoint National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon as acting Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister and Dan Meridor, another Likud
Knesset member, to take the post as National Infrastructure
Minister.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu did not make his final decision on such issues, but
did ask all coalition Knesset members to vote for the 1998 state
budget later this afternoon in the Knesset, government sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset is scheduled to start another round of debate on
the arrangement bill of the state new budget at 2:00 PM (local
time) today before its second and third readings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the High Court of Justice declared Monday invalid
the agreement reached between the Finance Ministry and the
religious parties of the coalition concerning the allocation of
funds for Yeshiva students in the 1998 budget as petitioned by
the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
The Court ordered the Finance Ministry to tell the Knesset
the Court's decision and cut the allocations in the new state
budget, saying such agreement could only cause more conflicts
between vast majority ordinary and Yeshiva students.
</P>
<P>
David Levy announced his resignation on Sunday, accusing the
government of not keeping its promises made last summer on
budget allocations to his party and the new state budget did
not address the problems of the poor.
</P>
<P>
Four hours after Levy's resignation announcement, Netanyahu
also addressed the whole nation through TV that he hopes David
Levy will retract his resignation.
</P>
<P>
But between the lines, it has been clear that Netanyahu did
not really want Levy to return to the government.
</P>
<P>
He said he would hold onto the Foreign Affairs portfolio for
the time being, and would continue the talks on redeployment once
the budget is passed in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman on Sunday night called Levy to come
back for the sake of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai also said last night that
Levy is important and essential in the government to further the
peace process, establish security and deal with the socio-economic
issues.
</P>
<P>
Other cabinet ministers including the Science Minister Michael
Eitan, Health Minister Yehoshua Matza, Interior Minister Eli
Suissa, also asked Levy to stay in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
But till now, there is no sign of levy's return.
</P>
<P>
The surprise resignation of levy left the government standing
weakly on its feet. His departure is politically devastating not
just because the Gesher (Levy's Bridge Party) faction represents
five Knesset seats, bringing the coalition a razor-thin majority
of 61 seats only in the 120-member Knesset, but also a huge
political damage to the coalition headed by Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia Crisis Harms Bangladesh Labor Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The serious economic crisis in the
Southeast Asian region appears to be a setback for Bangladesh's
labor export, a local newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Bangladeshis are now working legally in Malaysia,
where thousands of others are also staying illegally, The Daily
Star said.
</P>
<P>
About 1 million migrant laborers, mostly from Indonesia, would
lose their jobs in Malaysia due to the economic crisis that
gripped the entire Southeast Asian region, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Many of Bangladeshis now working in Malaysia will lose their
jobs because of the suspension of many development projects as a
result of the recession.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 Bangladeshis, who are already over-staying in South
Korea, would have to be repatriated as the country would no longer
allow them to work there.
</P>
<P>
Labor export is a major foreign exchange earner for this South
Asian country, which exports more than 1 million workers every
year.
</P>
<P>
The country, which exports labor mainly to Malaysia, Saudi
Arabia and South Korea, earned 1.34 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign exchange in the 1995-96 fiscal year. Expatriate
Bangladeshi workers remitted about 1.4 billion dollars from
January to November last year.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Kills 40 Ugandans Since Christmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Cholera has killed at least 40
Ugandans since Christmas, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
A new outbreak of the pandemic has claimed 36 in eastern Mbale
district alone, The New Vision said in its report, adding the
disease has also killed three in Luzira Prison which houses 1,900
prisoners here in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The first outbreak of the disease in Mbale occurred three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Richard Othieno, the district health officer of Mbale,
attributed the new wave of the disease to a delay in burying the
deceased so that all relatives would be present at the burial as
required by the African tradition.
</P>
<P>
On Sese islands in Lake Victoria, local authorities have
registered 15 deaths so far. A local reporter saw a child
drinking water directly from the lake. He also cited the lack of
toilets as a cause for the spread of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Peace Onzia, an official in Mbale, said only 30 percent of
homesteads in the district have latrines.
</P>
<P>
In Kampala, the capital, the conditions are improving. But
1,000 cholera cases had been reported since Christmas, the
newspaper quoted experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tom Koene, the country's representative to Medicines San
Frontiers (MSF:doctors without borders), said the average daily
record of cholera cases dropped from 250 to 150 in Mulago
Hospital, the most up-to-date one in the country.
</P>
<P>
But Marie Skiinnider, coordinator of the MSF, said some people
are misusing antibiotics in fighting against the epidemic and
warned of the danger of forming a resistant strain of the germ.
</P>
<P>
Sam Okware, head of the anti-cholera task force, had appealed
to the local people to send patients to treatment centers.

<HEADLINE> China Speeds up Nuclear Power Plant Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China will speed up construction
of four cross-century nuclear power plants with installed
generating capacity totaling 6.6 million kw, in a bid to boost the
country's nuclear power development.
</P>
<P>
This was learned from a work conference of the China National
Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) held here today.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the second-phase project of the Qinshan Nuclear
Plant in east China's Zhejiang province and the Ling'ao Nuclear
Power Plant in south China's Guangdong province which were
launched in May and June of 1997, the country will start to build
the third-phase project of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant at the
end of this year, building two generating sets each with installed
capacity of 700,000 kw, and the Lianyungang Nuclear Plower Plant
in east China's Jiangsu province in 1999, building two generating
sets each with installed capacity of one million kw.
</P>
<P>
Chinese premier Li Peng has written a letter to the conference,
speaking highly of the country's nuclear power development.
</P>
<P>
He said that a new-type nuclear scientific-industrial system
embracing defense industry and non-military enterprises has
basically taken shape in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The coming three years is crucial for the country's nuclear
power development, " said vice-president Zhuang Huazhu of CNNC,
adding that installation and trial operation of the four large
nuclear power plants will be conducted during the period.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine currency, the
peso, fell by about 4 percent to a new record low of 42.65 pesos
against the U.S. dollar on Monday, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The peso closed at an average of 41.738 pesos per U.S. dollar
on a turnover volume of 17.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said falls in other Southeast Asian currencies,
especially the Indonesian rupiah, and heavy corporate demand for
dollars quickly pushed the peso down to the new all-time low.
</P>
<P>
The peso plunged to the new level in the first 90 minutes of
trading, forcing a halt to all transactions beyond that level for
the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
The peso has devaluated by some 61 percent since the financial

<HEADLINE> S. African Economy to Face Big Challenges: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- South African Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel has warned that the country's economy is
facing immense challenges this year as foreign investors are
expecting high from it, the Business Day newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking everyone into our confidence about the
immensity of the challenge. So many of the indicators are moving
in the right direction and South Africa remains an exceedingly
important investment destination," he said in an interview last
week.
</P>
<P>
But he said the country's overall economic conditions are
improving despite instability on global markets, a sharp fall in
the gold price and poor fiscal controls by provincial
governments.
</P>
<P>
Manuel indicated that investors should not judge the country's
economic health only by watching how closely the government's
economic projections are reflected. They should "look at the
overall performance" and take into account "factors over which
one has little or no control".
</P>
<P>
The government's medium-term budget expected the economy to
grow about 3 percent this year, and 4 percent and 5 percent in
subsequent years. This falls short of the 3.8 percent, 4.9
percent and 6.1 percent growth targets set for 1998-2000 by the
Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) macro-economic
strategy.
</P>
<P>
GEAR, adopted in 1996 by the government, highlights a
competitive fast-growing economy based on export improvement so
as to create sufficient jobs, and a redistribution of income and
opportunity in favor of the poor.
</P>
<P>
Manuel attributed the failure in meeting the target to
uncontrollable elements, such as global market instability and
poor gold prices.
</P>
<P>
"The balance of payments constraint is still there, and the
impact of the low gold price on jobs could be formidable. That is
why GEAR targets growth in non-gold exports. There has been some
success in stimulating manufactured exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
The fundamentals would continue to improve as the government
sticks to GEAR strategy, the medium-term expenditure framework
and the Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP), Manuel
said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa' SOS Phones Vandalized on Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Transport
Department is losing one million Rand (210,000 U.S. dollars) a
year on its SOS telephones set up along the major highways due to
vandalism, local daily Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
Transport ministry spokesman Didi Moyle was quoted as saying
that the department was "fighting a losing battle because as fast
as the phones are being repaired, they are being vandalized."
</P>
<P>
Moyle said she could not say how many of the telephones had
been operational during the festive season because they were
continuously vandalized and the batteries and solar panels were
often stolen.
</P>
<P>
"We can't understand why these phones are being vandalized
because there is nothing of value on them," she said.
</P>
<P>
The department had introduced an incident management system
where motorists could dial 112 on a cellular phone, if they had
one, or 10177 on the SOS telephones if they could find one that
was working.
</P>
<P>
The department was reportedly negotiating a deal with one of
the cellular network companies in an attempt to convert the SOS
telephones into a system that could be used more effectively.

<HEADLINE> Indian Heart Patients Implanted With New Device </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Experts at the All India
Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here have successfully
carried out the implantation of a new mechanical device to assist
patients with severely impaired hearts, the Press Trust of India
(PTI) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in Asia that such a new device has been
implanted through operations on four Indian patients, the PTI
quoted AIIMS Dr. P. Venugopal as saying.
</P>
<P>
The device, manufactured by a U.S. company, aids the heart in
pumping blood to the conduits of the body, thereby reducing stress
and workload on a patient's heart after surgery. It allows
patients a near-normal lifestyle after the operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Heart mate is a boon for those patients with long-standing
heart ailment awaiting a suitable donor. The use of this device
offers a better survival by acting as a support device during the
waiting period. Almost 80 percent of patients who registered for
transplant at the AIIMS have already died for want of a suitable
heart," he said.
</P>
<P>
The device, which has a life span of maximum two years, is less
cumbersome compared to previous devices and the patients can be
discharged within two weeks.

<HEADLINE> S. African Former President Blasts Truth Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's former
state president P W Botha blasted the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission (TRC) again on Sunday, saying that he was still not
prepared to appear before it.
</P>
<P>
"I have done nothing to them but they have started prosecuting
me," Botha was quoted as saying in an interview with an Afrikaans
Sunday newspaper, Rapport.
</P>
<P>
He said he had done nothing wrong and that he went to great
lengths in giving a written reply to all questions put to him by
the TRC concerning the former State Security Council in an
1,800-page document.
</P>
<P>
TRC laid criminal charges against Botha after he failed to
appear before the TRC for a third time last month.
</P>
<P>
Western Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn said he would decide
on the matter this week.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Botha and the TRC flared up when Botha told
Rapport in mid-November that he would rather be prosecuted than
appear before the TRC.
</P>
<P>
TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu, who was angry with Botha's attitude
toward his commission, failed to lay charges against him on
December 5 only as a result of a defection of the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
A third subpoena was served on the same day, ordering Botha to
appear on December 19 but Botha failed again to turn up.
</P>
<P>
Botha, who was president between 1984 and 1989, had refused to
apologize for the activities of his government, which vehemently
implemented apartheid policies.
</P>
<P>
He accused the TRC of being a revenge camp against the
Afrikaner and called it a "circus."
</P>
<P>
The TRC was installed after the first all-race general
election in 1994 to investigate human rights violations in the
apartheid era.

<HEADLINE> At Least 11 Massacred on Lesotho-S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 people were
shot and hacked to death near the border between South Africa and
Lesotho on New Year's Day, South African Press Association quoted
police as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Police officer Fanie Lategan who attended the scene said the
bodies were found scattered near the Bellevue patrol post on
Friday after police were alerted about the massacre.
</P>
<P>
Lategan said an AK-47 assault rifle was found in the
possession of one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
He said the victims were apparently from the Nzongwane area in
the Eastern Cape Province.
</P>
<P>
They had apparently crossed into Lesotho via Kwazulu-Natal and
allegedly stole cattle from Lesotho residents.
</P>
<P>
Another police officer, Fanie de Lange, said the attack
appeared to be related to the ongoing conflict between Nzongwane
residents and those of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Investigations were hampered by poor visibility and difficult
terrain, de Lange said.
</P>
<P>
Lategan said it took police almost a whole day to locate one
of the bodies.
</P>
<P>
According to De Lange, it was possible that more people were
killed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Several incidents of cattle rustling were reported on the
border area in recent days.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Australia's communication and
electronics industry received a boost Monday, winning contracts
with the Australian Defense Force (ADF) to develop a high
frequency radio communications system for the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan Monday announced the
signing of the contracts worth more than 380 million Australian
dollars (247 million U.S. dollars) between the ADF and Boeing
Australia Limited to operate a modern communications system well
into the next century.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the contracts were the largest awarded for a
communications project in as many years and would provide a
substantial boost for the country's communication and electronics
industries.
</P>
<P>
"About 75 percent of the contract to develop and construct the
network and more than 90 percent of the operation and support
contract will be provided locally," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the system would use modern technology to
provide a long-range communications system for use within
Australia and with ships and aircraft operating in the region.
</P>
<P>
It will comprise four ground communications stations located in
the New South Wales state's Riverina region, Townsville in
northern Queensland state, Darwin, a port city in northern
Australia and at the North West Cape in Western Australia state.
</P>
<P>
Each station would have a transmitter and receiver site
remotely controlled by a network facility in Canberra, capital of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the network was scheduled to commence initial
operations in 2002 and would be fully operational by late 2004.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weaker, Dragged Down by Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar shrugged
off strong international trade figures Monday and was dragged down
below 65.00 US cents by struggling Asian currencies to close at
its lows for the session.
</P>
<P>
On its first day of full strength trading since the Christmas
and New Year breaks, the local currency finished at 64.82 US
cents, down from 65.05 locally late on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 497 million Australian dollars (323 million US dollars)
balance on goods and services surplus for November announced by
the Australian Bureau of Statistics Monday was not enough to lift
the local currency from its doldrums.
</P>
<P>
Stavros Nitis, foreign exchange senior dealer of Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, said the market briefly rallied to 65.15 US
cents following the release of the data, but then fell back to
previous levels around 65.05.
</P>
<P>
"I think the market has just shrugged those numbers off as
historical data and of not too much significance," Nitis said.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank economist Craig James said today's figures
were subject to volatility and export growth would slow in 1998 as
demand from Asia was falling.
</P>
<P>
"It is probably a case of the calm before the storm," he said.
</P>
<P>
Of greater concern than the local data Monday was plunging
Southeast Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah, the Malaysian ringgit, the Philippine
peso and the Thai baht all recorded new lows.
</P>
<P>
Traders said Asian currencies were being sold down on domestic
concerns coupled with lingering fears that more turbulence lies
ahead for Asia before recovery sets in from the regional financial
turmoil raging since July.
</P>
<P>
Nitis said the Australian dollar would see a gradual decline on
the back of deterioration in Asia, and lower commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
"I think over the next week or two we are going to revisit the
previous lows, which are around 64.20/30," he said.
</P>
<P>
The currency has not been at these levels since September 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended Monday at 85.73 yen, from 85.19 on
Friday and at 1.1673 marks, from 1.1720.

<HEADLINE> Australian Shares Jump As Banks Rise on Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
moved strongly higher Monday as a buoyant bond market pushed
banking stocks up with sellers still largely absent from trading.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index rose 35.2 points to 2,644.3, following
the rise on Wall Street on Friday and ignoring further falls on
key Asian equity markets.
</P>
<P>
"Banks are strong with quality earnings in a low inflation
environment, coupled with the fact (US Federal Reserve chairman)
Greenspan is talking deflation, disinflation and the diminishing
of asset values," said Stuart Smith from Henderson Charlton Jones.
</P>
<P>
Smith said buyers were looking to invest in blue chip stocks
with assured earnings, including banks and high yielding property
trusts, as a buffer against the predicted deflationary
environment.
</P>
<P>
Volume was still below average in a continuation of the holiday
environment, which caused a possible exaggeration of gains in the
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 235.5 million shares at a value of 763
million Australian dollars (496 million US dollars), with rises
outnumbering falls 577 to 414.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index rose 63.5 points to 4,523.9.
</P>
<P>
Westpac and Commonwealth Bank shares benefited the most in the
bank buy-up, increasing 23 cents and 40.6 cents respectively.
Meanwhile, ANZ Bank improved 13 cents and National Australia Bank
lifted 31.1 cents.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index was 12 points higher at 1,146.1, with
mining stocks strong.
</P>
<P>
BHP shares improved 12 cents and Rio Tinto and WMC were both
six cents better than last session.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks generally improved as the bullion price rose by
0.20 US dollar per ounce to 287.85.

<HEADLINE> Attention Called to Enterprise Groups in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at the
Macro-economics Institute of China's State Planning Commission
warn that more attention should be paid to six aspects of large
enterprise groups because their problems will directly affect
their development.
</P>
<P>
A strategy of making conglomerates and enterprises groups out
of state-owned enterprises as a reform measure is natural they say.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary Jiang Zemin, in his report to the 15th
National Party Congress, said an effort should be made to set up
more multinational conglomerates with mixed ownership to increase
large enterprise reforms and expansion.
</P>
<P>
So, conglomerates and enterprise groups have been growing in
China but, in the wake of this quick expansion, a range of
problems have emerged and greater attention should be paid to them.
</P>
<P>
Some enterprise groups and government departments are paying
too much attention to size and want to grow overnight. Some have
expressed a clear desire to become one of the world's top 500
conglomerates by early next century, but the feasibility of this
is quite doubtful.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises can be developed by internal or external
expansion. Internal comes about through capital accumulation, and
expanding into related products or industries by using
technological, financial, and management advantages. External
comes about through mergers and reorganization of assets.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of enterprise groups and government departments,
deeming that joining the world's top 500 by internal expansion
will just take too long, turn to external expansion. But that is
not as good as improving scientific research and development or
management and will only lead to failure. The enterprise groups of
the Republic of Korea (ROK) are a good example of this.

<HEADLINE> Attention Called to Enterprise Groups (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A second problem is that some conglomerate executives and a
number of government authorities confuse economies of scale with
economic scale.
</P>
<P>
In terms of assets and sales, most Chinese enterprises are
small in scale and are not very efficient, and they believe that
one way to develop economies of scale is to put all related
business in one enterprise group, but this larger scale is not
necessarily economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
China established a number of large enterprises or enterprise
groups, thinking of economies of scale or separate areas of
specialization, but few of these were successful.
</P>
<P>
What is needed is to look at strong points or return on
production in establishing enterprise groups. In setting them up,
acquisitions and takeovers, two popular practices in a market
economy, should be considered fundamental, and not administrative
orders. Otherwise, some enterprises with good performance records
will eventually be landed in a difficult situation by money-losing
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A third problem is that some enterprises groups are paying too
much attention to diversifying economic operations, with the idea
of spreading the risks. But, even though a strategy of diverse
operations can be an important choice for large enterprise groups
in expanding their business, diversity does not always lead to a
decrease in risks, and diversification can sometimes only further
increase risks.
</P>
<P>
It is more efficient for enterprises to concentrate on limited
expansion, as in the case of the Seg Group of Shenzhen City, in
south China's Guangdong Province.

<HEADLINE> FINA Restricts Submarine Butterfly Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur
Swimming Federation (FINA) announced in Perth on Monday that they
will restrict the distance of submarine technique in butterfly,
which has contributed to a few world records in recent years.
</P>
<P>
FINA voted to define a rule which already uses in breaststroke
and backstroke and limit the distance allowed to be swum under
water to 15 meters.
</P>
<P>
A FINA technical congress said the above and other new rules
would come into effect on March 6.
</P>
<P>
The butterfly world record holders, such as Russian reigning
Olympic champion Denis Pankratov and American Misty Hyman were
greatly benefited from the prolonged submarine techniques, even
more than half the first length of the 50-meter pool uner water.
</P>
<P>
The congress not only agreed in principle to introduce
semifinals in swimming, but also decided to recognise world
records for all other three 50 meters strokes, like butterfly,
breaststroke and backstroke in the long-course pool besides
freestyle, the same as its treatment of short-course records.
</P>
<P>
Competition organisers may consider whether to use the
two-start rule which allows for one false start at current major
championships, or the one-start rule with no false starts
allowed.

<HEADLINE> Attention Called to Enterprises Groups (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fourth problem is over-emphasis of low-cost expansion. A
vital reform measure of state-owned enterprises is to enliven the
state-owned economy. Many enterprise groups have expanded quickly
through acquisitions, mergers, and reorganization of assets and
have developed medium-sized and small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, some enterprises groups emphasize low-cost expansion
and open new factories or purchase many small enterprises,
resulting in rapid expansion, rapid rise of management costs, and
a drop in efficiency.
</P>
<P>
In strategies and policies that affect long-term development,
higher cost may bring more benefits and be considered low in the
long term. But, if good strategies and plans are not implemented,
or if wrong strategies are carried out, the low-cost expansion may
ultimately carry a heavy price, as in the case of Japan's Sony in
the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
A fifth problem is that it is wrong to think of assets as being
more important than productive operation. Quite a number of people
believe that assets are a kind of higher form and that enterprises
should shift from production to assets.
</P>
<P>
Many executives think of assets as an independent business and
blindly lead their company into the financial sector, showing keen
zeal for shares and futures to the neglection of their main
business and production.
</P>
<P>
In fact, assets are the business of financial organizations
like investment banks and foundations, but for non-financial
enterprises, especially manufacturers, assets are only a part of
their overall work, and are not at all a higher operation or the
purpose of a company.
</P>
<P>
A sixth and final problem is that some enterprise groups set up
in the past have expanded too fast, and a number of them, which
are bound together through administrative order, do not have very
advanced relations between the general office and the subsidiaries
and lack strong cohesiveness because of imperfect management, and
can not develop economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
Large enterprise groups should intensify construction and
offices should form a complete system of production, marketing,
technological growth, financial control, and assets operations.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's State Bank Allowed to Intervene in Forex: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced Monday that the country's Central
Bank is allowed to intervene in the foreign exchange to ensure the
stability of the local currency ringgit, provided that it is
"deemed absolutely necessary".
</P>
<P>
The ringgit went passed the level of four ringgit to the U.S.
dollar Monday, a new historical low. At the day's close, the local
currency stood at 4.0550/50 against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The fall in ringgit was attributed mainly to regional factors.
</P>
<P>
"As a policy, the State Bank has to ensure that there is
stability of the ringgit," Anwar, who is also finance minister,
told reporters after a function here.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they should preclude the option to intervene
where deemed absolutely necessary," he said. "As a practise, State
Bank has not intervened too aggressively to defend the ringgit,
but it should keep the option (of intervening)."
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank must have the credibility and power to
safeguard and defend the country's financial system, including the
stability of the ringgit, when it thinks that is necessary.
</P>
<P>
"The performance of the general development in the region is a
concern to us," Anwar said. "We will continue to monitor the
situation. I believe we can overcome this."

<HEADLINE> Computers to Have Human Brain Power: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Rapid growth of information
technology will usher in "terra computers" by 2010 which can
process 1 trillion instructions per second, an expert said Monday
at the 85th Indian Science Congress being held in the southern
city of Hyderabad.
</P>
<P>
The 85th Indian Science Congress, which opened last Saturday,
is attended by 5,000 delegates from both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Computers are fast catching up with the human brain and the
day is not far away when micro-chips would process 1 trillion
operations per second, which is close to human brain power,"
Professor Raj Reddy of the Carnegie Mellon University of the
United States said.
</P>
<P>
On future trends and applications of information technology, he
said, "intuitive interface" computers would soon replace the
mouse-driven operations with visual and speech-recognition
systems.
</P>
<P>
By 2020, 100 billion transistors could be accommodated on a
single chip, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth in information technology is leading to a
paradigm shift in all intellectual endeavors with an
all-encompassing impact. "Unless pro-active steps are taken, the
emerging technological growth will lead to a widening gap between
the haves and have-nots," he warned.

SINGAPORE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
decline in thin trading on the Singapore market as the benchmark
Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) lost another 22.25 points
to close at 1,495.95 points on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that stocks went lower as the market was burdened
by the seemingly unceasing weakness in regional currencies and the
increasing desire among investors to hold cash.
</P>
<P>
They noted that most Asian currencies were generally softer,
with the Indonesian rupiah, the Thai baht and the Malaysian
ringgit all plunging to all-time lows earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume was low at 64.45 million units, valued
at 133.96 million Singapore dollars (about 78.34 million U.S.
dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 278 to 41, while 292
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Summit was the most actively traded stock as it registered a
turnover of 3.23 million units. It was followed by IPC Corporation
which had 2.38 million shares traded. Singapore Telecom was next
with 2.26 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Jardine Matheson Holdings (JMH) led the gainers of the day as
it rose by 25 cents to finish at 5.3 U.S. dollars. GP Bat
increased by 16 cents to end at 4.56 Singapore dollars, while
Clipsal picked up by 15 cents to close at 1.55 U.S. dollars.
</P>

On the downside, J Cement and Uniphoenix shared the top spot on
the gainers' list as each of them declined by 40 cents to end at
five and 2.5 Singapore dollars respectively. Malaya Banking fell
by 34 cents to close at 4.18 Singapore dollars. Asia Pacific and
the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Foreign were 30 cents lower at
four Singapore dollars and 20.8 Singapore dollars respectively.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Keep Inflation Rate at Single-Digit Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
determined to keep the inflation rate within single digit for the
year 1998 despite the continuing assault on Asian currencies,
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Habito's statement followed the release of the December
inflation figure of 6.1 percent compared to November's 6.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The December figure brought the 1997 full-year average
inflation rate to 5.1 percent, compared to the 1996 rate of 8.4
percent and below the government's 6- to 6.5-percent target for
the year.
</P>
<P>
The lower-than-expected inflation rate could be attributed to
low prices of most commodities in December, especially of food,
beverages and tobacco, data released by the National Statistics
Office showed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Habito, who is also director-general of the National Economic
and Development Authority (NEDA), cited "a policy environment that
fosters greater competition in the economy" as one of the reasons
for the lower inflation figures.
</P>
<P>
Habito said manufacturing firms have been reluctant in
adjusting their prices due to intense competition in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Stable prices were also made possible through early rice
importation, active price monitoring and avoiding of a wage-price
spiral, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ample supply of fruit and vegetables during the holiday
season, he said, also contributed to the low inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Habito, however, maintained that the government is "watchful"
of the danger signs, particularly the current currency crisis, the
El Nino phenomenon which would cause food prices to rise and
higher election spending.
</P>
<P>
He called for the adoption of economic measures, particularly
prudent monetary and fiscal management and a six-point agenda to
address the currency situation and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Habito noted that the Central Bank, in particular, intends to
pursue prudent monetary management to address the expected surge
of prices.
</P>
<P>
He said the NEDA projected the full-year inflation rate at 6.5
to 7.5 percent for 1998, taking into account likely wage and oil
price adjustments due to the continued fall of the peso.

<HEADLINE> ADB Urges Vietnam to Speed Up Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Monday urged Vietnam to accelerate its current economic reform
process to avoid a currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam can minimize the impact of the Asian currency crisis on
its economy through good macroeconomic management and by speeding
up its economic reform, including deregulation and liberalization,
the Manila-based bank said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said this is the consensus reached by economic experts
at the High Level Policy Seminar on the Financial Developments in
Asia and Vietnam's Economy recently held in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized by the ADB, the State Bank of Vietnam
and the Central Institute for Economic Management, was attended by
senior government officials and representatives from the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the U.N.
Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The experts agreed that Vietnam's exchange rate policy needs to
be flexible to avoid a significant appreciation of the currency in
real terms, the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of the production sector, the financial
sector and the external capital account need to be carefully
sequenced and not prematurely implemented and it should be
accompanied by a solid legal and accounting system and good
prudential oversight of the financial system, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The reform of state-owned enterprises, which still play a
dominant role in the economy, remains critical and should be
encouraged so as not to restrict the needed reforms in the
financial sector, the experts noted.
</P>
<P>
External resource flows must be encouraged in view of low
domestic savings and should be efficiently allocated to the
productive sectors, based on Vietnam's comparative advantage.
</P>
<P>
As competition for foreign direct investments increases
substantially, Vietnam should carefully review the incentive
structure so that these investments do not go into inefficient
capital-intensive industrial sectors, the ADB said.

<HEADLINE> Competition to Rise in Thailand's Auto Sales in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's automobile sales in
1998 will be a buyers' market as sales are expected to drop
drastically, according to industry experts.
</P>
<P>
The Automotive Industry Club of Thailand forecast that auto
sales in the country in 1998 could be around 200,000 units,
compared with about 360,000 units in 1997, the Nation newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The total auto sales in the country soared to 589,000 units in
1996, the highest in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
As a result of steep declines in the baht's value and consumer
purchasing power, fierce competition is expected in 1998 from
manufacturers, who will be fighting hard to keep their market
shares and to compete against used cars, club officials said.
</P>
<P>
To promote their sales, auto companies will try to absorb their
losses, offering more reasonable prices, longer warranty periods
and easy payment conditions and providing better service.
</P>
<P>
In the last quarter of 1997, nearly all vehicle assemblers in
the country reduced their production, either operating at half
capacity or closing down temporarily.
</P>
<P>
It would take several years for the industry to get back to its
size in 1997, the Nation quoted auto industry experts as saying.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders Energy Chief to Prevent Blackout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
directed Energy Secretary Francisco Viray on Monday to take
measures to prevent a recurrence of the weekend blackout.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered National Power Corporation President Guido
Delgado "to review, reinforce and improve the overall Luzon grid
system and all other systems countrywide" to prevent potential
blackout, a news release from the Presidential Palace said.
</P>
<P>
The 11-hour blackout which hit most parts of Luzon Island,
including Metro Manila, on Saturday afternoon, kept millions of
homes in darkness during the New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
In his updated report to the president, Delgado said a full
investigation of the blackout is going on.
</P>
<P>
He said that at around 1:28 p.m. last Saturday, an insulator
bolt of a 115-kv electric pole along the Binan-San Pedro, Laguna
transmission line near Metro Manila was damaged, causing fire and
a short circuit on the line and this "initiated the first major
disturbance."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Press Secretary Hector Villanueva dismissed as
baseless claims by opposition quarters that the power outage was
part of a dress rehearsal for a declaration of a state of national
emergency leading to the cancellation of presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The united opposition has accused the Ramos administration of
stage-managing the blackout to pave the way for Ramos' stay in
power beyond June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Villanueva said the blackout was caused by a technical problem
and politics had nothing to do with it.

<HEADLINE> Attack Aims at Wrecking Iraq-Jordan Ties: Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi diplomat who survived an
assassination attempt here Saturday has said the attack was aimed
at wrecking the ties between Jordan and Iraq, the semi-official
Jordan Times newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
"They do not want our relations with Jordan to get better or
smoother," Iraqi Commercial Counselor Abdul Rahim Taher told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He further laid blames on "either the Iraqi oppositions or
Israel or the United States" for carrying out the shooting at him
and his 14-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
A gunman in a passing car fired a shot with a silencer-equipped
pistol at the 45-year-old diplomat and his son while he was
starting his car in front of his house Saturday morning. The
bullet hit the car but both of them were unharmed .
</P>
<P>
The car with the attacker then sped away. The diplomat said he
had noticed the same car following him last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Ambassador to Jordan Nouri Al Weiss has said the
assassination attempt was carried out "by some elements who do not
want to see any rapprochement in relations between Jordan and Iraq
taking place."
</P>
<P>
"There are some parties who are unhappy because the ties
between Jordan and Iraq have started to return to normal. They are
trying to fish in troubled waters," the ambassador added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's acting Minister of State for Information Affairs
Nasser Lawzi said Saturday that Jordan is very concerned about the
attack and that the police are investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
Tensions mounted in bilateral relations after Iraq executed
four Jordanians in December on charges of smuggling car parts into
Iraq. Jordan expelled seven Iraqi diplomats in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
But there have been improvements since Iraq agreed to renew an
agreement to supply oil to Jordan at favorable prices.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Ministry Commments on Taiwanese Singapore Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China today said it hopes that
Singapore will stick to a "one China" policy and will not do
something that harms bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The comment comes from Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang,
who was asked to comment on the recent visit of Taiwan's
"vice-president" Lien Chan to Singapore and his meetings with
Singaporean leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government firmly opposes the "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan" policies, and opposes the practice of any
country that has diplomatic ties with China of having any form
of official relations or contacts with Taiwan, Shen said. The
government's position on this is consistent and clear-cut, firm,
and is respected by the majority of the world's countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government of the People's Republic of China is recognized
as the sole legitimate government representing the whole people of
China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of that, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> SADC Member States' Growth Rate to Be Up: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) is posed to record average growth of
between four and five percent in 1998, save for new members
Seychelles and the Democratic Republic of Congo, a local
economist predicted recently.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Kotelo, economist at the Pretoria-based Africa
Institute, warned however that growth levels in certain SADC
states including Zambia, could come in a at lower rate.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, Botswana and Mauritius looked set to score rates of
about five percent this year, while the growths in Swaziland,
Zimbabwe and Malawi could come in at Between 3.8 and four
percent.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's growth could be less than the SADC average, maybe at
two percent, and this could be exacerbated if the political
situation in Lusaka worsened in the coming months, Kotelo said.
</P>
<P>
Kotelo was also pessimistic about Angola, saying that business
links in the oil industry were too poor for the country to
exploit fully its oil wealth.
</P>
<P>
The World In 1988, a recently published outlook by the
London-based The Economist Group, forecast a 3.2 percent growth
rate for South Africa, and warned that high real interest rates
would undermine investment and private consumption.
</P>
<P>
The publication's prediction for Zimbabwe is 3.1 percent,
accompanied by a warning that the "preferment process will stifle
growth and undermine efforts to diversify the economy from its
reliance on primary commodities".
</P>
<P>
Kaire Mbuende, the SADC's executive secretary, said recently
that the SADC economies would expand at a rate of six percent in
1998, following the previous year's trend during which member
states achieved positive growth rates of between two and 13
percent.

<HEADLINE> 200 Illegal Migrants Detained in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 200 foreign nationals
were detained late Sunday night by Turkish police in Istanbul as
they attempted to illegally emigrate to European countries, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia said the police staged the operations at 22:00 local
time and those foreign nationals caught included Pakistanis,
Syrians, Afghans and Bengaleses.
</P>
<P>
In response to a letter from his Italian counterpart Lamberto
Dini on the latest fleeing wave of Turkish nationals to Italy,
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem on Sunday said that his
country is ready to cooperate with Italy to combat the illegal
trend.
</P>
<P>
Cem said the current problem is a case of illegal human
smuggling which is an "extremely serious form of organized crime."
</P>
<P>
"This criminal activity is based on the exploitation of the
understandable desire to have a better life," Cem said, adding
that Turkey has consistently sought multilateral cooperation
against all forms of organized crime and international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Cem pointed out: "We are taking all measures needed to stem
illegal immigration as an organized crime, through or from
Turkey."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, 18 unemployed migrants, aged between 20 and
25, were discovered without proper exit permits in a truck
loaded with tires at Istanbul's Haydarpasa port.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that they intended to travel by ferry across
the Mediterranean to Italy, before applying for asylum in
Germany. Each had paid about 1,100 U.S. dollars to the organizers
of the trip.
</P>
<P>
The flood of migrants to Italy started in the past week when
some 1,000 refugees, mainly Iraqi and Turkish Kurds, arrived in
southern Italy, causing tensions in relations between Ankara and
Rome.
</P>
<P>
Around 2,000 Kurdish refugees had arrived in Italy's Adriatic
coast since September.

<HEADLINE> All Zambian Parties Urged to Take Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The National Patriotic Alliance
(NPA) grouping 12 opposition parties has appealed all Zambian
political parties to the inter-party talks to put national
interests above individual party.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted NPA acting chairman Chibeza Mfuni
as saying on Sunday that the umbrella alliance remains firmly
committed to serious dialog and maintains that everything
possible should be done by all to revive the inter-party talks,
which have postponed to late this month from early this month
after a number of opposition parties including the NPA announced
their withdrawal of the talks in protest against the arrest of
former president Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
MFUNI said NPA leaders resolve that the inter-party talks to
be attended by party presidents has failed and another round of
secretaries meeting should be held to address and resolve
preliminary issues.
</P>
<P>
He said the preliminary issues have been communicated to the
government, which include lifting the state of emergency, releasing
political detainees and security guarantee for the party leaders to
the talkks.
</P>
<P>
"The presidents' meeting must be taken very seriously and not
in a confrontational approach. this meeting should be about
handshaking in a reassuring atmosphere," he said.
</P>
<P>
At an earlier briefing Malimba Masheke, chairman of the United
National Independence Party (UNIP) led by Kaunda, said UNIP, one
member of the NPA, is willing to participate in any "meaningful"
inter-party talks when Kaunda is freed.
</P>
<P>
Masheke called for an urgent national dialogue under a neutral
convenor to accommodate all stakeholders including churches,
non-government orgazinations (ngo) and civil societies.
</P>
<P>
But Micheal Sata, national secretary of the ruling Movement
for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), rejected NPA and UNIP's
pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was arrested on 25 in alleged connection with the
October 28 foiled coup and transferred from prison to house
arrest on 31 of last month.
</P>
<P>
At the preliminary meeting attended by party secretaries early
last month an agenda was worked out for the inter-party talks.
However, after Kaunda's arrest the planned talks were plunged
into stalemate.

<HEADLINE> Religious Conflicts Dangerous, Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has urged people of different religions to avoid
conflicts, otherwise the consequences will be dangerous, press
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony to mark the centenary celebrations of
the Western Diocese of the Moravian Church in the Tabora Region,
the president reiterated that people who speak against other
religions will be punished according to the law.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanians have long lived peacefully irrespective of
their creeds, Mkapa said, adding that religious conflicts are
dangerous and in some parts of the world people were killing each
other because of differences in religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
Of late, some people have been distributing cassettes,
booklets and convening meetings in which other religions are
disparaged, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Those who are doing this are infringing upon the freedom and
constitutional rights of others, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the government's duty to protect religious rights of
individuals and ensure that such rights are not violated, the
president told bishops from other denominations and government
and political leaders on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
A total of 80 percent of people in Tanzania are Christians and
Muslims, with the rest holding indigenous beliefs.
</P>
<P>
The president called on all religious leaders to foster love
and peace in the society, and praised religious organizations for
their contribution to the undertakings of education, water supply
and health.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Bishop Isack Nichodemus of the Moravian
Church donated 100 bags of maize as relief food to Mwakabasa
villagers in Nzega District. The village is engulfed by floods
which have isolated it from other areas.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Kenyans Choose Moi Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Having won about 2.46 million
or 40.12 percent of the total votes cast by a big majority,
incumbent Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi is to be sworn in
today to continue his 19-year-old rule till 2002.
</P>
<P>
All major independent polling observer organizations have
admitted that the "results do on the whole reflect the wishes of
the Kenyan voters and should be accepted in total."
</P>
<P>
As the last of Africa's "Big Men," it seems Moi holds some
trump cards which have made common Kenyans believe he is their
best choice no matter what challenges the country is facing ahead
of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
One of Moi's key trump cards should be his least tribal color.
He is the only one who has collected more than 25 percent of the
votes in five of the country's eight provinces -- a "must"
requirement by Kenya's laws for a qualified head of state.
</P>
<P>
His closest challenger, Democratic Party's Chairman Mwai
Kibaki, who is from Kenya's most populous tribe of Kikuyu, met
the 25-percent-rule in three provinces while other three big
rivals only made it in their respective tribe's home province.
</P>
<P>
Tribalism has been surging especially since 1992 when
multi-party politics was introduced in the country with 42
tribes. Moi then bowed reluctantly to pressure from home and
abroad to implement multi-party democracy while bitterly blaming
it for what he perceives to be a hotbed of tribalism, violence
and other social evils.
</P>
<P>
Moi himself, a member of the Tugen sub-group of the minority
Kalenjin ethnic confederation, has for years pursued policies of
supporting small tribes and making them allies, together with his
famous Nyayo philosophy -- peace, love and unity.
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old Moi, who holds the record as the longest
serving president, vice president and member of parliament in the
history of Kenya, also owes his success to his rich political
experiences, local analysts say.
</P>
<P>
"Moi is like a giraffe, while others are like ordinary small
animals. When they are busy grazing down there, the giraffe is
seeing very far," said late Jaramogi Oginda Odinga, the first
vice president and Father of Kenya's opposition.
</P>
<P>
In the middle of last year, he timely and swiftly softened his
original hard tune on constitutional reforms for which the
opposition sought by organizing nationwide strikes and rallies.
</P>
<P>
As a result of his sudden change, parliamentary members from
both the ruling Kenya African National Union and the Opposition
had worked out the constitution reform bills and passed them
through as enacted laws.
</P>
<P>
The move not only to a great extent enhanced democracy and
reduced the then mounting violence and tension nationwide, but
also persuaded many Kenyans of Moi's sincerity for his commitment
to social changes.
</P>
<P>
To the satisfaction of his fellow people, Moi has pledged, in
his final term, to improve government efficiency, remove
corruption, attract more foreign investment, further adjust
economic structure, promote privatization, create more jobs,
develop education and etc.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sharp division among the opposition, whose 14
presidential candidates stood basically on their respective
tribal line, has given Moi a great advantage by making votes
against him dispersed.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders had made repeated attempts throughout 1997
to churn out their common presidential candidate to defeat Moi,
but the efforts ended in vain due to their different tribal
interests and personal ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Moi's success is also attributed to his image as a prominent
peace-broker and ardent advocate of regional cooperation in the
Great Lakes region and eastern Africa. None of his rivals can be
his match in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"I will vote for Moi because he loves peace," said a nurse
working for a private clinic in Nairobi on the eve of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Moi sponsored several regional summits to mediate
conflicts in the former Zaire and southern Sudan. As chairman of
the seven-member Inter-Governmental Authority of Development, he
has played a key role in re-opening peace talks between the
Sudanese warring sides after a three-year deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Election fever is fading fast, but tough challenges still
remain. Can the helmsman bring about a more brilliant future for
his people by whom he has been chosen again?
</P>
<P>
No matter what follows, it is quite clear that "Moi has made
his own footprints in the sands of time," said former British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during her visit to Kenya in
1988.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Sell Gas to Israel Via Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia is planning to sell
natural gas to Israel through Turkey, local newspaper Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Russian Ambassador in Turkey Vadim Kuznetsov told the paper
that the natural gas will be transported to Israel through the
planned Black Sea pipeline between Turkey and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"It was mentioned not only during the recent visit of Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to Ankara, but also when Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netenyahu visited Moscow," Kuznetsov
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Canadian and Israeli companies would be involved
in the construction of the pipeline but failed to mention when the
project will be completed.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador, however, admitted that the main user
of the Russian gas will be Turkey because Turkey is an
energy-starving country.
</P>
<P>
At present, Turkey purchases about 6 billion cubic meters of
natural gas from Russia per year, but the figure is estimated to
increase to 30 billion cubic meters following the construction of
the Black Sea pipeline.

HARARE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Department of National Parks
and Wild Life Management of Zimbabwe will start a 1.3 billion
Zimbabwe Dollars (80 million U.S. dollars) project this year to
improve the operations of the country' 11 major parks, The Herald
daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The project, to be extended for over six years, will help the

services in more cost effective ways.
</P>
<P>
The parks rehabilitation and conservation project will be
implemented with assistance from the World Bank, International
Development Agency, the Global Environmental Fund and U.N.
development program.
</P>
<P>
Chales Chipato, secretary for mines, environment and tourism,

establishment of the Parks and Wild Life Conservation Fund to
manage the parks and wild life estate as a commercial entity.
</P>
<P>
The project, he said, aims at improving and enhancing
decision-making by management, assessing skills and training
needs and establishing a performance and evaluation review
system.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are
scheduled to set up the East African Business Dispute Settlement
Center to meet the needs of growing regional trade and
investment, the East African reported today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper said the three member countries of the
East African Co-operation had agreed on the structure of the
business dispute arbitration body at an experts' meeting held
recently in Arusha, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Once it is set up, the paper quoted participants of the
meeting as saying that it would no longer be necessary for
parties to take recourse to international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The decision to set up the center came at a time when there is
growing trade and investment within the east African region.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the meeting predict that disputes are bound to
occur, hence the need for an arbitration center.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, experts have recommended the harmonization of
national laws and the introduction of United Nations Commission
on International Trade Law model law on arbitration and
conciliation.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania and Uganda were required to update their laws on
arbitration by July this year as they have outdated laws which
are still subject to courts of law.
</P>
<P>
If approved in its current form, the center will have
international jurisdiction and comprise seven arbitrators, one of
whom would be chairman, and each member state will nominate two
people qualified for appointment to the center as arbitrators.

The economy in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province grew a great deal
with a GDP of 113 billion yuan, an increase of 16 percent over the

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Juvenile Crimes Drop in 1997: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Juvenile crimes in Kuwait
dropped by 12.5 percent in 1997 as a result of strict
implementation of anti-crime laws and preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sunday newspaper here today, director of the
Juvenile Care Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs and
Labor, Nasser Al-Ammar, said there were 2,752 juvenile crimes
during the year as compared to 3,146 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The rate of crimes committed by teenagers had been on the rise
since the Gulf War in 1991, and this was the first-time decrease
in six years.
</P>
<P>
He said a committee was formed last year to fill loopholes in
the Juvenile Law in light of new social developments in the
country after the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, his department had organized a preventive
program aimed at minimizing juvenile delinquency. The first
quarter of 1998 will witness the implementation of the
department's second preventive program, he added.
</P>
<P>
Juvenile delinquency has been a serious social problem in the
country and attracted great attention and raised serious concern
among the people over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Experts cited negative effect of various media means, inability
to keep pace with the swift changes in the economic and social
fields, negligence of family as well as consequences of the Gulf
War.

<HEADLINE> China Continues To Increase Foreign Exchange Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Sources at China's State
Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC) say the country will
increase foreign exchange controls to protect financial stability.
</P>
<P>
Since reforms began in 1994, a system of current account
convertibility was established to eliminate restrictions on
transactions, and China has fairly large foreign exchange reserves
and a stable yuan.
</P>
<P>
For the past three years the People's Bank of China and the
SAEC have done country-wide inspections and exchange control
officials began to see that supervision should be increased
further when they found that some enterprises, individuals, and
international speculators were involved in illegal exchange and
securities activities.
</P>
<P>
SAEC sources say they have closely cooperated with other
departments to focus their investigation on large cases and to
deal strictly with law-breakers.
</P>
<P>
For the past few years, exchange controls have included more
advanced technical measures to allow the early exposure of
abnormal practices, and the system is being connected by computer
to major banks for transmission of information.
</P>
<P>
Exchange control departments have also increased cooperation
with Customs offices. In mid-1997, the SAEC and the General
Administration of Customs signed a memorandum on cracking down on
exchange fraud that involves the use of false declaration forms.
</P>
<P>
SAEC officials say that organizations involved in illegal
activities will face severe penalties and will be subject to
stricter supervision in the future. Those who break the law will
be referred to public security departments for investigation.

by three avalanches at the weekend in the Canadian province of
British Columbia (B.C.).
</P>
<P>
The avalanches swept down mountains in southeastern British
Columbia burying recreational skiers and snowmobilers.
</P>
<P>
"There have never been so many deaths in one day among three
groups in three different areas," an official from the Canadian
Avalanche Centre said.
</P>
<P>
The storm has prevented police from recovering the bodies of
five skiers and a search is on for one who was still missing
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
So far this winter, 13 people have been killed by avalanches in
western Canada.

<HEADLINE> Differences Not Barriers, Says Kyrgyz President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev
said different attitudes toward the integration of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) should not become
obstacles in cooperation between the CIS countries.
</P>
<P>
Akayev was quoted by the newspaper, Slovo Kyrgyzstana (Word of
Kyrgyzstan), on Saturday. He said the different attitudes toward
the integration process resulted from different situations facing
the countries in their transitional periods.
</P>
<P>
He said the CIS firstly denoted an economic association, which
should be conducted on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Every country in the four-state customs union (Kyrgyzstan,
Kazakhstan, Russia and Belarus) faced two questions, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
One is the establishment of an open space for the free flow of
commodities, capital and labor forces inside the four states. The
other is the creation of conditions for the integration of the
countries into the open world economic system.
</P>
<P>
Akayev was critical of the imposition of high transit duties by
the customs union states on the Kyrgyzstan-exported goods, which
he deemed was squeezing Kyrgyzstan out of the CIS and the customs
union market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the domestic situation, Akayev said Kyrgyzstan
first achieved a stable macro-economy and steady economic growth
inside the CIS.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan enjoyed a growth rate of more than 8 percent in
gross national product (GNP) in 1997, with very low inflation. The
total output in agriculture grew by 8.9 percent. The country is
now preparing for a new economic take-off.

<HEADLINE> External Factors Limit Thailand's Exports: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's export performance in
the first 10 months of 1997 showed that the country gained limited
export opportunities from the Thai currency's effective
devaluation, according to the Nation newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thai exporters did not benefit from the baht's float since July
2 as much as they had originally expected, because several other
Asian currencies have also depreciated.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports in the said 10 months rose only 19.8 percent
in baht terms, as compared to an almost 50 percent depreciation of
the baht against the U.S. dollar. As a result, Thai exports rose
by only 4.4 percent in dollar terms in the 10 months.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, who is
concurrently the commerce minister, attributed the sluggish export
performance to regional competition, as Thailand's ASEAN
neighbors, such as Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, also
depreciated their currencies and exported cheaper goods to the
world market, the Nation quotes him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's farm exports will also face fewer opportunities in
South Korea because of its domestic economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Supachai believed that the competitive currency depreciation is
likely to spur a protectionist trend in the United States, which
is the most important export market for most Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Ministry Commments on Taiwanese Singapore Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China today said it hopes that
Singapore will stick to a "one China" policy and will not do
something that harms bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The comment comes from Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang,
who was asked to comment on the recent visit of Taiwan's
"vice-president" Lien Chan to Singapore and his meetings with
Singaporean leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government firmly opposes the "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan" policies, and opposes the practice of any
country that has diplomatic ties with China of having any form
of official relations or contacts with Taiwan, Shen said. The
government's position on this is consistent and clear-cut, firm,
and is respected by the majority of the world's countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government of the People's Republic of China is recognized
as the sole legitimate government representing the whole people of
China, and Taiwan is an alienable part of that, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> India's Industry for Stable Government After Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- India's industry is for a
stable government after the general elections to be held from
February 16, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Leading industrialists believe that single party majority rule
at the Center would do a lot of good to the country's economy, The
Hindustan Times said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Most of those who talked to the paper were, however, clear
about one thing -- only the majority party or partner in the
coalition should lead the government and as far as possible the
system of "outside support" should be avoided as it gave immense
authority to the outside supporter without the accompanying
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Industry representatives were also honest about the
impossibility of the economy reviving very fast. In fact, one of
them said "1998 is not going to be a picnic," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"What we need today is political stability, end of uncertainty
and restoration of business," said L. M. Thapar, manager of BILT
Company.
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely hope that a stable government will emerge, either
a single party government or a coalition government led by
majority party without outside support. Such a government will
bring about much needed psychological change and help in greater
flow of investment both domestic and foreign," he said.
</P>
<P>
"People are fed up with continued political instability. This
has done immense harm to the country," another industrialist
Kulwant Rai said.

<HEADLINE> LTTE Member Confesses Attacks on Sri Lankan Sanctuary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The attacks on the Yala Wildlife
Sanctuary in Southern Sri Lanka last year were carried out under
the instruction of a leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE), a captured LTTE cadre has confessed to police.
</P>
<P>
Police said Monday that the LTTE activist who was arrested in
Batticaloa, Eastern province, has confessed that he was ordered by
an LTTE leader, identified as Mahesan, to destroy all government
properties within the sanctuary park.
</P>
<P>
He was hand-picked for the job because he is familiar with this
area and fluent in the Sinhala language, police quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He led a group of 24 armed rebels to enter the jungle park for
their first raid.
</P>
<P>
On their way they came across three Sinhala villagers, who
showed the attackers the jungle paths and gave them information
about bungalows in the park.
</P>
<P>
In return, the villagers were given 3,000 Rupees (50 U.S.
dollars) and a deer killed by the rebels in the park.
</P>
<P>
The rebels used the information to launch their second attack
on the park, police said.
</P>
<P>
However, police said the arrested activist could not provide
relevant dates of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Yala, one of the key sanctuaries in Sri Lanka, was closed for
several months last year due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Many bungalows were burnt, vans were hijacked and workers and
villagers were killed in the park last year. Almost all the
attacks were blamed on the LTTE.

<P>
YANGON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 42 state-owned factories
under the ministries of industry, livestock breeding and fishery,
and commerce will be added to the privatization scheme in Myanmar,
an official information sheet said.
</P>
<P>
The privatization scheme also includes other two livestock
breeding farms and 76 cinemas of the Information Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar announced privatization of 51 state-owned
economic enterprises (SEE) in the first phase in January 1995 in
line with the market-oriented economy, the privatization process
has been underway in various forms including auctioning and
leasing out the SEE or establishing joint ventures with local and
foreign entrepreneurs or operating either under buy-back or
counter-trade system.
</P>
<P>
Since then, more than two dozen state-owned saw mills in
Myanmar's Sagaing division and over 37 cinemas in different states
and divisions have been privatized.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Urges Balance in Immigration Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The right balance must be found to
resolve the immigration problem, especially in the light of waves
of Kurdish refugees, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said
in Florence Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dini said the problem was "extremely delicate" because it
involved humanitarian aspects to which Italy must remain highly
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government's position is to grant asylum, as it has
done to those claiming refugee status on the grounds of political
persecution. At the same time, Rome is stepping up its controls
along its land borders and coastlines, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must take into account that Italy is part of the Schengen
system and, therefore, we also have a duty towards the countries
of northern Europe where most of these refugees plan to settle."
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, Dini and Interior Minister
Giorgio Napolitano were to meet Sunday evening in Rome to discuss
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Germany criticisms, Dini said he did not think
Germany blamed his country. Germany knew it also had a constant
and illegal flow of immigration that originated at Germany's
eastern border.
</P>
<P>
"Italy, because of its geographical position, is the most
exposed to this assault." He said it was harder to maintain border
controls at sea than on land. In any case, the minister felt
confident that Italy could count on the full understanding of its
partners.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANBKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Most Thai people were spending
less during the past six months because of the economic crunch,
according to a survey published Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 74 percent of the 5,914 people interviewed nationwide in
December by Suan Dusit Rajabhat Institute said they had tightened
their belt to cope with the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
A total 3,052 people, or 51.6 percent, said they did not have
enough to live on and were in debt, while 2,452 respondents, or
41.5 percent, said they could just about make ends meet and did
not have anything left to save.
</P>
<P>
Only 410 people (or 6.9 percent) surveyed said they could
manage to save some money, after the Thai currency was floated on
July 2 last year.
</P>
<P>
About 22.66 percent of the people interviewed said they had
sought extra jobs during the latter half of last year.
</P>
<P>
Up to December 31, 1997, the baht lost 83.35 percent of its
value against the U.S. dollar. The reference rate for that day was
47.286 baht to the dollar, as compared to 25.79 on the day prior

BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China's civil aviation industry
ordered 97 aircraft from European and American manufacturers in
1997, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Government purchases made up the bulk of these, ordering 50
aircraft from Boeing and 30 from Europe's Airbus, but private
airlines have broken new ground in aircraft purchases. The Yuanda
Group of southern China ordered a six-place business aircraft and
a Bell-208 helicopter from abroad. China also purchased five
passenger aircraft from Russia.

<P>
The European manufacturer AIR increased its role in the China
market when ten of its AIR-72 passenger aircraft were ordered,

<HEADLINE> Austrian Exports to Eastern Europe Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Austria's exports to Eastern
Europe and developing countries rose 25 percent in 1997, making a
major contribution to its rising exports growth.
</P>
<P>
Jan Stankovsky, an expert on exports in the Vienna Institute
for Economic Research (VIER), told Die Presse daily that Austria's
exports to Eastern Europe accounted for 17 percent of the
country's total exports in 1997, a remarkable increase over the 10
percent of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Austria's exports to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, Latin America and China also gained upward momentum.
</P>
<P>
However, exports to Southeast Asia were still not encouraging
in 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although exports to the European Union, the biggest trading
partner of Austria, increased by 10.7 percent in 1997, its
percentage in the total dropped from 68 percent of 1996 to 63
percent of 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another development in 1997 was the 20 percent increase of the
exports of high value-added products.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to those changes, the total volume of Austria's exports
in the first nine months of 1997 increased by 16.3 percent, the
highest in 20 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the VIER predicted economic growth of Austria in
1997 would exceed the expected 1.6 percent, and in 1998 was likely
to climb to 2.5 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Poppy growing in northern
Thailand's province of Mae Hong Son is on the increase after years
of gradually reducing plantation sizes, according to a local press
report Monday.
</P>
<P>
In 1987-88 there were 10,737 rai (1,718 hectares) of poppy
plantations. In 1994-95 this had been cut to 1,543 rai (246
hectares). But recent figures say the size has grown to 2,611 rai
(417 hectares), making the province the country's biggest poppy
producer.
</P>
<P>
A drug intelligence officer in Mae Hong Son was quoted as
saying that the crops were grown in steep valleys in the
province's Pai district and Pang Ma Pha sub-district which are
almost inaccessible to the authorities seeking to destroy poppy.
</P>
<P>
The crop is then supplied to heroin production plants along the
Myanmar border.
</P>

Opium, heroin and amphetamines were the top three illicit drugs

<HEADLINE> Italian Premier Says Kurdish Exodus Needs EU Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
said Sunday that European cooperation is needed to help deal with
a flood of Kurdish refugees.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 people, many of them Kurds, arrived in Italy
last week seeking asylum. Some 1,300 more are believed to be on
their way.
</P>
<P>
Over recent years, Turkey's southeast has become a bitter
battleground between government forces and militant Kurdish
separatists who are fighting for an independent Kurdish state.
</P>
<P>
On the Italian offer of political asylum for the Kurdish
refugees, most of them from Turkey, Prodi said such status will be
granted to those who are worthy of it.
</P>
<P>
"The right to asylum is granted on an individual basis, and not
collectively. This is a very firm position because there is a
common line among all the European countries," the Italian prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi told reporters: "Italy considers Turkey a country not
only of strategic importance but also essential in the framework
of political relations for peace in the Mediterranean."
</P>
<P>
Some European countries worry that the immigration problem will
soon become theirs and accused Italy of being soft on the
Kurds. But Prodi said a common European policy was needed because
it was such a large-scale phenomenon and individual countries
could not cope effectively on their own.
</P>
<P>
The Italian prime minister said that cooperation among the EU
states was necessary.

<HEADLINE> Promising Mining Industry in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
Region will launch broader cooperation with domestic and foreign
counterparts in the mining industry, in a bid to speed up the
development of the local mining industry, according to the regional
government.
</P>
<P>
The region is going to develop its mining industry by using
government investments and introducing domestic and foreign
investments, expertise and trained people.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has found 96 kinds of mineral deposits, with the proven
reserves of seven ore deposits among the top five in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, low management level and backward technologies have
slowed down the development of the local mining industry.
</P>
<P>
The region now has 220 mining enterprises, with the combined
output value only standing at 170 million yuan in 1996. These
enterprises now mine only 22 kinds of mineral deposits.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the regional government said that the region will
focus on the production of electrolytic copper, and the mining of
chromium, gold, lead, zinc and silver in the period from now to
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The annual output value of the region's mining industry is
planned to increase at an average rate of 20.8 percent in the
coming three years.

<HEADLINE> Sample Gives Paulauskas Lead in Lithuanian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Former prosecutor Arturas
Paulauskas has gained the upper hand over his rival, Valdas
Adamkus, early results suggested Sunday in the Lithuanian runoff
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Early results based on the count of 46,484 votes, or just under
two percent, showed that Paulauskas pocketed 55.75 percent of the
vote with Adamkus on 43.32 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, electoral commission officials said it was too early
to tell from the initial figures whether Paulauskas would finally
win, but the ex-prosecutor's election team was confident.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had predicted a close fight between the two
candidates. Both are new hands in politics and have campaigned on
the plank of being void of past scandals and political battles.
</P>
<P>
Paulauskas and Adamkus won through to the runoff from a first
round on December 21, with 42.5 percent and 28.2 percent of the
vote respectively.
</P>
<P>
Although Adamkus lagged behind in the first round, opinion
polls gave him a slight lead for the runoff, but around 14 percent
of voters were undecided.
</P>
<P>
Both candidates appealed for liberal economic reforms and
efforts to integrate Lithuania into the European Union and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

<HEADLINE> Ho Chi Minh City Plans Economic Rejuvenation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's
largest economic hub, has set up an action plan to re-organize the
banking system.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam news agency (VNA) reported Sunday that the plan, a
part of a programme to promote investment and develop state-run
industries, also involved strengthening co-ordination with the
State Bank of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The agency said renovation of the financial and banking system
is one of the five major economic and social tasks in the city's
development plan for 1998, which will also focus on the city's 18
commercial joint-stock banks to improve the efficiency and health
of credit activities.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of Ho Chi Minh City was quoted by VNA as
saying that banking staff should receive further training to meet
the continuing market-oriented economy. The official claimed the
public now had more than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in home savings,
which the banking sector could mobilize for production and
business development projects.
</P>
<P>
To improve the investment environment, city authorities will
focus on administrative reforms, introduce incentive policies
involving tax concessions, land rental reforms and infrastructure
projects to attract foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The city hoped that more foreign direct investment projects
would begin in 1998, involving industrial production and
processing industries for export goods to help boost the city's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Domestic investment would also be encouraged, with loans being
allocated to enterprises for upgrading technology to compete with
imported goods, while priority policies on taxes, capital and
simplifying procedures would also be introduced.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh city recorded a 12.1 percent growth in gross
domestic product (GDP), or 3.1 percent over the national level in
1997. Its industrial value jumped by 13.7 per cent as against
13.2 percent for the whole country.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Plans to Develop Three Hi-Tech Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the largest
industrial metropolis in China, plans to boost three hi-tech
industries in the coming few years, according to local government
sources.
</P>
<P>
Three hi-tech sectors -- information technology, biological
pharmaceutical and new materials -- will help increase the city's
output value of high-tech industries to 170 billion yuan by the
year 2000, up 100 billion on 1996.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech industries accounted for a mere two percent of the
city's total industrial output value in 1992, with the figure
rising to 14 percent 1997, and even further to 20 percent by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The development of hi-tech industries will help develop the
city's six pillar industries -- automobiles, household electric
appliances, petrochemicals, iron and steel, and power
generation equipment.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech products currently account for only five percent of the
city's total exports, with the figure expected to hit 15 percent
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Local officials note that the development of hi-tech industries
has contributed greatly to the city's economy which has grown by
14 percent annually over the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Philippine International Reserves Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross
international reserves dropped 23 percent to 9 billion US dollars
as of the end of 1997 from a high of 11.7 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country's monetary authorities are now looking for ways to
beef up and rebuild the dwindling dollar reserves, local press
Monday quoted Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson as saying.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, Singson said, gives priority to raising
additional financing from commercial and official sources to
further bolster international reserves.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the central bank was seriously considering the
issuance or floatation of 500 million dollars worth of bonds with
maturity ranging from five to ten years.
</P>
<P>
In fact, negotiations with several banks to raise the initial
money are already ongoing, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
On top of this, Singson said official money from multilateral
sources such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
Japan Export-Import Bank (Jexim) bank is forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this month or early next month, the Philippines
would be able to draw from the IMF and Jexim bank some 640 million
dollars worth of financing tied to the country's compliance of the
commitments under the IMF's Extended Fund Facility, he said.

JAKARTA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers have found the cockpit
voice recorder (CVR), a crucial part of the black box which could
help explain the cause of the Singapore Silk Air plane crash on
December 19 last year in Indonesia's South Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the South Sumatra district police said on
Sunday the CVR that should have monitored conversations and noises
on the flight deck minutes before impact was discovered from the
muddy riverbed at 4:35 p.m. on Sunday, reports reaching here
Monday said.
</P>
<P>
He said the CVR was found by the Singapore dredger Moshasi
which had been sent to help search operations last week.
</P>
<P>
The CVR could shed some light on the cause of the accident. It
records radio transmissions and all sounds in the cockpit, such as
the pilots' voices and engine noises.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on December 27, rescuers discovered the flight data
recorder (FDR) of the ill-fated plane which was later sent to the
National Transportation Safety Board in Washington for
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The plane with 104 people aboard crashed on its flight from
Jakarta to Singapore. None of the passengers and crew survived the
crash, the second major air accident in Indonesia last year.
</P>
<P>
No intact bodies of the victims have been found so far.

WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. balloonist Steve Fossett
today floated his "Solo Spirit" balloon across Bulgaria and over
the western edge of the Black Sea at a slow pace, his mission team
at St. Louis said.
</P>
<P>
At 5:20 a.m. CST (1120 GMT), Fossett was heading south at 25
mph (38 kph) at an altitude of 22,000 feet (3,625 meters). His
mission team at Washington University in St. Louis projected that
Fossett would pick up winds flowing eastward at a more rapid clip,
sending the balloon over the southern edge of the Black Sea and
into Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Fossett, on his fourth day mission to circle the globe without
stop, told his base headquarters that if he was unable to get to
the upper air jet stream, he could drift into Russia, which would
not be ideal.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old adventurer launched his balloon from a sports
stadium in St. Louis at 5:04 p.m. CST (2304 GMT) on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. balloonist Steve
Fossett's mission to pilot a balloon to circle the globe without
stop was in jeopardy today as his heaters were malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old adventurer was shivering in his cockpit and it
was very unlikely he would complete his trip, Alan Blount, mission
control director, told a news conference at mission control base
in St. Louis on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after Fossett's two vital heaters went
out and he appeared to be headed toward the north side of the
Black Sea over Russia.
</P>
<P>
Blount said there was "serious discussion" Sunday morning
between the mission control team and Fossett about executing a
landing, because "the wind track at that time showed that
eventually he would begin to loop back to the northwest toward
Murmansk and Moscow."
</P>
<P>
The team believes Fossett could continue traveling eastward,
rather than looping north, which would put over the very southern
tip of Russia. He may still attempt to break his 1997 record of
traveling 10,361 miles (17,434 kilometers) in a balloon.
</P>
<P>
"If you set a record, that's great, it's a milestone," Blount
said. "If you get all the way around the world, that's the pot of
gold."
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT), Fossett was 225 miles (360
kilometers) northeast of Istanbul, Turkey, riding the wind toward
the east at 26 mph (42 kilometers) at an altitude of 23,000 feet
(3,625 meters).
</P>
<P>
The team reported that a heater was malfunctioning in Fossett's
6-by-4 passenger capsule beneath the balloon and the temperature
had dropped. Meanwhile, one of the two propane burners that are
fired whenever the hot air balloon must be heated for extra lift,
was not working properly.
</P>
<P>
Fossett took off from St. Louis on Wednesday and hoped to
complete his flight in 15 days.

<HEADLINE> Manila Adheres to Strict Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank has
vowed to adhere to stringent monetary policy in 1998 as
uncertainty in the financial market due to a depreciating currency
continues to hound the country.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no short-term compromises on monetary
discipline," central bank governor Gabriel Singson said in his
year-end report and economic outlook for 1998 to President Fidel
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Singson admitted that the "early months of 1998 are likely to
continue to be difficult for the economy especially as the
regional financial crisis continues," local newspaper Manila
Bulletin reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
With this as premise, Singson said the monetary authorities'
actions would appropriately "focus" on price stability as well as
stringent monetary discipline.
</P>
<P>
Apart from prudent monetary policy, Singson believed that the
attainment of a sound overall macroeconomic situation for 1998
"requires a strong fiscal position to ensure reasonable economic
growth prospects with price and balance of payments stability."
</P>
<P>
He described the year just past as "very tough and challenging"
with the ability of the monetary authorities challenged by the
currency crisis and high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But despite the generally difficult regional conditions,
Singson reported that the Philippines has stood its ground and was
"able to avoid worse outcomes" such as those seen in Thailand,
Indonesia and Korea.

LONDON -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said here Sunday
negotiations between the European Union (EU) and central European
countries which have applied for the membership may be completed
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks would be more difficult than those which led
to Austria, Sweden and Finland joining the EU in 1995, Cook told
BBC television in an interview. It took three years for the three
countries to complete negotiation on the membership.
</P>
<P>
"Those were prosperous countries, small countries, all of them
net contributors (to the EU budget)," Cook said. (EU-Enlargement)

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Hopes Levy to Retrieve Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today hoped that Foreign Minister David Levy
would retrieve his resignation decision.
</P>
<P>
In response to Levy's resignation announcement made this
afternoon, Netanyahu said in a press conference here that he
regretted very much when he heard about Levy's intention to leave
the coalition government, adding that "I hope he will change his
mind."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that he had made great efforts to implement the
commitments he made to Levy and he will continue to consult with
the Treasury to meet Levy's demands.
</P>
<P>
He noted that despite a total of 15 billion shekels (about 430
million U.S. dollars) overdraw inherited from the previous Labor
government, the Likud government has managed to allocate
considerable resources to development towns and disadvantaged
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
Giving his reasons for resignation, Levy said the proposed
1998 state budget does not address the country's social and
economic problems, particularly the sufferings of the low income
families and these people really needed for support.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the government for ignoring the promises made to
him last Summer in formulating the the state budget and for
lacking the positive intention in moving the Middle East peace
process forward.
</P>
<P>
In his agreement reached last Summer with the government,
Netanyahu promised to allocate about 100 million U.S. dollars as
special budget for Levy's Gesher (bridge) Party to address the
problems of development towns and underprivileged neighborhoods
in the 1998 state budget.
</P>
<P>
Levy also said that another reason for his resignation is that
many cabinet members did not support his policy of resuming peace
talks with the Palestinians, particularly the implementation of
the Hebron Agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu said today that only the current coalition
government is capable of achieving the peace with security,
stressing that "we are striving for a permanent final settlement
with secure arrangements ...and we can live here in a secure state
for many many years."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also noted that he is confident that despite Levy's
resignation his coalition government will continue leading the
country. He said that "I believe this coalition will continue,
its work will continue, and its existence will continue to do
what it has to do until 2000."
</P>
<P>
Under the law, Levy's resignation would come into effect 48
hours after his resignation letter to the prime minister. So the
prime minister still has two days to persuade him to change his
mind. But it seems that Levy would be unlikely to go back as he
had made very harsh criticisms of the government.
</P>
<P>
With the resignation of Levy from the government, Netanyahu
only enjoys a marginal majority of 61 seats in the 120-member
parliament. Levy's Gesher Party has five seats in the
parliament in which Netanyahu has escaped narrowly several
no-confidence motions in the past several months.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition the Labor Party has already announced that
it would make another no-confidence motion in the parliament
against Netanyahu next week. If the Labor succeeds in winning the
motion, elections would be held within two months.

<HEADLINE> AL Concerned over Turkish-Israeli War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League today expressed
deep concern over the Turkish-Israeli-U.S. naval exercises in
eastern Mediterranean, describing them as a "threat to regional
security."
</P>
<P>
"The exercises threaten the stability and security of the
region and the efforts towards the building of a stable, just and
comprehensive Mideast peace," the Arab League said in a statement
released today.
</P>
<P>
The league views these war games as a way to pressure Syria and
Iraq and as part of a strategy to mould the political future of
the region, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"These exercises will undermine neither the Arab support of
Iraqi unity and sovereignty nor the Syrian steadfastness, but
(they) rather will strengthen this steadfastness," it added.
</P>
<P>
The league expressed hope that Turkey would reconsider its
military relationship with Israel, which, it said, fully
contradicts the Charter of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference and the traditional ties between Turkey and the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled Turkish-Israeli-U.S. joint exercises next week
have aroused harsh criticism from the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, however, repeatedly said that the exercises were not
targeting any third country.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Israel to Hold More Maneuvers in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Israel are planning to
hold more joint maneuvers in the Mediterranean in an effort to
enhance their coordination, the Anatolia News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the Turkish General Staff, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, were quoted as saying that Turkish and
Israeli military officials are to discuss the details of the
exercises in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
They said that the naval exercises involving Turkey, Israel and
the United States, which are scheduled to start on January 5, have
been code-named "Reliant Mermaid I."
</P>
<P>
The three-way exercises, which have been postponed several
times, prompted harsh criticism from Iran and the Arab countries,
which accuse Ankara of forming military alliance with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been trying to play down the significance of the
joint exercises, describing them as "a routine search-and-rescue
operation."
</P>
<P>
Two frigates, one helicopter along with 800 sailors from the
Turkish Navy are to participate in the upcoming maneuvers,
military sources said.
</P>
<P>
One destroyer and one helicopter from the United States and
two Israeli warships will be involved in the long-expected naval
war games.
</P>
<P>
Jordan announced Sunday that it would take part in the
Turkish-Israeli-U.S. maneuvers as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has also received an invitation to send observers,
refused to attend the disputed war games apparently due to fears
that its image in the Arab would be damaged if it was involved in
the maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The quickly growing Turco-Israeli military cooperation has
aroused uneasiness among the Arab countries, which termed Turkey's
move as a betrayal of the interests of the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, however, has repeatedly stated that the Turkish-Israeli
military cooperation is not directed against any third country,
saying that such a cooperation is aimed at promoting peace and
stability in the region.

<HEADLINE> Report: More Americans Go Hungry due to Food Stamp Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Four months after the last of
27 billion dollars in food-stamp cuts took effect in the United
States, evidence is mounting of a large increase in the number of
people who can't get enough to eat without help.
</P>
<P>
Charity leaders and experts on hunger believe the cuts are at
least partly to blame, according to an Associated Press report
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is booming by most standards we use to measure it,
and yet we're saying our demand is up," says Sister Christine
Vladimiroff, a Benedictine nun who runs Chicago-based Second
Harvest, the nation's largest charity to getting food to the poor.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Conference of Mayors released a survey last month that
reported average 1997 increases of 16 percent in requests for
emergency food -- the largest jump in the 29-city survey since
1992.
</P>
<P>
The study found that 19 percent of those seeking help were
turned away, and 46 percent of the cities reported that charities
and other private programs provided inadequate amounts of food to
those helped.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four percent of city officials cited cuts in the
food-stamp program as a chief cause of the problem.
</P>
<P>
But many said the blame cannot be placed solely on the changes
in the food-stamp program, which reduced the stamps' value,
limited to three months the eligibility of able-bodied, childless
adults and denied benefits to most legal immigrants. Other,
perhaps larger, factors include unemployment and low-paying jobs,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Second Harvest supplies through a network of food banks more
than a billion pounds of food a year to the hungry, elderly and
the downtrodden. In an informal survey, Second Harvest found it
took an average of 14 percent more food to feed the hungry this
November than last.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen states have moved to keep food-stamp benefits intact
for some legal immigrants by spending their own money.
</P>
<P>
Second Harvest and groups including the National Council of La
Raza, the Jewish Federation and Catholic Charities are lobbying to
get President Bill Clinton to push in his January 27 State of the
Union address for renewed access for legal immigrants. They want
him to include the same stipulation in his 1999 spending plan to
be unveiled February 2.
