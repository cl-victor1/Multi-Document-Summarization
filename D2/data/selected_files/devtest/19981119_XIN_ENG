<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Spearheading APEC Sci-Tech Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua)-- China has dedicated 10
million U.S. dollars to establish a fund to finance cooperation in
science and technology with other Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) countries.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the China APEC Science and Technology
Industry Cooperation fund was announced by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin here Wednesday morning and won widespread praise from other
APEC members here.
</P>
<P>
The fund, which will be provided by the Ministry of Science and
Technology (MST), the Ministry of Finance and the State Economic
and Trade Commission, will help implement the APEC Agenda for
Science and Technology Industry Cooperation into the 21st century,
</P>
<P>
Observers pointed out that as the biggest developing country in
the world, China was playing a more and more important role.
</P>
<P>
It was widely acknowledged that the measures China has adopted
in the financial crisis were important to stablize the regional
and international economies, and the establishment of the fund set
a good example for other member countries.
</P>
<P>
China has long advocated cooperation in the science and
technology industry, an important aspect of economic cooperation,
within the framework of APEC.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of science and technology and education is now
internationally recognized as vital to the development of national
economies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the promotion of science and technology cooperation
may bring pragmatic benefits for all parties concerned without
necessarily being affected by political factors.
</P>
<P>
In a proposal by China, cooperation in science and technology
was first put on the agenda of APEC in 1993, and a special working
group was established a year later.
</P>
<P>
Since then, economic and technological cooperation, one of the
two pillars of APEC, have been developing. The other pillar is
normally believed to be trade and investment liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Proposed by Jiang, the first meeting of APEC ministers of
science and technology was held in Beijing in October 1995. Jiang
opened the meeting, which was attended by more than 200 delegates.
</P>
<P>
So far, cooperation in science and technology industry has led
to the the implementation of 65 programs, five of which were put
forward by China and eight of which involved China.
</P>
<P>
At the fifth APEC Leaders Informal Meeting in Vancouver in
1997, Jiang proposed to formulate the Agenda of APEC Science and
Technology Industry Cooperation into the 21st century. His
proposal was widely accepted and later written into the leaders'
declaration.
</P>
<P>
Through concerted effort by relevant departments of China and
APEC organizations, the agenda was formulated and agreed upon at
the third meeting of the ministers of science and technology in
Mexico in October this year, and was eventually adopted by the
current leaders meeting.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, at talks with representatives from the APEC
Business Advisory Council, Jiang reiterated the stand of the
Chinese government on strengthening economic and technological
cooperation. He hoped that the Kuala Lumpur meeting could be an
important milestone in this field.
</P>
<P>
An MST official noted that the Chinese government had been
pushing the cooperation of science and technology industry among
APEC members for a long time, and the establishment of the fund
was simply another good example of China's sincerity.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that other member countries could also make due
contributions to promote this cause.

<HEADLINE> NBA, Union to Resume Talk on Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The full bargaining
committees of the NBA and the National Basketball Players
Association will sit down at the bargaining table Friday for the
first time in 23 days, the two sides agreed yesterday after a
two-hour meeting among three representatives of each side.
</P>
<P>
"It was agreed we have nothing to lose by meeting, and we
mutually decided to meet Friday," NBA Commissioner David Stern
said in a telephone interview. "We're not near anything. But you
can't get anyplace unless you meet. We owe it to a lot of people
to try to have another meeting."
</P>
<P>
On the 140th day of a lockout of the league's more than 400
players, Stern also said that the signing period for the league's
200 free agents, followed by abbreviated training camps, will not
begin until a complete collective bargaining agreement is signed.
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with Stern's thinking said such a scenario
indicates that the season would not begin until January, even if
a deal were reached by Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
It likely would take 10 to 14 days for a labor contract to be
ready for signatures if no hitches developed. Union sources were
not available to comment immediately on yesterday's developments,
which followed the first conversation between Stern and NBA
players union executive director Billy Hunter in 11 days.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Jeffrey Kessler, the union's outside counsel,
called Jeffrey Kessler, the union's outside counsel, called
Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's chief legal officer, and they
mutually agreed it "would be futile" to resume talks, Krssler
said.
</P>
<P>
Team owners, union officials and players have said recently
they are willing to sit out the season rather than give in to the
other side's demands and accept "an unfair deal."
</P>
<P>
There are a number of unresolved economic issues, including
how much of league revenue the players will share. The players
received 57.1 percent of the revenue last season, and the league
wants to reduce it to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The union is seeking 60 percent and wants owners to assume s
ome risk if the agreed-upon amount is exceeded.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- France Wednesday called on
Israel and Palestinians to carry out a "loyal and rapid"
implementation of the Wye agreement in the wake of its approval by
the Israeli parliament.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy with this approval obtained with a great majority
which proves that the pursuit of peace and, singularly, the
application of the agreement of Wye River, enjoy strong support in
Israel," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She said the road had been paved for Israel and the
Palestinians to carry out the measures planned in the agreement.

Arafat would visit France on November 25 at the invitation of
President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.

aftermath of the signing of the Wye River agreement, the French
government reaffirms its encouragement for the pursuit of the road
to a negotiated peace," she said.

<HEADLINE> EU Clears Strategy on Forestry Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Wednesday that it has adopted a strategy for its member states to
promote sustainable development of forests.
</P>
<P>
The forestry strategy will contribute to the implementation of
international commitments on the management, conservation and
sustainable development of forests, said the European Commission,
the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
The strategy, based on the multifunctional nature of the
forests, puts particular emphasis on the major challenges facing
European forestry, such as its contribution to overall economic
and social development, and the protection of the environment,
notably in relation to biodiversity and climate change, said the
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, EU commissioner Franz Fischler stressed the
importance of forestry, not only to the EU's economy as a whole
but, in particular to its rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Forest-based industries produce goods worth over 300 billion
ECU (about 280 billion U.S. dollars) each year and provide jobs
for over two million people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the employees live in rural areas and a substantial
percentage of those employed in forestry are also part-time
farmers, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Commission would continue to help coordinate and complement
policies and measures between EU member states, Fischler added.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Makes Slow Progress: World Bank Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank economist said
here Wednesday that the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) has made a slow progress in the past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
"It's clearly a slow progress. It hasn't developed into as a
dynamic regional grouping as some of the others," John Williamson,
the World Bank's chief economist for South Asia, told Xinhua in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
The economist ended his three-day visit in Kathmandu Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that not just in Europe, the Mercado Comun del Sur
(MERCOSUR) in South America and the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) have achieved a lot more, and "in some cases,
much quicker" than South Asia has accomplished so far.
</P>
<P>
"There are some particular reasons for that," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that some of the SAARC countries have important
bilateral disagreements, making it more challenging to build up
regional organization.
</P>
<P>
"The main prerequisite in my mind would be a willingness on the
part of India and Pakistan to resolve their bilateral
disagreements," he observed.
</P>
<P>
"Until that is resolved, it is very difficult to see how a
regional organization that embraces both (of them) can really go
forward," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hopes for the resolution of disputes though it
looks hopeless at times.
</P>
<P>
"We just have to hope that statesmen in India and Pakistan will
finally see how important it is to achieve that sort of
reconciliation" in North Ireland and South Africa, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC was formed in December 1985 to promote the economic
and social development among its seven member countries --
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Williamson said that he did not agree that the SAARC has laid a
solid foundation for further development.
</P>
<P>
"I hope it can go much faster in the future, but I think if
that happens, it will be because what's done from now on, not
because solid foundation has been laid up to now," he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Starts Trip to Japan, South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
left here on Wednesday to start his visit to Japan and South Korea
with economic and security issues high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is more important to restore growth in Asia than
efforts to restart Japan's economy," Clinton told reporters
gathered on the South Lawn of the White House.
</P>
<P>
He said he is looking forward to discussions with Japan's
leaders on how to promptly and effectively stimulate demand and
economic growth and open Japan's markets to fair trade.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States has met its own obligations to
halt the global economic crisis, assisting the International
Monetary Fund, helping organize an assistance package for Brazil
to prevent the crisis from spreading and pressing the World Bank
to double its investment to help "people who have suffered the
most."
</P>
<P>
"Now we're taking our efforts directly to Asia, where the
crisis began," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that while in South Korea he will hold
high-level discussions on "the difficult but necessary task of
reforming their financial institutions, their corporate sector and
getting growth on track there."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Korea's corporate conglomerates must also "do
their share" to foster economic reform.
</P>
<P>
His journey will take him from ornate palaces in Tokyo to
military training fields in South Korea. The final stop will be
the Pacific island of Guam, where he will spend several hours
before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
The trip was delayed and then rearranged after the weekend
showdown with Iraq. Clinton also canceled his participation of
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Malaysia.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif will underscore the country's commitment to contain
spread of nuclear weapons during his visit to Washington early
next month.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a group of American editors here Wednesday, Foreign
Secretary Shamshad Ahmed said that the prime minister will also
express his commitment to the promotion of peace and security in
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to forge partnership for peace and development with
the United States, based on shared values and interests," Shamshad
was quoted by the Associated Press of Pakistan as saying.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason we are opposed to the sanctions approach which
only embitters bilateral relations. The sanctions also do not
work," said the foreign secretary.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan is prepared to work with the United States in
renewing its relations.
</P>
<P>
It is Pak-U.S. common interest to forge a strong relationship

consolidate peace, economic development and democratic values as
well as to combat the evils of terrorism, extremism and narcotics,
he said.

Shamshad also said that Pakistan noted with satisfaction the
U.S. decision to partially lift sanctions.

<P>
ATHENS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday reacted
sharply to Turkey's threat, saying that the Turkish claims were
rejected as "unfounded and groundless."
</P>
<P>
Turkey Tuesday accused Athens of supporting the Kurdistan
Workers Party (PKK) and its leader, Abdullah Ocalan, and
threatened that Athens was "playing with fire."
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Wednesday, Greek Foreign Ministry said
that Greece had condemned terrorism from wherever it might
originate and had categorically stated to the Turkish side at the
highest level that it had not provided any support whatsoever to
the PKK.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek government with regret notes that Ankara, rather
than attempting rapprochement, has chosen the path which takes it
further from the civilized democratic countries of Europe," the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, 109 Greek parliamentarians signed an
invitation for Ocalan to visit Greece, but the Greek government
has made it clear that it has not invited the PKK leader to visit
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Satisfied with APEC Leaders Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The sixth leaders meeting
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum ended today
with members broadly optimistic at overcoming the region's
economic and financial turmoil, said Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tang said at a press conference after the meeting that, along
with the financial troubles, the leaders had discussed trade and
investment liberalization, economic and technical cooperation and
other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
They had also reached a broad consensus which was reflected in
the declaration at the end of the meeting, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Overcoming the financial crisis and strengthening cooperation
in revitalizing the economies of East Asia were among the main
priorities of the meeting, said Tang.
</P>
<P>
He said the leaders not only saw the daunting challenges
brought about by the economic globalization and the financial
crisis, but also realized the potential and vitality in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The leaders believed that with a single effort by all the
member economies and with support from international community,
the Asia-Pacific region would overcome the crisis and resume
growth, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The measures China had taken amid the Asian financial crisis
were applauded by all as highly responsible, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also discussed the reform of international
financial systems and how to strengthen supervision and control of
short-term capital flows.
</P>
<P>
They committed themselves to strengthening and supporting APEC
to enable it to play its role in improving world financial
systems, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders endorsed at the meeting the arrangement of nine
economic sectors for voluntary liberalization and decided that
from the next year on, each member could implement its own
commitments on the basis of voluntarism.
</P>
<P>
This arrangement manifested APEC's principles of voluntarism,
consensus and flexibility, said Tang.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening economic and technical cooperation had been
agreed by APEC members, he said, and the meeting endorsed the
Agenda of APEC Science and Technology Industry Cooperation into
the 21st Century proposed by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and the
Kuala Lumpur Action Program on Skills Development.
</P>
<P>
Tang said implementing the two documents would enhance the
economic development capacity of APEC economies, narrow the
development gaps and make progress toward common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang announced at the meeting the establishment of
China APEC Science and Technology Industry Cooperation Fund and
China APEC Enterprises Assembly.
</P>
<P>
These and other practical measures by China to promote APEC
economic and technical cooperation were welcomed by other members,
Tang said.

</P>
<P>
According to an OAU press release issued Wednesday, the

<HEADLINE> World Bank Report on Economic Situation in South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Despite the financial
turmoil in neighboring East Asia, most of the South Asian
countries continued to record satisfactory gross domestic product
(GDP) and export growth in 1997, said the World Bank Annual Report
1998 available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investment in the region continued to grow, with net
long-term resource flows reaching the highest level on record,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
At 5.2 percent in 1997, South Asia's GDP growth was down almost
one percent from 1996, mainly due to sluggish demand and
stagnation in India's industrial sector and low cotton output in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The report said that estimated growth rates in fiscal 1998 are
5.5 percent in Bangladesh, 5.1 percent in India, 5.4 percent in
Pakistan and 5.8 percent in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the fiscal deficit in India rose to an estimated
6.1 percent of GDP from fiscal 1997's deficit of 4.9 percent
despite continued efforts by the government to reduce spending.
</P>
<P>
Estimates indicate that Bangladesh's fiscal deficit remained
unchanged from fiscal 1997 at 5.3 percent of GDP, Pakistan's fell
to 5.4 percent from 6.3 percent while Sri Lanka's to 6.5 percent
from 7.6 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Largely due to increased disbursements from official creditors,
the region's long-term external debt rose by three percent,
reaching 142 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, the report noted,
adding that official debt continued to account for the bulk of the
region's long-term liabilities.
</P>
<P>
A nine percent rise in export revenues led to an improvement in
the debt-to-export ratio, which fell from 194 percent in 1996 to
183 percent in 1997, but it still exceeds the average for all
developing countries (136 percent in 1997), the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, short-term external debt remained low, a factor that
may have helped prevent slipover from the East Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Financial sector regulations, which prohibited banks from
fueling large credit booms, and small current account deficits
also helped the region avoid financial crisis," the report
observed.
</P>
<P>
However, "uncertainty about the economic prospects of the
region increased, following the detonation of nuclear devices by
India and Pakistan in May 1998 and the resulting imposition of
economic sanctions by several industrial countries," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that growth in private capital flows leveled
off in 1997 after jumping from an average of 5 billion dollars
between 1990-95 to 9 billion dollars in 1996 with India continuing
to attract the bulk.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Accuses S. Africa of Being Partial to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Laurent Kabila, president of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), said here Wednesday that
the ambiguous declarations issued by the South African government
on the DRC issue is actually indication of its partiality to the
Ugandan and Rwandan invaders.
</P>
<P>
Kabila made the remarks after concluding a three-hour brief
visit to Angola.
</P>
<P>
The DRC needs support from South Africa, he said. However,
South Africa has been making appeals for the withdrawal of all
foreign troops without distinguishing between invaders and
defenders of national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
According to Kabila, the military situation in his country is
now stable, with the enemy forces besieged by government army and
its allies.
</P>
<P>
He said his government is still willing to negotiate with
Rwanda and Uganda, if they wish so, on the withdrawal of their
forces from the DRC, and hear the explanations about their
military presence in his country.
</P>
<P>
During his short visit, Kabila met with Angolan President
Eduardo dos Santos and exchanged views on situation in the DRC
and Angola peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-led rebels started an uprising in east Congo in
early August against Kabila's then 15-month-old government.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the fighting broke out, Kabila has been accusing
Rwanda and Uganda of backing the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, on the other hand, had sent
troops and offered other logistical support to help Kabila quell
the rebellion, which now centered in the east part of the vast
African country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
narrowed to 14 billion U.S. dollars in September from a record
high in August, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted September gap between exports of goods
and services and imports was 11.7 percent lower than a revised
record deficit of 15.9 billion dollars in August, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
In September, U.S. exports of goods and services rose 3.3
percent to 77.1 billion dollars, but for the first nine months of
the year, they're off 0.5 percent. Imports fell 0.2 percent to
91.2 billion dollars in the month, but are up 4.8 percent for the
first nine months.
</P>
<P>
In goods alone, the U.S. trade deficit with Pacific Rim
countries soared 36 percent to 119 billion dollars from January
through September, as against the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In September, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan had a slight
dip to 5.07 billion dollars from 5.2 billion dollars the month
before.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Canada, America's largest trading partner,
jumped 40 percent to 2.3 billion dollars in September, highest
since December 1996.
</P>
<P>
The increase in U.S. exports overall was the second in a row
and came after four consecutive declines. Exports of civilian
aircraft doubled to a record 4 billion dollars. Automotive exports
rose to 6 billion dollars from 5.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But, exports of agricultural products fell 8.6 percent to 3.3
billion dollars, the lowest since July 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, imports of advanced technology products, including
computers, rose to a record 14 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But oil imports fell 10 percent to 3.6 billion dollars, which
was attributed to a decrease in volume to 8.23 million barrels a
day from 9.32 million but an increase in price to $10.98 per
barrel, compared to a 12-year low of 10.63 dollars in August.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the U.S. deficit in goods and services is
running at an annual rate of 166 billion dollars, 50 percent
higher than last year's 110 billion dollars imbalance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. increases in its foreign trade deficit are largely
blamed for financial crisis which leveled a number of Asian
economies and Russia.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Republicans in the U.S.
House of Representatives on Wednesday unanimously selected
Representative Bob Livingston from Louisiana to be next speaker.
</P>
<P>
Livingston is replacing Newt Gingrich who resigned after the
November 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
Livingston, 55, was chosen in a closed party meeting.
</P>
<P>
Livingston will officially be elected by the full House for a
two-year term when the chamber reconvenes January 6. Although
Democrats traditionally nominate their own top leader Richard
Gephardt for the post, with a 223 to 211 Republican majority,
Livingston's victory is assured.
</P>
<P>
"There are some who insist the Republican era is over. But
that's like saying the American dream is over. It isn't true --
and they know it," Livingston said in his speech to the Republican
conference.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich handed the gavel to Livingston and praised his ability
to unite the party.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Livingston said he saw the job as one to run the House
smoothly and pointed to his experience as head of the powerful
Appropriations Committee, the panel that controls annual
government spending.

<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said here
Wednesday that the number of mad cow disease cases in the EU
member states has further declined.
</P>
<P>
From January to October 1998, the European Commission said, the
number came down to 1567 reported cases. Last year, 4454 new cases
had been reported, compared to 37301 new cases at the peak of the
disease in 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, 66 new cases this year are in Portugal, compared to 30
cases last year, give strong reasons for concern, the commission
said.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the statements of the commission's second
follow-up report to the European Parliament on the implementation
of its work program on the disease.
</P>
<P>
Adopting the work program on the disease, the commission also

KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin called here today upon the developed members of APEC (Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation) to help the developing members
promote electronic commerce by providing them with the necessary
technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Sixth APEC Leaders Informal Meeting held at
Cyberjaya, about 45 kilometers south of Kuala Lumpur, Jiang said
that electronic commerce represents the future of doing business
and its application would give the APEC members more trade
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the present stage of electronic commerce, there
was a considerable gap between the developed and developing
members.
</P>
<P>
"Only through extensive and in-depth technical exchanges and
cooperation can electronic commerce develop in a coordinated
manner among APEC members," the Chinese President said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in developing electronic commerce, "we
should not only pay attention to the promotional role of the
private, industrial and commercial sectors, but also improve
macro-planning and guidance by government departments".

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Bank Forecasts 2.5 Percent GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- One of Zimbabwe's leading
commercial banks, Standard Chartered, has forecast a 2.5
percent real GDP growth for 1999, with a considerable downside
risk.
</P>
<P>
In its November issue of Business Trends magazine released
Wednesday in Harare, the bank said the country's inflation needed
to slow during the year, averaging about 27.5 percent and falling
below 20 percent by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"GDP growth will depend hugely on global economic development,
commodity prices, regional conditions and climatic factors," the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Given the enormous uncertainties surrounding all these
factors, predictions are hazardous. We are forecasting 2.5
percent real GDP growth though with considerable downside risk,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's year on year inflation stands at 31.7 percent and
is expected to hit 32 percent by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three years to 2002, economic conditions were
likely to be substantially influenced by the changed
socio-political climate, especially the demand for "catch-up" in
respect of wages and living standards particularly by low income
groups.
</P>
<P>
The pressures to which the government was being forced to
respond would be exacerbated by political uncertainties in the
form of parliamentary elections (2000) and presidential elections
in 2002, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> German"five wise men" Criticize New Bonn Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's new Social
Democrat-Greens coalition government came in for its first major
economic policy criticism Wednesday when the panel dubbed the
"five wise men" issued their forecast for the country's economy in
1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the report issued by the "five wise men" on
Wednesday here, it will be a slowdown in German gross domestic
product growth next year to just 2.0 percent, from this year's
2.75 percent rate. Unemployment was expected to drop to 4.1
million persons, at a rate of 10.8 percent. This year's
joblessness average rate is 11.2 per cent.
</P>
<P>
While giving those prognosis, the panel by inference singled
out finance minister Oskar Lafontaine for criticism over his
political demands made in the debate over interest rates, taxes
and currency policies.
</P>
<P>
"In Germany, the debate over the economic policy of the new
government is dampening the mood," the five economic professors
wrote in the report, saying also they did not regard a rate cut by
the European Central Bank next year as being necessary.
</P>
<P>
The report rejects the demand put forth by the finance minister
Lafontaine soon after the new Bonn coalition took office, saying
this demand that monetary policy should be more strongly linked to
supporting the economy and improving the job situation was "not
convincing".
</P>
<P>
"There is no proof that companies and private households do not
invest or consume more due to the current interest rates," the
panel report said.
</P>
<P>
The panel of professors called for a more far-reaching tax
reform, while rejecting another idea by Lafontaine to try to
restrict taxation competition in Europe through a harmonization of
tax rates.
</P>
<P>
The report is the first that the new "Red-Green" Bonn
coalition, now in power about a month, has received from the panel
of five professors who are popularly dubbed the "five wise men".

<HEADLINE> Angolan Minister Denies Possible Govt Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Deputy Minister of
Territorial Administration Higino Carneiro denied once again on
Wednesday the press reports that government troops are poised to
launch large-scale attacks on UNITA controlled Andulo and
Bailundo cities in central Angola.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, however, he noted that "nothing happens there will
be surprising, because (government) armed forces are determined
to fight against any criminals sabotaging national order."
</P>
<P>
The Angola News Agency reported Wednesday that the opposition
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
forces have recently occupied some areas in central Angola,
bringing about much tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Joao de Matos, chief of the general staff of Angolan armed
forces, went to Hambo Province, central Angola, Tuesday afternoon
to inspect the military situation in the area.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Carneiro, who attended a meeting of the joint
committee of Angola peace process called by U.N. special envoy to
Angola Issa Diallo, said the government has been fed up by such
"fruitless" meeting and is determined to "comply with and
implement" the Lusaka Protocol in its own way.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the committee meeting, Diallo confirmed that
UNITA has obstructed the withdrawal of U.N. observer mission from
Andulo and Bailundo by denying U.N. planes landing since last
Friday in the excuse of "repairing" the airport runway.
</P>
<P>
But he did not make any more comments in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here believed that UNITA plans to detain
U.N. personnel and take them "hostage" against possible
government attack.

<P>
HARARE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) Wednesday held another mass job stay-away,
demanding the government offer workers a 20 percent wage hike.
</P>
<P>
The stay-away marked the second attempt within a period of
seven days by the labor movement to force the government to
immediately resolve "break" issue.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU is also demanding the government reverse its decision
to implement a hefty fuel price increase which sent prices of
basic commodities sky rocketing.
</P>
<P>
Business was brought to a halt in Harare Wednesday, the
country's capital, as workers heeded the ZCTU call for a national
strike.
</P>
<P>
Industry and commerce in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest
city, was at a standstill. The atmosphere in the city's
industrial areas and the city center, resembled a holiday with
very few shops open and very few people loitering on rain-socked
streets, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In Mutare, the country's main eastern city, thousands of
workers heeded the second call by the ZCTU to stay away from
work.
</P>
<P>
Unlike last Wednesday when the armed forces were caught
napping by violent youths who stoned and looted from a service
station and a shop, this time armed officers were deployed
Tuesday night to avert any possible looting.
</P>
<P>
Most of workers in other cities and towns also held strike.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC)
Wednesday called for another tripartite meeting to discuss how
the macro-economic stability of the country can be restored.
</P>
<P>
ZNCC President Nhlanhla Masuku said in a statement that the
government, labor and business should make efforts to resolve
fundamental problems in economy through the talks.

<HEADLINE> NATO Readies Extraction Forces for OSCE Verifiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONS, Belgium, November 18 (Xinhua) -- NATO's extraction
forces, with a task to extract international verifiers from Kosovo
in extreme circumstances, are expected to be operational in the
first week of December, a NATO official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told a media
briefing that the extraction forces can, within 30 to 60 minutes
weather permits, react to pull out Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) verifiers or to rescue the verifiers
taken hostage in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance is preparing the multinational
extraction forces at the request of OSCE and the special forces,
to be based in nearby Macedonia, will have 1,500 to 2,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the extraction forces will be 12 months to
coincide with the mission of the OSCE verification.
</P>
<P>
France will lead the extraction forces with the participation
of Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Greece. The core
of the extraction forces will be French paratroopers, according to
NATO sources.
</P>
<P>
The extraction forces will be armed with armored vehicles and
armored attack helicopters for mobility and safety, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Though the official said that the extraction forces will be
deployed only under extreme circumstances, NATO decision makers
are still studying the legal basis for foreign troops entering the
sovereign territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
rules of engagement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He added that the core element of the extraction forces will be
in place within 36 to 72 hours after receiving the activation
orders from the North Atlantic Council, the decision-making body
of the 16-nation alliance.
</P>
<P>
The council approved the concept of extraction forces last
Friday but the activation orders are yet to reach the joint
operation center based outside the Belgian town of Mons later this
week.
</P>
<P>
In the deals reached between NATO and Yugoslavia and between
OSCE and Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav forces are to ensure the safety
of the 2,000-member OSCE verification team.
</P>
<P>
The verifiers will first resort to the Yugoslav authorities if
there should arise uncertain or hostile circumstances.
</P>
<P>
When the Yugoslav forces fail to react, the extraction forces
will be called in to react, said the official.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Palestinians to Step up Coordination on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and the Palestinians
will step up coordination over various peace issues in preparation
for the final status negotiations between the Palestinians and
Israel, Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, the Regent, made the remarks during his meeting with
Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council Ahmed Qureia
who arrived here Tuesday for a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said that a framework should be established first for
closer Jordanian-Palestinian coordination ahead of the
Palestinian-Israeli final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework, both sides are expected to reach common
visions on issues such as the status of Jerusalem, water
resources, refugees, security and borders, he said.
</P>
<P>
While pursuing such coordination, Jordan will stick to its
unwavering support for the Palestinians in their requests to
regain their legitimate rights and establish an independent
state on their own soil, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hassan noted that Jordan will also try its best to help ensure
the implementation of the latest Palestinian-Israeli peace
agreement signed last month in Washington, under which Israel
will withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinians' tougher measures to crack down on anti-Israeli
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Qureia echoed Hassan's view, saying that the Palestinian-
Israeli final status negotiations require intensive coordination
between Jordan and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with Hassan, Qureia had held talks with
Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdul Ilah Al-Khatib, Minister of
State for Development Affairs Tahir Kan'an and Senate Speaker
Zaid Rifai on bilateral cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli officials resumed long-suspended talks
about a final peace treaty Wednesday. Israeli Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon and Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen)
met at the Israeli Foreign Ministry to discuss an agenda for
full-scale final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The final status talks will deal with the issue of borders and
Palestinian demands for statehood in addition to the status of
Jerusalem, refugees, water and Jewish settlements.

<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
here Wednesday that it has adopted a report on findings on the
operation of four main EU legal instruments concerning dangerous
substances.
</P>
<P>
The legal instruments govern the classification, packaging and
labelling of dangerous substances and preparations, the evaluation
and control of the risks of existing substances and the
restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous
substances and preparations.
</P>
<P>
The instruments' specific objectives are protection of both
human health and environment in the context of the EU internal
market. The assessment identifies a number of issues that need to
be addressed with a view to improving their operation.
</P>
<P>
In general, the findings highlight the need to use the
instruments more efficiently and to implement as well as enforce
them more rigorously and consistently, the EU Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The commission prepared the report in the light of public
concern about chemicals in circulation in the EU internal market
and the discussion of the Environment Ministers at the Informal
Council of April 1998 in Chester, Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The parliamentary Committee on
Foreign Affairs of Zambia Wednesday urged the Southern Africa
Customs Unions (SACU) to accept the principle of free and fair
trade.
</P>
<P>
Committee chairman Vernon Mwaanga said here that it is greatly
concerned over the delay in finalizing an agreement between
Zambia and SACU, which groups Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia,
Botswana and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
When Mwaanga presented the Committee's report on foreign
affairs to be adopted by the house, he said the committee wants
SACU to finalize the agreement with Zambia without any further
delay so that SACU market can be opened to Zambian goods.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has reached the trade agreement with SACU but SACU
member countries have yet to sign and ratify the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mwaanga also said that Zambia needs to market itself globally
to attract more investment if it has to survive in the face of
declining donor aid.
</P>
<P>
Zambia should start looking to regions like Asia and the
Middle East for a new scope of the country's economic growth, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Seconding the motion to adopt the report, independent
parliament member Alexis Luhila called for more funding to
Zambian missions abroad.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the missions cannot promote foreign policy
if they are not adequately funded.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the government to open a mission in Latin
America to attract investment.

JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
officials resumed in Jerusalem Wednesday the final status
talks on contentious issues such as the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and
Palestinian official Mahmoud Abbas, came one day after Israel's
parliament ratified the Wye peace accord by a landslide majority.
</P>
<P>
Other sensitive issues to be resolved in the final talks
include Jewish settlements, the Palestinian refugees, and the
final borders between Israel and a possible Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Abbas said to the press the actual negotiations will probably
begin in a week or ten days.
</P>
<P>
"About the permanent agreement, I hope we can reach one as
early as possible," Sharon said.
</P>
<P>
"We will look ahead to see how to be able to find a way for a
lasting peace in the Middle East," he added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Legal Framework on Electronic Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
here on Wednesday that EU Commission has put forward a proposal
for a directive to set up a coherent legal framework for the
development of electronic commerce within the Union's single
market.
</P>
<P>
The proposed directive would ensure that information society
services benefit from the single market principles of free
movement of services and freedom of establishment and could
provide their services throughou the 15 EU states if they comply
with the law in their country of origin.
</P>
<P>
The commission said such services are defined as those provided
normally against remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means
and in response to the individual request of a consumer.
</P>
<P>
The proposed directive would establish specific harmonized
rules only in those areas strictly necessary to ensure that
businesses and citizens could supply and receive information
society services throughout the EU, irrespective of frontiers.
</P>
<P>
These areas, the commission said, include definition of where
operators are established, electronic contracts, liability of
intermediaries, dispute settlement and role of national
authorities.
</P>
<P>
In other areas, the directive would build on existing EU
instruments which provide for harmonization or on mutual
recognition of national laws. And the directive would apply only
to service providers established within the EU and not those
established outside, the EU proposal said.

<HEADLINE> Djibouti Cuts Official Ties With Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Djibouti severed diplomatic
ties with Eritrea Wednesday after Asmara accused it of backing
Ethiopia's war effort, a report quoted Djibouti's foreign
ministry as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti said its mission in Asmara, the eritrean capital was
closed and Ambassador Ahmed Issa Gabode had been recalled back
along with his staff.
</P>
<P>
The statement demanded Eritrea recall its ambassador to
Djibouti, and said it would serve him with notice of the
diplomatic severance Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti demands Eritrea's foreign ministry "close down its
embassy in Djibouti and recall its diplomatic personnel," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The government "informs the authorities in Asmara that the
embassy of Yemen in Asmara shall serve the interests of the
republic of Djibouti and those of its nationals," it said.
</P>
<P>
Disputes occurred when Djibouti was accused of backing
Ethiopia's armed conflict with Eritrea. several hundreds died in
May and June in the conflict, which has since cooled down
although both sides continue to reinforce positions in the border
area.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Eritrea accused Djibouti of letting
Ethiopia use its port as a conduit for military equipment to use
in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso last week, Eritrea
questioned whether Djibouti is qualified to be one of the three
mediators assigned by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to
mediate on the Ethio-Eritrean border conflict.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti's decision to cut diplomatic ties stems from "serious
and baseless accusations leveled by the Eritrean president
against our country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Most of Ethiopia's imports and exports have been come through
the port of Djibouti since the conflict began in May with
Eritrea. In the past, Addis Ababa used the Eritrean ports of
Assab and Massawa.

Hundreds of Egypt's public enterprises have been privatized in
the reforms and now the private sectors generate more than 60
percent of the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will also focus on fostering financial market
development, introducing competition in financial services,
achieving integration of the economy with trading partners and
improving the provision of data and information to the markets.

MAPUTO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique will, at all costs,
privatize the Ports and Railways Company of Mozambique, but be
very careful regarding the treatment of the company's workers, a
senior official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Muxanga, Minister of Transportation and Communications

Muxanga said a cooperation partner has offered 30 million U.S.

The government hoped that all the workers who may be affected
in the restructuring can get another job, if not in the ports and
railways company, Muxanga said.
</P>
<P>
Privatization is the only way to modernize the company, which
brought in about 110 million U.S. Dollars for the government in
1997, and it is expected to triple the revenues after
privatization, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
About 90 million Dollars are needed for the restructuring and

<P>
London's FTSE was up 4 percent at 5524.5, or 21.8 points early
in the morning. The US Fed's third interest rate cut in two months
had sparked an early rush of buying, which helped the Footsie
build a 50-point lead in the first ten minutes of the morning.
</P>
<P>
But that was as good as is got, with investors left to dwell on
the deteriorating economic situation in the UK. And the FTSE 100
ended the day 29 points lower at 5,474, at its low for the day.
</P>
<P>
German share prices were mixed but mainly lower in late trade
as dealers watched an indifferent start to US trade.

The leading Dax index closed down 4 points at 4,698. The later
trading Xetra Dax index was down 17 points at 4,701 near its
close.

French stocks shed early gains, the CAC 40 opened up 1.51
percent at 3,6559, but finished up 11 points at 3,612.

"Basically, we've acknowledged the US rate cut by opening
higher, and now we're sliding back," said Jean Faivre, trader at

<HEADLINE> Moscow Expects Ukraine to Destroy Strategic Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Moscow hopes that Ukraine will
get rid of its strategic bombers before the deadline set by
START-1, the Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing Rakhmanin noted that Ukraine, which
undertook in 1992 to liquidate strategic offensive weapons on its
soil, must destroy the bombers within the period stipulated by the
Start-1 treaty.
</P>
<P>
The deadline of START-1 is fixed on December 4, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The destruction of the first of the 44 Ukrainian strategic
bombers started in Priluki, Chernigov region, Monday, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The United States will finance the destruction of 19 Tu-160 and
25 Tu-95 aircraft before December 4, 2001, the Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, at a meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister
Boris Tarasyuk, who is in Moscow on a working visit, Chairman of
the State Duma Gennady Seleznyov said a new version of the draft
law on the ratification of START-2 prepared by the State Duma
contains a number of conditions "ensuring a proper level of state
security of the Russian Federation."
</P>
<P>
Among such conditions Seleznyov named "ensuring sufficient
funding for maintaining the combat capability of the rockets which
are in service, and an appeal for an immediate conclusion of a
START-3 treaty.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Congo (K) to Be Held in Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations, the
Organization of African Unity and the Southern African
Development Community will hold talks in Gaborone, Botswana
Friday trying to secure a cease-fire in Democratic Congo.
</P>
<P>
The rebels fighting to overthrow the government of President
Laurent Kabila will be allowed to attend the meeting, South
African television, SABC, reported Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Previously the rebels have only been consulted on the
sidelines at such talks as Kabila's government refused to have
direct talks with them.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being seen as a prelude to a peace summit to be
held in South Africa early next month, SABC said.
</P>
<P>
A SADC peace summit held in Pretoria in late August called for
an immediate troop standstill and cease-fire in Congo (K), but a
cease-fire has never been achieved.
</P>
<P>
At present, Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent
troops to fight on Kabila's side to help suppress the rebels who
are being backed by Ugandan and Rwandan soldiers.
</P>
<P>
As more countries were directly involved in the war, which
started on August 2, situation in the central African country has
become all the more complicated.

<HEADLINE> Blair Attacks Conservatives for Blocking European Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair attacked on Wednesday the opposition Conservative Party,
accusing it of using the dominance in the unelected House of Lords
to kill an important piece of European legislation.
</P>
<P>
"The row between the government and the Lords over plans to
change European ballots is no longer about voting rights but Tory
hereditary peers defying elected MPs," Blair said in a speech in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The upper chamber of Britain's parliament on Tuesday night
passed for a fourth time a wrecking amendment to a government bill
to change the way Britain's 87 members of the European Parliament
are elected.
</P>
<P>
The measure is set to go back to the Commons, then the Lords,
on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the battle had now come down to Tory hereditary
peers versus an elected House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
"It is not just the fact that hereditary peers can decide
policy in the House of Lords," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The inbuilt Tory majority which is three-to-one in the House
of Lords, that means whatever the election result they can use the
House of Lords to over turn the will of the House of Commons. That
is not democracy."
</P>
<P>
Blair's official spokesman said the government is now prepared
to abandon the legislation if the Lords refuse to back down.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, South Korea Discuss Ways of Boosting Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and South Korea Wednesday
discussed bilateral trade and economic relations and means of
promoting trade exchange.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Egyptian Trade and Supply Minister Ahmed
Gowaili and visiting South Korean Minister of Commerce, Industry
and Energy Pak Tae-Yong also touched on investment opportunities
in Egypt, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers reviewed Egypt's economic reforms, a new
investment law and efforts to clear trade obstacles, offering
favorable access to foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's economic reforms featuring privatization of the
state-run enterprises has succeeded in attracting foreign
investments. Media Reports have said the volume of direct foreign
investment in Egypt stood at 2 billion U.S. dollars in the first
10 months this year.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili expressed hope that the visit of Pak Tae-Yong would
mark an effective and strong start in the bilateral trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Egypt and South Korea amounted to 655
million dollars in 1997. South Korea has invested 160 million
dollars in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean official arrived here in the day for a
three-day visit. In an earlier meeting, he delivered a message to
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak from his South Korean counterpart
Kim Dae-Jung, which included an invitation to Mubarak to visit
South Korea next year.

LAGOS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Commerce
William Daley is to visit Nigeria early next month with a goal of
increasing trade and investment in the country, according to the
U.S. Information Service (USIS) in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the USIS Wednesday said that Daley,
expected to arrive in Nigeria on December 6, would hold bilateral
talks with officials of the Nigerian government and exchange
views with members of the Nigerian and American business
communities.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the visit would focus on
tele-communications, information technology, computers and
software, agro-business, power generation and environmental
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Daley, to be accompanied by a business team representing 18
U.S. companies, was quoted as saying that the U.S. private sector
had a strong interest in the African market.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has maintained its position as the biggest trading
partner of the U.S. in Africa with American imports from Nigeria
amounting to six billion U.S. Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Nigeria, the U.S. and its European allies
hit an all-time low under the government of the former Head of
State General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
However, the frost in diplomatic relations did not affect
trade matters with the U.S. importing some 40 percent of
Nigeria's crude oil annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq has reaffirmed its disciplines to the
weapons inspectors who have returned to Baghdad, sources close to
UNSCOM told Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday is the first day for the U.N. weapons inspectors to
resume their work in Iraq. The sources said the inspectors were
asked to strictly obey the relevant regulations to avoid
"unnecessary troubles."
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said the inspection work within the
next few days is "crucial and sensitive," as Baghdad's sincerity
will be tested following its announcement to resume full
cooperation with the weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Any carelessness from both sides would likely trigger a new
crisis," a diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM chief Richard Butler said on Tuesday that he will write
to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to ask Baghdad to hand
out its chemical and biological documents.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad on Saturday promised unconditional resumption of
U.N. weapons inspections and thus narrowly escaped a military
strike threatened by the U.S. and Britain to force Iraqi
compliance.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials have hinted that if Iraq fails to comply
fully with U.N. resolutions in the future, the U.S. will launch
punishing attacks without prior warning.
</P>
<P>
A group of 86 U.N. weapons inspectors returned to Iraq on
Tuesday

<HEADLINE> Rawlings Stresses Importance of Primary Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings Wednesday appealed to West African countries to lay
emphasis on Primary Health Care to ensure good health for the
majority of their people.
</P>
<P>
Building sophisticated health facilities would not make much
impact because only a few people can afford to pay for such
facilities, Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
"Primary health care will have to be revived otherwise we will
be wasting our time, diseases will multiply and we will be
running a vicious cycle," the President said when the top brass
of the West Africa College of Physicians called on him at the
Castle, Osu.
</P>
<P>
The physicians, led by Nigerian President of the college
Samuel Kuku, are holding their 23rd annual general meeting in
Accra under the theme "Adolescent Health", a Ghana News Agency
(GNA) story reaching here Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings recalled the effectiveness of sanitary
inspectors of old and said they contributed immensely to
environmental sanitation, thus promoting primary health care.
</P>
<P>
He told the physicians that "you carry so much weight so you
have to assist governments to enforce primary health care."
</P>
<P>
Rawlings spoke about the exodus of doctors from developing
countries and appealed to the senior ones who are staying behind
to assist their governments to curb the exodus.
</P>
<P>
Kuku said the college had stepped up its training programs to
churn out more personnel who can serve in all levels of the
health delivery system.

<HEADLINE> UK Widow's Pension Can Be Extended to Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The widows' pension is to be
extended to men in a pension system reform, British Social
Security Secretary Alistair Darling announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the move was taken after a case was submitted to the
European Court of Human Rights by a widower Kevin Willis.
</P>
<P>
Willis is expected to win his claim that the current UK system
discriminates against men.
</P>
<P>
Darling said the benefit changes will take place after April
2001.
</P>
<P>
He stressed changes would apply only to people of working age
who lose a spouse, and not to existing widows, widows over state
pension age and war widows.
</P>
<P>
Those aged 55 or over who qualified for income support and were
widowed in the five years after the changes were introduced would
get support worth the same amount as the current widows' pension.
</P>
<P>
He also said 20,000 already widowed men and their dependents
would benefit from the plans.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Urges Italy to Extradite PKK Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz Wednesday called on Italy to extradite Abdullah Ocalan,
leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), to Turkey
for trial, Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parliament deputies, Yilmaz said that the
Italian government would defame the country's history if it
refuses to extradite Ocalan to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of all political parties represented in the
Parliament, I declare to the whole world that no Turkish
government, even those that succeed us, will ever let Italy's
mistaken attitude stand without any response," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
He did not clarify what kind of response Turkey might make.
</P>
<P>
"We only wish good luck to our Italian allies in the tough and
historic test it will have to pass," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister stressed that Turkey's demands for
extradition do not originate from a thirst for vengeance, but
from its determination to punish a criminal who has acted against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested last Thursday by the Italian police for
holding a forged passport when he arrived in Rome by a Russian
airliner.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry demanded that Italy extradite him to
Turkey, saying that any action trying to block the extradition
will harm the friendly ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Italy, however, has not given Ankara any clear and positive
response.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Italian government fears that Ocalan
might be sentenced to death by the Turkish court because of the
facts that the PKK killed large numbers of Turkish soldiers and
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Justice Ministry has said that Ocalan would not be
executed if he stands trial in a court, saying that it is
preparing a motion to ask the parliament to abolish capital
punishment from the criminal law.
</P>
<P>
But this also failed to talk the Italian government into
making a decision on the extradition of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
"There are no positive signals coming from the Italian
officials," Turkish Ambassador to Rome Inal Batu said after
meeting with Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema expressed the hope that Turkey will understand Italy's
position and the Italian-Turkish relations will not be undermined.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting against the Turkish government since
1984 in an attempt to establish an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 37,000 people, including soldiers, rebels and civilians,
were killed during the armed conflict between the Turkish troops
and the PKK militants.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 40,000 gallons of
crude oil has flowed into a river in Kansas because of an oil
pipeline leak in Kansas, polluting at least 20 kilometers
downstream into Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
Crews were working to contain the leak Wednesday, which was
detected Tuesday night after the Montgomery County Sheriff's
Office received calls of a petroleum smell, an Associated Press
report said.
</P>
<P>
Farmland Refinery, which owned the line, blocked off the line
to stop the leak about a half-hour after it was found.
</P>
<P>
The leak happened in a section of 12-inch pipe that runs about
three miles between a crude oil tank and the refinery. Farmland
officials say they don't know what caused the leak into the
Verdigris River, or how long it had been going on.

<HEADLINE> House Republicans Selects Speaker, Other Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Republicans in the U.S.
House of Representatives nominated Bob Livingston Wednesday to
succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker and gave Dick Armey another two
years as majority leader.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, the only
black Republican in the House, was elected chairman of the party
conference.
</P>
<P>
Watts, a former football player, defeated Representative John
Boehner of Ohio for the conference chairmanship, the
fourth-ranking leadership slot. The vote was 121-93.
</P>
<P>
Armey, a Texan who has been majority leader since the
Republicans gained control of the House in the 1994 elections,
defeated Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma on a third
ballot. The vote was 127-95.
</P>
<P>
Watt's election was a victory for the party's conservative
wing. Boehner had served as conference chairman the past four
years. Representative Bob Ney of Ohio, a Boehner supporter, said
the former chairman "got blamed in my opinion for the lack of an
agenda here. They were looking for a magical message that didn't
exist."
</P>
<P>
"People were ready for a change," said Representative Matt
Salmon of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
Challenging Armey were Largent, Dunn, and J. Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, who dropped out after finishing fourth on the first
ballot
</P>
<P>
After the vote for majority leader, Armey emerged from the
closed caucus with Largent and Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington
and called the contest "a well-run race of energy and enthusiasm."
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to fight for the things we believe in as a
party," said Largent. Dunn appealed for unity, saying it was
important to "sweep up the residue" from the leadership contest.
</P>
<P>
Tom DeLay of Texas had no opposition for another term as party
whip, the third-ranking leadership post.
</P>
<P>
Livingston, who chaired the House Appropriations Committee, was
chosen by voice vote in a closed-door meeting of the 223 House
Republicans who will serve in the 106th Congress. With the backing
of the majority party, he is assured election to the job when the
new House convenes January 6.
</P>
<P>
The leadership elections followed two weeks of intense
behind-the-scenes campaigning by candidates for the jobs, and in
some cases months of preparation.
</P>
<P>
Livingston said House Republicans will not betray their
philosophy, but "lose nothing by reaching out to the other side,
to talk and listen and work in tandem with those who may share
some of our goals and dreams."
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Livingston will succeed Gingrich, who on
November 6 announced that he would retire from his post and from
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Clinging to his job as chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee was Representative John Linder of Georgia,
who had been handpicked by Gingrich. His challenger was another
moderate, Representative Tom Davis of Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Zambian MPs Condemn Idea of Barotseland's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Ten parliamentary members
(MPs) from Barotseland or Western Province of Zambia Wednesday
condemned the idea of their region's break-away from Zambia and
form one country with the Caprivi Strip of the northeastern
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The MPs from the ruling Movement for Muti-party Democracy
(MMD) disassociated themselves from earlier remarks made by
Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika, president of opposition Agenda
for Zambia (AZ) which has been advocating for a free and
independent Barotseland, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Lewanika, a royal member of Barotseland, said last Monday the
Caprivian Lozis from Namibia and those from the Barotseland were
of "one people" and they had the right to decide either to
"rejoin" a free Barotseland, establish their self-rule or remain
part of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted meeting in recent months with top figures of
the Namibia's Caprivian secessionist movement led by Mishake
Muyongo, president of the country's largest opposition Democratic
Turnhalle Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Mwitila Shumina, spokesman of the ten MPs including Foreign
Minister Keli Walubita, said the AZ leader was not a spokesman of
Western Province and his remarks had threatened the peace there.
</P>
<P>
The utterances of Lewanika would scare away potential
investors in the province and it was therefore important for the
Zambian government to study his statements for the truth and
build investor confidence, said Shumina, who added that they were
not only politically damaging but economically disastrous.
</P>
<P>
On the alliance of Caprivi-Western Province, Shumina said the
natural relationship of inter-border area did not correspond with
international law on boundaries.
</P>
<P>
"People of Western Province are aware that ethnic
relationships are common factors in most border areas hence the
Caprivi issue is not unique and it should not be used as a
barometer of problems in Zambia and Namibia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chief government spokesman Newstead Zimba disclosed last
Monday the Zambian government was studying the remarks made by
the AZ leader and said the utterances concerning the links
between the Lozis of the Barotseland and those of the Caprivi who
were considered rebels in their own country were "serious" and
needed careful scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
The remarks also drew the attention of Namibian High
Commission based in Lusaka. Acting High Commissioner Albert
Lushetile said last Tuesday that Lewanika's recent remarks were a
matter of concern to his government.
</P>
<P>
He noted that just like Zambia, Namibia was a sovereign state
and there was no way that such activities of secession could be
condoned and supported by both countries.
</P>
<P>
A Namibian newspaper, The Namibian, reported last Friday the
leaders of the Caprivi movement were now forging an alliance with
Lozi separatists in the Barotseland.
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, according to the United Nations
Humanitarian Information Unit, over 400 Caprivian separatists had
fled Namibia to neighboring Botswana to seek refuge, claiming
persecution at home.
</P>
<P>
It said Namibian President Sam Nujoma had asked Botswana to
repatriate them to face charges of treason and murder.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Arms Inspection Goes Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. weapons inspection went
on smoothly on Wednesday, the first day that U.N. arms inspectors
resumed work after returning to Iraq on Tuesday, said an Iraqi
official.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency INA quoted Hussam Mohammed Ameen,
director of the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate, the Iraqi
liaison with U.N. arms inspectors, as saying that the Iraqi side
provided all the facilities for U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Ameen said two missile teams from the U.N. Baghdad Monitoring
and Verification Center visited some sites to make sure that
surveillance equipments there were working properly.
</P>
<P>
A chemical team visited a factory outside Baghdad to check
whether sealing paper stuck on some machines were removed or not,
said Ameen.
</P>
<P>
Three inspection teams of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) in charge of overseeing Iraq's nuclear program
visited some sites in or outside Baghdad, said Ameen, adding that
a biological team inspected one site.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special envoy to Iraq,
Prakash Shah, left Baghdad for Bahrain on Wednesday, said Ameen,
but he did not mention the purpose of Shah's trip.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Shah told reporters that Iraq's pledges of
full and unconditional cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors would
be tested in the coming days, especially when intrusive and
surprise inspections to new sites were resumed.

Sources close to the U.N. Special Commission for disarming
Iraq (UNSCOM) told Xinhua Wednesday on condition of anonymity
that intrusive inspections of new suspected sites may have to wait
until next week.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-six U.N. arms inspectors returned to Baghdad Tuesday
after an imminent U.S. military strike against Iraq had been
averted.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday is the first day that U.N. arms inspectors
resume their work since last August when Iraq barred UNSCOM
and IAEA from conducting intrusive inspections of new sites.
</P>
<P>
U.N. chief arms inspector Richard Butler last Wednesday
ordered the withdrawal of about 100 personnel from Iraq on the
"strong recommendation" from the U.S. government which said a
military strike against Iraq was imminent.
</P>
<P>
Iraq averted possible U.S. and British air strikes at the
last minute on Saturday by agreeing to allow the resumption of
U.N. arms inspections unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership halted all forms of cooperation with UNSCOM on
October 31, including its monitoring activities, while allowing
IAEA to proceed with its monitoring activities.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and UNSCOM for attempting to
prolong U.N. economic sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. sanctions cannot be lifted unless UNSCOM
certifies that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.

LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Spanish club Real Madrid
appear to be stepping up their bid for Liverpool's Steve
McManaman - but they are only one of 14 clubs in the running.
</P>
<P>
McManaman's adviser Colin Gordon admitted Thursday that the
European Champions had made an inquiry about the England
midfielder but insisted that reports suggesting a deal was about
to be done were well wide of the mark.
</P>
<P>
He added that the 26-year-old star, who has been with the
Anfield club since leaving school, has still not decided to leave
Merseyside. With his contract due to expire at the end of the
current campaign, McManaman is one of the hottest properties in
the game.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ministry Spokesman Says U.S. Remarks Are Unreasonable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Spokesman Hu Chusheng said
today that a remark made by a senior U.S. Commerce Department
official recently was unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official charged that China's tax refunds for some
export commodities were in fact an export subsidy and covert
currency devaluation, but, Hu said, this was neither a subsidy nor
covert devaluation of the yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to the General Agreement of Tariff and Trade and the
World Trade Organization, refunds for commodities can not be
considered subsidies because they do not exceed the limit of taxes
allowed for the products.
</P>
<P>
China's export tax refund rate is only from 9 to 11 percent,
which is below China's legal tax rate of 17 to 13 percent, and
much less than that of most countries, so the U.S. official's
remarks reflect a misunderstanding of China's tax policy.
</P>
<P>
European and American countries all have export tax refund
policies, the spokesman said. The taxes and refunds of France were
26 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the Chinese government has lowered the export tax
refund rate twice in accordance with the real tax rate and has
increased tax collection controls in the past two years. Its real
tax rate is higher than before, which is why the government has
raised some tax refund rates. These were not directed at any
particular countries, and were not a covert devaluation of the
renminbi, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has paid a great price in not devaluing the renminbi, and
has made an important contribution to the financial situation in
Asia and stability of the global economy, the spokesman said, and
the unreasonable remarks of the U.S. official harm the Asian
economy's normal order.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Families Rally Against Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi families whose children
have become victims of U.N. economic sanctions rallied on
Thursday, calling for removal of the more than eight-year-old
embargo.
</P>
<P>
At the rally held in Saddam Children Hospital, participants
presented to the French humanitarian agency "Equilibre" letters of
protest demanding the lifting of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The participants held the American administration responsible
for the continuation of the embargo imposed on Iraq following its
1990 invasion of Kuwait. The embargo has claimed lives of
hundreds of thousands of Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
The rally was organized by Iraqi Children's Culture House in
cooperation with General Federation of Iraqi Children and the Red
Crescent Society.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Iraqi Red Crescent Society Sadiq Alwash told
reporters those letters had exceeded 2.5 million and they would be
sent to the Hague Tribunal to get officials acquainted with the
danger of the embargo on the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"Equilibre" Chairman Alain Michel stressed the need for putting
an end to the embargo which had led to an increase in mortality
rates among the Iraqi population, in particular the children.
</P>
<P>
Michael said his organization would exert the utmost to get
the world public opinion acquainted with the size of suffering
the Iraqis had seen.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Iraqi Children's Culture House Raad Bandar
said a massive number of letters were handed over to the house
since 1994 with an authenticated information of hardships borne
by Iraqi people under the harsh embargo.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last Saturday agreed to resume unconditionally
U.N. weapons inspections it halted three months ago. U.N. arms
inspectors who returned to Iraq Tuesday resumed tasks on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Weapons inspectors conducted routine monitoring activities
 on Thursday. So far no incidents were reported regarding the
cooperation of the Iraqi side.

<HEADLINE> Man United Manager Plays Down Aussi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has played down reports
of a possible line-up with Australian club, Adelaide Sharks.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper claimed the Old Trafford
club was interested in buying a majority stake in the Sharks,
once a decision had been reached on their own proposed 623
million pounds takeover by BSkyB.
</P>
<P>
"We are not merely talking about players here, the proposals
involve a lot more than that," said former Adelaide player Neil
McGachey, friend of Alex Ferguson since the United manager's
former club, Aberdeen, toured Australia in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The news surfaced only hours before United fans opposed to the
BSkyB takeover were due to question members of the Board at the
annual general meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Alex wants to set up the best possible opportunities here for
Manchester United. He has a clear vision of where he wants to go.
</P>
<P>
"He has told me he will be putting the Australian proposals to
the new owners as soon as the situation settles down," added
McGachey.
</P>
<P>
The report says the deal would involved United buying a 51 per
cent stake in the Adelaide club, resulting in player exchanges
and a takeover of major merchandising rights.
</P>
<P>
But Ferguson said: "We had lengthy discussions with the Sharks
during the summer but the club feels the time isn't right to take
matters any further at present. We want to concentrate our
efforts in Europe."
</P>
<P>
Manchester United signed a "memorandum of co-operation" with
Royal Antwerp earlier this week, which will result in the Belgian
side helping United attract young talent from outside Europe
Union.

<HEADLINE> EU Ready to Overcome Problems of Non-duty-free Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
here Thursday that it has drawn up a working document specifying
the instrument available to its member states to offset the
possible consequences of the abolition of intra-EU duty-free sales
as from July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the
scope of existing EU measures capable of offsetting regional,
local or social difficulties which may arise from the abolition of
duty-free sales beginning from next July 1, in accordance with an
EU decision in 1991, the EU commission said.
</P>
<P>
The document explains the scope of the EU structural Funds and
EU guidelines on state aid, particularly in the transport sector.
15 EU member states may use it as a basis for identifying the most
appropriate measures to counteract possible regional, local or
social difficulties after first assessing the problem involved.
</P>
<P>
During the current programing period of the structural funds,
which expires at the end of 1999, the commission said, the member
states have taken no specific measures aimed at alleviating
possible consequences of the duty-free sale abolition.
</P>
<P>
Some adjustments may still be made, but it will be possible to
have greater recourse to these measures in future year, according
to the level of priority granted to this question by the EU member
states.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Host Expo on Electrical, Electronic Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Nepal is to host an
international exhibition and symposium on electrical and
electronic products, services and ideas on November 24 and 28 in
Kathmandu, the organizers said in a press release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the expo is "Leading Nepal Toward an Electric
Future," reflecting Nepal's aspirations toward rapid development
by harnessing and utilizing its vast water resources with huge
potential for the generation of clean and renewable hydropower for
industrial use and as an export commodity, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Currently only 15 percent of the country's population have
access to electricity and the present installed capacity of about
300MW is less than 0.1 percent of the economically viable
hydropower potential in the country, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Sixty national and international exhibitors like power
companies, and manufacturers of electrical/electronic products,
wires, cables, motors, computers and electrical vehicles are
expected to participate in the expo, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the symposium will focus on hydropower
development, efficient lighting systems, switches and accessories,
mobile cellular phones, energy efficiency and auditing.
</P>
<P>
The expo and symposium will be organized jointly by the Nepal
Electrical Association and the Society of Electrical Engineers
Nepal and it will become a biannual event.
</P>
<P>
Such kind of event was first launched in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Japan's LDP, LP Reach Agreement on Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) and the opposition Liberal Party (LP)
Thursday agreed to form a coalition government by the next regular
Diet (parliament) session in January.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached between Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, head of the LDP, and LP leader Ichiro Ozawa.
</P>
<P>
It marks the end of the rivalry between the two parties that
started when Ozawa split from the LDP with a group of legislators
in June 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two parties will jointly draw up a state budget for the
1999 fiscal year by the end of this year, the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
The Liberals will cooperate fully with the LDP from outside the
cabinet during the extraordinary Diet session, which will convene
on November 27, it said.
</P>
<P>
The two parties will cooperate in national as well as local
elections, the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
The two parties will also coordinate policies on security
issues, education, administrative reform and welfare.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said after signing the agreement that he was "very
happy" with the alliance, and felt confident that various policies
will be implemented "with the firm cooperation of the parties".
</P>
<P>
Obuchi had been seeking a stronger power base for the LDP,
which holds a thin majority in the lower house, but lacks overall
control of the House of Councillors, or the upper house.
</P>
<P>
The LDP, which has 104 upper house seats, will still be short
of a majority even after forming a coalition with the LP, which
has 12 seats.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece to Protest Turkey Over Nuclear Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Greece on Thursday
agreed to join forces to protest against Turkey's construction of
a nuclear power plant on its southern coast.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a meeting here between Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides and visiting Greek Minister for the
Aegean Elizabeth Papazoi who arrived here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Papazoi said that Turkey aspires
to be a tourist destination, but its intention to construct
thirty nuclear power plants, most of which would be erected on
its southern coast, is "an unjustifiable energy choice."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has announced a plan to construct a nuclear energy
plant in Akkuyu, on Turkey's southern coast, north of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Papazoi noted that the plant would directly affect the
environment and the tourist industry in the whole region.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister said that Turkey, "with its
anti-environmental profile, can not guarantee that this plant will
operate on modern models," adding that it would only cover two
percent of Turkey's future needs, at a price three times higher
than today's cost of hydroelectric and natural gas power.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Akkuyu plant would be an environmental
hazard, as the location is prone to earthquakes, adding that a
nuclear accident would greatly affect the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
It is for this reason that Greece and Cyprus must cooperate to
prevent the construction of the plant, Papazoi pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Referring to her meeting with Clerides, Papazoi said that they
also discussed other matters such as bilateral cooperation, as
well as the multiple pollution caused by Turkey's heavy industries
and their untreated toxic waste that flows into the sea.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Inflation Edges Up in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Canada edged up
0.4 percent in October as consumers paid more for gasoline,
electricity and fresh vegetables, Statistics Canada said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In October, gasoline prices rose 2.2 percent over September,
electricity was up 2.3 point and fresh vegetables 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, prices for furniture and meat fell, which
largely moderated the overall increase on the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
On a yearly basis, Canada's inflation rate rose one percent in
October.
</P>
<P>
"Prices for gasoline and computer equipment continued to
exercise major downward pressure on the annual change, while
prices for food, university tuition, piped gas and property taxes
were the major contributors to the upward movement," the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Canada's annual inflation
rate has ranged from a low of 0.7 percent in September to a high
of 1.1 percent in January and May, well below the the annual
average change of 1.6 percent in both 1997 and 1996.

<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- American jockey Angel
Monserrate has been banned for ten years by England's Jockey Club
after riding in races as an amateur under a bogus identity.
</P>
<P>
He rode professionally in the USA until he was banned in 1995
after failing a drugs test, but turned up in England under the
name'Angel Jacobs'.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC on Thursday, Monserrate took part in 21
races in England, partnering five winners, but attracted
suspicion because of his riding style.
</P>
<P>
His licence was withdrawn in August and his mounts have been
disqualifed, with compensation paid to the owners of horses who
missed out on prize money because of his deception.
</P>
<P>
The ten-year ban was handed out at a meeting of the Jockey
Club's disciplinary committee, who charged him with misleading
stewards and acting in a manner prejudicial to the integrity of
racing.
</P>
<P>
Monserrate, who now works in a Cambridge restaraunt, told the
committee he did it "for the love of racing". He confirmed
afterwards that he would not appeal against the ban.

<HEADLINE> Health Canada Extends Toy Warning to Pets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian pet owners have been
warned to keep their animals away from soft vinyl products, which
could secrete a dangerous chemical when chewed or sucked.
</P>
<P>
"If you have concerns, you should remove the products from the
pet's environment and dispose of them," said Health Canada
spokesman Stephen Jeffery.
</P>
<P>
Health Canada had previously warned parents of small children
to keep their children from vinyl toys.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that animals habitually chew toys for much
longer time than infants do, the department later also extended
the warning to pets amid mounting concerns from cat and dog owners.
</P>
<P>
"If a substance is toxic for humans it is almost always toxic
for animals," said Diane Mckelvey, spokeswoman for the Canadian
Veterinary Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
"Puppies ... just love to chew. And it's not uncommon for them
to swallow bits of plastic toys," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to tests cited by Health Canada, soft vinyl toys
contain up to 44 percent of their weight in phthalates, a type of
chemical that has been shown to cause liver and kidney damage in
laboratory animals.

in Dar es Salaam, Sumaye said he has two simple houses, three
cars, two tractors, farms and other properties.

One of his houses is located in his home village Endasak, in
Hanang District in the northern region of Arusha, and the other
lies in Mbagala in the suburbs of Dar es Salaam which is rented
to clients at 360,000 Shillings (about 537 U.S. Dollars)
annually, he said.
</P>
<P>

(TOL) shares, each priced at 500 Shillings when launched earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Arusha and Dodoma regional
commissioners declared their personal assets.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian government and party leaders have been urged by
President Benjamin Mkapa, who is also the CCM National Chairman,
to declare their personal assets every year so that they cannot
abuse power to amass wealth. Mkapa himself has declared his
personal assets to the public.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are expected to fill in forms of personal assets
at the office of the Ethics Commissioner Judge William J. Manina,
and those who make false reports may face legal punishment.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish singer Julio
Iglesias was here today to promote trade and economic ties between
his hometown of Valencia and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
This was his first China visit as a 'trade ambassador', he
said, adding that China has a lot of his fans and its rapidly
developing economy has become more important.
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, the Spanish singer came to Shanghai and
didn't sell very well. At that time, what impressed him most was
the millions of bicycles, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
He says that he was the first to introduce pop music from the
West and he believes that one day Asian songs will become popular
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
But what Iglesia wanted to do today was to introduce the
businessmen from Valencia who are here for a month-long Valencia
Commodities Fair and he has an ad on the ticket of his upcoming
concert that promotes the fair.
</P>
<P>
Valencia is an important trade, tourism, and shipping center in
Spain and is the first of Spain's autonomous districts to send a
large trade delegation to China. Over 20 Spanish journalists have
joined the tour.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Kenneth W. Starr will insist in the House impeachment
hearing on Thursday that President Clinton abused his power to
cover up his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky and time and again put
up an array of "roadblocks and hurdles" that slowed the
prosecutor's other investigations.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration, committed to renewed support for
Iraqi dissidents, finds the opposition groups so weak and divided
and penetrated by Iraqi agents that it is uncertain how to form a
united front capable of toppling Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- House Republicans purged much of their troubled leadership
Wednesday, turning away from the ideological rhetoric of recent
years to embrace incoming Speaker Bob Livingston and his
nuts-and-bolts pledge to provide "honest, responsive and efficient
government."
</P>
<P>
-- American's top Catholic leaders Wednesday launched an
aggressive new campaign to lobby against abortion and to mobilize
parishes across the country into a powerful new voting bloc
against candidates who support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The Dow Jones Industrials rose 54.83 points to 9041.11,
their highest close since July 22, as cautious optimism followed
Tuesday's interest-rate cut. The Nasdaq Composite climbed as well.
Meanwhile, crude-oil futures dipped below 12 dollars a barrel for
the first time since June before recovering slightly. December
crude closed at 12.14 dollars a barrel, down 31 cents.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in September, thanks to a
jump in sales of U.S.-made aircraft and autos. But economists
don't expect such sales to continue, suggesting the deficit will
resume its record-setting pace.

Chretien's current visit is an indication of the importance Canada
places on its ties with China. He said he believes the visit will
have a positive effect on friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>

Canadians to enhance bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said that the Canadian government is willing to
continue its political ties with China and increase other ties in

CHENGDU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Huangcheng Mosque in
Chengdu, the capital of south China's Sichuan Province, opened
today to 16,000 Moslems in the city.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Hariadi Dharmawan, one of the
signatories of a joint communique considered by the Indonesian
government as proof of the existence of a subversive plot, has
been relieved of his position as Inspector General at the Forestry
and Plantations Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Hariadi was replaced by Brig. Gen. Soentoro by virtue of
Presidential Decree no. 216/M/1998 dated October 14, 1998 in a
measure that had been planned for a long time, the ministry's
secretary general Oetomo S. told reporters here Thursday.

</P>
<P>
He was one of 17 opposition figures who issued a joint
communique on November 12 proposing the replacement of the

be interrogated by police for "plotting to overthrow the
government".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Director General for Immigration Pranowo Thursday
told reporters that the government has imposed a travel ban on the
17 opposition figures.

<P>
CAIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- The volume of investments of the Anglo-Dutch Shell
company in Syria has exceeded 5 billion U.S. dollars, making it
one of the biggest foreign investors in Syria.
</P>
<P>
The latest quarterly Middle East Shell magazine quoted Robert
Veneer, general manager of Shell Syria, as saying that cooperation
between Shell, its German partner and Syria helped provide more
than 60 percent of Syria's total oil production as well as 4.25
million cubic meter of natural gas per day.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has requested
Finland to exert its efforts, after assuming the rotating
chairmanship of the European Union in the first half of 1999, to
abolish the tax the EU plans to impose on aluminum exports by UAE
and other Gulf states, Thursday's daily Al Hayat reported.
</P>
<P>
TUNISIA -- Tunisia's foreign currency reserves by the end of
August amounted to 1.75 billion dinars (1.59 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Tunisian Central Bank figures, remittances to the
country by Tunisian emigrants during the first eight months of
this year amounted to 415 million dinars.
</P>
<P>
TUNISIA -- Two protocols of cooperation were signed in Tunis,
the first between the National Chamber of Tunisian Businesswomen
and the Egyptian Businesswomen Society, and the second between the
same Tunisian chamber and the Community of Lebanese Businesswomen.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's daily Al Sabah pointed out that the two protocols
aims at enhancing exchange of trade, expertise and data between

<HEADLINE> Indian Military Exercises Being Monitoring Closely: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is closely
monitoring the current military exercises being conducted by India
which are the largest since 1987, a spokesman for the Foreign
Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan can not remain oblivious to the fact that these
exercises, which involve the Indian army as well as the airforce,
navy, marine corps and coastguards, are being conducted in the
vicinity of its territory, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
What is more alarming, he said, is that the exercises involve
amphibious assault operations described as a "seabourne attack" on
a "hostile" shore.
</P>
<P>
"Such operations can only be perceived as aggressive maneuvers
and raise questions about their intent and purpose," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
"They, therefore, cause justifiable concern among India's
neighbors," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable, the spokesman said that "this provocative
demonstration of force is taking place soon after tensions in the
region have been exacerbated by Indian nuclearization of South
Asia and continuing stalemate in talks with Pakistan as a result
of New Delhi's intransigent attitude."

<HEADLINE> Mass Demonstration Against Soeharto Held In Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JAKARTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Local people and students in
Indonesia's capital Jakarta held an anti-Soeharto mass
demonstration, starting at 14:00 local time on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators in great number moved toward residence of
the former president at Jalancendana street in Central Jakarta.
But they failed to reach the target point because of tight
security precautions at various intersections that lead to the
spot, official Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that demonstrators stage their action
near the residence of Soeharto who resigned on May 21 amid
anti-government demonstrations and bloody rioting in the country.
</P>
<P>
Students and citizens in the country have held various
demonstrations recently, urging the government to bring Soeharto
to court on the charges of corruption, collusion and nepotism
during his 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a legislator claimed that President B.J Habibie
needed no new law to start investigation on former president
Soeharto, saying that the existing anti-corruption law would do.
</P>
<P>
Djuhad Mahja SH of the United Development Party faction made
the statement in the Parliament building here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A investigation team set up in September announced on Tuesday
that some evidence of Soeharto's allegedly ill-gotten wealth has
been found in several provinces including land, factories and
others. The team also found Soeharto's personal saving accounts as
much as 2.3 million U.S dollars in 72 domestic banks.

<HEADLINE> Securities Market Needs Laws To Guide It: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, says that
China's securities market is a major part of the socialist market
economy and should be controlled by laws to maintain its healthy
development and serve economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Li visited Shenzhen in Guangdong Province, November 15-18, to
study the country's fledgling securities sector. He presided over
two discussions in Shenzhen attended by local securities
specialists and researchers.
</P>
<P>
Li says he agrees that the securities market has played a
positive role in raising public funds, improving use of resources,
adjusting the economic structure, transforming the management of
state enterprises, and developing the national economy.
</P>
<P>
One of the lessons China has learned from the financial turmoil
in Southeast Asia, he said, is the importance of avoiding
financial hazards and learning how to protect China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the securities market is highly volatile and asked
that there be greater controls.
</P>
<P>
China opened the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 1990 and the
Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 1991. Over 800 companies have been
listed on the two, with capitalization of more than 2 trillion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the NPC Standing Committee has held hearings on a
law for the securities market four times.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Oks First Stage Troop Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet gave its
final go-ahead Thursday to the long-delayed troop withdrawal from
the West Bank agreed upon in the recent land-for-security deal
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The approval paved the way for Israeli troops to begin
withdrawing from 2 percent of the West Bank in the first of the
three phases of further redeployment, in which Israel will hand
over a total of 13 percent of the areas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said the withdrawal would begin as early as
Thursday night. Besides turning the 2 percent into shared control,
Israel will turn over 7 percent of the West Bank now under joint
control to exclusive Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Israel is also expected to open a Palestinian airport in Gaza
and release 250 Palestinian prisoners later this week, all agreed
on by the two sides in the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 17 ministers voted for, 5 against and three
abstained, local TV announced. It did not explain whether the
remaining two cabinet ministers absented themselves from the
voting, following hours of debate in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, a leading opponent
to the peace accord, said before the cabinet meeting that he was
considering leaving the government and would possibly announce
resignation after the voting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called in light of a cabinet decision last week
when it approved the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
While ratifying the deal by a narrow majority, the cabinet
attached a string of conditions to it, including that the cabinet
would convene before every scheduled stage of withdrawal to review
the Palestinian compliance with their commitments undertaken in
the agreements.
</P>
<P>
Senior Israeli officials said before the voting that the
Palestinians have meet all their obligations during the first
stage, including the issue of an decree banning illegal weapons,
the confirmation by the Palestinian Liberation Organization
Executive Committee of the cancellation of the anti-Israel
provisions in the Palestinian national charter.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat issued a decree to ban
anti-Israel incitement earlier Thursday, removing the last hurdle
to the approval of the redeployment by the Israeli cabinet.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Convinced of DPRK's Nuclear-Related Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy for Korean
affairs Charles Kartman Thursday said the United States was
convinced that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is
constructing an underground nuclear facility.
</P>
<P>
"There is compelling evidence that this site is intended to be
used for nuclear-related activities," Kartman told reporters after
flying in from Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that a high-ranking U.S. official has
confirmed the underground facility being constructed was to be
used for manufacturing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
While in Pyongyang, the U.S. special envoy asked for
U.S. access to the suspected underground nuclear project now
underway in Kumchangni, some 40 kilometers northwest of Youngbyon
of the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"We asked the North Korean side to remove our suspicions about
Kumchangni," Kartman said.
</P>
<P>
The Kumchangni site is the only one the United States is now
pressing the DPRK to allow on-the-spot nuclear inspections, said
Kartman, who met South Korean officials earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. inter-agency team led by the special envoy conducted
"quite intensive discussions" in Pyongyang with a DPRK team headed
by Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye-kwan without making any
significant breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
"Although we discussed some ideas for access to that site,
there is still a rather wide gap between our positions," the envoy
said.
</P>
<P>
During the discussions, the DPRK officials, who denied they
were engaged in nuclear-related activities, demanded monetary
compensation in exchange for the "insulting" access to the site.
</P>
<P>
"We have absolutely rejected the concept of compensation,"
Kartman said.
</P>
<P>
Asked how much the DPRK asked for compensation, he said "the
question of the amount is sort of irrelevant".
</P>
<P>
While in Pyongyang, Kartman said he delivered a strong message
to make sure that the DPRK understood how serious the nuclear
issue was.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that failure to gain access to inspect the site could
directly affect the 1994 U.S-DPRK Agreed Framework, under which
Pyongyang pledged to freeze its nuclear programs in return for
receiving two light-water nuclear reactors and heavy fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
"My presentations contained very clear elements that failure in
resolving the suspicions would pose a threat to the viability of
the Agreed Framework," he said.
</P>
<P>
Washington and Pyongyang will continue talks on the alleged
underground nuclear facility.
</P>
<P>
"We have invited the North Koreans to continue these serious
talks as soon as possible," he said, adding that the future
schedule would be discussed by their representatives in New York.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy said that Washington and Seoul would maintain
close cooperation in dealing with the DPRK nuclear issue.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Officials, Reporters Denied Entry into DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 24 South Koreans were
barred from leaving a cruise ship by the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) on their trip to the DPRK's Mountain Kumgang, South
Korean Hyundai Group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK did not allow the 24 South Koreans to leave the ship,
saying they are hostile to the Pyongyang government.
</P>
<P>
The 24 consist of 15 reporters from the Korea Broadcasting System,
five journalists from the Chosun Ilbo and four Unification Ministry
officials.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai said Kim Yoon-kyu, president of Hyundai Engineering and
Construction is negotiating with DPRK authorities concerned for
the 24 people's entry.
</P>
<P>
The 28,000-ton luxury cruiser ship Hyundai Kumgang entered the DPRK
water late last night after sailing 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
Aboard the luxury ship, there are a total of 1,356 passengers and
crew, of whom, 200 are South Korean journalists.
</P>
<P>
The tour to Mountain Kumgang was conducted in accordance with
an agreement signed by Hyundai and DPRK's Asia-Pacific Peace
Committee in Pyongyang in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Hyundai will bring 1,000 South Koreans to tour
the mountain area. South Korean tourists have to pay 1,300 U.S. dollars
each for the five-day trip.
</P>
<P>
The historic tour of Mountain Kumgang, located near the
Demilitarized Zone on the East Coast, marks a major breakthrough in
inter-Korean relations, which have been dominated by tensions of
conflicts since the end of 1950-53 Korean War.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Security Council to React to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Thursday urged the
United Nations Security Council to react to U.S. President Bill
Clinton's call for toppling the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Thawra daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Baath party,
demanded the Security Council practice its ethical and legal
responsibilities towards Clinton's public incitement for
overthrowing Iraq's legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
The paper said in an editorial that Clinton's statement was "a
flagrant violation of the U.N. Charter, the international laws,
as well as an interference in Iraq's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said on Sunday that Washington would support the
efforts of Iraqi oppositions to overthrow the regime of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein while announcing that Iraq had narrowly
averted a military strike by backing down from its defiance of
U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said the Security Council "must not keep silent
and ignore this violation and let it go without thinking of its
dangerous consequences on the international community."
</P>
<P>
"This negligence will encourage the United States and other
countries to violate the international laws and give the
U.S. license to intervene in the internal affairs of other
countries," it warned.
</P>
<P>
The editorial pointed out that Clinton's statement is a hard
evidence of U.S. position on the sanctions aimed at weakening
Iraq's potentials.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. insists that the lifing of U.N. sanctions imposed on
Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait be linked not only with
Iraq's disarmament, but also with other time-consuming issues such
as the release of Kuwaiti prisoners of war and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Iraq agreed on Saturday to unconditional resumption of
U.N. weapons inspections, defusing the standoff with the U.N. over
its October 31 decision to halt all cooperations with U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
U.N. arms inspectors resumed their work in Iraq on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> News Corp Launches New Broadcasting Company for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The billionaire media baron
Rupert Murdoch is launching a new company, News Broadcasting
Australia Pty Ltd, by using new wave of broadcasting technology to
expand its manor in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to position News Corp in a nascent market
delivering broadcast content over platforms such as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very wide brief. It covers all areas of broadcasting,"
Jim Blomfield, formerly head of News Corp's digital satellite
operation in Tokyo and chief executive of the new company, was
quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cross media ownership laws in Australia prevent Murdoch
controlling a television station and newspaper in the same city.
</P>
<P>
As a result News Corp cannot hold a broadcasting licence in
Australia because of its wide newspaper interests.
</P>
<P>
But new technology is moving in the company's favor to allow it
to start transmitting through means other than radio waves.
</P>
<P>
Murdoch has said recently that new technology would sweep away
all efforts by the governments to control media ownership.
</P>
<P>
In launching the new company, Lachlan Murdoch, chief executive
of News Corp's Australian arm, News Ltd, said the new company
aimed to "provide the Australian public with greater freedom of
choice in entertainment and information services".
</P>
<P>
"News' experience at the forefront of digital broadcasting and
content development around the world puts it in a unique position
to be a driving force in giving the public the competitive choice
of programming to which they are entitled," he added.
</P>
<P>
News is also the 50 percent owner of pay TV company Foxtel and
has developed the film and television production house Fox Studios
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"News Broadcasting aims to bring the full benefit of rapidly
advancing broadcasting services to Australian homes as soon as
possible," Murdoch said.

Considering the financial turmoil and its impact, he said this

<HEADLINE> ROK President Expects bright Future for Asian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- President of the Republic of
Korea (ROK) Kim Dae-jung said here Thursday that the future of the
Asian economy is bright although many nations are "currently going
through a dark tunnel".
</P>
<P>
"Asia will very soon offer a surprising opportunity to the
international community as a cradle for the welfare and cultural
affluence of humankind," said Kim, who arrived in Hong Kong
Thursday after attending the APEC leaders' meeting in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address to the Hong Kong business community,
President Kim expressed his confidence in the advent of the age
of Pacific civilization, "although a considerable number of Asian
nations are currently going through a dark tunnel, trying to
overcome a financial crisis and carry out industrial
restructuring". He stressed that only intense efforts to
restructure the economy will help a nation out of the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kim expressed appreciation for China's contribution to the
stability of the beleaguered Asian economy by maintaining the
value of the Renminbi.
</P>
<P>
President Kim sang highly of Hong Kong's free market system,
saying that Hong Kong will continue to be the financial and trade
center of Asia and will prosper in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"Having returned to China in July 1997, Hong Kong is now
opening a new chapter in history for the 21st century and becomes
part of the most dynamic nation with the biggest growth potential
in Asia," said Kim.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Hong Kong business community to develop strong
partnership with the Republic of Korea in such fields as finance
and trade. Hong Kong is the fifth largest trade partner of the
Republic of Korea, and trade between the two sides totaled 12.6
billion U.S. dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Cigarettes Kill 2,000 Chinese Every Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Cigarettes now claim the lives
of 2,000 people in China every day, according to a recent study.
</P>
<P>
That is expected to climb to 8,000 per day, or 3 million every
year, by the middle of the next century if current smoking
patterns persist. This is a new warning of the hazards of tobacco
in China, the world's biggest tobacco producer and home of 320
million smokers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese researchers have worked with Oxford University and
Cornell University on two national studies of tobacco-related
deaths, involving 1.25 million people.
</P>
<P>
About 1 out of 8 male deaths is caused by smoking. By 2050 it
will be 1 in 3. Of over 300 million males aged 29 or less, at
least 100 million will eventually be killed by tobacco and half
these deaths will be between the ages of 35 and 69, says Professor
Niu Shiru of China's Academy of Preventive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Liu Boqi of China's Academy of Medical Sciences and his
group found that about 45 percent of China's smoking-related
deaths are caused by chronic lung disease, 15 percent by lung
cancer and 5 to 8 percent from esophagus cancer, stomach cancer,
liver cancer, strokes, heart disease, and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
The researchers studied one million people who had died in 24
big cities and 74 rural counties for smoking patterns, and found
that, unfortunately, most people seriously underestimate the
risks, according to Prof. Yang Gonghuan of CAPM, who says that a
1996 national study showed that two-thirds said they believed
smoking did little or no harm.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 percent did not know it can cause lung cancer and 96
percent did not know it can cause heart disease, she says.
</P>
<P>
Daily cigarette use among Chinese males has risen to 15 from
only 1 in 1952. On average, two-thirds of males become smokers at
the age of 25 and smoking becomes a lifetime habit.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Information
Minister Mushahid Hussain called Thursday for concerted efforts to
address the issues of poverty alleviation and establishment of
peace in the third world.
</P>
<P>
Mushahid made the call during a briefing to the envoys of
African countries in Islamabad about Pakistan's policies.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is part of the third world and believes in solidarity
among the third world countries for alleviation of poverty,
resistance against hegemonism and establishment of peace," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said, Pakistan attaches great importance to its
relations with the third world countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Pakistan's support to movements in Tunisia,
Algiers, South Africa, Mushahid said that Pakistan has always been
supportive of de-colonization and independence movements.
</P>
<P>
About the regional situation Mushahid said, Pakistan wants
peace and stability in South Asia on the basis of a fair and just
settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
"We are holding talks with New Delhi and have also asked the
United States to help find a solution of the issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the African envoys about Pakistan's economic
policies, saying that the policies initiated by the government of
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif are directed at reviving the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Mushahid said, the primary objective of the present government
is to strengthen democracy as well as democratic institutions and
find solutions to people's problems.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Female Smokers In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A study in China has found
that the rate of smokers among China's young women has
dropped to the present one percent from ten percent in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
But, researchers are unclear about the reasons for the decline
and say that things are still far from encouraging because more
males, especially youngsters, are taking up smoking and for many
it is a lifetime habit.
</P>
<P>
Researchers say that cigarettes will kill 3 million people in
China each year in 50 years if the smoking habits remain
unchanged. Now, cigarettes kill about a million every year.
</P>
<P>
The study was done by the Chinese Academy of Preventive
Medicine (CAPM), the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS),
Britain's Oxford University, and the U.S.'s Cornell
University. They found that smoking-related deaths account for 3
percent of the deaths among females, compared with 12 percent
among males.
</P>
<P>
Researchers predict that such ratio among females may drop to 1
percent by 2050, while that among males may climb to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
Women run almost the same risk of lung cancer and respiratory
diseases as men. Deaths from lung cancer among smokers, both male
and female, were 3 times those among non-smokers, the researchers
say.

<HEADLINE> China Offers Giant Market For Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- China is projected to push its
economy forward at an average annual rate of seven percent in the
next ten years and offers a giant market for foreign
participation, Sun Zhengyu, vice minister of foreign trade
and economic cooperation, said today.
</P>
<P>
Sun, speaking at the Canada-China Business Council (CCBC)'s
annual meeting which convened today, said the market exists
because China's planned investment scale for the 1998-2000 period
exceeds 1.2 trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The sources of funds will mainly rely upon domestic savings,
but we will also actively utilize foreign funds in a wide range
of ways including fund raising for projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
He announced that official estimates for the country's foreign
trade volume in the year 2000 will reach 400 billion dollars
and that the figure is expected to double by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed his hope that "far-sighted, confident
and patient Canadian entrepreneurs will grasp the rare opportunity
at the turn of the century" and grow with China.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that China will increase the import of advanced
technology, equipment and materials and provide favorable
terms to encourage foreign companies to invest in China.
</P>
<P>
He said projects that are restricted in the eastern areas
have a greater chance of approval in western and central China as
local conditions allow, because the resources-rich heartland is in
dire need of capital to catch up with eastern regions.
</P>
<P>
While previously provincial governments could only approve
projects with foreign investment of less than 10 million
dollars, now they have the authority to approve projects with
foreign investment of up to 30 million dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister expressed his satisfaction with the size and
dimension of Sino-Canadian economic cooperation and trade at the
two-day conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the end of October China has approved nearly
3,900 Canadian direct investment projects, attracting contractual
funds of over six billion dollars, adding that more than 1.6
billion dollars have already been invested in China.
</P>
<P>
Canadian companies are now involved in agriculture, forestry,
transport, telecommunications, electricity, energy, the
metallurgical industry, medical care and finance in China.
</P>
<P>
While Chinese officials try to lure Canadian investment,
Sergio Marchi, Canadian minister for international trade, said in
his speech that Canada must also attract more Chinese investment in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
He told representatives of over 250 member companies of the
CCBC to speak to Chinese businessmen about "the advantages
of the Canadian economy and make them aware that Canada could be a
choice location for Chinese international investment."
</P>
<P>
"Many business leaders in China still see Canada as we were
20 years ago: a resource-based economy," he said, "But things have
changed. Twenty years ago, 60 percent of our exports were
commodity-based. Today, it's only about 35 percent -- that's just
12 percent of our GDP."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, when Chinese business leaders think of Canada, they
should be thinking high tech," he said. "They should be thinking
of a knowledge-based economy, fired by information technology,
fueled by telecommunications and fortified by the fifth largest
aerospace industry in the world."
</P>
<P>
The CCBC is a private sector, non-profit membership
organization incorporated in 1978 to facilitate and promote trade
and investment between Canada and China.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi FM on Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The present Bangladeshi
government has consistently treated its foreign policy as a
national policy, which is not confined to the outlook of a certain
party, Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are working on a (foreign) policy which... reflects the
hopes and aspirations of the entire nation," Azad told a regular
weekly briefing.
</P>
<P>
The main emphasis of the country's foreign policy was on "how
best relations can be built up with our neighbors," he said.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the present government would honor all
commitments with the outside world made by the previous regimes.
"We will honor all commitments and understanding reached before,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's policy of friendship and peaceful relations with
neighbors had brought positive results in recent years, according
to the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Often "we are blamed for delay" in responding to developments
in the international arena without going into the reasons, but
"delay can also bring dividend," he pointed out, referring to the
country's initiative in lessening tension in the subcontinent
following the nuclear explosions by India and Pakistan in May.
</P>
<P>
"We can very fairly claim to have played a role in lessening
tension in the subcontinent following the nuclear explosions,"
which was appreciated "by international fora including the United
Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement," Azad said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that mediation and understanding were accepted
norms to achieve success in international relations, citing as an
example the dialog between Bangladesh and Pakistan on the
repatriating stranded Pakistanis in the country.

<HEADLINE> Trademark Infringement Cases Reduced in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China handled 11,450 cases of
trademark infringement in the first half of 1998, 1,142 fewer than
in the same period last year, according to the latest figures from
the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SATC).
</P>
<P>
This is the result of effective measures adopted by the country
and an enhanced awareness among the people of China that they can
protect their intellectual property rights, said Teng Jiacai, an
official of the Trade Mark Department under the SATC.
</P>
<P>
China's administrative departments for industry and commerce,
which are in charge of trademark registration, increased the
the fine for trademark infringement to 4,063 yuan per case, on
average, seven percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
They also turned over 43 persons to judicial organs for further
penalties, an increase of 72 percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also indicate that east China's Zhejiang and
Shandong provinces handled more than 1,000 cases respectively
during the period, the most in the country.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts point out that since the Trademark Law was put
into effect in March 1983, China has established a comprehensive
series of trademark laws.
</P>
<P>
China has become one of the top 10 countries in the world in
trademark registrations in force, said Teng.
</P>
<P>
The number of trademark registrations in force topped 860,000
last year, compared with only 80,000 in 1982.

<HEADLINE> S. African Consumer Inflation Slightly Drops in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's year-on-year
consumer inflation slightly dropped to 9.0 percent in October from 9.1
percent in the previous month, Statistics South Africa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.4 percent month on
month. The seasonally adjusted index also increased by 0.4 percent for
the same period.
</P>
<P>
The annual increase of the CPI is mainly due to annual increases in
the price indices for housing (3.8 percentage points), food (1,1
percentage points), medical care and health expenses (0,8 percentage
points), household operation (0.7 percentage points) and transport
(0,7 percentage points).
</P>
<P>
The monthly increase of the CPI is due to monthly increases in the
price indices for food, housing, household operation and personal
care.
</P>
<P>
The annual core inflation rate, which excludes mortgage rates,
volatile food items and value added tax, remained unchanged at 7.7
percent in October compared with the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The difference between the official inflation rate of 9,0 percent
and the core inflation rate is mainly due to the impact of rising
interest rates on existing mortgage bonds.
</P>
<P>
The core inflation rate is the South African Reserve Bank's
preferred indicator of underlying inflationary pressures.

MANILA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines sets to
strengthen the country's taxation system by introducing the
necessary corrections on the revenue law, senior official of the
Department of Finance said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Assistant Secretary Gil Beltran told reporters that
since the revenue code of the country was very old, his department
was preparing a study on the necessary reform.
</P>
<P>
He added that the country's taxation system was "no longer at
par with the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
The study placed emphasis on the way of imposing taxes on the
funds transfer conducted by financial institutions, Beltran said.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the preparation for the new tax system,
reform plan would be presented to the private sector for necessary
consultations.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the Bankers Association of the Philippines and
the other financial institutions will oppose the plan as this will
even encourage more investments in the country," Beltran said.

Environment Program (UNEP) announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 child delegates aged between 10 and 12 from all

and their solutions mainly in the fields of wildlife, wastes and
their recycling and media's role in the environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"One of the aims of the conference is to give children of the
world a forum to discuss environmental issues of concern to them
and an opportunity to present those concerns to a wider
audience," Theodore Oben, a senior UNEP officer, said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
By drawing attention of governments, environmental groups,
citizens and the media to environmental problems, children hope

against further devastation, the UNEP noted.
</P>
<P>
The children will also discuss activities since the 1995
International Children's Conference held in Britain and make
preparations for the next conference which has been scheduled
also in Britain from May 22 to 24, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia on Right Track to Economic Recovery, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is indeed on the
right track toward economic recovery but its efforts are not only
aimed at regaining the growth it had enjoyed in the past,
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to create a development framework that will create
a new society, combining the emergence of private and public
sectors, both operating within a strengthened, legal, and
administrative framework that will ensure transparency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Indonesian Forum here on Thursday, Ginandjar said
the government realizes that economic growth would be useless
unless it creates an educated and healthy society which could
actively participate in the country's economic and political life
and unless there is an even distribution of the fruits of
development.
</P>
<P>
The two-day forum was attended by the World Bank's country
director for Indonesia Dennis de Tray and hundreds of Indonesian
and foreign businessmen as well as politicians.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said the riots and lootings that broke out in the
city last week did not affect the economy as could be seen from
the strengthening of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah continued to strengthen from 7,775 to the U.S.
dollar Wednesday last week to 7,700 to the U.S. dollar Wednesday
this week.
</P>
<P>
He said the government continues to focus on economic recovery
through a reform package that includes bank restructuring.
</P>
<P>
"Recapitalizing our banks is among our highest priorities," he
said, adding that the country's private sector debt should be
settled soon.
</P>
<P>
He urged creditors to negotiate a reasonable settlement but
debtors must also offer an honest appraisal of the value of their
assets and expected revenues.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar also said that the country is pinning its hope on the
commitment of the Chinese government not to devalue the Chinese
yuan, on the commitment of the Japanese government to continue
assisting crisis-hit nations, and on the commitment of Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) leaders to help Asia
overcome its recession.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dennis de Tray said the economic crisis that
Indonesia has been facing has been compounded by the drought and
forest fires that hit some parts of the archipelago last year.
</P>
<P>
Asked how Indonesia would step toward economic recovery, he
said the country needs more open dialogues between the various
sectors of society so that everyone could agree on how to rebuild
the economy.
</P>
<P>
The country also needs to lay a strong political foundation
that would support economic recovery, he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Vows to End Communal Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian leader General
Abdulsalami Abubakar has vowed to bring a final resolution of
bloody communal clashes in parts of the country by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the assurance Wednesday in Ibadan after
attending the 50th anniversary of the University of Ibadan,
according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
"We shall try to mediate to ensure that peace returns to these
areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is very unfortunate that brothers and sisters who
have been living together peacefully for many years are killing
one another.
</P>
<P>
The government has resolved to solve the problems in these
areas once and for all, he added.
</P>
<P>
Communal clashes between different ethnic groups have led to
huge loss of lives and properties in several parts of Nigeria in
recent times.
</P>
<P>
In the southwestern state of Osun, the relocation of the Ife
East Local Government has sparked off continued clashes between
the Ife and Modakeke peoples since last August.
</P>
<P>
In Delta State, the relocation of the Warri South Local
Government caused bloody clashes between the Ijaw and Itshekiri
peoples in late October, resulting in scores of deaths and
torching of many houses.
</P>
<P>
As communal clashes spread, some people accused the military
government of deliberately ignoring them so as to creat barriers
to the success of the ongoing transition to civil rule program.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Promises Clean, Fair Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Thursday reaffirmed his government's commitment to holding
a clean, fair and democratic general election which the
international community is free to observe.
</P>
<P>
"Through this election, we will see which force would get the
people's support and which would not," Habibie told the 350
Indonesian and foreign participants of the Indonesian Forum whom
he received at the State Palace here.
</P>
<P>
The president said his government will invite observers from
the United Nations Development Program, the United States,
Germany, France, Japan and Australia to see for themselves if
Indonesia's general election is held democratically.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Internal Affairs Syarwan Hamid said that
the Bill on Politics, which is being deliberated in the House of
Representatives (DPR), would be passed into law by the end of
January 1999, making the next general election be undertaken no
sooner than in mid-June 1999.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that it will need at least four months after
the sanctioning of the law on politics that a general election can
be undertaken. It will be difficult to hold election earlier
because there are many preparations to do," Syarwan told reporters
here on Thursday following a limited cabinet meeting on politics
and security.
</P>
<P>
The preparations include the forming of an Election Committee
and the selection of political parties which are eligible to
contest in the election.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Ends Up, Buoyed by Retail Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Buoyant retail stocks and a
stronger lead from Wall Street propelled the Australian
sharemarket higher, brokers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index finished 11.9 points higher
at 2,680.6, below its intra-day high of 2,685.7.
</P>
<P>
"A more confident close from Wall Street overnight put the
Australian market in a more positive frame today," said Morgan
Stockbroking client adviser Simon Reed.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index in New York picked up
54.83 points to 9,041.11, after the Federal Reserve easing
monetary policy late the day before.
</P>
<P>
Asian markets provided little directional cues with the Nikkei
in Japan closing down 244.77 points at 14,354.46, just off the low
of 14,354.41 points.
</P>
<P>
"Asian markets are pretty quiet today. Most of our direction
came from Wall Street," Reed said.
</P>
<P>
Coles Myer was the stand-out performer among retail stocks,
gaining 36 cents or 4.82 percent to 7.83 Australian dollars
following hints of a possible share buyback and a rosy profit
forecast by chairman Stan Wallis at Thursday's annual general
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Woolworths also benefited from the more bullish outlook for
retail generally, stacking on 19.3 cents, while Harvey Norman
added 10 and David Jones firmed four cents as well.
</P>
<P>
Cable &AMP; Wireless Optus firmed one on volume of 118.1 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
Shares in rival telco group Telstra surged 17 cents, Qantas
shed 3.1.
</P>

performance from the "Big Four" players.
</P>
<P>
Westpac added six, Commonwealth gained 7.4, ANZ remained steady
at 9.95 Australian dollars, while NAB went ex-dividend, shedding
9.3.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the industrial index climbed 28.4 points to 4,715.7
and the all resources index eased 3.1 to 1037.0.
</P>
<P>
Among diversified miners BHP dropped 16, Rio Tinto tumbled 26,
WMC fell four and MIM eased two cents.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Hits Six-Month Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
cannoned forward to hit six-month highs Thursday, with enthusiasm
attributed to Australia's internationally competitive interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
The local currency surged more than 1.5 U.S. cents, buoyed by
the Reserve Bank of Australia's failure to ease interest rates in
the wake of a cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
It hit a high of 64.78 U.S. cents, and traded during the day
between 64.27 and 64.52, before closing at 64.46 U.S. cents, up
from 63.15 at Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
As well as the favorable interest rate differential, traders
said U.S. hedge fund buying also spurred the Australian dollar
higher.
</P>
<P>
IBJ foreign exchange dealer Scott Lewis said the large move
higher by the Australian dollar was the result of aggressive U.S.
hedge fund buying in offshore markets Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve Wednesday lowered its fed funds rate
for the third time in seven weeks to 4.75 percent from 5.00
percent.
</P>
<P>
As well, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand also indicated an
easing in monetary policy and Wednesday night the Bank of Canada
cut rates by 25 basis points. The call loan target band now stands
at 4.75 to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the Reserve Bank of Australia has not moved on rates,
having last reduced them on July 30, 1997, by 50 basis points to
5.00 percent.
</P>
<P>
This means the interest rate differential with the U.S. is now
in Australia's favor, a situation beneficial to the Australian
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the cross rates the Australian dollar was buying
78.50 Japanese yen from 76.59 and 1.0805 German marks from 1.0531.

<HEADLINE> Gold Demand in India Decreases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Gold demand in India was
"less lively" during July-September 1998 after exceptionally
buoyant growth in the first two quarters, apparently dampened by
economic problems, according to World Gold Council (WGC) sources
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At 171.8 tons, demand fell eight percent below the record level
of the third quarter of 1997, but remained substantially higher
than the the third quarter demand in earlier years.
</P>
<P>
Demand in the 25 key markets in the country for gold
consumption monitored by WGC totaled 1,712.2 tons in the first
three quarters of 1998, which was down by 20 percent compared with
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Tensions with Pakistan and the effect of sanctions, imposed
following India's nuclear tests in May this year, along with
domestic political uncertainties have hit confidence, WGC said.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of rupee (Indian currency) since the beginning
of the year and a rise in general import tariffs caused a surge in
prices of basic foodstuffs draining consumer purchasing power, it
said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Stresses Agriculture in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 19 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has urged local governments in the country to
eradicate poverty by developing agriculture as the top priority,
a government press release said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa told officials at a meeting in northern city of Moshi
Wednesday that new farming methods must be adopted to promote
production in agriculture, the backbone of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture has not been of great help to peasants as a means
for eradicating poverty, hence leaving the majority of Tanzanians
without assured food supply," he said when opening the 14th
general meeting of the Association of Local Authorities in
Tanzania (ALAT).
</P>
<P>
The president asked the officials to stimulate agriculture and
livestock production by providing basic social services and
making bylaws regarding land policy, environmental protection,
proper use of seeds and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa blamed some local organs for being busy only with tax
collection while ignoring the fact that underfed Tanzanians could
not be good tax payers.
</P>
<P>
"It is only through revamped agriculture that the majority of
tax payers will be able to improve their standard of life and
fight the prevailing poverty in the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Good governance will be a meaningless concept if majority of
Tanzanians lead a miserable life," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa urged ALAT leaders to strengthen democratic practices
toward people-oriented development in all aspects of life.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed fears that the wide development
disparities emerging among various regions and districts in the
country could endanger the national unity.
</P>
<P>
"Fresh steps must be taken to rectify this development gap,"
he warned. "Stern legal measures will also be taken against any
unscrupulous officials."

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Surge Up on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Share prices surged up on
Singapore Stock Market Thursday as expectations were building up
for further local interest rates cut.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI), propelled by banking
and property stocks, jumped by 44.85 points to a half-year new
high of 1316.55 points, breaching the 1,300-point level for the
second time in the month.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover rose to 443.08 million units worth 831.49
million Singapore dollars (about 509.80 million U.S. dollars).
Gainers outstripped losers by 253 to 44 with 121 counters
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
KepLand was the most active stock that had 32.95 million units
traded. KepBank was the second most heavily traded stock with
28.08 million shares done. Wing T was next with 25.93 million
counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
UOB F led the ascent of the day as it rose by 120 cents to
close at 12.70 Singapore dollars. CityDev gained 100 cents to
finish at 7.85 Singapore dollars. C&AMP;C rose by 75 cents to close
at 5.55 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Robinson was the biggest loser of the day as
it lost 15 cents to finish at 5.00 Singapore dollars. Asean
retreated 10 cents to close at 5.10 U.S. dollars. Creative 50 and
SIA 200 also slid off 10 cents and they ended at 23.30 and 6.25
Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said international investors resumed buying amid hopes
for another one percentage point cut in local banks prime lending
rate to around five percent from the current six percent. The
strength of STI's ascent partly driven by foreign buying has
baffled many players, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Hopes that a stimulus package could help revive the Japanese
economy is also a factor helping raise the market sentiment,
dealers added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sets up Small, Medium-Scale Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has set up a
small and medium-scale industry (SMI) Rehabilitation Fund to help
competitive SMIs facing non-performing loan problems.
</P>
<P>
An initial allocation of 750 million ringgit (about 197.368
million U.S. dollars) would be provided by the government to the
fund, which would be financed and managed by Bank Negara (State
Bank or Central Bank), Malaysia's Second Finance Minister Mustapa
Mohamed announced here Thursday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa said Bank Negara Malaysia would channel the fund at a
rate of one percent per annum in order to encourage the
disbursement of the loans by participating banking institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the fund carries an interest rate of no more than five
percent per annum and a maximum repayment period of seven years.
</P>
<P>
He said the maximum amount loan to be offered is 5 million
ringgit (about 1.315 million dollars) and a minimum of 50,000
ringgit (about 13,054 dollars).
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Frontier Town Becomes Trade Center on Sino-Russian Border (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today there is still some European-style architecture among
the modern buildings, which have witnessed the city's changes.
</P>
<P>
A government official said that in the 1960s and 70s,
the city was poor and its economy grew slowly. But, he
noted, with the improvement of Sino-Russian relations in the
1980s, historical changes have taken place fast.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Guo said that after border trade between China and
Russia resumed in 1987, Shuifenhe has gradually become one of the
international trade centers in North China. At present, about
1,500 tourists a day travel from the city to Russia, and more than
4,000 tons of goods are shipped across the border.
</P>
<P>
He said the city has become a bridge to the East Asia Economic
Zone.
</P>
<P>
"Although our city is small, it likes to catch up on new
trends," he said. There are six cars for every 100 residents in
the city, 32 telephones and a dozen mobile phones, and this year
more than 200 households became Internet users.
</P>
<P>
He said that an international helicopter port is under
construction and a special trade zone for the free entry of
Chinese and Russian businessmen is being planned by the city.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- David Shayler, the renegade former MI5 officer wanted in
Britain for allegedly leaking secrets to a newspaper, was freed from
jail Wednesday after a French court rejected Britain's bid to
extradite him.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Momentum towards the creation of a pan-European stock exchange
to trade blue-chip stocks accelerated Wednesday when the Madrid and
Milan bourses said they wanted to join the planned London-Frankfurt
link-up.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair's plans for a new voting
system for June's European elections were thrown into chaos
Wednesday night after peers inflicted a fifth and final defeat on
the Government in the dying hours of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States attacked Japan for an "inexcusable" failure
of leadership at the Asia-Pacific economic summit Wednesday as

official visit to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Most Chinese Villages Enjoy Financial Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The farmers of Qianyu Village
in east China's Fujian Province used to spend a lot of their time
appealing to higher authorities for suspected financial
wrongdoings on the part of their village leaders.
</P>
<P>
But things have changed since the village adopted a system a
few years ago that makes financial management public. Under the
new system, all villagers now enjoy the right to know about the
village's financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to this financial democracy, the Qianyu villagers now
experience fewer disputes and greater concord, which has led to
faster development for the village.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the village achieved 420 million yuan in gross
domestic product and 5,300 yuan in per-capita income, more than
double the figures before the adoption of the new system.
</P>
<P>
Like Qianyu, about 80 percent of the country's nearly one
million villages have introduced new financial management
patterns, according to a Ministry of Agriculture official.
</P>
<P>
These moves are part of a national effort to implement a system
of self-governance for villagers, granting villagers democratic
rights to elect and supervise village leaders and decide village
management, the official said,
</P>
<P>
Under this system, the village leadership is obliged to publish
financial reports regularly.
</P>
<P>
In some villages, special groups have been elected by villagers
to examine and verify revenues and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Transparent management of financial affairs has proved
effective both for boosting the standardization of village
financial affairs and preventing corruption, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Shangqiu in Henan Province, around 180 million
yuan in village funds was found to have been skimmed off when the
new system was adopted, and so far, most of this lost money has
been recovered.
</P>
<P>
The city of Kaiping in Guangdong Province used to be plagued by
conflict between villagers and their leaders, but now there have
been no reports from villagers accusing their leaders of financial
misconducts for the past five years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Arrives in Japan for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrived here Thursday afternoon on a two-day visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is expected to meet with Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi on Friday, will urge Tokyo to achieve domestic
demand-led growth and cite the importance of Tokyo's financial
stabilization measures, and market opening and deregulation,
Japanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi will brief him on Japan's new economic stimulus package
worth 24 trillion yen (about 196.7 billion U.S. dollars), and his
recent visit to Moscow, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Another likely issue will be the stationing of U.S. forces in
Japan, particularly a plan to relocate the U.S. Marine Corps'
Futemma Air Station in Ginowan, Okinawa Prefecture, as a condition
for closing the base in 5-7 years.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also exchange views on some international
and regional issues, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Clinton is also scheduled to meet Japanese
Emperor Akihito and hold a town hall meeting with Japanese people
aged 21-45 with an aim to reach out Japanese next generation
leaders.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, Clinton will leave for a visit to South
Korea, the second leg of his two-nation Asian tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 3,073 South Korean
drug users were arrested in the first 10 months of this year, 33.7
percent more than the same period of 1997, said the National
Police Agency Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the number of users of philopon, an addictive
Japanese drug, surged by 43.4 percent over a year earlier to 1,891.
</P>
<P>
The agency attributed the increase of drug users to economic
hardships which started gripping the country late last year and to
lower prices of drugs.

<HEADLINE> New Wedding Style Challenges Old Custom in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Mass wedding is becoming a
new life style in the Terai plain, the southern belt of Nepal
where a dowry system has been prevailing for years.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu Post daily said Thursday that a Nepal National
Marwari Mass Wedding Center had been formed in the Marwari
community in the border city of Birganj. The center discourages
the dowry system, which is usually a nightmare for the poor
families with several daughters.
</P>
<P>
Under Nepal's dowry system, the bride is required to bring with
her an amount of wealth as a dowry to the groom's family. Brides
with a humble dowry are often reported to be abused. In the
indigenous communities in Terai, the birth of a daughter is
regarded as a curse while the birth of a son is seen as a boon.
</P>
<P>
Of late, the center arranged a mass wedding ceremony for 39
couples, in which it provided clothes and jewelry to both the
brides and grooms. It spent 25,000 rupees (about 400 U.S. dollars)
on each couple from donations.
</P>
<P>
"This is to discourage disparity. We don't want rich
participants to display their wealth and make poor ones feel
inferior," the organizer was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
All the married couples are said to be living happily, the
English-language paper reported.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the center Tara Chand Kedia said that
those interested young people should first fill in a form and pay
100 rupees (about 1.6 dollars), then submit their bio-data and
personal preferences, they are entitled to participate in the
center's activities.
</P>
<P>
When women and men have selected their partners, the center
will seek the permission from their respective parents. After
that, the two are introduced and given two weeks to acquaint with
each other. During this period, the center begins to investigate
their backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
Even after they got married, the center continues to keep in
touch with them to inquire about their well-being.
</P>
<P>
Such a wedding is good for women, Kedia said. "We make the
groom sign a guarantee that he will not harm the woman after
marriage," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The system of mass wedding is a very good start," a local
resident said. "It is free from frivolities and also economical."

<HEADLINE> South Korean Stocks Up 4.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Seoul stocks jumped 4.1
percent on Thursday due to renewed foreign buying in the wake of
United States' interest rate cut and a rebound in futures and
program-related buying.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Premier to Meet Mandela in Cape Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Prime Minister
Pakalitha Mosisili left Maseru Thursday morning for a meeting
with South African President Nelson Mandela in Cape Town, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted Lesotho government officials as saying
that the meeting will focus on bilateral issues between the two
countries, and that the two leaders are also expected to discuss
political developments in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho opposition alliance, accusing the government of
harassment, Monday suspended talks with the Mosisili
administration and Southern African Development Community (SADC)
mediators.
</P>
<P>
The SADC mediators said Thursday that it remains convinced
that the Lesotho government and opposition parties are still
committed to the launch of the interim political authority (IPA)
tasked to prepare for fresh elections due within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's spokesman, Ronnie
Mamoepa, said: "In this regard, the Lesotho government and
opposition parties have expressed their wish to see the launch of
the IPA take place sooner than later."
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the IPA was agreed upon after difficult
negotiations between the Lesotho government and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Trouble in the mountainous kingdom started in early August
when opposition supporters began camping outside the royal palace
in capital Maseru to protest against the results of the May 23
general election.
</P>
<P>
The unrest boiled up to a major political crisis in September
and ultimately led to military intervention by SADC forces.

<HEADLINE> Philippines May Receive 5 billion Dollars of Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada will return home from Kuala Lumpur Thursday afternoon with
concrete commitments of financial aid amounting to 5 billion U.S.
dollars from developed economies that attended an Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' informal meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to a Philippine News Agency report, the potential aid
will be released out of the Miyazawa initiative and the financial
aid is set to be released by the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Miyazawa Fund was an initiative of the Japanese government
to set 30 billion dollars in financial aid to help rehabilitate
the economy of the countries hit by the Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Japan-U.S. initiative binds both countries to
raise another 10 billion dollars to help restructure APEC members'
banking and the corporate sectors with huge non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
From these two funds, the agency said, the Philippines is
expected to get a total of 5 billion dollars of aid.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted President Estrada as saying that the amount
of aid should be enough to get the "ball rolling in our country."

<HEADLINE> Iran Pessimistic About Future Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran expressed pessimism about
future oil prices before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) ministers gather in Vienna next week to explore
ways to deal with oil price slump.
</P>
<P>
"With a decrease in oil production cost in industrial states,
no increase can be forecast for oil prices on world markets in the
future, except under unexpected situations like war or
revolution," a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Hojatollah Ghanimifard, a department director of the National
Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) made the remark at a quarterly meeting
of the National Iranian Energy Committee, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ghanimifard said the production cost of each barrel of crude
oil has considerably dropped over the past two decades as a result
of technological and scientific progress.
</P>
<P>
In certain Western industrial countries, the cost has decreased
to about 4.5 U.S. dollars per barrel in recent years from 12
dollars per barrel in the 1970s, he said.
</P>
<P>
The cost of oil production still continues to decline and
therefore traditional oil producers can no longer expect to
receive economic privilege, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that other factors like intervention of monetary
institutions and certain international oil companies also have
passive impacts on oil prices.
</P>
<P>
No considerable surge can be predicted for the oil prices in
the near future as long as the economic crisis in Southeast Asia
continues, Ghanimifard said.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices plunged again following the easing of tension
between Iraq and the United Nations over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts believe that the OPEC ministerial meeting next
week will not help in finding ways to recover the sluggish oil
prices, as many of the OPEC members, including Iran, are against
further cuts of output.

<HEADLINE> Frontier Town Becomes Trade Center on Sino-Russian Border (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harbin, November 19 (Xinhua) - With the improvement of Sino-
Russian relations, the city of Shuifenhe in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province has evolved from a frontier outpost in a
remote region into a bustling border trade center.
</P>
<P>
This small city of 42,000 permanent residents is now home to
more than 50,000 migrant retailers. Despite the cold weather, the
markets are full of goods and people and outside of stores,
bargaining over prices and exchanges rates of yuan and rubles can
be heard.
</P>
<P>
At the railway station, Russian and Chinese businessmen with
packs and bags crowd together, waiting for trains to cross the
Sino-Russian border.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, the city is brightly lit and on the major
streets dancing bars with names like "Night Paris" entertain
customers till early morning.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, a total of 6-billion-yuan worth of vegetables, meat,
shoes and socks, and other daily necessities were sold from local
Shuifenhe markets to Russia, said Guo Xiaohua, secretary of the
City Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
"Our city appeals not only to Russian businessmen from the
region around Fuladiswosituke, but also to those from as far away
as Moscow," Guo said, adding "it has become the largest market at
the Sino-Russian border."
</P>
<P>
Shuifenhe was established in the early part of the century when
a trans-border railroad was built.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Leader Stresses Importance of Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's communist party chief
Le Kha Phieu said Thursday that agricultural and rural development
is of strategic importance for Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the third national congress of the Vietnam Farmers'
Association (VFA) which opened here this morning, the general
secretary praised the results of Vietnam's agricultural renovation
policy, especially the achievements in food production, which can
now supply sufficient food for domestic consumption, national
reserve and export, while only some years ago the country still
had to import food.
</P>
<P>
Industrialization of agriculture and rural areas is closely
combined with the development of the multi-sectorial economy, in
which each sector has its own position and role, and is encouraged
to develop along socialist orientation in close and interactive
relations, said the party chief.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also said that exercise of rural democratic rules
has become an urgent requirement to create a motive force for
development and ensure unity and happiness for rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Statistical Services in Africa Need Support: ECA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) said here Thursday that the
statistical services in Africa need support and pledged its
continued assistance.
</P>
<P>
In a press release marking this years' African Statistics Day
which falls on November 18, the ECA said it will continue to
assist in coordinating statistical development within the
framework of the Coordinating Committee on African Statistical
Development.
</P>
<P>
The ECA is aimed to increase the public awareness of the
important role of statistics in the socio-economic development of
the African continent.
</P>
<P>
It said that statistical information has a crucial role to
play in the achievement of sustainable social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Regular, reliable and complete statistical information is
indispensable for research, sound decision-making, and in the
planning of economic and social development, it added.
</P>
<P>
However, the ECA noted that since the mid-1980s, most
countries in Africa have experienced a major decline in budgetary
resources allocated to support statistical activities.
</P>
<P>
With a view to reversing the negative trend, the Conference of
African Ministers adopted in May 1990 the Addis Ababa Plan of
Action for Statistical Development in Africa responsible for
planning and economic development in a bid to achieve national
self-sufficiency in statistical production by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Important progress has been achieved in the area of
statistical production and data quality, said the ECA.
</P>
<P>
But, it noted that national statistical offices in Africa
still face three challenges:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, how to meet the needs of both the public and private
sectors for timely, accurate and reliable statistical
information;
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the need for greater client focus and responsiveness
to be able to respond rapidly to changing information needs;
</P>
<P>
And thirdly, how to exploit and harness the new information
and communication technologies to provide reliable information in
cost-effective manner.
</P>
<P>
The ECA said that it will continue to assist in capacity
building at the national level in the areas of policy advocacy,
consensus building, harmonization of statistical classifications,
standards and methods.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the African Statistics Day this year is
"harnessing information for development."

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed lower in Tokyo
Thursday despite indications that the banking sector is forging ahead
with plans to boost their capital bases with the help of public funds.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 244.77 points, or 1.68
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 14,354.46.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 9.42 points or 0.85 percent to 1,104.00.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section was heavy at an estimated 515 million
shares, up from Wednesday's 477.90 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Aoki was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Bank shares rose initially on reports that 15 of Japan's 18 major
banks are ready to ask for a combined 4-7 trillion yen (about 32.8
billion dollars-57.4 billion dollars) in public funds to strengthen
capital bases.
</P>
<P>
But the sector ended marginally lower and analysts pointed out that
bank stocks have already rebounded strongly from their lows in
September and October.
</P>
<P>
A sharp afternoon drop in Nikkei 225 futures prices also helped to
depress stock prices, traders noted. In Osaka, the near-term December
contract fell 110 points to 14,360.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,345 issues listed on the First Section, losers surpassed
gainers 659 to 492, with 142 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> PNG Trade Unions Threaten National Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Trade union movement in Papua
New Guinea (PNG) Thursday threatened to invoke a nationwide strike
unless the PNG government under Prime Minister Bill Skate rescinds
a decision made in its 1999 budget this week to abolish key
industrial relations bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Papua New Guinea Trade Union Congress, which represents
70,000 workers, said that the government's move to scrap various
industrial tribunals, boards and councils was "anti-democratic"
and the start of persecution against trade unionists.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget papers released Monday, the Skate
government plans to abolish the Minimum Wages Board, the
Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Tribunal, the Office of
the Industrial Registrar, the National Training Council and the
National Tripartite Consultative Council.
</P>
<P>
"It amounts to confrontation ... it amounts to human rights
abuse," PNG Trade Union Congress acting general secretary Clemence
Kanau told the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"We want the government to retract what they have done and
provide (the industrial bodies) more funding."
</P>
<P>
Kanau said the congress would consider serious industrial
action, including calling for a national strike.
</P>
<P>
"We have the capacity to shut down the mines, the ports, banks
and communications," Kanau said.
</P>
<P>
The congress claims that the abolition of the industrial bodies
will result in no protection of wages, conditions and workers'
rights; no security of employment; and no trade union rights for
workers.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Impose Fishing Ban from December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Ministry of
Agriculture, Food and Fisheries will next month close all major
rivers for three months from commercial fishing to enable fish to
breed, a fisheries official has said.
</P>
<P>
The move is to enable fish to eat more, breed and grow quickly
in the period from December to next February, Times of Zambia
newspaper Thursday quoted Fred Kafumbe, provincial fisheries
official from northern Luanpula Province, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some rivers such as Kafue, Bangweulu and Lower Zambezi will
close from December 1, this year.
</P>
<P>
Kafumbe said Wednesday that in this period, fish can receive
much food in form of organic matter from land surfaces which
nutrients are dragged by running water into rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
He said that fishing areas bordering other countries will
remain open except for one along the Zambia-Congo (K) border,
where an agreement has been signed between the two governments to
close the fisheries at this time.
</P>
<P>
The fishing areas that will remain open are Lusiwasi in
Serenje of Lower Luangwa, and Lake Kariba which is shared with
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Kafumbe said that even in these areas, fishermen would be
advised to obtain certificates of origin of fish before being
allowed to sell their catch.
</P>
<P>
And those who import fish from abroad would be requested to
get necessary papers from Zambian customs and health offices
before they are granted permission to sell.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Set up Body Organs Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A body organs bank is to be set
up in Iran to meet the need of organs transplants, head of Iran's
Charity Foundation for Special Diseases (CFSD) Fatemeh Hashemi has
announced.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the official news agency IRNA, Hashemi said that
her foundation is going through the preliminary stages of the
project, including compiling information from the people in need
of body organs and volunteers for donating organs.
</P>
<P>
"The bank will continuously be in touch with the hospitals to
learn of the cases of brain-death and thus to arrange for timely
performance of organ transplants," she said.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi said that the practice of obtaining organs from a
brain-dead body for transplants started in Iran in 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, body transplants has not become a widely used practice
in the country and there is no particular organization in charge
of the issue, she said.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi also announced that a seminar on "Brain-death and Organ
Transplants" will be held here next week to discuss the subject
from religious, legal, practical and medical point of views.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is to arrive at practical guidelines for organ
donations and transplants, which have been authorized by the
country's religious leaders, she said.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi said her foundation is seeking laws to govern organ
donations and transplants in the country and to that end, it is
preparing proposals on the subject for submission to the medical
committee of the Majlis, or parliament, for approval.
</P>
<P>
She also highlighted the need for an education program to
inform the public of the definition of brain-death and to get
home the message that in case of a brain-death, decided by a team
of medical experts, there is no more hope of life.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, secretary of the foundation Baqer Larijani said
that the common practice of receiving hearts, kidneys and livers
from living individuals has not been enough to address all the
organ needs in the country.
</P>
<P>
To cover all the people in need of organ transplants, he said,
receiving organs from the dead should also become a common
practice.
</P>
<P>
The CFSD is currently extending services to people suffering
from hemophilia, thalassemia and kidney diseases, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
The foundation last year arranged for 1,150 cases of kidney
transplants in the country and the number is expected to reach
1,300 this year.

<HEADLINE> Late President's Legacy Still Valuable for China: Officials (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) - Late Chinese President Liu
Shaoqi's theories on building the Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
and his thoughts on economics and the construction of a democratic
legal system are still of guiding significance for today's China,
top officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a Standing Committee member of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and two former officials, Gu
Mu and Wang Hanbin, made these comments here today.
</P>
<P>
They were speaking at the opening ceremony of a five-day
symposium on the life and thought of the late Chinese
president. Hu Jintao, State vice president, also attended the
meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Liu was acclaimed for having "performed acts of undeniable merit
in the cause of the Chinese revolution and construction." He was
the first chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee and later served as President of the State. But he died
as a result of political persecution on November 12, 1969.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that Liu expounded the position and role of Mao Zedong
and his thoughts in the Chinese Communist Revolution, and made
historic contributions to the establishment of Mao Zedong Thoughts
as guiding principles of the Party.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Stress Development of Aquiculture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Zeng Chengkui, an outstanding
academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said recently
that resolving the issue of grain in China will rely on the full
use of marine resources and the development of what he termed
"blue agriculture".
</P>
<P>
Zeng, a famous oceanologist, explained that blue agriculture
can also be referred to marine agriculture, or the development and
processing of aquatic products and marine husbandry.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that China's maritime breeding industry will have
the capability of producing 40 million tons annually in 20-30
years if developed properly, or twice the current annual quota for
imported grain.
</P>
<P>
"Who Will Feed China", a book written by American author Lester
Brown and issued in 1995, points out that the nation currently
imports some 20 million tons of grain annually. However, according
to Brown, the volume required when China's population hits 1.6
billion by the year 2030 has not as yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
Brown says in the book that no country in the world will have
enough extra grain to feed China.
</P>
<P>
The American scholar's view not only sparked strong
repercussions in China's political and academic circles, but also
attracted worldwide attention concerning the safety of China's
grain problem.
</P>
<P>
"This is indeed a real problem for China," said Zeng, adding
that grain is an international issue and oceanologists should
table their views on the use of marine organisms.

<P>
He enumerated Liu's important principles on Party work, which
he said are of great realistic significance for today's building
of the CPC. These principles are:
</P>
<P>
-- The political party in power must pay attention to the
education, management, and supervision of its members, especially
its leading officials;
</P>
<P>
-- Leading officials must strengthen their confidence with
Communism, always put the interests of the people at the top of
all their priorities, and whole-heartedly serve the people;
</P>
<P>
-- The "special privilege" mentality must be criticized and
rooted out, as well as the tendency to treat the people as
subjects and bureaucratic practices.
</P>
<P>
Liu also gave comprehensive explanations of the working rules
of democratic centralization concerning Party work, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Studying and learning Liu's ideas are conducive to the
anti-corruption drive within the Party and will help improve the
leadership role of the Party, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gu and Wang served as vice premier and vice chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress,
respectively. Gu said that in the era when political campaigns
overwhelmed all others, Liu was persistent in proposing that the
Party should focus on economic construction after the founding of
New China, and China must steadily develop its economy on the
basis of the realities.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hanbin said that the first NPC Standing Committee
promulgated some 80 laws and decrees, and laid foundations for the
legal framework of New China. Liu's words on democracy and the
rule of law should also be remembered today.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Stress Development of Aquiculture (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oceans, which cover as high as 71 percent of the earth's
surface, are filled with abundant organism resources, a major
source of protein for human beings.
</P>
<P>
However, Zeng warned that natural conditions place limits on
aquatic resources and stressed that people should actively develop
marine breeding and cultivation to supplement agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China leads the world with annual aquatic output of over seven
million tons. The nation's output of artificially-bred sea fish
stands at 200,000 tons, with the output for freshwater fish
exceeding nine million million tons.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said China can score a major breakthrough by breeding sea
fish and developing blue agriculture. He also pointed out that
China has vast potential to increase its output of shellfish and
marine plants.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that governments at various levels and collectives
should expand efforts to develop aquiculture in bays, with the
exception of bays used as commercial ports.
</P>
<P>
Zeng stressed that attention should be paid to protecting the
marine environment while developing maritime agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Urges to Promote Southern African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has called upon all governmments and other social partners
in southern African countries to play an active role in promoting
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Launching preparations for the third Southern African
International Dialog (SAID) Wednesday evening, Mugabe said all
social partners including politicians, civil servants,
entrepreneurs, corporate leaders, management, labor and ordinary
citizens should play their roles in promoting regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Each group has different roles to play according to its
circumstances," he said.
</P>
<P>
The third SAID is due to be held in Zimbabwe's resort town of
Victoria Fall from October 3 to 6 next year.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe stressed the importance of harmony or smart partnership
in regional coopeation, saying it is "indeed a process that
unites people in growing prosperity." "It is from this
togetherness and oneness that prosperity will grow," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Although each year our countries face different problems,
smart partnerships offer the most efficacious way to realize
mutual benefit through cooperative endeavor within the global
environment," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
SAID is a forum which brings together representatives of
southern African governments, businesses, labor unions and civil
societies and encourages them to tackle issues of wealth
generation and development in the spirit of smart partnership.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean president noted that further regional and
international cooperation ensuing the first SAID meeting in
Kasane, Botswana, last year will enable the region to participate
in the global economy from a much informed and stronger position.
</P>
<P>
The Kasane meeting was followed up by SAID 1998 held in
Namibia, last July at which the governments, the private sector,
labor and civil society in the region agreed to create
opportunities and generate wealth that will be mutually and
equally shared in a sustainable manner.

<HEADLINE> Genes of Ancient Chinese Extracted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Japanese
geneticists today extracted some DNA samples from ancient Chinese
who lived some 3,000 years ago and whose remains were
excavated in Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The gene samples were collected from the teeth of more than 100
people who lived in the Yin Dynasty, and this is considered
helpful for the study of the evolution of human genes and the
migrations of ancient people.
</P>
<P>
Tang Biaoxian, an archeologist with the Archeological Research
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), said
that a large number of bones have been unearthed in the burial
grounds of the ancient Yin people.
</P>
<P>
He said that artifacts including a palace, workshops,
inscriptions on bones and tortoise shells, bronze ware and jade
articles also suggest that this Bronze Age civilization was quite
developed in Anyang, capital of the Yin Dynasty, which lasted
about 270 years.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still many mysteries concerning the remains
of the Yin Dynasty, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jin Feng of the Genetics Research Institute of the CASS,
said that the gene samples will be used for statistical analysis
using a sophisticated computer system, and the data will be
compared with the genetic makeup of modern humans.
</P>
<P>
The remains of the Yin Dynasty were first discovered in the
city of Anyang in 1928, already renowned for its ancient
inscriptions on bones and tortoise shells.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Survey Shows 1998 as Year of Megadeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Led by remarkable surges
in mergers and acquisitions (M&AMP;A) involving U.S. purchasers and
targets, global M&AMP;A activity during the first three quarters of
1998 surpassed the full-year record set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As shown by a M&AMP;A survey released Wednesday by U.S.
professional service firm KPMG, total spending on cross-border
transactions soared to 383 billion U.S. dollars worldwide in the
first three quarters, up 67 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The explosion of cross-border M&AMP;A spending is being triggered
by "megadeals" in almost every sector of industry, said KPMG.
</P>
<P>
KPMG defines megadeals as deals in which the purchase spending
is at least one billion dollars. The largest 1998 cross-border
megadeal thus far has been the purchase of automaker Chrysler of
the United States by Daimler-Benz of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Megadeal purchasers spent 229 billion dollars on 61
cross-border targets during the first three quarters this year,
more than tripling the amount spent on 35 cross-border megadeals
during the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As investors in global debt and equity markets have fled
developing countries during 1998, the new trend of cross-border
megadeals has shifted to the world's more advanced economies, said
KPMG.
</P>
<P>
Targeting on Asian firms dropped modestly in the first three
quarters, and spending on targets in all major developing
countries except Brazil dropped sharply.
</P>
<P>
Underscoring this trend is a doubling in cross-border M&AMP;A
spending targeting firms in the European Union (EU), to 180
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Further, KPMG said U.S. businesses have again become the engine
for global M&AMP;A. Fifty-six percent of all cross-border deals
spending worth of 215 billion dollars linked U.S. firms to buyers
or sellers abroad during the period.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the unprecedented 105 billion dollars spent by
foreign-based firms on U.S. targets during the period, and despite
a weakening dollar, U.S. firms accelerated their M&AMP;A spending
abroad, too. U.S. companies announced a record 110 billion dollars
of purchases elsewhere in the world, more than doubling last
year's figure.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai to Fix 46,000 Cars Sold in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Hyundai Automotive Australia,
a company set up by South Korean car giant Hyundai, announced
Thursday that it will conduct a customer service campaign in
Australia to address safety concerns with up to 46,000 of its
Excel passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
Without referring to the move as a formal recall, Hyundai said
in the southern Australian port city of Adelaide that the
Australian Federal Office of Road Safety (FORS) had approved a
plan to inspect and strengthen all Excels sold in Australia that
were built in South Korea between August 1994 and March 1996.
</P>
<P>
It said the exercise would involve the use of stainless steel
rivets to strengthen parts of the sub-frame of the cars which
could be the subject of cracking because of faulty welds.
</P>
<P>
The procedure would be carried out at no cost to car owners and
followed a detailed examination of the issue by FORS.
</P>
<P>
Safety concerns with the Excel were raised last week by the
Australian Automobile Association (AAA), which said the suspect
welds could affect the right front wheel.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai admitted 46 Excels had been repaired and another 178
fitted with preventive modifications.
</P>
<P>
But it refused to order a general recall, instead setting up a
hotline for concerned owners to ring and also promising to fix any
cars found to have problems.
</P>
<P>
The AAA and the Australian Consumers Association called on
Hyundai to recall the cars, while Australian Federal Transport
Minister John Anderson gave the company a week to prove it had
adequately dealt with the safety issue.
</P>
<P>
Doug Croker, managing director of Hyundai Automotive Australia,
said the company believed the action was appropriate to reassure
the customers about the long-term integrity of the sub-frame and
to further put their minds at ease that Hyundai would guarantee
the strengthened area for life.

<P>
The 22-year-old shuttler was banned after the anabolic steroid
Nandrolone was found in his urine samples taken at the Singapore
Open in August, a competition he won.
</P>
<P>
"Thank God because I will only serve half the usual sentence.
I feel relieved and pleaded with the PBSI's (Badminton
Association of Indonesia) efforts during the hearing last week,"
Sigit was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
An emotional Sigit also thanked his parents for their
encouragement despite the blot that now tarnishes his illustrious
career.
</P>
<P>
"They have been prepared for such a bitter decision, and yet
they still give me their full confidence," he said at the
national badminton center in East Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
PBSI vice chairman Agus Wirahadikusumah said on Tuesday the
association would file an appeal to have Sigit's punishment cut
to six months.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about the plan to appeal. But if the association

<HEADLINE> China Regulates Stamp Market to Greet UPU Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Postmaster General Liu
Liqing said that China will further regulate the stamp collection
market in order to create a sound environment for the 22nd
Conference of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) and the '99 World
Stamp Collection Exhibition to be held in Beijing next August.
</P>
<P>
The State Postal Bureau has disciplined a number of subordinate
enterprises in Guizhou, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Anhui and Beijing
for violating regulations relating to the issuance and
distribution of stamps and post cards. Five employees responsible
for the violations were dismissed from the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
This decision was announced at a national television conference
of postal bureaus in Beijing earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that in a bid to strengthen the regulation of this
market, the State Postal Bureau will severely punish enterprises
and individuals who violate the rules, and encourage those who
obey the rules and report the illicit activities of others.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government attaches great importance
to the UPU conference and the World Stamp Collection Exhibition,
and state leaders have repeatedly expressed their determination to
guarantee the success of the conference. Preparations for the
conference and exhibition are now proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the State Postal Bureau's move is a major step
taken to create favorable conditions for the conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, China's stamp collection market has been
growing steadily since the beginning of this year. Operation
revenue of the stamp collection arm of the State Postal Bureau was
6.58 billion yuan between January and October, accounting for 27
percent of the bureau's total revenue in that period.
</P>
<P>
At present, the number of people collecting stamps in China
exceeds ten million.

<HEADLINE> 4 Out of 10 Youths Have Mental Illness in NZ: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of New
Zealand's young people may be suffering from a mental illness,
the New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It said that a Christchurch health and development study
examined the prevalence and treatment of psychiatric disorders in
more than 1,000 Christchurch-born 18-year-old youths and found
more than 40 percent of them showed signs of having at least one
mental illness, though they had not necessarily received a
clinical diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
Their problems ranged from mood disorders including depression
to anxiety disorders such as panic disorders and agoraphobia,
conduct disorder, and substance abuse including alcohol abuse or
dependence, cannabis abuse or dependence, and other substance
abuse or dependence excluding nicotine dependence.
</P>
<P>
NZPA quoted study executive director Professor David Fergusson
as saying that these young people had four main types of problems:
 substance abuse (24 percent), mood disorders (22 percent),
anxiety disorders (17 percent), and conduct disorders (five
percent). Of those showing signs of mental health problems, 42
percent showed signs of having more than one psychiatric disorder.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, rates of disorder were similar overall
for males and females, but mood and anxiety disorders were more
common among young women while conduct disorders and substance
abuse were more common among young men.
</P>
<P>
Fergusson said data was gathered during interviews with the
young people and their families, and it was possible that the
figures were an exaggeration of reality.
</P>
<P>
"Even so, the study shows that symptoms of mental illness are
alarmingly common among youths," he said.
</P>
<P>
The professor urged the New Zealand Health Ministry to improve
both state and community mental health services for young people.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Gets 1.23 Million Tons of Pledged Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has so far received
food aid pledges of more than 1.23 million tons from foreign
countries after its flood earlier this year, a daily newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question in the parliament Wednesday, Food and
Agriculture Minister Motia Chowdhury said that of the total,
726,400 tons would be received as flood aid while the rest 508,117
tons would be regular aid, The New Nation said.
</P>
<P>
During the catastrophic flood period, no foodgrain was damaged
by flood water at any government godown, she added.
</P>
<P>
The government had a food reserve of more than 733,000 tons in
its hand on November 5, she told the house, apparently denying a
rumor that a possible famine would occur in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh experienced the most severe floods in a century this
year, which lasted for 10 weeks and hit two-thirds of the country
with more than 30 million people seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector was heavily hit, with 850,000 hectares
of cropland ruined and an estimated 3.5 million tons of grains
lost.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Bangladeshi government appealed in August this
year to donor countries and international agencies for food aid.
Besides, both government and private sectors have taken measures
to import 1.5 million tons of grains respectively to meet the food
shortage.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan Rating &AMP; Investment
Information Inc. has downgraded India's sovereign rating by a
notch to BBB, citing the inflexible fiscal deficit and weak
current account structure, Business Standard said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese credit rating agency said in a press statement
Wednesday that it "removed the foreign currency long-term rating
of India from the rating monitor scheme and downgraded it from
BBB+ to BBB.
</P>
<P>
It also lowered ratings for Samurai bonds issued by Oil and
Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Industrial Development Bank of
India (IDBI). ONGC and IDBI bonds have also been removed from the
rating monitor scheme and downgraded from BBB+ to BBB.
</P>
<P>
ONGC had issued Samurai bonds worth 30 billion yen while IDBI
had raised funds through two series worth 50 billion yen.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese rating agency said the downgrading reflects
India's narrowing fiscal flexibility, which could put pressure on
the government's policies on various economic issues. It also
reflects India's weakening current account structure, which has
been affected by the deteriorating external economic environment.
</P>
<P>
It said a reduction of subsidies and downsizing of the public
sector is essential to improve the fiscal position, but there are
no signs of the political leadership aiming for this.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- China's State Postal Bureau is
currently developing the world's largest multimedia network in an
effort to ensure its technological reaches international standards.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide infrastructure project for an ATM
telecommunication network covering more than 230 cities will be
completed at an estimated cost of 300-400 million yuan. The
integrated service data network will enable the bureau to monitor
the entire mail delivery process via computer.
</P>
<P>
One postal official said that the data network will help the
bureau provide new services, including automated post offices and
teller services. In combination with the low-cost postal network,
it will also expand the market for express mail and mail sales.
</P>
<P>
The ATM switches for the data network alone cost close to 20
million US dollars, and the bureau recently contracted the
U.S.-based Lucent Technologies to supply and install ATM equipment
costing several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The contract is the largest Lucent has received in China,
according to Lucent Chairman Randy Yeh. He described the contract
as a "significant and strategic win" for Lucent in the
Asia-Pacific Region and China.
</P>
<P>
Post Master General Liu Liqing said that foreign and private
express delivery companies entering the Chinese market and
electronic mail have posed a great challenge to the nation's
postal services.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has responded by allocating substantial funding to
update infrastructure, as well as to purchase motor vehicles,
railway cars and aircraft, and to develop a data network and mail
processing centers.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the bureau has also introduced electronic express mail
nationwide and has opened the country's first automated post
office in Guangzhou and the first mail sales center in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
He said that separating the postal bureau from the former
telecommunications ministry has enabled China to further open the
sector to the outside world. Liu noted that China will gradually

<HEADLINE> British Submarine Tests Cruise Missile off U.S. Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's attack submarine
HMS Splendid successfully fired a Tomahawk cruise missile 800
kilometers at a target off the California coast on Wednesday in
the first such live warhead test by Britain.
</P>
<P>
The British Embassy in Washington said two previous California
tests using nonexplosive warheads were successfully conducted from
the Splendid this month.
</P>
<P>
The Splendid, which launched the missile on Wednesday from one
of its torpedo tubes while it was submerged, is the first British
submarine equipped with the U.S.-made Tomahawk.
</P>
<P>
The satellite-guided six-meter missile popped out of the water
and sped to the island, the British Embassy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Tomahawk Land Attack Missile, or "TLAM", can be fired from
Navy cruisers, destroyers and submarines. The missile's range has
been improved since the 1991 Gulf War from 1,120 to 1,600
kilometers and is now much more accurate with a satellite guidance
system.
</P>
<P>
Britain also said that the success of this test is "a
significant moment in the U.S.-U.K. global security partnership."
</P>
<P>
"This new capability will enable the U.K. to be an even more
effective partner with the United States and NATO in support of
international diplomacy," the embassy quoted a British diplomat as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Japan's October Trade Surplus Up 23.9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade
surplus in October jumped 23.9 percent from a year earlier to 1.37
trillion yen (about 10.6 billion U.S. dollars), marking the 19th
straight month of increase, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise in trade surplus to a rapid
decline in imports, which contributed to a setback in exports.
</P>
<P>
Exports fell 5.7 percent to 4.382 trillion yen (about 33.9
billion dollars), down for the first time in five months, due to
the continued weakness in demand from other Asian nations, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Imports slipped 14.9 percent to 3.012 trillion yen (about 23.3
billion dollars), posting the 10th straight month of a decrease,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States soared 31.9 percent to 719.7 billion yen (about 5.6 billion
dollars), its 25th consecutive monthly increase.
</P>
<P>
Japan's surplus with other Asian countries totaled 315.5
billion yen (about 2.4 billion dollars), down 40.9 percent, while
that with the 15-member European Union (EU) advanced 41.8 percent
to 426.1 billion yen (about 3.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Japan's merchandise trade balance is measured on the basis of
goods clearing customs and is reported before an adjustment is
made for seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
The yen averaged 129.37 to the U.S. dollar in October, down 6.3
percent from a year earlier.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
announced on Wednesday it was planning to sell 11 surplus naval
frigates to Turkey for 205 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon announced the package of three guided-missile
Perry Class frigates and eight Knox Class vessels would include
20,000 rounds of 20mm ammunition and preparations to make the
ships ready to operate.
</P>
<P>
The eight older Knox Class vessels are already being leased by
the Turkish Navy, and the Ankara government already has three
other Perry Class frigates in its fleet.
</P>
<P>
While the ships would upgrade Turkey's Navy and improve its
anti-submarine ability, "the proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not affect the basic military balance in the region,"
said the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
The proposed sale will need to be approved by the U.S.
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has continued to sell sophisticated arms to both
Greece and Turkey over the past year based on their defense
modernization needs as allies of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey have been strained because

<HEADLINE> Italy Ready for Talks over Kurdish Leader's Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Italy is ready to open "frank and
friendly" talks with Turkey on Ankara's request to extradite
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema said in a statement late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Italy would not give in to "unjustified"
pressure to extradite Ocalan, leader of Turkey's outlawed
Kurdistan Workers' Party, whom Ankara brands as a "terrorist" in
leading armed campaigns for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"There is no point in demanding that Italy hand over Ocalan. We
have laws and we cannot hand him over to anyone," said D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
Noting that it would be unacceptable to place Italy on a par
with terrorism, he asserted that his country "does not want to
assist terrorist activities in any way."
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested by police on international warrants on his
arrival at Rome's international airport from Moscow. He has
requested political asylum and is now detained in a hospital in
Palestrina, a town outside Rome.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has demanded his extradition to face trial for treason
charges while thousands of Kurds from across Europe have arrived
in Rome in the last few days to show support for Ocalan.

<HEADLINE>   ESCAP Urges More Attention to Waterways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The increased use of inland
waterways for transport could reduce costs considerably and have
important implications for socioeconomic progress in the
Asia-Pacific region, a U.N. agency said.
</P>
<P>
Adrianus Mooy, executive secretary of the U.N. Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)said in a press
release available here Thursday that in recent times, inland water
transport has been somewhat neglected compared to other modes of
transport such as roads and railways which have received higher
levels of investment.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the large capacity and lower investment
requirements, inland water transport is the least costly, most
environmentally friendly and energy-efficient form of transport,"
Mooy was quoted as saying Wednesday at the first session of the
Committee on Transport, Communications, Tourism and Infrastructure
Development, organized by ESCAP between November 18 to 20.
</P>
<P>
The committee will review implementation of the New Delhi
Action Plan on Infrastructure Development in Asia and the Pacific
and discuss issues related to development of inland water and
maritime transport as well as sustainable tourism in the region.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address to the committee Wednesday, Suthep
Thaugsuban, Thailand's minister of transport and communications,
said the strengthening of intraregional and interregional
transport linkages has a crucial role to play in facilitating
trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
He said work undertaken by the ESCAP Secretariat within the
framework of the Asian Land Transport Infrastructure Development
(ALTID) project will have important implications for the region
which strives to become more integrated with the globalization
process.
</P>
<P>
High-level government officials from more than 20 countries of
the ESCAP region and representatives from other U.N. bodies and
specialized agencies as well as from intergovernmental
organizations and NGOs are participating in the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Smoking Causes 4 Million Deaths Yearly: Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Cigarette smoking kills about
4 million people a year across the world and half of these victims
are in developing nations, experts attending an on-going
international health conference here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An official from the World Health Organization said at the
"Global Public Health Perspective: Challenges for the Future"
conference that cigarette smoking will be the major cause of death
in many developing countries within 20 years if governments take
no immediate action.
</P>
<P>
Although illnesses and deaths from other diseases were
beginning to stabilize or decline, the risks associated with
smoking were rising, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, unless smoking behavior changes,
premature deaths caused by tobacco in developing countries will
exceed the combined deaths expected from AIDS, tuberculosis and
complications in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the conference urged the governments of
developing nations to do more to stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the host country, experts said that although
Thailand had introduced tough measures to counter smoking, it is
still a major cause of death, via lung cancer, heart attacks,
strokes and chronic disorders.
</P>
<P>
They urged the Thai government to keep the momentum going
because results of actions implemented today will be seen only in
10 years' time.

<HEADLINE> Starr Defends His Investigation of Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, opening a statement to the U.S. House of Representatives
Judiciary Committee, defended his investigation of President Bill
Clinton and alleged a pattern of abuse of power by the president.
</P>
<P>
"This office has achieved a superb record in courts of
law ... We go to court and not on the talk-show circuit, and our
record shows that there is a bright line between law and
politics," Starr said in his testimony released Wednesday and
prepared for delivery Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He alleged Clinton abused his power in the Monica Lewinsky case
in 10 different ways.
</P>
<P>
"In short, the evidence suggests that the president repeatedly
used the machinery of government and the powers of his office to
conceal his relationship with Monica Lewinsky from the American
people, from the judicial process in the (Paula) Jones case and
from the grand jury," he said in the testimony.
</P>
<P>
Starr, who is the first witness in the committee's impeachment
inquiry, said his office considered making an impeachment referral
to Congress in late 1997 on the Whitewater real estate deal and
even drafted a report, but stopped short "because of the
difficulty of establishing the truth with a sufficient degree of
confidence."
</P>
<P>
"The pattern of obstruction of justice, false statements and
misuse of executive authority in the Lewinsky investigation did
not occur in a vacuum," he said, adding his office had faced an
"extraordinary" number of legal disputes with Clinton and his
supporters that have blocked investigations and thrown up
roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
"We have been forced to go to court time and again to seek
information from the executive branch and to fight a multitude of
privilege claims asserted by the administration -- every single
one of which we have won," he said.

United Development Party (PPP) faction said 15 would be
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim-based PPP was the only faction that opposed the
allocation of unelected seats to the military in last week's
special session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR). It
argued that only elected representatives of the people should be
allowed to sit in the house.
</P>
<P>
However, it failed in its bid to have the military expelled
from the country's legislature, losing a vote on the matter in
which the four other factions in the MPR supported a continued
military involvement in politics.
</P>
<P>
Both Sazili and Zarkasih are members of the 83-strong House
Special Committee set up to deliberate on political bills, which
cover general elections, the structure and function of the House
of Representatives, the provincial legislatures and the MPR, and
political parties.
</P>
<P>
The legislators will have 27 working days to complete their
deliberations and the bills are expected to be passed on January
28, according to Sazili, who chairs the special committee.
</P>
<P>
A government-sponsored bill on the structure and function of
the country's legislatures entitles the armed forces to 55
unelected seats in a proposed 550-seat House of Representatives.
The military would also receive the same number of seats in a
scaled-down MPR with 700 seats. The MPR currently has 1,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
On the bill on general elections, both Zarkasih and Sazili said
their factions would propose that foreign observers be allowed to
monitor the general election to be held in May or June next year.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Plans to Boost Exports by 40 Percent in Four Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government plans to increase exports by 40 percent in the next
four years, from the current 11.3 billion U.S. dollars a year to
15.3 billion, Foreign Trade Minister Martha Ramirez said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ramirez said the government will offer incentives such as tax
returns to the best exporters.
</P>
<P>
The government said earlier that it would devalue the peso by
14 percent in the next four years to boost exports and create more
jobs following a revaluation of the currency in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Ramirez said her ministry and finance and customs authorities
are studying the simplification of procedures for exporters.
</P>
<P>
The export program focuses on small- and medium-sized
enterprises which could create jobs and use new technologies to
diversify their products.
</P>
<P>
About half of Colombian exports are made up by coffee, coal,
oil and ferronickel, while other exports like flowers, bananas,
textiles and clothes are also increasing.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police Call Bloody Clashes Provoked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian police said
provocateurs incited students and the masses to attack security
forces before the bloody clash in Jakarta last week.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide televised address, National Police chief Lt.
Gen. Roesmanhadi said the students were negotiating an end to last
Friday's protest with security personnel deployed to safeguard the
special session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) when
the agitators appeared on the scene. They began throwing stones,
Molotov cocktails and dirt at the lines of security personnel and
urged others to join in.
</P>
<P>
This led directly to the clashes between the security personnel
and the protesters, the Jakarta Post Thursday quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said clashes on Thursday and Friday last week left 13 people
dead, 89 hospitalized and 427 requiring medical treatment. Those
killed included four students and one member of the security
forces. Independent estimates put the death toll from the two days
of violence at 15 people.
</P>
<P>
The police chief laid the blame for the riots on a group of
opposition politicians who last week openly called for an
alternative government. He said this had incited the students and
mobilized the masses.
</P>
<P>
The group met in the Sahid Jaya Hotel last Thursday to issue a
declaration, which then received nationwide publicity.
</P>
<P>
"They had the motive and they made the initial move,"
Roesmanhadi said, adding that police will continue to investigate
the matter and are currently gathering more evidence and
testimony.
</P>
<P>
Roesmanhadi said police would announce in a detailed and
transparent manner the results of the investigations.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the National Police continued to question seven
of the 20 opposition figures accused of trying to topple President
B.J. Habibie's government.
</P>
<P>
The figures are charged with violating articles 107 and 110 of
the Criminal Code on subversion, which carry maximum penalties of
life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the independent Commission for Missing Persons and
Victims of Violence (Kontras) asserted that the military was
involved in provoking student protesters.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters on Wednesday, Kontras coordinator Munir
said plainclothes and uniformed military personnel were "directly
and indirectly involved."
</P>
<P>
He said witnesses, including a number of unemployed people and
Armed Forces personnel, have admitted that they had been assigned
to incite unrest during the student protests.
</P>
<P>
Munir displayed a fake university jacket and a badge of the
private Veteran University, worn by an alleged provocateur who was
apprehended by students and the public.
</P>
<P>
Munir said there were also reports of intimidation against a
number of victims who were still being treated at hospitals in
Central Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Liquefied Natural Gas Exports Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's liquefied natural
gas (LNG) exports will decrease by 4.2 percent this year following
a slump in demand by South Korea and Japan amid the monetary
crisis, the Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian state oil and gas company Pertamina's Director of
General Affairs Hadi Daryono said the company's LNG exports would
drop by 22 shipments to 501 shipments this year due to the crisis
which has battered the region for more than one year.
</P>
<P>
One shipment comprises 125,000 cubic meters of LNG.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the world's largest LNG exporter with customers
including Korea Gas, Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas, Hiroshima Gas, Toho Gas
and Nippon Gas.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso said on Wednesday that his country had started to
overcome its difficulties and the confidence of foreign investors
in the country had been restored.
</P>
<P>
"Those who stopped investing in Brazil due to a lack of
confidence following the Russian economic crisis in August can
continue to reinvest their funds here again since no one will lose
their money," Cardoso said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a one-billion-U.S.-dollar investment in Brazil's
oil sector announced Wednesday by the German company Thyssen
proved that investor confidence had returned.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil wants to grow and those who do not believe it are going
to lose," Cardoso said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Brazil and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
"had started a new kind of relationship."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American
Development Bank, along with 20 countries, approved a
41.5-billion-dollar rescue package for Brazil, which will be paid
over the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Thailand Sees Stable Baht for Rest of Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Following U.S. rate cuts, the
dollar/baht exchange rate is likely to trade in a small band
between 36 and 37 baht which will not affect exports, Bank of
Thailand's Assistant Governor Kietisak Meechareon said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The baht does not tend to move rapidly against the dollar, the
Bangkok Post Thursday quoted Kietisak as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I personally estimate it should be somewhere around 36-37 baht
a dollar until the year end," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Judging that the interest rate cut did not have much impact on
the dollar, the market still has a bullish sentiment on the U.S.
currency."
</P>
<P>
The recent appreciation of the baht has been driven by the
weakening of the dollar to the yen. The central bank has
intervened from time to time, to minimize fluctuations in the
baht's exchange rate, Kietisak said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States decided to cut rates in an attempt to
"get ahead of the curve" and minimize the chance of an
international economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the U.S. economy has yet to show signs of a
slowdown and investors believe the Japanese financial reform
package will not yield short-term gains has helped sustain the
dollar, Kietisak said.

SHANGHAI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Customs have
increased efforts to eliminate piracy involving intellectual
property rights (IPR).
</P>
<P>
The Customs office investigated over a dozen piracy cases
during the first 10 months of this year. In October alone, related
cases involved the illegal use of trademarks or patents for
products valued at over two million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Customs launched the anti-piracy campaign three years

imported and exported commodities.
</P>
<P>
Local experts point out that Customs offices are required to
protect victims filing appeals in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that the move to strengthen IPR protection will

for strengthening efforts to ensure foreign trade enterprises

<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 percent of
Beijing college students want to study aboard, according to a
survey of more than 300 students at five renowned universities in
the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Among the students wanting to study aboard, three-fourths named
the United States as their first choice. Some 135,000 Chinese
students went to the United States to study between 1978 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Japan, Canada, and Britain are also favorite choices, but they
each account for less than ten percent of first choices.
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the students graduating from the physics
department of Beijing University have gone to study aboard, said
Professor Gan Zizhao, adding that in the United States alone, the
department has 500 alumnae and alumni.
</P>
<P>
Foreign universities are also focusing on Chinese students
graduating from the best universities. All 35 students from a
computer department class at Beijing's Qinghua University received
scholarships from well-known foreign universities.
</P>
<P>
Better educational conditions and broader development prospects
are the main attractions for students who want to study aboard,
according to the survey, sponsored by the Beijing Shijilantu
Market Research Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese students studying aboard movement has gone through
three stages. It began at the end of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),
when a number of Chinese students were sent abroad to study
Western industrial technologies; the second stage lasted from the
1930s until the founding of the People's Republic of China; and
China is now seeing the third wave, which began after the reform
and opening drive since 1978 and continues to this day.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank
(CCB) introduced computerized account transferral remittance
services in 138 Chinese cities beginning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The "individual electronic remittance" services are available
on CCB's nationwide computer network and operating systems. The
service allows customers to remit money from their current account
to the accounts of payees in various cities. The payee can
withdraw the funds from the nearest CCB branch in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Charges for the new service are relatively low when compared
with traditional remittance services.
</P>
<P>
The new service is available at CCB's 9,000 service outlets
throughout the country. The bank plans to expand the service to a
number of other cities, as well as developed counties and towns,
according to a CCB spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that the sharp increase in economic activities
and increasing mobility of Chinese citizens have caused the
nation's remittance volume to surge from 52 billion yuan in 1991
to 300 billion yuan in 1997, up 35 percent on an annual basis. The
figure is expected to reach 450 billion yuan by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province Steps Up Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, an old
industrial base in northeast China, has instructed 929 local
industrial enterprises to treat pollution sources within a given
period of time.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, this campaign to treat industrial
pollution at the source will be carried out in three stages, with
37 percent of the task finished by the end of this year and the
rest fully completed by 2000.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that by the year of 2000, the province will have
treated industrial pollution sources at 1,085 sites which
presently cause 85 percent of the province's total industrial
pollution, according to the provincial environmental protection
department.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the State Council, the country's highest governing
body, published a regulation stipulating that all industrial
pollution sources in the country should discharge according to set
pollution treatment requirements by the year 2000, and polluting
enterprises will otherwise be shut down.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is China's heavy industrial base, and discharges of
industrial waste have remained high there due to backward
technology and out-moded equipment. The pressure on the
environment has become obvious among Liaoning's dense population.
</P>
<P>
To support the anti-pollution campaign, the province plans to
build more sewage treatment plants, and eight provincial cities
will have sewage treatment plants within five years, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Construction of four sewage plants in the province is now being
carried out, and a sewage treatment plant in the provincial
capital of Shenyang, the country's second largest of its kind, is
now in service.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Approves '99 National Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The House of Representatives of
the Philippines Wednesday night approved on third and final
reading the 579.5-billion-peso (14.5 billion U.S. dollars)
national budget for 1999.
</P>
<P>
A total of 139 voted in favor of the budget while 28 dissented,
with no abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Members of the ruling majority, who were grumbling about the
house leadership's failure to accommodate their requests for funds
for priority projects in their districts, had threatened to block
the bill, house sources said.
</P>
<P>
But house leaders appeased the dissenters in the ruling
majority during an all-member caucus late Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Opposition congressmen rejected the bill and criticized the
majority for "capitulating without putting up a fight against the
Presidential Palace" to retain the lawmakers' pork barrel fund,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The final version of the budget included a reduction in the
budget of the Bureau of Customs and additions to the Calamity Fund
and public projects budget.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The British attack
submarine HMS Splendid successfully fired a Tomahawk cruise
missile 800 kilometers at a target off the California coast
Wednesday, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
In this first live warhead test by Britain, the missile's
453-kilogram explosive warhead slammed into a test building in an
orange burst on San Clemente Island about 120 kilometers off the
Southern California coast.
</P>
<P>
Two previous nonexplosive warheads tests were successfully
conducted from the Splendid this month. Those Tomahawks were fired
about the same distance to a U.S. Navy test range at China Lake,
California.
</P>
<P>
The Splendid launched the missile Wednesday from one of its
torpedo tubes while it was submerged. It is the first British
submarine equipped with the U.S.-made Tomahawk.
</P>
<P>
The test was conducted on the eve of British Defense Secretary
George Robertson's visit to the United States. He was expected to
hold talks at the Pentagon with U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 18 (Xinhua) -- While still in an emerging
state, the online retail market in the United States is enjoying
robust growth, according to a study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the trade association for U.S. online
retailers -- shop.org -- based on polls of 127 online retailers in
seven categories, revealed that annual growth stood at 200 percent
and the top 10 publicly traded online retailers have witnessed
year-on-year revenue growth in excess of 160 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also found that while many consumers are visiting online
retailers, few are buying.
</P>
<P>
Online revenues generated by North American-based retailers for
the first six months of 1998 were 4.4 billion U.S. dollars, less
than 1 percent of overall retail revenue, according to the study.
However, full year online revenues for retailers will surpass 13
billion.
</P>
<P>
Online retailers are investing heavily now to expand their
reach and customer bases, shop.org said in a related report. Some
65 percent of the revenues generated through online services are
reinvested in marketing and advertising, compared with 4 percent
for most traditional stores.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province,
one of the nation's major foreign trade centers, has recovered a
favorable balance in international payments this year due to
the introduction of strict control on foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu earned 8.35 billion US dollars and spent 5.3 billion
US dollars in the first 10 months of the year. The surplus for
the period ended at slightly over three billion U.S. dollars.

<P>
The province has also introduced measures to standardize
procedures for foreign trade.

JAKARTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia's gross foreign
exchange reserves rose by 985.3 million U.S. dollars to 22.76
billion dollars in the week ending November 13 from the previous
week.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the increase to the withdrawal of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) extended loan arrangement,
The Jakarta Post Thursday quoted a central bank statement as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia said, however, that net international reserves
dropped by 100,000 dollars primarily due to servicing government
foreign debt and stabilizing the rupiah, the country's currency.
</P>
<P>
The net international reserves level of 14.23 billion dollars
was still above the adjusted net international reserves level of
11.26 billion dollars targeted by the IMF, the bank said.

MEXICO CITY, November 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 16 people were

<HEADLINE> Price of Color TV Picture Tubes Picks Up in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The declining price of
China's color TV picture tubes began to pick up in October for the
first time in 30 months, thanks to the state's anti-smuggling
drive and its policy of stimulating domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhangqing, director of Hunan Province's electronics
industry bureau, said that the anti-smuggling campaign stopped
millions of illegal picture tubes from entering the Chinese
market, thus helping restore the tube prices.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the price rise to a booming rural market in
household electric appliances in the wake of reconstruction in
the flood-damaged areas.
</P>
<P>
The price of a 21-inch color TV picture tube, which had fallen
as low as 460 yuan this summer, increased to more than 500 yuan
early this month, while that of the 25-inch tube increased from
760 yuan to more than 800 yuan, according to China's major picture
tube manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Since March 1996, the price of the picture tubes had been
declining as color TV manufacturers cut the prices of TV sets to
promote sales. The 21-inch tube, sold at 980 yuan at that time,
also underwent continuous price cuts, and the price reached bottom
this summer.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the color TV picture tube industry still
needs overhauling in spite of the rising prices, and have called
for a readjustment of product mix.

Pierce dominated the match throughout today with the power of
her shot making. She blasted 18 winners and converted 6-of-9
break-point chances in the 44 minutes. She will face a tough
battle in the next round against world No. 2 Martina Hingis of
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Pierce, who won back-to-back titles last month to give her
four titles in 1998, won the opening four games while losing only
nine points, giving her rival no chance.
</P>
<P>
"I just had a good day," said Pierce, who has won seven of
nine matches against the tiny South African. "All my shots worked
for me, basically I just tried to stay concentrated because,
against someone like Amanda, if you give her a chance, then she
gets back into the match. Then it can become a very tough match."
</P>
<P>
Coetzer committed 15 unforced errors and failed to hold her
serve once.
</P>
<P>
"She started off great and I never even got a chance to get
anywhere close to the match," Coetzer said. "I didn't feel like I
was playing badly. I think Martina has got a little more to hurt
Mary and she put a little bit more pressure obviously than what I
did. If Mary can continue to serve as well as she did today and
if she can keep her composure, I think she is to be hard to
beat."

<HEADLINE> Davenport Highlights Action Tonight at Chase Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Davenport, who is assured of becoming the first American-born
woman to end the year as the world's top-ranked players since
Chris Evert in 1981, will battle Sandrine Testud of France in the
night match at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
Also tonight, fifth seed Americna Monic Seles will try to
shake off the effects of food poisoning against a slumping Anna
Kournikova of Russia.
</P>
<P>
In today's first match, sixth seed Mary Pierce of France
overpowered South African Amanda Coetzer to post a 6-1, 6-0
victory.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who earned the biggest victory of her career in New
York at the U.S. Open, wrapped up the year's to ranking Monday
when Spain's Arantxa Sanchez Vicario lost to Irina Sirlea of
Romania.
</P>
<P>
That loss denied No. 2 Hingis the opportunity to collect bonus
points she would have needed to unseat Davenport.
</P>
<P>
Tonight's encounter is a rematch of the finals of the Porsche
Grand Prix, played in October in Filderstadt, Germany. In that
match, the 14th-ranked Testud earned her only title of the year
with a 7-5, 6-3 victory. However, the tall American owns a 6-2
lead in the all-time series.
</P>
<P>
Davenport is coming off a loss to Germany's Steffi Graf in
last week's Advanta Championships in Philadelphia. But she has
won a tour-leading six titles this season.
</P>
<P>
Seles has won 10 of her last 12 matches since falling to
Hingis in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open, but she became sick
from a meal last week and spent all of Monday and the better part
of Tuesday in bed recovering. Seles won three consecutive Chase
Championship titles from 1990-1992.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova is hoping for a recovery of a different kind. The
17-year-old Russian, making her debut at the year-ending event
tonight, has lost three straight matches and has committed 37
double faults in her last two outings.

<HEADLINE> England Beat Czech Republic in Soccer Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well-drilled first-half goals from Darren Anderton and Paul
Merson were the least England deserved, after they survived some
early scares from their highly-rated opponents to give the crowd
an exhibition in attacking football.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle went into the game with the criticism of England's
recent poor displays and reports of clashes with his players
ringing in his ears.
</P>
<P>
But his controversial selection policies paid off as an
experimental side clicked into gear, with David Beckham pulling
the strings in the center of midfield.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of first-choice strikers Alan Shearer and
Michael Owen, Hoddle opted for a less than youthful front pairing
-29-year-old Dion Dublin joining 35-year-old Ian Wright in attack.
</P>
<P>
And Wright proved the star of the show, as the West Ham
veteran pulled the Czech defense all over the park with his
foraging runs and provided the crosses for both goals.
</P>
<P>
Dublin too had his moments as target man and in the eighth
minute he showed how confident he is after scoring five goals in
his first two games for new club Aston Villa.
</P>
<P>
Beckham played Anderton into space on the right, the Tottenham
star turned and crossed to the edge of the area and Dublin struck
a first-time volley, which blazed over the bar.
</P>
<P>
But a minute later the Czechs showed they had not come to
Wembley as the supporting cast, as they came so close to scoring
a stunning opener.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Smicer began a superb attack with a rampaging run at
the heart of the England defense. He then slipped a precise
through-ball into the path of Pavel Kuka, who hit a delicious
diagonal chip with his first touch, which left Nigel Martyn
flailing but ricocheted back off the bar.
</P>
<P>
England were stung into action and should have gone ahead on
16 minutes when Beckham's corner found Dublin unmarked 12 yards
out, but the striker's downward header was cleared by Jiri
Novotny at the far post.
</P>
<P>
But it did not take long for England to stamp their authority
on the game.
</P>
<P>
With 22 minutes on the clock, Wright dragged down Graeme Le
Saux's long pass, spun off his marker and sprinted towards the
by-line, before hooking a low cross into the area. The ball
evaded Dublin's stretch, but no-one had picked up Anderton's late
run into the area and the wing-back stroked a left-foot shot into
the bottom corner.
</P>
<P>
And the second goal, with 39 minutes on the clock, was a near
replica of the first.
</P>
<P>
Again Wright found himself wide on the left flank, and again
he beat his man and crossed into the box - but this time Dublin
nodded the ball down and Merson, unmarked on the right, swept the
ball home.
</P>
<P>
Beckham came close with a curling long-range effort in injury
time as England ended the first half on a high.
</P>
<P>
The second period began in the same vein and Graeme Le Saux
should have made it 3-0 in the 49th minute.
</P>
<P>
Dublin forced the ball back from the by-line to the Chelsea
star in the six yard box, but Le Saux hit his shot straight at
Kouba.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later the Czech keeper did well to palm away
Beckham's stinging drive and the lurking Wright failed to get a
clean connection on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
A mistake by stand-in skipper Sol Campbell then gave the
Czechs a rare chance to reduce the arrears but substitute
Vratislav Lokvenc volleyed over the bar.
</P>
<P>
Wright was forced off in the 67th minute after pulling a
muscle as he turned and shot straight at the keeper and was
replaced by Robbie Fowler.
</P>
<P>
And a minute later Anderton headed wide from Beckham's
near-post cross.
</P>
<P>
Teenager Lee Hendie was given his debut in the 76th minute, in
place of Villa team-mate Merson.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs had their best chance of the second half after 78
minutes, when Martyn had to be at his sharpest to get down and
hold a low shot from Lokvnec.
</P>
<P>
Hendrie was denied the chance of a fairytale debut two minutes
from time, when he wove his way into the box but pulled a diagonal
 shot just wide with only Kouba to beat.
</P>
<P>
"I was very pleased with the team's performance," a beaming
Hoddle said.
</P>
<P>
"Every single individual put a lot in and they all got a lot
out of the game. It was an excellent performance really.
</P>
<P>
"If we had taken our chances in the second half it could have
been four or five. That would have really been a just result.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased with the movement, very pleased with some
of the play and it's a bit of experience for quite of few of them
</P>
<P>
"I said going into the game that we obviously wanted to win as
professionals, and you could see in that performance that they
are winners, " he added.

CHONGQING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chongqing Zoo in this
southwest China municipality plans to breed southern tigers, one
of the most endangered species in the world, with self-developed
tube-breeding techniques.
</P>
<P>
Southern tigers are found only in China, and a total of 53 are

extinct.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing Zoo has bred 24 southern-tiger cubs in recent
years, and 16 of them have survived. The zoo has been cooperating
with the city's genetic and reproduction center and the
ultra-sonic medical engineering institute to research
test-tube-breeding techniques for southern tigers, and major
progress has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The zoo will also construct a 5,860-square-meter area as a
natural habitat for the test-tube cubs.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday said its
dialogue with India on the Kashmir issue is exclusively directed
toward a just and durable settlement of the dispute in accordance
with the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by a Foreign Office spokesman while commenting
on Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's statement that the
 dialogue was meant to discuss the status of Azad Kashmir
(Pakistan-controlled Kashmir).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that Pakistan remains committed to
engaging in bilateral and multilateral efforts to resolve the
Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
India, he said, "should realize that the settlement of this
issue can no longer be postponed."
</P>
<P>
He accused India of refusing to honor its international
commitments and allow the people of Kashmir to exercise their
right of self-determination, which he said provides the only basis
for resolving this dispute.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said nuclearization of South Asia has converted
Kashmir into a nuclear flash point. Now there is a strong
conviction in the international community to find an early
settlement of the Kashmir dispute, he added.

<HEADLINE> Annan Meets With NATO Chief on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan met with visiting NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
here Wednesday evening, saying that "we are working very closely
in Kosovo," a Yugoslav province where ethnic Albanians make up a
majority of the population.
</P>
<P>
Fresh from the meeting, Solana told reporters that he discussed
with Annan on such issues as Bosnia and Kosovo, the two regions he
said NATO had "close cooperation" with the United Nations on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of things in agreement," he said. "We are
working together in Bosnia and Kosovo," and "We have very very
profound relations."
</P>
<P>
Solana said he was glad to see a resolution adopted by the U.N.
Security Council Tuesday, condemning Yugoslavia's failure to
cooperate with war crimes investigators and demanding the arrest
of three men charged with organizing an alleged massacre of more
than 200 Croats in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Without the authorization of the United Nations, NATO has
threatened to use military force against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia on the question of Kosovo, which was considered by
Belgrade an internal affair. Such a unilateral decision came
under strong fire from most Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
NATO, after an agreement with Belgrade, has set up a mission of
verification, manily from air, to monitor Yugoslav compliance with
relevant U.N. resolutions. The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has also sent personnel to monitor
Belgrade's compliance on land in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Annan said he would not recommend the
establishment of a United Nations political presence in Serbia's
province of mainly ethnic Albanians in order to avert what he said
might turn out as reporting confusion over the situation on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said, "It is quite
obvious that any need that might have existed for such a presence
has been superseded by the decision to establish the Kosovo
Verification Mission."
</P>
<P>
Since the Kosovo Verification Mission, made by up of 2,000
monitors from the OSCE, will report to the Security Council, the
decision not to establish a United Nations political presence will
serve to avoid "parallel reporting channels that might lead to
confusion and overlapping in the field, as well as necessary
financial expenditure."
</P>
<P>
At the current stage, it is important to develop clear channels
of communication between the OSCE and the United Nations on the
issue of Kosovo, where conflicts originated from ethnic Albanians'
bids for independence, he said.

<HEADLINE> Crude Futures Prices Reach All Time Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The price for prompt January
Brent Crude crashed Wednesday morning to 11.20/bl, the lowest
level ever recorded, 10c less than the previous low of 11.30/bl on
October 5, 1998, the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE)
announced.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have attributed the weakness in oil prices to a
variety of factors including growth in supply, particularly from
non-Opec countries; a fall in demand from Asia due to the economic
crisis in this region, and high stock levels.
</P>
<P>
The IPE said that low prices this year contributed to a surge
in volume of trade at the IPE. So far this year business has
increased almost a third compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In November daily volumes of trade in oil have averaged just
under 90,000 lots, equivalent to about 85 million barrels a day.
This volume is greater than total daily world oil consumption.
</P>
<P>
Lynton Jones, chief executive of the IPE said "this year's low
prices have reinforced the need for effective risk management
tools to all those companies which are exposed to energy price
volatility."
</P>
<P>
"Any one whose profit margin depends significantly on oil sales
or purchases has seen the benefits of hedging clearly demonstrated
in recent months," he added.
</P>
<P>
The IPE launched the Brent Crude futures contract on 23 June
1988. It forms a key part of the complex used as a benchmark for
pricing two thirds of the world's internationally traded oil
supplies.

If the highest court in Britain upholds a ruling same as the

He had been in Britain with a diplomatic passport for health
reasons before he was kept under police guard.

<HEADLINE> Zambian MPs Condemn Idea of Barotseland's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Ten parliamentary members
(MPs) from Barotseland or Western Province of Zambia Wednesday
condemned the idea of their region's break-away from Zambia and
form one country with the Caprivi Strip of the northeastern
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The MPs from the ruling Movement for Muti-party Democracy
(MMD) disassociated themselves from earlier remarks made by
Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika, president of opposition Agenda
for Zambia (AZ) which has been advocating for a free and
independent Barotseland, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Lewanika, a royal member of Barotseland, said last Monday the
Caprivian Lozis from Namibia and those from the Barotseland were
of "one people" and they had the right to decide either to
"rejoin" a free Barotseland, establish their self-rule or remain
part of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted meeting in recent months with top figures of
the Namibia's Caprivian secessionist movement led by Mishake
Muyongo, president of the country's largest opposition Democratic
Turnhalle Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Mwitila Shumina, spokesman of the ten MPs including Foreign
Minister Keli Walubita, said the AZ leader was not a spokesman of
Western Province and his remarks had threatened the peace there.
</P>
<P>
The utterances of Lewanika would scare away potential
investors in the province and it was therefore important for the
Zambian government to study his statements for the truth and
build investor confidence, said Shumina, who added that they were
not only politically damaging but economically disastrous.
</P>
<P>
On the alliance of Caprivi-Western Province, Shumina said the
natural relationship of inter-border area did not correspond with
international law on boundaries.
</P>
<P>
"People of Western Province are aware that ethnic
relationships are common factors in most border areas hence the
Caprivi issue is not unique and it should not be used as a
barometer of problems in Zambia and Namibia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chief government spokesman Newstead Zimba disclosed last
Monday the Zambian government was studying the remarks made by
the AZ leader and said the utterances concerning the links
between the Lozis of the Barotseland and those of the Caprivi who
were considered rebels in their own country were "serious" and
needed careful scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
The remarks also drew the attention of Namibian High
Commission based in Lusaka. Acting High Commissioner Albert
Lushetile said last Tuesday that Lewanika's recent remarks were a
matter of concern to his government.
</P>
<P>
He noted that just like Zambia, Namibia was a sovereign state
and there was no way that such activities of secession could be
condoned and supported by both countries.
</P>
<P>
A Namibian newspaper, The Namibian, reported last Friday the
leaders of the Caprivi movement were now forging an alliance with
Lozi separatists in the Barotseland.
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, according to the United Nations
Humanitarian Information Unit, over 400 Caprivian separatists had
fled Namibia to neighboring Botswana to seek refuge, claiming
persecution at home.
</P>
<P>
It said Namibian President Sam Nujoma had asked Botswana to
repatriate them to face charges of treason and murder.

<HEADLINE> Butler Demands Iraq's Weapons Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler,
executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM), had asked Iraq to hand over several documents about its
weapons programs, a U.N. official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for UNSCOM in charge of dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said Butler had written to
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz Tuesday and asked for
several documents.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan said these secret documents included a logbook
discovered by arms experts at an Iraqi air force base earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM weapons inspectors glanced at it but were not given a
copy, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The weapons inspectors, who withdrew from Iraq last week in
anticipation of U.S. air strikes, have returned to their posts
Tuesday. Iraq barred them from most inspections on August 5 ad
suspended all its cooperation with them on October 31.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Republicans Select Speaker, Other Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Republicans in the U.S.
House of Representatives nominated Bob Livingston Wednesday to
succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker and gave Dick Armey another two
years as majority leader.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, the only
black Republican in the House, was elected chairman of the party
conference.
</P>
<P>
Watts, a former football player, defeated Representative John
Boehner of Ohio for the conference chairmanship, the
fourth-ranking leadership slot. The vote was 121-93.
</P>
<P>
Armey, a Texan who has been majority leader since the
Republicans gained control of the House in the 1994 elections,
defeated Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma on a third
ballot. The vote was 127-95.
</P>
<P>
Watt's election was a victory for the party's conservative
wing. Boehner had served as conference chairman for the past four
years. Representative Bob Ney of Ohio, a Boehner supporter, said
the former chairman "got blamed in my opinion for the lack of an
agenda here. They were looking for a magical message that didn't
exist."
</P>
<P>
"People were ready for a change," said Representative Matt
Salmon of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
Challenging Armey were Largent, Jennifer Dunn of Washington and
J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, who dropped out after finishing
fourth on the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
After the vote for majority leader, Armey emerged from the
closed caucus with Largent and Dunn and called the contest "a
well-run race of energy and enthusiasm."
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to fight for the things we believe in as a
party," said Largent. Dunn appealed for unity, saying it was
important to "sweep up the residue" from the leadership contest.
</P>
<P>
Tom DeLay of Texas had no opposition for another term as party
whip, the third-ranking leadership post.
</P>
<P>
Livingston, who chaired the House Appropriations Committee, was
chosen by voice vote at a closed-door meeting of the 223 House
Republicans who will serve in the 106th Congress. With the backing
of the majority party, he is assured election to the job when the
new House convenes on January 6.
</P>
<P>
The leadership elections followed two weeks of intense
behind-the-scenes campaigning by candidates for the jobs, and in
some cases months of preparation.
</P>
<P>
Livingston said House Republicans will not betray their
philosophy, but "lose nothing by reaching out to the other side,
to talk and listen and work in tandem with those who may share
some of our goals and dreams."
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Livingston will succeed Gingrich, who on
November 6 announced that he would retire from his post and from
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Representative John Linder of Georgia, whom Gingrich had tapped
to head the campaign committee, was also swept from office by
Republicans seeking a change in leadership. Representative Tom
Davis of Virginia toppled him, with a strong assist from DeLay.

<HEADLINE> Starr Expected to Go Beyond Lewinsky Matter in Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr was given leeway Wednesday to go beyond the Monica Lewinsky
matter as he makes his case at U.S. President Bill Clinton's
impeachment hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With Republicans and Democrats getting ready for a partisan
fight at the hearing Thursday, Starr prepared a presentation that
would portray the Lewinsky matter as the core of a pattern of
lying and obstruction of justice, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Henry Hyde of the House Judiciary Committee, a
Republican, has allotted Starr two hours to give his evidence to
members of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
Starr's presentation will be followed by questions from
committee investigators, lawmakers and Clinton's private lawyer
David Kendall.
</P>
<P>
Starr's appearance "won't be a straight recitation" of his
written report submitted in September, said his spokesman, Charles
Bakaly.
</P>
<P>
Democrats were angry that Starr was given authority by Hyde to
delve into matters such as the Whitewater real estate
transactions, misuse of FBI files, firings at the White House
travel office and payments to presidential friend Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
"This is an impeachment in search of a crime," complained James
Jordan, spokesman for Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, given 30 minutes to cross-examine
Starr, assigned Kendall, who has accused Starr of leaking grand
jury material and has relentlessly pursued a contempt of court
motion against him.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Hyde wrote the White House that Clinton's lawyer
wouldn't be allowed to question Starr about the various
controversies surrounding his investigation, such as the grand
jury leak investigation and his contacts with Paula Jones'
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Hyde also pressed the administration to answer the committee's
81 questions about Clinton's conduct and respond to the
Republicans' request for material that could help Clinton's case.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said it appeared the
Republicans were off on an unfair, unconstitutional "partisan
adventure."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters prior to Clinton's departure for Asia,
Lockhart said that Republicans are seeking to muzzle the
president's defenders while attempting to broaden their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"They have rediscovered all of their old bad habits and since
they don't like where it's going, they're going to try to find
something else," Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Germany, U.S. to Keep Seeking Russian Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the United
States and Germany agreed on Wednesday that Russia's economy
needed more reform efforts, said White House spokesman P.J.
Crowley on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder spoke by telephone about the situation, which Schroeder
assessed on his just-completed trip to Russia, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
"The two agreed on the need for the United States and the
European Union to continue to help Russia progress with their
economic reform efforts," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to help Russia is to help them improve their
investment climate... and as winter is approaching in Russia, to
continue to monitor the need for humanitarian assistance," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Crowley said Clinton and Schroeder spoke for about 15 minutes
while the president was en route to Japan on Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Schroeder wrapped up a two-day visit to Russia,
where he met Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Crowley indicated Primakov may have overstated the U.S.
perception of his economic policy after meeting U.S. Vice
President Al Gore in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Primakov said he outlined his economic
policy to Gore, who agreed the policy was "reasonable and
realistic." Crowley said, "we continue to encourage Russia to
take further steps."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supports Turkey on Extradition of Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday expressed its support for Turkey's request that Italy
extradite Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
"We believe he should be extradited and brought to justice. And
we hope a way will be found to extradite him to Turkey, consistent
with international and Italian law," State Department spokesman
James Rubin told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. said it favored extradition and a trial for Ocalan,
the leader of the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), but it
did not take a position on where he should go.
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain the change, Rubin said that Turkey was the
only country to send Italy an extradition request and that most of
Ocalan's alleged crimes took place on Turkish soil.
</P>
<P>
On reports that Ocalan has renounced "terrorism," possibly as a
defense against extradition to Turkey, the spokesman said, "We are
deeply sceptical of this PKK leader's repudiation of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Given the number of times he has renounced violence in the
past, on each previous occasion the PKK continued to engage in
ruthless acts of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"We have no doubt that this man is a terrorist, and he
therefore should receive no safe haven," Rubin said.

BAGHDAD -- U.N. weapons inspection went on smoothly on
Wednesday, the first day that U.N. arms inspectors resumed work
after returning to Iraq on Tuesday, said an Iraqi official.

The Iraqi News Agency INA quoted Hussam Mohammed Ameen,
director of the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate, the Iraqi
liaison with U.N. arms inspectors, as saying that the Iraqi side
provided all the facilities for U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Shah told reporters that Iraq's pledges of
full and unconditional cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors would
be tested in the coming days, especially when intrusive and
surprise inspections to new sites were resumed.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the U.N. Special Commission for disarming
Iraq (UNSCOM) told Xinhua Wednesday on condition of anonymity
that intrusive inspections of new suspected sites may have to wait
until next week. (Iraq-UNSCOM)

<HEADLINE> Brent Crude Closes off Session Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Benchmark Brent crude futures
closed at 11.50 U.S. dollars a barrel Wednesday, up 12 cents on
the day having earlier established a new 12-year low of 11.15
dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Brent crude has not been as low since 1986, when it slipped
below 9 dollars a barrel. However, Wednesday's closing price is 7
cents higher than the previous close.
</P>
<P>
The deepening oil market crisis is expected to weigh heavily on
the ministerial meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) scheduled for next week in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
"If the expectation is to cut more, maybe it is too much for
OPEC to handle that," Sayed Mehdi Hosseini, Iran's deputy oil
minister for international affairs,told the annual oil and money
conference in London Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"At present additional output curtailment by producers does not
appear feasible," Reuters quoted Adrian Lajous, head of Mexico's
state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Facing a massive stock overhang and weak demand there is not
much more OPEC can do these days," said London's Center for Global
Energy Studies.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's efforts this year to rescue the market have been largely
ruined by a record stockpile of crude and refined petroleum
products and shrinking demand, in particular from Asian consumers.
As supplies have already been cut by 10 percent and that made no
impact on prices, oil producers are considered in poor shape to
take further action.
