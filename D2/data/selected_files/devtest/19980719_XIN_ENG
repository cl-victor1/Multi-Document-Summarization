<HEADLINE> Mandela Marries Graca on Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela and his longtime sweetheart Graca Machel, tied the
knot happily Saturday, which falls on Mandela's 80th birthday.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Thabo Mbeki announced in Pretoria that the two
longtime lovers married at Mandela's residence in the suburbs of
Johannesburg Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman, Priscilla Naidoo, said the two had a private
ceremony this morning. It was apparently a traditional ceremony,
followed by holy communion.
</P>
<P>
Mandela would leave for Brazil Monday for a state visit, she
said, but declined to confirm whether the couple would have a
honeymoon in the south American country.
</P>
<P>
Graca Machel, 52, the widow of former Mozambican President
Samora Machel, was trained as a lawyer and is one of the most
influential figures in Mozambique, notably as an international
campaigner for children's rights.
</P>
<P>
Her ex-husband, Samora Machel, was killed in a plane crash in
October, 1986.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Graca went public about their relationship last
year. Mandela once admitted in an interview that the love had
made him feel young again and "bloom like a flower."
</P>
<P>
But the two have always scotched rumors of marriage, even when
Desmond Tutu publicly but light-heartedly castigated them for
setting a bad example to the youth of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, just one day ago, the presidential office again
denied that the two would marry on Saturday, saying they would
not marry "in the near future."
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who got divorced from his second wife, Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela in 1996, had indicated earlier that the
reluctance to marry came from Graca.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people gathered outside Mandela's newly-renovated
white house in the Houghton suburb to give their best wishes for
the newly-weds.
</P>
<P>
Many of them, including dozens of reporters and cameramen,
have been waiting at the gate of the house from Saturday morning.
But the couple did not crop up till 6:30 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
A group of women were singing and dancing, celebrating the new
First Lady of South africa.

<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's industrial exports in the first half of
this year stood at 174.1 billion Lebanon pounds (114.75 million
U.S. dollars), Egypt's Al-Alam Al-Youm daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Ministry of Industry have showed
that the exports decreased by 5.07 percent from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, France, Jordan and Syria are the major importers
of Lebanon's industrial products, which include chemicals,
textiles, foodstuff, canned foods, paper products and aluminium.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Abu Dhabi has started to build a sugar plant,
which is estimated to cost 100 million dirhams (27.24 million
dollars) and has an annual production capacity of 29,000 tonnes of
sugars.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Dhabi municipality expected the plant, the second of
the kind in the United Arab Emirates, to bring about proceeds of
48 million dirhams (13.1 million dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The costs of the project will be covered in three years.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus has issued a 350 million Euro bond (about 385
million dollars) to support its financial needs, an official
statement said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Cyprus issued a Euro bond in ECU,
which will be converted to Euro as from January 1, 1999 when 11 of
the 15 European Union members adopt the Euro as their common
currency.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have reportedly showed a keen interest in the
bond and Cyprus would gain from this financial move.

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tunis Stock Exchange index was
on a steady decline over the last trading week from July 13 to 17,
to finish at 452.97, down 0.50 percent from the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The weekly bulletin of the stock market said the decline of
prices of some shares and the weak demand had a negative effect on
the index.
</P>
<P>
Most shares went down in the last trading week. The major
losers are the Chemistry Company, the Mesbar Company, the Tunisian
Airways, the National Bank for Tourism Development, the
International Banks Union and the Tunisian Corporation for Dairy
Products.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline of the index, the turnover last week hit
17.5 million Tunisia dinars (15.1 million dollars), rising by 13.7
million dinars (11.8 million dollars) from the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Taxi Drivers Demand Reviewing Traffic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Taxi drivers and operators in
Kampala suggested that the new traffic law should be reviewed
because it is too harsh for them.
</P>
<P>
The demand was made at a special meeting for public service
vehicles drivers and representatives and owners at Hotel Africana
on Friday, the Now Vision paper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They set the maximum fine they can pay for reckless driving
causing bodily harm to accident victims at 500,000 Ugandan
Shillings (400 U.S Dollars), cutting off half of the amount
stipulated in the new traffic law.
</P>
<P>
The members of Parliament did not consider the incomes of the
taxi drivers when passing the bill, they noted.
</P>
<P>
"The minister responsible did not consult well with the
technical personnel when drafting the law. We should set our
terms. If he is not satisfied he should call the technical people
and drivers in a meeting to iron out the differences, Ferdinand
Atwiine, the secretary-general of Uganda Taxi Operators and
Drivers Association, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The drivers vowed that they would petition the attorney
General and the chief justice to change the attitude of the
magistrates toward drivers.
</P>
<P>
It is always the drivers who are punished even if the accident
is caused by pedestrians, they argued.
</P>
<P>
The three-day nationwide strike by taxi drivers over the heavy
road accident fines paralyzed the capital city Kampala and
brought the economic life in some places to a halt. The
government had to use pick-up trucks to ferry people to and from
work.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called off following the bending down of the
government as indicated by a promise of Transport Minister John
Nasaira to review the law.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Says No to Turkish Warships, Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has lodged a
protest against the arrival of Turkish naval vessels and military
aircraft in the divided northern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkish Cypriot press reports, six ships docked
at the Kyrenia port in the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north and
about 10 NF-5 aircraft landed at the Lefkoniko airport Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They were to participate in events marking the Turkish landing
of troops in the island on July 20, 1974, following an abortive
coup seeking union with Greece, which led to the division of the
east Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish actions "constitute a provocation and a challenge
to the international community to take a clear-cut position
against those who create tension on the island," government
spokesman Christos Stylianides said in a statement Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Foreign Ministry is making all necessary
diplomatic moves to protest the "new Turkish provocative actions."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides has
proposed demilitarization of the island, which has been rejected
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Clerides' proposal, first put forward in December 1993, was
reiterated last month in a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Clerides in the letter reaffirmed his commitment "to reconsider
the issue of non-importation of new weapon systems to Cyprus
provided that progress is made on a schedule which includes a
number of measures and steps leading towards the eventual goal of
demilitarization."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has so far maintained a 40,000-strong force in the
northern third of the island, which was unilaterally declared in
1983 by Turkish Cypriots a breakaway state, recognized by no other
country than Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rubin's African Visit Builds Up on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Bobert
Rubin, during his five-nation African tour which ended in Kenya
Saturday, has done a follow-up on Clinton's trade-not-aid Africa
policy.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, accompanied by a 30-strong delegation including
entrepreneurs and officials of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund (IMF), started his first African tour on July 12
from Cote d'Ivoire, which also brought him to Namibia, South
Africa, Mozambique and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Addressing bankers, students and government officials at the
Kenyan School of Monetary Studies in Nairobi Friday, Rubin said
that corruption "is a major impediment to economic activity, a
cause of gross misallocation of scarce resources and an
additional cost to business."
</P>
<P>
IMF halted a lending program to Kenya just under a year ago,
complaining of poor governance. Frightened foreign investors
have largely shied away from Kenya since then, interest rates
have risen and the economy has sunk into recession.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi who cut his own pay by half
this week, had appealed to Rubin for debt relief so the
government could focus more resources on addressing poverty and
unemployment. The current domestic debt of Kenyan government
mounts up to 2.8 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rubin who has heightened the need for debt relief for the
poorer countries he visited on his trip, however, showed little
sympathy for Kenya which Clinton's visit to Africa bypassed.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, "is
not bad compared to many other developing countries," he said.
"By having done a good job, you have less need of relief than the
countries that are in worse shape."
</P>
<P>
Rubin also visited the Nairobi Stock Exchange. His visits to
the stock markets have a symbolic significance, for the exchange
houses are keen to attract American investors. Another aim of
Rubin's visit is to help establish more effective financial
markets in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the U.S. treasury boss and the following tour by
Secretary for Commerce William Daley in September are viewed as
build-ups on the momentum of President Bill Clinton's visit to
Africa in March, observers here say.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's six-nation African tour demonstrated U.S. interest
in the huge untapped African markets and its support for Africa's
efforts to attract the private sector in investment and bring
African economies into the global economy.
</P>
<P>
And Rubin's trip is seen as a continuation of publicizing
Washinton's shift-aid-to-trade Africa policy.
</P>
<P>
His visit came at a critical junction when the U.S. trade
deficit hit a record 15.75 billion U.S. Dollars in May as Asian
weakness slashed U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC),
Robert Rubin Monday signed a bilateral investment agreement with
the government of Cote d'Ivoire, a reforming but heavily-indebted
state.

<TEXT>
<P>
"This agreement represents an important step forward in the (
U.S.) adminstration's efforts to work with Cote d'Ivoire in its
effort to attract foreign investment and foster growth," Rubin
said after signing the agreement in Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
OPIC, as a self-sustaining federal agency, sells investment
services to American businesses expanding into some 140
developing nations and emerging markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, Rubin noted that South Africa has made
encouraging economic achievements after following sound fiscal
and monetary policies since the post-apartheid government took
power in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the pressure on the South African currency Rand,
Rubin who is a staunch opponent of controls on capital flows
despite the curraency crisis in the emerging markets said that
sound macro-economic policies were a prerequisite to achieving
stability in the currency market.
</P>
<P>
About two months of relentless speculative attack on the Rand
which has wiped some 25 percent off the currency's value against
the U.S. Dollar this year had pushed the interest rates to a
13-year low.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official noted he believed that privatization is the
most obvious and immediate way in which South Africa could
attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
In a speech in Soweto, Rubin expressed his hope that South
Africa and the U.S. will conclude a free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official also spent two hours in talks with finance
ministers from the 14-nation Southern African Development
Community (SADC) states in the west coastal town of Swakopmund in
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
They discussed what President Clinton's African trade and
investment partnership has to offer and share lessons learned
from the current Asian financial crisis, the U.S. embassy to
Namibia said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
A lesson of the experience of Asia and other developing
countries during last 25 years is that attracting private sector
capital is central to fostering growth, said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Sub-Saharan Africa attracted less than
three percent of total long-term private capital flows to
developing countries last year and the region remains heavily
dependent on concessional loans and grants from multilateral and
bilateral donors.
</P>
<P>
From Namibia, Rubin headed for Mozambique, one of the poorest
countries in the world and the first recipient of the World
Bank/IMF sponsored HIPC (heavily indebted poor countries)
initiative, a deal to reward reformist states with generous debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
In Maputo, Rubin praised the Mozambican government for having
done tremendous work in reforming the country's economy, saying
he would bring this message back home to the private sectors, the
corner stone for economic development.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Exports, Imports More Via Dire Dawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Various goods worth about 80
million U.S. Dollars have been imported and exported via Dire
Dawa located near eastern border with Djibouti during the 1997/98
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The quantity of goods imported into Ethiopia via Dire Dawa,
the second largest city in the country, during the reported
period exceeds that of the previous fiscal year by 37 percent
while that of exported items grew by 1.3 percent, according to
latest statistics available from the foreign trade branch of the
Dire Dawa Administration.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency Saturday reported that office
attributed the increase in the import and export of goods via
Dire Dawa to the tough control of contraband trade and the
banning of franco valuta to replace it with letter of credit.
</P>
<P>
The full utilization of the port of Djibouti for both import
and export trade because of its border conflicts with Eritrea has
greatly facilitated transport of goods, the office said.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of Ethio-Eritrean border dispute on May 6,
Ethiopia has diverted from Assab Port of Eritrea to Port of
Djibouti as its outlet. Assab port used to transport 70 percent
of Ethiopia's import and export goods.
</P>
<P>
Items exported via Dire Dawa include coffee, horticultural
produces, vegetables, cattle, and khat (a stimulant plant). Goods
imported via Dire Dawa include spare parts, medicinal drugs and
electrical equipment.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's 1997/98 fiscal year ended on July 7, 1998.

<HEADLINE> No Relation with Secret U.S. Anti-Iraq Plot: Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti First Deputy Premier
and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah said
Saturday that his country has nothing to do with a U.S plan to
topple the Iraqi regime.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah made this remark when asked about U.S. press and
television reports on a covert U.S. scheme to bring down the
government of President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The official Kuwait News Agency quoted the foreign minister as
saying "Kuwait has no relation with this subject."
</P>
<P>
"I repeat it once, twice and many times that Kuwait has nothing
to do with the Iraqi internal affairs," he added.
</P>
<P>
There were reports on U.S. press Friday that the Clinton
Administration is seeking approval from Congress for secret
operation to weaken and possibly overthrow Saddam.
</P>
<P>
The new authority "would go far beyond past CIA (Central
Intelligence Agency) efforts" to encourage internal resistance and
to mount covert operations inside Iraq, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wall Street Journal newspaper, the U.S.
administration has already sent Congress a classified notice
asking it to approve the use of secret contingency funds within
the defense and intelligence budget.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted unnamed government officials at the State
Department and Pentagon as saying that the initiative could
involve U.S. military personnel and take more than a year of
organizing before fully undertaken.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, the small and oil-rich neighbor of Iraq, was invaded
and occupied by Saddam's troops in August 1990, before being
liberated by U.S.-led allied forces in February 1991.

<HEADLINE> Iran: OIC Ministerial Meeting to Be Held in Rabat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced Saturday that the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) would hold a
ministerial meeting in Rabat, Morocco to discuss counter-measures
against the Israeli plan to expand Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to Tehran radio, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi said that Kamal Kharrazi, the foreign minister, would
preside over the ministerial meeting. However, he did not mention
when the meeting would be held.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the meeting would be convened upon the June
23 call by Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, in the capacity of
chairman of the 55-nation OIC.
</P>
<P>
Despite international outcry, Israeli government last month
approved the plan to enlarge Jerusalem's borders to include Jewish
settlements around Jerusalem, in an attempt to change its status.
</P>
<P>
The plan was construed by Iran as a hostile move to Judaize
Jerusalem by adding more Jewish people to the city's population.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani strongly
criticized Islamic countries for failing to give any response to
Iran's call for an emergency meeting on Israel's expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the OIC was formed with the aim to defend Muslims
around the world and it should not be indifferent to the destiny
of a Muslim nation - Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Warn Against Breach of Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The police Saturday reminded the
public that the "public order act" on the conduct of public
processions in Nigeria is still in force.
</P>
<P>
The members of the public wishing to stage any procession
should always apply for police permit under the law, the police
said in a statement here.
</P>
<P>
Citing recent development since the death of late politician
Moshood Abiola, the police said that the law had not been
repealed.
</P>
<P>
Riots erupted in southwest Nigerian cities, including Lagos, when
demonstrators protested against the death of Abiola in detention
Tuesday afternoon last week.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 people were killed in the three-day violence, with
many others injured and property damaged, according to the
police.
</P>
<P>
"In the interest of peace and security, members of the public
are advised to be law-abiding and go about their lawful
businesses," said the police statement, quoted by the News Agency
of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The police Friday outlawed the conduct of a prayer session at
the Tafawa Balewa square in central Lagos for the repose of the
soul of Abiola.
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, anti-riot police, backed up by heavily armed
soldiers, sealed off the main entrances to the square to prevent
its usage for the eight-day prayers, insisting that the gathering
was unauthorized.
</P>
<P>
Shops and markets on the Lagos island were closed, apparently
in compliance with the directives of the organizers of the
prayers called as Fidau.
</P>
<P>
The Diau prayers, which, however, took place in the sprawling
home of late Abiola, was attended by both Moslems and Christians
whose leaders rendered prayers in turn.
</P>
<P>
A police helicopter hovered above the venue from time to time
while several kilometers in the south of the city, one armored
tank and trucks were stationed in front of the main entrance of
the square.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Hails Syrian President's Visit to France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon on Saturday hailed Syrian
President Hefez al-Assad's visit to France, saying it would bring
about positive effects on Lebanon's reconstruction process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Syrian National News Agency, Lebanese
Information Minister Bassem Sabba said the Syrian president and
his French counterpart Jacques Chirac recognized Lebanon's
sovereignty and stressed the necessity of liberating south Lebanon
from Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad wrapped up a three-day visit to France, the first by a
Syrian president in 22 years, during the day.
</P>
<P>
Sabba said the two leaders called on Israel to comply with the
United Nations Security Council Resolution 425, which demands a
unilateral and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to endorse the resolution. But it
attached its troop pullback to Lebanon's security guarantees for
its northern border areas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which agree to coordinate their stances on
key issues, have rejected the offer. They insist that the
withdrawal be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the
claimed aim to protect its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Lebanon's Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The common stands of Syria and France will give Lebanon a
strong political momentum to promote its reconstruction process,
kicked off after the end of the 1975-1990 civil war, the Lebanese
official said.
</P>
<P>
France, which has traditional relations with both Lebanon and
Syria, wants to play an active role in helping break the deadlock
in the peace talks between the two Middle East countries on the
one hand, and Israel on the other.
</P>
<P>
Sabba said that Syria is one of the countries that always
stand with Lebanon whether in war or peace.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has about 40,000 troops in Lebanon as
peacekeepers, wants the return of the Golan Heights captured by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Marries Graca on Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela tied the knot happily with his long-time
sweetheart Graca Machel Saturday, which falls on his 80th
birthday, ending months of media speculation.
</P>
<P>
The two were married in a private ceremony at Mandela's
newly-bought residence in the northern suburb of Johannesburg
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokeswoman Priscilla Naidoo told reporters
outside the house that the ceremony was attended by dozens of
people, among whom were Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, Justice
Minister Dullah Omar, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and African
National Congress stalwart Walter Sisulu.
</P>
<P>
Omar served as the best man and Mbeki was the witness of the
marriage. Mandela's sister and Graca's three brothers also
attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, which lasted about an hour, was presided over by
Methodist Bishop Mvume Dandala, Naidoo said. But priests from
different denominations -- Moslem, Hindu -- were also present at
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Graca first signed the papers and then exchanged
vows. After Dandala pronounced them man and wife, they kissed
each other, said Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
Graca, widow of late Mozambican President Samora Machel, will
keep her surname after the new marriage and she will shuttle
between Mozambique and South Africa as before, Mbeki announced at
a news conference in Pretoria Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Graca Machel, 52, was trained as a lawyer and is one of the
most influential figures in Mozambique, notably as an
international campaigner for children's rights.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and the new First Lady will make their first public
appearance at a grand birthday celebration in Midrand, Gauteng,
on Sunday. Graca will also company Mandela on his state visit to
Brazil Monday. Naidoo declined to confirm whether the couple
would have a honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people gathered outside Mandela's white house in
the Houghton suburb to give their best wishes for the newly-weds.
A group of black women were singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
Many of the crowd, including dozens of reporters and
cameramen, had been waiting there for hours. But the couple did
not appear.
</P>
<P>
Mandela met Graca in Mozambique in 1990 shortly after
Mandela's release from prison. They went public about their
relationship last year.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said in a television interview in February that he was
"blooming like a flower" because of Graca's love.
</P>
<P>
But the two have always scotched rumors of marriage, even when
Desmond Tutu publicly but light-heartedly castigated them for
setting a bad example to the youth of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the presidential office again denied that the two
would marry on Saturday, saying they would not marry "in the near
future."
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who got divorced from his second wife, Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela in 1996, had indicated earlier that the
reluctance to marry came from Graca Machel.
</P>
<P>
Mandela married his first wife Evelyn in 1944.

<HEADLINE> German Politicians Call for International Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Leading German politicians including
Chancellor Helmut Kohl Saturday called for strengthened
international cooperation to crack down on child pornography on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German Sunday newspaper Welt am
Sonntag which was released in advance, Kohl said that he was
"shocked" by a recent founding in the Netherlands that an
international child pornography ring had exploited toddlers as
young as one year old and distributed their images worldwide via
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of print photographs and computer disks with child
pornography images were confiscated during a raid on an apartment
in the Dutch seaside town of Zandvoort owned by a German man who
was shot dead in Italy after tipping off police to the pornography
ring, a Belgian citizen group investigating the case announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said that the new founding highlighted the need for an
intensification of international cooperation on protecting the
children from sexual abuses.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel meanwhile called on the
European Union to suggest an international legal convention
against child pornography on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The latest founding of on-line child pornography had actually
opened up a new dimension for international legal authorities,
something which cannot be dealt with by just one country, Waigel
said.
</P>
<P>
German Research Minister Juergen Ruettgers on Saturday also
called on members of the United Nations to negotiate an "Internet
code of conduct" to provide regulations on materials disseminated
over the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Iran, EU Start First Talks in More Than a Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU) delegation
started its first round of talks with Iranian Foreign Ministry
officials Saturday afternoon, the first of its kind in more than a
year, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged views on of the Middle East, the
Persian Gulf, Iraq, Afghanistan, Central Asia and the Balkans in a
"positive and constructive" atmosphere, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Their two-hour-long talks also focused on cooperation between
Iran and the EU countries, it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official news agency IRNA reported that Iranian
deputy foreign minister for Euro-American affairs, Morteza
Sarmadi, expressed hope that the negotiations would be fruitful
and constructive.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, he hailed the "constant effort" by Britain,
the previous EU chairman, to arrange the current negotiations
instead of the former "critical dialogue" between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks offered a new framework other than the
previous dialogue, which he said had "shortcomings in the manner
and content" and had been used "as a leverage to pressure Iran."
</P>
<P>
The EU started the purported "critical dialogue" with Iran in
December, 1992 with the aim to soften Tehran's policies on the
Middle East peace process, international terrorism and weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
After seven rounds of talks, the dialogue was suspended in
April, 1997 after a Berlin court verdict accused Iranian leaders
of being behind a terrorist assassination of Iranian dissidents in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
In March, the EU decided to resume talks with Iran after the
two sides brought their diplomatic row over the Berlin court
ruling to an end.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member EU delegation, led by secretary general of the
Austrian Foreign Ministry, Albert Rohan, arrived here Saturday
morning and will meet Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The so-called troika team included senior diplomats from
Britain, Austria and Germany, representing the past, present and
future holders of the EU's rotating presidency.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Satellite to Relay Palestinian TV Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will relay programs of the
Palestinian Television via the Nilesat, its first communications
satellite, as of next year, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
(MENA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Coordinator General of the Palestinian Radio and Television
Hisham Makki was quoted as saying the Egyptian Nilesat Company has
agreed to lease a channel to the Palestinian Television at a
nominal price.
</P>
<P>
Makki said the Palestinian Space Council has approved the plan.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian technical committee will be set up to complete
discussion and implementation of the project, which is expected to
be carried out from January 1999.
</P>
<P>
The unique opportunity for the Palestinians to rent a space
channel at a reasonable price confirms the role of Egypt and its
media in continuing support for the Palestinian cause and the
Palestinian people, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Television has been broadcasting programs from
the Palestinian self-rule city of Gaza for three years.
</P>
<P>
The Nilesat, which started test transmission on May 31, has 50
general and specialized television channels. Egypt has signed
contracts with Libya and Oman on leasing space channels, and
another contract with Lebanon is expected to be inked soon.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticizes Republicans for Opposing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- In a speech to his Democrats in
Arkansas -- his home state, U.S. President Bill Clinton Saturday
bashed the Republican-controlled Congress for opposing Democrats'
"whole agenda."
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable," Clinton was quoted by The Associated Press
as saying about Republican efforts to stop his program for putting
100,000 additional police officers on the streets even as the
national crime rates fall.
</P>
<P>
Appearing at a meeting of the Arkansas State Democratic
Committee, Clinton said Democrats need to find not just good
candidates but candidates with good ideas.
</P>
<P>
Clinton cited examples of changes his administration has fought
for against Republican opposition since 1993.
</P>
<P>
"We have proved what works in education, and yet, they're still
saying `no' to smaller classes, `no' to better school buildings,
`no' to so many of our efforts to improve the education of our
children," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He listed other issues that have drawn partisan opposition,
including his administration's environmental priorities and its
proposal for a health care patient's bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
"By and large, our whole agenda is being opposed by the leaders
of the other party," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Orders to Purchase Wheat to Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Saturday the government is buying 2.5 million tons of wheat
to prop up prices.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio address from Little Rock, Arkansas, where he
is spending the weekend, Clinton said, "America's farm families
face a crisis, and we have an obligation to help."
</P>
<P>
"Our farmers face a difficult and dangerous moment," Clinton
said, noting that falling prices have taken a toll on farming
communities across the country.
</P>
<P>
"Many farm families have been pushed off their land, and many
more could suffer the same fate unless our nation revives its
commitment to helping farmers weather hard times," the president
was quotaed by AP as saying.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, Clinton said the government will buy within
days 80 million bushels of wheat, or about 2.5 million tons, which
he said could lift prices as much as 13 cents a bushel. A bushel
of wheat sells for about 2.75 U.S. dollars, down sharply from a
year earlier as domestic supplies soared and Asia's economic crisis
depressed important wheat export markets.
</P>
<P>
The president also urged Congress to take additional action to
help farmers. Among his suggestions are expanding eligibility for
direct and guaranteed loans and helping replenish the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to stabilize Asian economies.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government to Review 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said on Sunday that his administration will review the 1999
national budget proposed by the previous government of former
president Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he will present to Congress on July 27 a budget
program in conformity with his campaign commitment of allotting
large portions to agricultural modernization and social services
to the poor.
</P>
<P>
He said an overhaul of the 1999 budget was needed in the wake
of the revenue collection shortfall during the first quarter of
1998 and the continuing ill-effects of the regional currency
crisis on the economy.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's budget and economic team is currently scrutinizing
the proposed 1999 budget because revenue targets set by the
previous administration have become unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that revenues collected during the
first four months of 1998 stood at only 147.5 billion pesos (3.6
billion U.S. dollars), way below the target of 159.7 billion pesos
(3.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The administration may have to trim the proposed 1999 budget to
reduce deficit spending without sacrificing Estrada's pro-poor
agenda of creating jobs and lowering the prices of basic
commodities.
</P>
<P>
The government is also eyeing a set of revenue-generating
measures which include privatizing cash-strapped state-owned and
-controlled corporations, abolishing the pork barrel of both the
executive and legislative branches and eradicating corruption in
the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
The overhauled 1999 budget to be presented to the new congress
when it opens on July 27 forms part of a three-year budget
framework being worked out by the administration with legislative
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 budget program was one of the legislative measures
included in the priority agenda of the Estrada administration
during his first 100 days in office.

<HEADLINE> ILO Calls for Elimination of Violence at Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) has called on policy-makers in government
agencies, employers' and workers' organizations and other experts
to make efforts to repudiate violence and remove it from the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
France, Argentina, Romania, Canada and England have reported
the highest rates of physical assaults and sexual harassment on
the job, said the ILO in a report to be published here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bullying and ganging up or mobbing are major forms of
non-physical violence, often referred to as psychological
violence, which has been emerging in workplaces in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The number of people working alone is increasing globally
because of automation, subcontracting, teleworking, networking and
the other new self-employment.
</P>
<P>
For those working alone, taxi drivers in many countries are at
the greatest risk of violence. Those working alone in small shops,
gas stations and kiosks are easy targets by aggressors. And those
working alone outside normal hours (cleaners, maintenance or
repair staff) appear at special risk of suffering physical and
sexual attacks.
</P>
<P>
Women are especially at risk, because so many are concentrated
in the high-risk occupations, particularly as teachers, social
workers, nurses, and bank and shop workers.
</P>
<P>
The ILO urged the interested parties to take immediate
preventive measures to contain the effects of violence and to draw
up a long-term plan against violence at work because the
consequences of violence are also long-term.

<P>
MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is committed to
plans to establish an ASEAN satellite television channel by the
year 2000 that would showcase the region's preparedness to be a
major player in global economic and political affairs, Press
Secretary Rodolfo Reyes said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The six other members of the nine-member Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have also agreed to set up the
satellite channel, Reyes told reporters. But he did not name these
countries.
</P>
<P>
The satellite channel is expected to provide ASEAN members with
a medium that will provide the international community with a
balanced view and insider's look about developments in the region,
instead of relying on reports by the American and European media,
he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia,
Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, Myanmar and Laos.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said initial plans for the establishment of the channel
were firmed up during the 5th Conference of the ASEAN Ministers
Responsible for Information held last year in the Thai capital of
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report submitted to him by the Philippine delegation
to the meeting, Reyes said the ASEAN ministers emphasized the
urgent need for the satellite channel in view of the currency
turmoil sweeping the region.
</P>
<P>
Another meeting will be held by the ministers in October this
year in Singapore to discuss preparations for the satellite
channel's operations.

CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian diplomat
downplayed here Sunday the significance of the renewed
Israeli-Palestinian talks later the day, the Egyptian Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Zhohdi al-Qudra told
reporters here that the Palestinians did not expect any
breakthrough from the talks held between top Palestinian official
Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai in
Tel Aviv late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian side is waiting for actions, not words, from
the Israeli government which is used to making promises without
fulfilling them," al-Qudra said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians insist that Israel withdraw from an additional
13 percent of the West Bank as proposed in a widely reported
initiative put forward by the United States, al-Qudra said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority has already adopted the
U.S. proposal, but Israel has rejected citing security
concerns. Israel has said that it would not accept any
redeployment exceeding 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qudra believed that Israel agreed to hold the talks mainly
due to the international pressures, including the intensified Arab
diplomatic pressure led by Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's meeting will be the first high-level direct contact
between the two sides in months, and it is aimed at breaking the
16-month-old deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

<P>
ANKARA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) have killed 40 civilians in northern Iraq,
the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
PKK militants attacked five villages in northern Iraq Saturday,
causing the deaths, the agency quoted a radio report of Iraq's
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were women and children, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The KDP claimed that PKK militants kill an average of a dozen
civilians daily in northern Iraq, accusing the PKK of being "the
largest obstacle" to peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish
state in the southeast of Turkey. It has sought shelter in
northern Iraq since 1991 when the Iraqi government was rendered
ineffective to control the area after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
According to the Turkish official figures, there are about
2,500 PKK guerrillas in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> India, US to Hold Third Round of Talks on Nuke Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott was to arrive here Sunday evening for the third
round of talks with the Indian side on the nuclear issue scheduled
to begin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The visit will be the first one to India by a high-ranking
American official since New Delhi conducted five nuclear tests on
May 11 and 13 this year, drawing strong condemnation from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Talbott and the Indian Prime Minister's special envoy Jaswant
Singh met in Washington on June 12 and in Frankfurt on July 9 to
discuss issues of mutual concern including disarmament and nuclear
non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
At the two rounds of talks, New Delhi's stand to have a minimum
nuclear deterrent was rejected by Washington which has insisted
that India must sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
immediately and unconditionally, a position termed as unacceptable
by New Delhi. India is expected to get down to some hard
bargaining with the United States in the third round of talks on
issues of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
The Indo-U.S. talks here assume significance as they come 10
days ahead of a crucial meeting between Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif on the
fringes of a three-day summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to be held in Colombo on July 29-31.
</P>
<P>
Officials here have termed as premature prospects of a major
breakthrough in the third round, saying that the dialogue process
has just got under way and no overnight results could be expected.
</P>
<P>
As part of his special mission to South Asia, Talbott will also
travel to Pakistan on Tuesday to continue his talks with Pakistani
leaders on these issues.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ruling Party's National Congress Ushers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The first national congress of
the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) of Uganda ushers in
a new era for the east African country.
</P>
<P>
At the five-day conference which ended last Friday, 1,554
delegates from across the country had elected their party leaders
and made some important decisions which will promote the
country's political unity and the build up of its economic
strengthen.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the conference, President Yoweri Museveni
and Al Hajji Moses Kigongo were uanimously elected as NRM's
chairperson and vice-chairperson respectively.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the they were elected to these
posts, although they had been holding the posts before the
election.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker James Wapakhabulo was made the National
Political Commissar of NRM, the number three position in the
hierarchy of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Wapakhabulo, who was reportedly Musevini's room mate at Dar es
Salaam University in Tanzania, is a new face in the party
leadership.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders of the ruling party are energetic,
optimistic and reform-minded.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the elections will strengthen
political unity within the party, which will contribute to the
country's stability and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The conference also makes some strategic decisions which set
the political and economic direction for the country to go in the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
The party has decided to enhance the pace of industrialization
and agricultural modernization by improving national security,
fighting corruption and developing the country's trade and
commerce.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the main targets of the party, Museveni stressed the
need to develop the national economy and implement universal
primary education in the country.
</P>
<P>
The women and youths should receive education at rural levels
so that they can be turned into productive workers for the
society, said the Ugandan president.
</P>
<P>
In a long speech presented to delegates for discussion, he
noted that political unity is of great importance in forging
economic integration in the region.
</P>
<P>
Political unity is the guarantee to economic development and
regional integration, Musevini asserted.
</P>
<P>
He suggested setting up an East African Union just like one in
Europe, which can unite the countries in the region into a whole.
</P>
<P>
African states were colonized in the past because they were
separate and not united in front of common enemies, the Ugandan
president said, adding that the war between the hostile ethnic
groups is another hindrance to development.
</P>
<P>
Only when the different ethnic groups in Uganda are truly
united, can the country really develop and prosper, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Musevini also expressed his determination to wipe out the
rebels in northern and western Uganda because they are posing a
big threat to the national security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has decided to further cut the size of its army to save
money for the troops to be better equipped. The 26-percent
increase of its defense budget is another effort aimed at
enhancing the army's capability.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, NRM elected its leaders for the first time
since it took power in January 1986, demonstrating one step
forward in the country's democracy process.
</P>
<P>
With democracy and unity within the party further
strengthened, it can be expected that NRM's goals, political
or economic, will be realized in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier on Taihu Lake's Anti-Pollution Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao has
emphasized that the goals for controlling pollution of the Taihu
Lake must be reached within the period and to the requirements set
by the central government.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier made his remarks at a work meeting on curbing
pollution in the Taihu Lake area, which was held here last Friday
and attended by officials from the central departments and Jiangsu
and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Wen, also a Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the CPC Central
Committee Secretariat, praised the lake area for its enormous
economic achievements and contributions to the country in the past
two decades.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the area is weak ecologically and
environmentally, with a highly density urban area population.
</P>
<P>
For a long time the area paid greater attention to development
and less to the importance of protection, resulting in backward
anti-pollution facilities, excessive pollution of surface water
and the overuse of groundwater, according to the vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
This environmental pollution and ecological deterioration
threatened and hampered economic and social development in the
lake area, Wen noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, it is an opportune time now for the local
governments to launch their anti-pollution programs this year,
since the Party Central Committee and the State Council have made
environmental projects an important element for enlarging domestic
demands and strengthening the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Beginning on January 1 next year, all pollution sources located
in the lake area must stop discharging pollutants into the lake
and its related rivers, while efforts are being made to step up
the building of anti-pollution projects in the area, Wen said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Australian Planes Sent to PNG's Tidal Wave-Hit Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia Sunday sent three Air
Force C130 Hercules aircraft loaded with medical and food supplies
on an urgent mission to help survivors of a devastating tsunami
which struck Papua New Guinea (PNG) Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The tidal wave smashed into the northwestern coastline near the
town of Aitape in West Sepik province, killing at least 600
people, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan told reporters in
Adelaide that Australia's aid agency, AusAid, estimated the final
toll would be well over 1,000, with many thousands injured and as
many as 6,000 left homeless.
</P>
<P>
Two Hercules aircraft left the Richmond airforce base,
north-west of Sydney, in the afternoon, while another plane took
off from Townsville. The planes were due to arrive Sunday night
and fly out to the devastated region Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the aircraft were ferrying 60 medical personnel
with the aim of setting up a mobile hospital in the area. However,
he said that how quickly the medical crew could get to work would
depend on whether the landing strip at Wanimo was long enough for
the C130s to land and the possibility of further earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
"It's very rough terrain and our problem is finding an area we
can land and get in our equipment," he was quoted by the
Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Defense ministry spokesman Colonel Keith Jobson said that even
when the planes touched down at the airstrip, the defense
personnel would still have to use helicopters or road transport to
access the stricken villages.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer described the events in PNG
as "horrific", saying Australia would do all it could to help PNG
cope with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be further liaising with the Papua New Guinea government
to provide realistic help in those circumstances," he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Clone Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists will shock the
world again if the world's first Dolly-like giant panda is cloned
within the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has announced the cloning
of a giant panda within five years as a key project, according to
Chen Dayuan, a researcher at the Research Institute of Animals
under the CAS, and project leader of the program.
</P>
<P>
"China will be able to use trans-species cloning technology to
create a panda. This will be much more complex and difficult than
the intra-species cloning done by British and Japanese scientists,
who cloned sheep and cattle respectively," the Chinese scientist
said in an interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
A panda calf will be reproduced by the cell of an adult panda
being planted into an egg cell, with the nucleus removed, of an
animal other than a panda, Chen explained.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is an endangered animal and Chinese scientists
hope that cloning technology can help the rare species to thrive
in the wild, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
There are now fewer than 1,000 giant pandas living in the wild,
and Chinese scientist have been attempting to create more pandas
through artificial propagation since the early 1960s. But
artificial propagation alone will not effectively stop the decline
of the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, Chen first successfully introduced the
method of using frozen sperm and eggs to reproduce pandas. Some 24
pandas have been born this way in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
American scientists also suggested cloning the giant panda
earlier this year. Chen said that research on the cloning project
will be done soon if the program secures sufficient funding.

<HEADLINE> Feature:  Rosy Signs for Political Settlement in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 19 (Xinhua) -- An atmosphere of optimism is
hovering around the Somali capital ahead of the coming event of
the opening of Mogadishu's air and sea ports as pledged by the
faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
Addilatif Afdub, spokesman for the faction leaders, announced
in Nairobi Saturday that a central authority to run the air and
sea ports of the war-scarred Somali capital Mogadisu is to be
established early next week.
</P>
<P>
Even though the dedication of the faction leaders did not come
true on Saturday as anticipated by many of the politicians, the
enthusiasm of the people is still there.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of small business owners have gone to the main sea port
in Mogadishu to open their stalls around the main gate of the
facility.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 small pubs, teashops and khat kiosks are already
opened, ready for making fortune at the start of the opening of
the sea port.
</P>
<P>
Many of the fortune seekers expressed their happiness over the
restoration of these abandoned facilities while the guarding
militiamen had shown indifference to the activities going on
around them.
</P>
<P>
A very good sign for political settlement is the
reconciliation and collaboration between the two faction leaders,
Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Osman Ali Atto who had not been in good
terms in wake of the incident that 10 International Commission of
Red Cross (ICRC) aid workers were kidnaped in North Mogadishu in
April this year.
</P>
<P>
Even though there are still a few more hurdles to overcome and
difficult tasks to be performed, the hope for a political
settlement in Mogadishu has been growing stronger ever since the
faction leaders had returned from their five-day trip to Libya
last week.
</P>
<P>
The new wave of hope in Mogadishu has especially been
encouraged by a meeting between the faction leaders of the
capital and a breakaway group who had only been brought back to
the negotiating table Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The peace brokers including Mohamed, Aidid and Atto, had
persuaded the breakaway group to accept the current peace deal
for the establishment of the Mogadishu's administration.
</P>
<P>
The authority will involve an equivalent of municipal
government comprising the sea and air ports of Mogadishu and the
adjoining districts, an area commonly known as the Benadir
region.
</P>
<P>
Abdishakur Ga'al Issak, one of the peace lovers in the
capital, said that the leaders now seem to be serious about the
pacification of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that the faction leaders work together
in persuading another opposition group for the common good," said
Issak, a former officer in the ministry of education.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Seeks Private Sector Help in Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Tourism Secretary Gemma
Cruz-Araneta has urged the private sector to extend strong support
for the government's tourism development programs, particularly in
the domestic front.
</P>
<P>
Cruz-Araneta made the call during the fourth general membership
meeting of the Philippine Travel Tours Association (Philtoa) held
here this weekend, the Philippine News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cruz-Araneta said the call for the strong private assistance is
in line with the policy directions of President Joseph Estrada's
pro-people and anti-poverty policy.
</P>
<P>
In her speech to the meeting, Cruz-Araneta said she will employ
the 10-point objectives of the Estrada administration as
guidelines for effective devices in tourist development.
</P>
<P>
She also stressed that she would continue to develop ecotourism
as well as agri-tourism in already identified communities.
</P>
<P>
The new tourism secretary hoped to establish better linkages
with the private sector in order to make things work at the
tourism department.
</P>
<P>
She hoped to boost domestic tourism in the country, believing
that people in the rural areas stand to benefit most when urban
dwellers unravel the many attractions of the countryside than
travelling to some overseas destinations.
</P>
<P>
She said the tourism department would also strive to boost
in-bound tourism because this is a dollar-earner industry.
</P>
<P>
She also emphasized the need to promote income-generating
programs that will contribute to the economic resources of the
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- An inaugural ceremony was held
Friday to mark the start of construction of a software development
center in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province, with financing
from the Toshiba Corporation of Japan and the Shenyang Oriental
Software Group of China.
</P>
<P>
In July 1996, Toshiba Corporation and the Oriental Software
Group, an industrial business run by Northeast China University,
started a joint venture to research and develop computer software.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the joint venture had completed 85 such
projects, earning one million U.S. dollars in exports.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors decided in March to increase investment
by adding four million U.S. dollars, bringing the total to five
million, with the hope of gaining an edge in China's computer
market.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the new center is an important part of this
plan. The center, located in the Shenyang high-tech development
zone, a state-designated software production base, is being built
on an area of 2.5 hectares.
</P>
<P>
When completed, it will have a total floor space of 6,500
square meters, and will be a modern plaza employing 400 workers.

<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton announced Saturday that he is
ordering the Agriculture Department to buy 80 million bushels of
wheat from U.S. farmers that desperately need food aid.
</P>
<P>
The new program, he said in Arkansas in his weekly radio
address, would both ease farm troubles at home and alleviate mass
starvation overseas.
</P>
<P>
-- Facing the long shot threat of losing control of the House,
Republican congressional leaders have adopted a legislative
program designed to boost Election Day turnout among social
conservatives and speed the flow of campaign cash from the
corporate community.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- With an eye to the November elections, to the 2000
Presidential campaign and perhaps to his own legacy, President

<HEADLINE> Work Conference On Deng Xiaoping Theory Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The three-day national work
conference on the study of Deng Xiaoping Theory came to an end
today with a call to further arm and educate the Communist Party
of China (CPC) and the people with the theory.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guan'gen, Member of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee Political Bureau, spoke at the closing
ceremony. He urged making Deng Xiaoping Theory a spiritual pillar
and a guide for the great cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Ding, also Member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and
Head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee,
said that efforts must be made toward a thorough and correct
understanding and mastering of the scientific system of Deng
Xiaoping Theory and the essence of the Fifteenth CPC National
Congress.
</P>
<P>
For the further study of Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Marxist
style of learning must be adopted by persist efforts to study
theory in combination with practice, and to emancipate the mind
ideologically and seek truth from facts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Study must be integrated with the reality of the country's
reform, opening and modernization, in order to resolve the evident
contradictions and problems in current economic and social life,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for firm persistence in the Party's principal theory
and political line, with economic construction at the core, and for
remaining in concert with the CPC Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core, ideologically and politically.
</P>
<P>
During the past three days, the participants studied a keynote
speech delivered by Jiang Zemin at the opening of the conference
and a circular on studying Deng Xiaoping Theory issued by the CPC

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Reform Revenue Collection Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
will push for the professionalization of the government's revenue
collection agencies through structural reforms, pay increases and
the swift and harsh punishment against corrupt employees.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive review of the bureaus of internal revenue and
customs will form part of Estrada's 100 days of "people's agenda"
which he will present to Congress on its opening session on July
27, the Philippine News Agency said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The review will be an initial step to improve tax
administration and stop the steady drop in revenue collections,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Estrada administration's proposal to Congress includes the
review of the organizational structure, processes and pay scales
at the two collection bureaus.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has also proposed hiring performance-based executives
and making the two bureaus independent from the civil service.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's action agenda also includes raising the salaries of
both the officers and the rank-and-file in the two bureaus to make
these more competitive with the rates in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Corrupt and dishonest officials and employees, however, will be
dealt with swiftly and punished harshly in accordance with the
law.
</P>
<P>
The weeding out of corrupt civil servants in the two bureaus is
also part of Estrada's pledge to mount a full-scale anti-graft
drive during his six-year term.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has said that there was an immediate need to institute
reforms in the two collection agencies to restore confidence in
his administration's ability to manage the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Collections by the two bureaus fell way below the government
targets during the first quarter of 1998, largely due to the
economic downturn induced by the regional currency crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Omani Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Yousef Bin Alawi arrived in Jeddah Sunday on a
surprise visit to Saudi Arabia to discuss a border dispute, the
Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Alawi brought a letter from Omani Prime Minister Sultan Qaboos
Bin Said to Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz. The letter
was related to the border demarcation agreement between Oman and
Yemen which Saudi Arabia said transgressed parts of its territory,
the agency quoted diplomatic sources in Jeddah as saying.
</P>
<P>
Oman was seeking to explain to Saudi leaders its official stance
toward the controversial border agreement in attempt to prevent
any negative consequences on its relations with Riyadh, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia said last Friday that it has filed two
memorandums to the United Nations and the Arab League (AL) in
order to preserve its rights and interests in view of the
existence of common borders with Oman and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Last week Saudi Arabia lodged a protest to the Pan Arab
Organization against the Omani-Yemeni border deal, "saying it
transgressed parts of Saudi territory."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia declared it "will not recognize any rights
resulting from the deal that transgressing its rights."
</P>
<P>
In its strong reaction, Yemen accused Riyadh of launching
aggression against its territory, a charge that has been denied by
Saudi leaders.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia demanded that any border dispute between Saudi
Arabia and Yemen be solved through the joint borders committee
formed under the 1995 Memorandum of Understanding and not "through
the statements that impede the quest for solutions."

<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
voiced concern on Sunday over the escalation of military conflicts
in Afghanistan, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Iran's special envoy for the Afghan affairs
Alaeddin Boroujerdi, Khatami expressed regret over the siege of the
central region of Afghanistan and the death of innocent people as
a result of food shortages.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to provide relief aids
to the war-torn Afghanistan and save the innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi, who paid a visit recently to Afghanistan, briefed
Khatami on the latest international diplomatic efforts to help
solve the Afghan crisis and the latest developments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Following a military setback of the Afghan Northern Alliance
in the strategic northwestern province of Faryab, Boroujerdi went
to Mazar-i-Sharif to discuss the situation with the ousted Afghan
president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia of Afghanistan took over Maimana, capital
of Faryab Province, last Sunday, dealing a serious blow to the
Uzbek General Abdul Rashid Dostam.
</P>
<P>
Faryab was a major stronghold of Dostam, who joined the alliance
in September 1996 when Rabbani was driven out of Kabul, capital
of Afghanistan, by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said there could be no winner in the Afghan war, adding
this fact would help bring about understandings among the
belligerent sides.
</P>
<P>
Iran appreciated the joint efforts of the United Nations and
the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to settle the
Afghan crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president reiterated that Iran, as the current OIC
chairman and Afghanistan's neighbor, would spare no efforts to
help realize peace in the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Iron Giant Sees Profit Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Handan Iron and Steel
Group Co., Ltd, one of the largest iron makers in China, posted a
net profit of 200 million yuan (about 2.4 million U.S. dollars) in
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The company, in north China's Hebei Province, has set a goal of
500 million yuan in profits for this year. This will not be easy
to accomplish because of declining overseas demand, and the rising
cost of raw materials and electricity since the beginning of the
year.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the company's net profit
was only 41 million yuan due to these unfavorable market
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The company took measures to upgrade its technology, and
increased its daily production of liquid steel from 6,000 tons to
8,000 tons beginning this April. Handan Iron and Steel's annual
production capacity has now reached 2.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
As of April, the company's net profits have increased
considerably, according to Liu Hanzhang, chairman of the board of
and general manager of the company.

<HEADLINE> 2ndlead Writethru: Palestinians, Israelis Condemn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Both Palestinians and Israel on
Sunday condemned the attempted explosion in Jerusalem earlier in
the day, and at the same time tried to lower expectations for the
first direct talks between them in months.
</P>
<P>
The abortive terror attack occurred only hours before the direct
talks begin at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Palestinian Planning and International
Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath as saying that Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat condemned the attempted
terror attack in downtown Jerusalem Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the statement in Ramallah after Arafat met
with an Israeli peace group.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described
the attempted car bomb attack on the heart of Jerusalem as "very
serious." The incident strengthened Israel's insistence on
security components in any peace deals and the principle of
reciprocity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said at a news conference that Israeli government was
not satisfied with the current situation in which terror attacks
could occur "at any moment."
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians must carry out their parts of the deal
and not allow their territories to become bases for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police beefed up security in the city center after the
car bomb was defused shortly before it would explode. Police said
the incident took place at about 8:30 a.m. when a van caught fire
on the Jaffa Street and the policemen rushing in to the rescue
found "a large quantity of dangerous substances" in it.
</P>
<P>
Police said the driver, who was badly burned, came from the
West Bank. No further detail is not available.
</P>
<P>
Declining to confirm Israel Radio's reports that the van was
full of inflammable chemicals and detonative devices, Jerusalem
police chief Yair Yitzhaki said a terrible tragedy with heavy
casualties was fortunately averted.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinians and Israeli have tried to lower
expectations for their direct talks, saying the two sides will not
be able to wrap up an agreement in the meeting. They expected more
talks later in the week.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said at the news conference that Israel has "sincere
wish" to reach an agreement over the second redeployment and he
suggested continuous talks in order to clinch a deal as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
He countered media speculation that he was only maneuvering to
further put off a second Israeli redeployment in the West Bank
through purported "direct talks" by saying he has given Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai "total support" for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have stressed that they intend only to
listen to what Israel's new offers are at the talks, not to
renegotiate the 13.1 percent withdrawal proposed by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
They said the Palestinian side agreed to the meeting only
because they do not want to be blamed for the failure of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of direct talks was called upon by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who has failed to persuade
Netanyahu to buy the U.S. idea.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian direct negotiation talks broke down 16
months ago when Israel began building a Jewish settlement in the
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Although Palestinian officials said the "simplest, easiest and
only way" to revive the peace talks was for Israel to say yes to
the American proposal, so far little signs of optimism have
emerged from either side.
</P>
<P>
With the direct talks between Mordechai and PNA Deputy Chairman
Abu Mazen only hours away, diplomatic and security sources said
the attack was planned in an attempt to retard the peace process,
and said they believe the militant resistance group Hamas was
behind the scheme.
</P>
<P>
Observers also noticed that it was almost exactly a year ago
that a suicide bomb attack killed 16 and injured scores of others
in an open market in Jerusalem. Hamas claimed it was responsible
for that attack.

<HEADLINE> Durban Beach Safe for Swimming: Shows Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Holidaymakers heading for
Durban in east South Africa can swim with confidence because a
latest seawater test has found the water off the port city
beaches is not badly polluted.
</P>
<P>
A latest report issued by the South African Bureau of
Standards said that the test along the Golden Mile last month
found there was little bacterial pollution and marginal sewage
effluent in the water.
</P>
<P>
The daily Sunday Times quoted the report as saying that this
contrasts with tests conducted in last November, which found the
sea water in Durban contained enough diluted sewage and bacteria
to give swimmers diarrhoea, gastroenteritis and mild infections
when swallowed.
</P>
<P>
Ted Burst, the Acting Chief Executive of Tourism Durban,
welcomed the test result, saying that the city would redouble its
efforts to acquire "blue flag" status, an international symbol of
purity granted to seaside resorts whose seawater passed stringent
microbiological tests.

AMMAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad
Anani left here Sunday for Tel Aviv to meet Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to review the latest developments of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Anani's visit to Tel Aviv came just one day after he met
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat in
the West Bank city Ramallah to help the Palestinians prepare for
their negotiations with Israel scheduled for Sunday, the first
direct contacts between the two sides in months.
</P>
<P>
Anani, also deputy prime minister for development affairs,
confirmed Saturday that he reviewed with the Palestinian officials
"chances of holding contacts with Israel."
</P>
<P>
Jordan is determined to resume efforts towards ending the
present stalemate on the Palestinian-Israeli track, said Anani.
</P>
<P>
Also in Tel Aviv on Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and PNA Deputy head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) will open
the negotiations to discuss the possibility of implementing a
peace proposal put forward by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. in its proposal calls on Israel to withdraw from 13.1
percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the
proposal, while Israel has rejected it on grounds.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been deadlocked
since March last year when Israel began the construction of a Jewish
settlement in the Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Northwest City Becomes Important Rolls-Royce Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Rolls-Royce's joint venture in Xi'an
has become one of the company's major producers of aviation engine
components, thanks to the past four months of its superb
performance.
</P>
<P>
Bob Pitt, general manager of Xi'an XR Aerocomponents Co.,
Ltd. (XRA), has briefed Xinhua on the joint venture's objectives
for the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
The annual turnover of XRA by the year 2000 is expected to be
25 million U.S. dollars, according to Pitt, and the figure for
2004 is estimated at 35 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
XRA is the only state-of-the-art civil aeroengine component
manufacturer in China, invested in jointly by Rolls-Royce and
Xi'an Aeroengine Corp., China's largest aeroengine producer.
</P>
<P>
The major components in the production process are regarded as
the most advanced in the world, said Jia Fei, commercial manager
of XRA.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture provides 24 components for engines powering
major civil and military airplanes such as Fokker 100, Gulfstream
IV and Boeing 727-100s. XRA's products are exported to
Rolls-Royce aeroengine assembly lines in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The British Duke of Gloucester visited XRA last Friday, and
said he was "very impressed" by the company's sound development.
</P>
<P>
The achievements of the production line at XRA is evidence that
some Chinese-made aeroengine components and parts have met
international standards, and this represents major progress
for China's aviation industry, he added.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 30-million-dollar investment of XRA, Xi'an
Aeroengine Corp. contributed 51 percent, and the remaining 49
percent of the shares are held by Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts noted that funding and technological support
are crucial to China's aeroengine industry, and investment and
technology introduced by Rolls-Royce, an industry leader, will
help bring China closer to current international standards.

<P>
BAGHDAD, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Sunday slammed the
reported U.S. government plan to seek Congress' approval of the
use of secret contingency funds for operations to weaken and
possibly overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman with the Ministry of Information and Culture said
the United States has, since 1990, tried all means of economic,
military, political and psychological warfare and aggression
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the U.S. government had reaped nothing but
disappointment, disgrace and isolation among people in the United
States and the world.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal newspaper reported Friday that the
Clinton administration had sent a classified notice to Congress,
asking it to allow the use of secret contingency funds for covert
anti-Saddam operations.
</P>
<P>
The American newspaper also disclosed that a recent State
Department report to Congress outlined plans to establish an Iraqi
center in suburban London and to support future conference for the
opposition in exile.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman, who was not identified, said that the
U.S. government had tended to leak such information on Central
Intelligence Agency's contact and coordination with brokers of the
Iraqi opposition abroad.
</P>
<P>
This would only invite more contempt for those who had become
agents and mercenaries of the U.S. government, he added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Continue Rice Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has planned to
import some two million tons of rice in 1999 due to the spillover
effects of El Nino and La Nina phenomena and the projected
increase in consumption, the Philippine News Agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
National Food Authority (NFA) Administrator Eduardo Nonato
Joson was quoted as saying that even without drought and
devastating floods, the rice production shortfall is estimated at
700,000 to one million tons yearly.
</P>
<P>
"Importation will be still critical next year because of our
low productive capacity. The worst case scenario would be minimum
of one million metric tons and maximum of two million metric tons
of rice imports again for 1999," Joson said.
</P>
<P>
NFA Deputy Administrator Gregorio Tan said that if La Nina,
sister of El Nino, hits the country, the volume of imported rice
may be less than one million tons.
</P>
<P>
La Nina, which is expected to bring more rains to the country,
may allow greater farm land to be planted next year, Tan
explained.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has already imported more than 1.2 million tons
of rice this year due to the severe dry spell caused by the El
Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Joson said the country may import a total of 2.1 million tons
of rice in 1998, including the proposed additional 300,000 tons
whose importation depends on the effects of La Nina. The bulk of
the rice imports this year will be sourced from Vietnam and China.

<P>
Local officials attribute the achievement to the efforts to
implement a program designed to introduce industrialized farming
and concerted efforts the city has made since 1993 to improve the
marketing network.
</P>
<P>
The formation of major enterprises featuring the combination of
production, processing, information, scientific research and
services are the key factors to realizing industrialized farming
and bringing more farm produce to the market, according to
officials.
</P>
<P>
The city's 300 such major farm produce enterprises with annual
sales of some 10 million yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) each have
played a vital role in establishing production bases, with rural
households entering the market in an organized manner.
</P>
<P>
Local governments in Yantai have not only expanded
industrialized farming, but also extended great effort to build a
marketing network for farm and sideline products. The existing
network consists of rural and urban free markets, regional
wholesale markets, specialized markets and retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city has set up more than 600 farm products
market of various kinds, with some 70 percent of the city's rural
households using related facilities to sell the fruits of their
labor.
</P>
<P>
The markets have enabled Yantai city to export 130,000 tons of
fruit, 150,000 tons of vegetables and 100,000 tons of aquatics
annually, according to officials.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Securities Market Grows Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The securities market in the
largest economic and financial center in China continued to
develop steadily in the first half of this year despite the
increasing pressure of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The number of firms listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE)
had reached 417 by the end of June, and overall share value hit more
than 1.1 trillion yuan, up 18 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
A total of 24.6 billion yuan was raised from the securities
market in Shanghai in the first six months through issues of
shares and securities, investment funds, and rights issues.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Composite Stock Exchange closed at 1,339.206
points at the end of June, up 12 percent from the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Management of the securities market was also improved in the
first half of the year. The China Securities Regulatory
Commission, the securities market watchdog, and the SSE unveiled a
number of policies to standardize trading practices and tackle
stock market problems.
</P>
<P>
Stable market growth has helped to attract more
investors. Official statistics indicate that some 185.7 million
investors had opened trading accounts at the SSE by the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
An improving macroeconomy, government policies increasing
investment in infrastructure, and cuts in interest on bank
deposits and in stamp duties, among other factors, will combine to
create a better environment for the securities market in the
second half of this year, according to some experts.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
undertaken a program to build an extra tourism zone in the
southern part of the country, the Daily Star newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the Patuakhali district and bordering on the Bay of
Bengal, the Kuakata seashore resort with an 18-km-long sea beach
is turning into an attractive tourist spot, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on the resort began on March 14 this year.
</P>
<P>
The program with a cost of 13.8 million taka (294,000 U.S.
dollars) is being implemented by the Bangladesh Parjaton
Corporation (BPC), the national tourism organization of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The government is investing heavily in the tourism industry. It
plans to invest 2 billion taka (42.1 million dollars) to build
more hotels, restaurants and other tourist facilities in the
country's southeastern hill districts, and also to develop
exclusive tourist zones in several prospective sites for foreign
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The country earned 1.96 billion taka (about 41.7 million
dollars) from tourist arrivals during January-September 1997, up
123.7 percent from the previous corresponding period, according to
the latest BPC figures.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Anshan Iron and Steel
Corporation, the largest steel complex in China, said farewell to
the backward open hearth process by halting operation of its
last open hearth furnace last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The steel complex is located in Anshan City in northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Until 1996, when the company began to replace open hearth
furnaces with converters, its annual open hearth steel output was
over five million tons, 57.8 percent of its total and 40 percent
of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the steel firm has introduced advanced
technology and equipment to cut cost, raise efficiency
and reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
The money needed for the upgrading will be recovered in a year,
a company source says.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the company, with three steel plants, turns out
nearly 10 million tons of steel a year.

JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Both Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday
condemned the attempted explosion in Jerusalem earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The abortive terror attack took place only hours before the
first direct Israeli-Palestinians talks in months begin.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Palestinian Planning and International
Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath as saying that Arafat condemned
the attempted terror attack in downtown Jerusalem Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the statement in Ramallah after Arafat met
with an Israeli peace group.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Israel's Prime Minister's Office, Netanyahu
described the attempted car bomb attack on the heart of Jerusalem
as "very serious." The incident strengthened Israel's insistence
on security components in any peace deals and the principle of
reciprocity, he said.

Netanyahu said at a news conference that Israeli government was
not satisfied with the current situation in which terror attacks
could occur "at any moment."
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians must carry out their parts of the deal
and not allow their territories to become bases for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police beefed up security in the city center after the
car bomb was defused shortly before it would explode. Police said
the incident took place at about 8:30 a.m. when a van caught fire
on the Jaffa Street and the policemen rushing in to the rescue
found "a large quantity of dangerous substances" in it.
</P>
<P>
Police said the driver, who was badly burned, came from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Declining to confirm Israel Radio's reports that the van was
full of inflammable chemicals and detonative devices, Jerusalem
police chief Yair Yitzhaki said a terrible tragedy with heavy
casualties was fortunately averted.
</P>
<P>
With the direct talks between Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and PNA Deputy Chairman Abu Mazen only hours away,
diplomatic and security sources said the attack was planned in an
attempt to retard the peace process, and said they believe the
militant resistance group Hamas was behind the scheme.
</P>
<P>
Observers also noticed that it was almost exactly a year ago
that a suicide bomb attack killed 16 and injured scores of others
in an open market in Jerusalem. Hamas claimed it was responsible
for that attack.

<HEADLINE> 1,500 Australians Rally Against Pauline Hanson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A rally of some 1,500 anti-racism
Australians in Melbourne Sunday night forced One Nation Party
leader Pauline Hanson to cancel her planned speech to the party's
gathering.
</P>
<P>
Streets around the city's Hawthorne Town Hall, where 800 One
Nation Party guests were to meet, were blocked by about 1,500
demonstrators, awaiting Hanson's arrival for Sunday night's
meeting, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
Protesters from left-wing and student groups gathered outside
the hall and jeered guests entering the venue. They waved placards
and chanted "racist scum" as invitees arrived for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The protesters' chant of "hey, hey, ho, ho, Pauline Hanson's
got to go" was stopped only by anti-One Nation speeches delivered
through megaphones.
</P>
<P>
The crowds chanting "Migrants in One Nation out" turned away at
least a dozen people attempting to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Police checked passes and invitations outside the hall to deter
protesters from entering.
</P>
<P>
But an hour before Hanson was to begin her address, only 22 of
the 800 invited guests were able to enter the hall as
demonstrators blocked the entrances.
</P>
<P>
And half an hour before Hanson was to have addressed the
meeting, police ordered the event be canceled on the grounds of
safety.
</P>
<P>
Senior police officer Colin Jessup later said 150 police
officers at the scene was insufficient as they had not expected
such a large demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Asked if police believed Hanson's safety would have been in
danger, he said: "I did feel that, yes."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, nearly 1,000 students marched in Melbourne,
capital of the state of Victoria, in protest against Hanson's
racism.

<HEADLINE> - Vietnam's Exports to ASEAN Countries Down 31 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's exports to other members
of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) from
January through June dropped 31 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Trade Ministry said in its latest report that
the financial crisis sweeping through the region since last July
had curbed its exports to ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
As currencies of countries in the region were devalued,
Vietnamese commodities have hardly been able to compete in the
ASEAN market, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The payments for the import of Vietnam's rice by some countries
in the region is also a problem, it added.
</P>
<P>
Exports to other ASEAN countries used to make up 30 percent of
Vietnam's total export turnover.
</P>
<P>
Among the 1.05 billion U.S. dollars earned by Vietnam from the
exports, nearly 560 million dollars came from Singapore, Vietnam's
largest buyer.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 152 million dollars came from the Philippines;
151 million dollars from Indonesia; 90 million dollars from
Thailand and 47 million dollars Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, Vietnam will boost barter trade to
enhance its commercial cooperation with ASEAN countries and to
cope with the devaluation of regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam in the past six months imported 1.75 billion dollars
worth of goods from ASEAN countries, mainly automobile and
motorbike spare parts, steel and oil.

The talks did not proceed as Tehran had expected. During the
seven-hour meeting Saturday night, the 11-member EU team raised
again the issues of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, and
the death sentence on the British writer Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio quoted Iran's deputy foreign minister for
Euro-American affairs, Morteza Sarmadi, as saying the EU asked
Iran to rescind the death sentence ordered by Iran's late supreme
leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini in 1989 on Rushdie for alleged
blasphemy in his novel, "The Satanic Verses."
</P>
<P>
In reply, Sarmadi said, Iran had underlined the need to
separate insulting to religious beliefs with the freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU delegation also voiced concern over the
development of human rights status in Iran, particularly in the
past one year, after the election of the moderate President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Iran's stances on the Middle East peace process, international
terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and its human rights
situation had been the main topics in the EU's "critical dialogue"
with Iran over the past years.
</P>
<P>
The EU started the purported "critical dialogue" with Iran in
December, 1992 with the aim to soften Tehran's policies on the key
issues. The dialogue was suspended in April 1997 after seven
rounds, due to a row over a Berlin court's accusation that Iranian
leaders were involved in a political assassination in Germany.
</P>
<P>
It was only in March this year that the EU decide to resume
talks with Iran. It is noticed that the EU has conspicuously kept
its manners in the previous dialogue intact, though Iran had
expected a "constructive dialogue" this time around.
</P>
<P>
Head of the EU delegation Albert Rohan, who is secretary
general of the Austrian Foreign Ministry, said the EU has informed
all its stances to Iranian officials and would follow the issues
in future talks.
</P>
<P>
He called Saturday's meeting "fruitful," and hoped the talks
would produce positive results.
</P>
<P>
The so-called troika EU team, which arrived Saturday morning,
included senior diplomats from Britain, Austria and Germany,
representing the past, present and future holders of the EU's
rotating presidency.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg
Sysuyev met Sunday with the representatives of striking coal
miners in Kemerovo to defuse mounting tension in the remote coal
basin.
</P>
<P>
Sysuyev, who arrived in Kemerovo in the morning, had talks with
leaders of strike committees and trade unions, representatives of
the local authorities and enterprises, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister promised that wage arrears would be
paid to miners by next Wednesday and the living conditions of the
pensioners and public sector workers in the Kemerovo region would
be improved.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Fokin, chairman of the strike committee in
Anzhero-Sudzhensk city, announced at the meeting that the blockade
of the Trans-Siberian railway was lifted in the city at 06:00
Moscow time.
</P>
<P>
Railways in the Kemerovo region, including the Trans-Siberian
railway, have been blocked by coal miners and workers from other
enterprises since July 3, resulting in heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
The Kuzbass section of the Western-Siberian railway has
suffered losses of more than 26 million rubles (about four million
U.S. dollars), and the Tomsk region's economy, over 100 million
rubles (1.6 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel, U.S. to Set up Joint College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan, Israel and the United
States have agreed in principle to set up a joint college in Wadi
Araba in Jordan-Israel border area for agricultural and business
education.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Water and Irrigation Munther Haddadin,
who is in charge of joint projects with Israel, said the kingdom
accepts the idea of founding the three-way college on condition
that it be a U.S. higher education facility under Jordan's
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Jordan Times Sunday quoted the minister as
saying the proposed project is still subject to the approval of
the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Information Service said the project is
backed by the three governments and 40 million U.S. dollars worth
of facility will be extended by the U.S. to either side of the
Jordanian-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Despite the three sides' consensus in principle, there is also
a major difference among them about the jurisdiction of the future
project, the Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan wants full jurisdiction while Israel wants joint
jurisdiction. The U.S. has not clarified its attitude, only saying
that the college will be a joint Jordanian-Israeli-U.S. project.
</P>
<P>
On the funding of the project, Jordan said it wants to garner
U.S. congressional financial support.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1994, patronized by
the U.S..

<HEADLINE> Thai Women Urged to Play Bigger Role in Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Activists for greater woman rights
on Sunday argued that the presence of women in politics would
offer remedy for corruption and social and economic ills.
</P>
<P>
The activists attending a seminar entitled "the Power of Thai
Women: A Nation's Survival" wanted to see more women appointed to
ministerial posts as they believed woman politicians would help
curb corruption.
</P>
<P>
They called on all political parties to put as many female
candidates as possible on their party lists in the next general
election.
</P>
<P>
"We should not vote for any party which fails to field women
in the election race," said reform advocate Prawase Wasi.
</P>
<P>
The seminar noted that female leaders of rural communities had
shown their honesty in campaigns to promote self-sufficiency as a
remedy for the economic crisis, and worked effectively in pulling
their villages out of poverty, but they always have to work twice
as hard as men to make their presence felt.
</P>
<P>
Phra Payom Kalayano, a well-known preacher, urged women to
make greater contributions to social, economic and political
development.
</P>
<P>
The preacher said an all-women party should be set up so as to
have its own candidates in the next general election.
</P>
<P>
Thai women in the past had helped save the country from
enemies and monuments had been built to remember their heroic
acts. It was now time for women to come to the rescue of the
flagging economy, Phra Payom said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that I will see a monument built for women again,"
said the preacher.
</P>
<P>
Sudarat Keyuraphan, leader of the Palang Thai Group and an MP,
said having the new constitution was only half the battle in
bringing about political reform. Reformist politicians were also
needed.
</P>
<P>
She called on women to increase their role in politics by
becoming candidates, supporters or good voters.
</P>
<P>
Sudarat said she was saddened that the economic crisis had led
to women becoming less active in politics.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Police Act to Decongest Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police have suspended the
detention of suspects with petty offenses so as to decongest
cells following a crippling countrywide magistrates strike.
</P>
<P>
The magistrates strike which has entered its 17th day has
caused congestion in police cells and remand prisons causing food
shortages, Times of Zambia reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, in the capital city of Lusaka,
only a principal resident magistrate has been clearing a backlog
of cases and deferring most of them.
</P>
<P>
The magistrates of the country have refused to go back to work
until their salaries and service conditions are improved.
</P>
<P>
Remand prisons in Lusaka and Kitwe, about 400 kilometers north
of the capital, have also stopped accepting any more inmates from
the courts as there is no space to keep them.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Beenwell Chimfwembe and Lusaka Provincial
Police Chief Ryan Chitoba confirmed the new development in Lusaka
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is pathetic, we are under so much pressure. We
have been left with very little option but to release all those
with petty offenses such as simple assaults and opting for
fines," Chimfwembe said.
</P>
<P>
Chitoba said cells in Lusaka's central police stations are
some of the most congested, citing a cell which normally takes 15
has over 40 suspects.
</P>
<P>
police cells at most stations in Kabwe, 150 kilometers north
of Lusaka, are filled to capacity because of the continued strike
by magistrates.
</P>
<P>
The country's prosecutors feared that the congestion could
cause an outbreak of deceases as there is not enough ventilation
in the cells before the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Relatives and friends to the remands and inmates complained
that that their relatives are suffering for no cause of their own
and appealed to the Zambian government to move in and resolve the
impasse.

<HEADLINE> PNA Refuses to Renegotiate U.S. Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) official said Sunday that the Palestinian side
will not negotiate once more the U.S. initiative on Israeli troop
withdrawal during the upcoming direct talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Local Government Minister Saeb Erekat made the
remark in an interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs Radio
over telephone before leaving for Tel Aviv to take part in the
first direct Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in months.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Palestinian
deputy chief Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) will lead their delegations
to the talks at the U.S. ambassador's residence Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Erekat made it clear that the agenda does not include
negotiations over the U.S. initiative but the Palestinians "will
only be listening to fresh Israeli ideas" as they were informed by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Erekat accentuated that the Palestinians will never give up
"even one inch more" over the 13 percent in the American overture
for the second phase Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. administration to press Israel to
respond to new efforts to salvage the flagging Mideast peace march.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been trying to break the 16-month
Israeli-Palestinian impasse by getting them agree on Israel's
handover of land in return for Palestinian security commitments.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat has
accepted the U.S. initiative, while Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu still resists the 13-percent scope.
</P>
<P>
Political sources said Israel wants to give Palestinians full
control of another 10 percent of the West Bank and limited control
in 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, viewed as a relative moderate in Netanyahu's cabinet,
held talks last February with Abbas, an architect of the landmark
1993 Israeli-Palestinian Oslo accord.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambia Faces Economic Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(Wang Nengbiao)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- After successive two years' growth
in 1996 and 1997, Zambia's economic situation in the first half
of this year is not as good as in the past two years due to
reduced foreign exchange inflow, falling copper prices in the
world market, slowing copper mines privatization pace and heavy
burden of foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's inflation rate now has rebounded to 25.7 percent from
the 18.6 percent of last year, and its currency, Kwacha, has
devalued drastically from 1,400 against one U.S. Dollar at the
beginning of the year to 2,000 against one Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of Kwacha has pushed up the costs of imported
commodities and reduced the purchasing power of the Zambians.
</P>
<P>
It seems almost impossible for the country to achieve targeted
5.5 percent economic growth and nine percent of inflation for
this year.
</P>
<P>
After the detention of former president Kenneth Kaunda alleged
involved in the coup attempt occurred last October, some donors
suspended their aid in protest against the detention.
</P>
<P>
Although the state of emergency declared after the foiled coup
has already been lifted and Kaunda has been released from under
house arrest, foreign exchange inflow remains nominal.
</P>
<P>
Last May, donors pledged Zambia an aid of 530 million dollars
at the consultative group meeting held Paris. However, Germany
and Netherlands have made it clear that they will not release the
money until the Zambia Consolidated Cooper Mines (ZCCM), which earns
over 80 percent of the country's foreign exchange income, completes
its privatization.
</P>
<P>
German Ambassador to Zambia, Helmuth Schroeder said that it
will be economically imprudent if the aid is released before
ZCCM's privatization process is completed.
</P>
<P>
Since the money ZCCM is losing equals the amount of the aid
the donor community pledged to give, he said, if the money is
released, it will have no impact on its economy because all of it
will go to bail out the ailing ZCCM.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has been trying to quicken the
privatization of ZCCM but failed to complete the process in the
first half of this year as planned.
</P>
<P>
Due to disagreement over the selling price of Nkana and
Nchanga mines, two biggest mines of the country, Zambia suspended
the negotiations with the Kafue Consortium last April on the sale
of the two mines, which accounts for 65 percent of ZCCM assets.
</P>
<P>
Because of the falling prices, two other foreign mining
companies pulled out of Konkola Mine Project and abandoned bid
for Chambishi Mine before the breakdown with the Kafue
Consortium.
</P>
<P>
Output of the manufacturing sector decreased by 10 percent to
15 percent in the first four months this year after the ailing
ZCCM cut down its orders of various manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economic crisis in Asia has reduced demand for
copper, thus pushing copper prices further down. Copper price
dropped by 33 cents a Pound in the london metal exchange market
to 77 cents per Pound in the first quarter of this year compared
with 110 cents in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in 1997 Zambia spent over 200 million dollars in
servicing its foreign debts now standing at seven billion
dollars. In the first quarter of this year 43.2 million more
dollars was spent in servicing the debts.
</P>
<P>
Since last October Zambia has imported 40 million dollars of
maize to deal with domestic food shortage. Due to El Nino effect
which reduced country's food production, the country will spend
more money to import food this year and beyond. As a result,
Zambia's foreign reserves dropped to 155 million dollars
from 227 million dollars at the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Bamboo Groves being Rejuvenated in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Bamboo groves in the Shennongjia
Mountains, once the natural habitat of the giant panda in central
China's Hubei Province, are currently in a state of rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
Arrow bamboo, the favorite food of the giant panda, grows on
mountain slopes at elevations above 2,000 meters. It blooms and
dies every 60 years and is rejuvenated the following year after
the one-year florescence.
</P>
<P>
Large areas of bamboo wilted in the Shennongjia last autumn and
bamboo groves covering more than 6,000 hectares, one third of the
total, perished.
</P>
<P>
Today bamboo shoots are a favorite food of the golden monkey
which lives in the region, since giant pandas moved to neighboring
Sichuan Province decades ago because of climate changes.

<HEADLINE> Over 100,000 Stranded Passengers Evacuated At Three Gorges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Over 100,000 ship passengers
stranded by flooding at a small port near the Three Gorges of the
Yangtze River have been transferred to safety over the past 11
days.
</P>
<P>
Between July 2 and 6 and July 10 to 16, the water flow at the
section around the gigantic Three Gorges Water-Control Project
on the Yangtze accelerated to 50,000 cubic meters per second. This
forced the closing of the water-diversion canal and the temporary
shiplock through which all ships must pass during the present
construction.
</P>
<P>
The closure affected a total of 800 passenger ships during the
11 days, stranding 100,000 passengers at the small port of Maoping
in Hubei Province near the construction site of the huge Three
Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
With roaring torrents on the river and temperatures reaching 40
degrees Celsius, any delay in evacuating the passengers could have
resulted in the washing away of ships and massive cases of
heatstroke, local authorities realized.
</P>
<P>
Confronted with the tense situation, the authorities in Yichang
City and Zigui County quickly mobilized every effort possible to
solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
During the massive evacuation, about 400 motor vehicles were
dispatched; medical workers were called to the scene, and police
were called in to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle that a small port in a mountainous area could
manage to transfer 100,000 passengers in 11 days without a single
accident," a local official remarked.

<P>
WARSAW, July 18 (Xinhua) -- After months of debate, the Polish
National Assembly on Saturday passed a bill reducing the number of
the country's provinces from 49 to 16.
</P>
<P>
The 16-province plan, passed with an overwhelming majority of
votes, was viewed as a major success of President Aleksander
Kwasniewski.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition originally put forward two province-
redividing plans in the Senate, one favoring 12 provinces and the
other 15, but both were vetoed by the president.
</P>
<P>
Later, the president suggested a 16-province plan, a compromise
between the ruling coalition's 15-province plan and the opposition
Democratic Left Alliance's 17 province plan.
</P>
<P>
President Kwasniewski indicated earlier on Saturday that he
will sign the plan as soon as it is passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
It is said that new provincial council elections will start in
early October. Political parties are making new alliances and are
mapping out their campaigning programs.

<P>
TEHRAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced Saturday that the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) would hold a
ministerial meeting in Rabat, Morocco to discuss counter-measures
against the Israeli plan to expand Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to Tehran radio, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi said that Kamal Kharrazi, the foreign minister, would
lead the Iranian delegation to the ministerial meeting. However,
he did not mention when the meeting would be held.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the meeting would be convened upon the June
23 call by Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, in the capacity of
chairman of the 55-nation OIC.
</P>
<P>
Despite international outcry, Israeli government last month
approved the plan to enlarge Jerusalem's borders to include Jewish
settlements around Jerusalem, in an attempt to change its status.
</P>
<P>
The plan was construed by Iran as a hostile move to Judaize
Jerusalem by adding more Jewish people to the city's population.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani strongly
criticized Islamic countries for failing to give any response to
Iran's call for an emergency meeting on Israel's expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the OIC was formed with the aim to defend Muslims
around the world and it should not be indifferent to the destiny
of a Muslim nation - Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Thai Legal Panel Pushing for Land Buyers Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A legal advisory panel of the
Interior Ministry is pushing for the approval by the cabinet and
parliament of a draft bill aimed at protecting land buyers from
being cheated by developers.
</P>
<P>
The panel wants the Council of State to forward the bill to
the cabinet and parliament for consideration as soon as possible,
Sunday's Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Thavorn Senniam, a panel member, said the draft bill was sent
to the council for consideration years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The Council of State has been too slow to act, apparently
because of government changes," said Thavorn. "Moreover, the
Consumers Protection Board is proposing another similar draft. We
(the panel) think the council should go ahead and send the draft
to the cabinet to speed up the legislative process."
</P>
<P>
The major principle of the draft Land Development Control Bill
is to empower a provincial committee, chaired by the provincial
governor, to issue land development licenses in a bid to
decentralize power. Currently, the power is in the hands of the
National Land Development Board chaired by the Interior Ministry's
permanent secretary.
</P>
<P>
The provincial committee is to check the qualifications of
land developers, and to find out if land plots put up for sale are
under any mortgage obligations.
</P>
<P>
The bill is intended to protect land buyers from cheats, and
to punish developers who fail to transfer land plots after the
buyers have paid for them in full. Developers are also required to
provide public utilities to areas being developed.

<HEADLINE> PNG Tidal Death Toll Rises to 599 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in Papua New
Guinea's (PNG) tsunami disaster has climbed to 599 and is expected
to rise, a PNG disaster control officer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on PNG's
north-west coast, said the tsunami, that hit the coast west of
Aitape on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had almost
completely destroyed another, according to an Australian
Associated Press report sent Sunday from Aitape.
</P>
<P>
A 10-meter tsunami engulfed the heavily populated villages near
Aitape, 800 km north of PNG's capital city of Port Moresby. The
disaster occurred 30 minutes after an undersea earthquake of about
7.0 on the Richter scale took place.
</P>
<P>
"The latest death toll for the district is 599," Dickson Dalle,
chairman of district disaster coordinating, was quoted as telling
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Dalle said it was impossible to say how many people were
missing.
</P>
<P>
"There are still people out there who are injured that we have
not rescued," he said. "They are scattered all over in the
mangroves."
</P>
<P>
Dalle said the Nimas village near the Sissano lagoon, the
Warapu village and the Arop village had been wiped out, and the
Malol village had almost been completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
At Warapu 500 people had been confirmed dead. At Arop 16 were
dead.
</P>
<P>
PNG Prime Minister Bill Skate was expected to arrive in Aitape
later Sunday afternoon to assess the situation.

BRIDGETOWN, Barbados, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier
Qian Qichen arrived here on Saturday for a two-day official visit
to Barbados to further promote relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Qian said that the objective of his
visit is to enhance mutual understanding, deepen the friendship

relations between the two "have developed smoothly, which conforms
to the aspiration and fundamental interests of our two peoples,"
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
It was Qian's first official visit to the Caribbean nation. He
was greeted at the airport by Acting Foreign Minister Phillip
Goddard, who is also minister for international trade and business.

"I'm looking forward to meetings with leaders of the Barbadian
Government and Parliament for exchange of views on bilateral
relations and international issues of common interest as well as
to extensive contacts and dialogue with people from all walks of
life," said Qian.

Stranthon Husbands on Sunday and Prime Minister Owen Arthur on
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Crudes Basket Rises to $9.90 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan basket of crudes
and byproducts closed the week with an average price of 9.90 U.S.
dollars a barrel, a 35-cent increase over last week's average.
</P>
<P>
The Energy and Mines Ministry's weekly Public Affairs Bulletin
revealed that the Venezuelan oil basket registered an average
price of 11.15 dollars per barrel during the first six months of
this year, down by 5.17 dollars from its 1997 average of 16.32
dollars. In 1996, the average price was 18.39 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) seven-crudes basket closed the week with an average of
11.88 dollars, again representing an increase of 35 cents,
compared to the previous week's index, which was 11.53 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slight improvement, however, the level of 12.50
dollars per barrel, which would be a benchmark for the estimation
of the national budget for 1999, is still very far away, market
sources noted.

<HEADLINE> Memorial to Black Veterans Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people gathered
here Saturday for the unveiling of a 2.6 million-dollar bronze
statue dedicated to the African-American veterans of the Civil War
(1861-1865).
</P>
<P>
"They fought not only for the preservation of the Union, but
also for their freedom from slavery," said U.S. Army Lieutenant
General Joe Ballard, the keynote speaker. "Perhaps more than any
other men, these soldiers knew the value of freedom."
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Civil War, African-American veterans have
fought a long battle for public recognition of their service.
</P>
<P>
According to Ballard, 10 percent of the Union's soldiers were
black and one-third of the black soldiers died in service.
</P>
<P>
After the Confederacy surrendered, however, the North in large
part erased African-American war contributions from the public
memory.
</P>
<P>
Black veterans were not allowed to march in the Union's victory
parade in Washington. In the 1880s, Congress rebuffed efforts by
black veteran George Washington Williams to construct a memorial
near Howard University.
</P>
<P>
Williams's wish at long last realized Saturday. Within sight of
Howard, the African-American Civil War Memorial lies in
Washington's Shaw neighborhood, a predominantly black area named
after white Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, leader of Massachusetts's
54th Volunteer Infantry, an African-American regiment which fell
at Ft. Wagner, South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The memorial, much like the history it represents, has long
struggled for recognition. The project has suffered from repeated
delays and budget shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's unveiling did not include the full
memorial. Etchings of the names of the 208,943 African-American
soldiers and sailors and their white commanders are not expected
to be completed until Veteran's Day.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, speaker after speaker, flanked by a regiment of
Civil War re-enactors, lauded the military achievements of
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton sent his regards by letter, saying the
memorial shows Americans the need to enter a 21st century free
from discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The memorial includes a nearby museum with displays on the
slave trade, abolition and African-American achievements to the
Civil War. In the gallery, computer databases allow visitors to
trace the military backgrounds of their descendants.

<P>
SANTIAGO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Economic Activity
Monthly Index (Imacec) grew 4.2 percent in May, compared with the
same period of 1997, the Central Bank announced.
</P>
<P>
The May index, the lowest for the first five months this year,
was more than two percentage points below the 6.7 percent rise in
April, while it posted an 8.1 percent growth in March.
</P>
<P>
The index embodies 90 percent of the activities included for
the calculation of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Vice President Jorge Marshall said that although
the index is for a single month, the May Imacec shows a moderate
growth compatible with the Central Bank's plans, which foresaw a
deceleration in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank expected a moderate economic activity growth
and spending this year to align with the productive capacity of
the country, said Marshall.
</P>
<P>
He said that a slow increase of economic activities is also
expected in the coming months.

<HEADLINE> Martin, Courier Give US Davis Cup Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Todd Martin and Jim Courier
rallied to beat Belgians Johan Van Herck and Xavier Malisse in
five sets Saturday to clinch a US Davis Cup quarter-final victory.
</P>
<P>
Courier, a last-minute doubles replacement for the injured
Richey Reneberg, made his first Davis Cup doubles appearance a
successful one as he teamed with Martin for a 5-7, 6-2, 6-7 (2/7),
7-6 (7/5), 6-1 triumph, clinching the best-of-five tie 3-0.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has won a record 31 Davis Cup titles,
will host Italy in the semi-finals September 25-27 at a site to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
Italy, which won its lone Davis Cup title in 1976, secured its
third straight semi-final berth as Andrea Gaudenzi and Diego
Nargiso defeated brothers Byron and Wayne Black of Zimbabwe 1-6,
7-5, 7-5, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Courier, who improved his lifetime Davis Cup record to 15-8,
has been America's pivotal player in Davis Cup this year with
three victories, including two clinchers. In singles, he secured
the first-round victory over Russia in April in a thrilling
decisive fifth match.
</P>
<P>
With Saturday's victory, the United States improved to 12-0 in
Davis Cup ties when Courier competes, including titles in 1992 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
After both teams held serve in the fourth set, the Americans
forced the decisive final set as Van Herck double-hit a forehand
return into the net on set point.
</P>
<P>
In the fifth set, the United States broke serve in the second
and fourth games before Courier closed out the three-hour,
30-minute match with a drop-shot winner.
</P>
<P>
Martin improved to 12-5 in Davis Cup competition, including a
3-3 record in doubles.
</P>
<P>
The victory extended the United States' Davis Cup-record home
match winning streak to 19.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, which fell to 0-3 lifetime against the US in Davis Cup
play, was making its first appearance in a quarter-final since the
16-team World Group was created in 1981.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar held a state ceremony here
Sunday to pay respects to fallen heroes who sacrificed their lives
in the struggle for the country's independence in late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The 51st anniversary Myanmar Martyrs' Day ceremony, which took
place at the Martyrs' Mausoleum in commemoration of the passing
away of the late National Independence Hero General Aung San and
eight others, was attended by Minister of Culture U Win Sein on
behalf of the State Peace and Development Council Senior-General
Than Shwe.
</P>
<P>
The late General's bereaved daughter Aung San Suu Kyi also took
part in the ceremony as a martyr's family status, laying wreaths
and baskets of flower at the tombs.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi, who is also General Secretary of the National
League for Democracy Party, has attended the annual
state-sponsored ceremony to pay respects to her fallen father and
other martyrs since she was released in July 1995 from nearly six
years of house arrest.
</P>
<P>
51 years ago on July 19, 1947, the late General, along with his
eight Councilor Members, was assassinated at the then Secretariat
Office (now Office of the Ministers) in Yangon six months before
Myanmar regained independence from British colonialists.

<HEADLINE> Italy Ends Zimbabweans Davis Cup Dream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Italy will meet the United States in
September's Davis Cup World Group semi-finals after both sailed
through their quarter-finals on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Italy, who reached the semi-finals for the third successive
year, took an unassailable 3-0 lead over surprising Zimbabwe while
the Americans also hold a 3-0 lead over Belgium.
</P>
<P>
In the other quarter-finals, Boris Becker failed to put the
Germans ahead as they lost the doubles to holders Sweden in four
sets. The Swedish Jonas Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti combined to
defeat Becker and David Prinosil in four sets.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, finalists in 1992, fought back to take the doubles
against Spain, who are seeking their semi-final debut in 11 years,
as Marc Rosset and Lorenzo Manta saw off Javier Sanchez and Julian
Alonso in five nervewracking sets.
</P>
<P>
The Italian heroes were Andrea Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso who
came through against the Black brothers Wayne and Byron, who had
sealed their place in the pantheon of Zimbabwean sporting heroes
when they beat Australia in the first round in April, in 2 hours
and 47 minutes 1-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-2
</P>
<P>
The Americans, who were whitewashed 5-0 by Sweden in last
year's final, sealed their place when Jim Courier and Todd Martin
rallied to defeat Xavier Malisse and Johan van Herck 5-7, 6-2, 6-7
(2/7), 7-6 (7/5), 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Courier, a last-minute replacement in doubles for the injured
Richey Reneberg, made his first Davis Cup doubles appearance a
successful one.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss fought back to take a 2-1 lead after Rosset and Manta
lost the first set to Sanchez and Alonso, but Manta, ranked 241st
in the world, then allowed the Spaniards back in to the rubber
when he lost his service in the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
Manta, however, put the smile back on Swiss faces as he served
out in the fifth set to seal the five set marathon and take the
match into the final day.
</P>
<P>
All started sweetly for the Germans as Becker and Prinosil
broke the Swedes at 5-4 to take the first set but after Bjorkman
and Kulti levelled it with their first set point in the second set
tie-break the match ebbed away from them despite the passionate
support of 11,000 supporters.
</P>
<P>
Becker, who reached the Swiss Open final last Sunday, handed
the Swede's the advantage in the third set, as having come back
from 5-3 down to force a tie-break, the three-time Wimbledon
champion doublefaulted at 5-6 to lose the set.
</P>
<P>
The ace Swedish pair then wrapped up the match in the fourth
set as they broke Prinosil and then Becker, after the Germans had
broken back to level at 3-3, and won the rubber on their first
match point when Becker put his return out.

<HEADLINE> China's Yuan Widely Expected to Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese yuan will continue to
be stable, both analysts and residents agree.
</P>
<P>
The key factor determining the trend of the yuan, which is
under the pressure of currency devaluations in Southeast Asia and
Japan, is the domestic economy, today's China Daily said, quoting
an unidentified researcher of the Institute of International
Finance under the Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
If China can realize sound economic growth, the competitiveness
of Chinese exports will be sharpened as a result of declining
production cost, and foreign capital will keep flowing into China,
the researcher said.
</P>
<P>
"This will ensure the balance of supply and demand in the
country's foreign exchange market, providing strong support for
the stability of the yuan," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China's efforts to diversify its export
markets have paid off, partly offsetting the impact of currency
devaluations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Michael Hasenstab, a former emerging markets sovereign
securities analyst for Franklin Templeton, said in China Daily
that China's economic fundamentals are favorable for a stable
yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The continued expansion of domestic market-oriented reforms,
combined with ongoing structural reforms of the state-owned
sector, remain the linchpin to yuan stability," the analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official survey of residents in 446 Chinese
cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenyang, reveals that
57.2 percent of the respondents believe that the yuan will retain
its stability despite the turbulent conditions surrounding the
decline in the value of the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts from the People's Bank of China, the
State Statistics Bureau and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
noted in a separate survey that keeping the yuan's stability will
help China increase its economic and political influence in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The yuan remained stable in the first half of this year. It
closed at 8.2797 against the US dollar at the end of June, almost
unchanged from the level of 8.2796 at the beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica To Reduce Rice Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica would reduce up to 21
percent its rice imports in 1999 from the originally planned
purchase of 95,000 tons to 75,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Rice Office Executive Director Gerardo Alvarado said the import
cutback would come in line with a bigger domestic rice production
this year, which is expected to have a 15 percent to 21 percent
surplus.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica consumes some 16,000 tons of rice a month. And since
the national harvest dropped steadily in the previous years and
there was not enough to meet the internal demand, some 80,000 tons
of rice was imported every year.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Agriculture and Livestock Ministry showed that
Costa Rica's rice output was 217,428 tons in 1991, and it dropped
in 1996 to 186,399 tons.

<HEADLINE> China to Export More Electrical Goods, Machinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China has officially set its
exports of electrical and machinery products at 65 billion US
dollars this year, up 10 percent from last year, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The value accounts for more than one-third of China's targeted
total exports for the whole of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation earlier
forecast a 10 percent growth in the country's export earnings this
year, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The exports of electrical and machinery products will be
crucial to the realization of China's overall export growth
target, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
China exported 59.32 billion US dollars-worth of electrical and
machinery products in 1997, about 32.5 percent of the year's total
exports.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, the exports of
electrical and machinery products rose 39.4 percent on a yearly
basis. The growth rate is 19.1 percentage points higher than the
comparable figure of last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the rising exports partly to favorable
credits for exporters, tax rebate incentives and better export
administration, the China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
The vessel export tax rebate rate was recently jerked up from 9
percent to 14 percent, while textile equipment for exports has
been exempted from the value-added taxes, it said.

<HEADLINE> Motor Vehicle Sales Drop in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's vehicle sales
dropped by 39 percent in June, compared with May, due to the high
rates of interest.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for the Exchange of Information of the Automotive
Sector said that 8,017 units were sold in June, 4,893 fewer than
in May, forcing retailers to offer discounts up to 3 million pesos
(some 2,247 U.S. dollars) under the sale price of the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Augusto Zuloaga, vice president of the automotive sector of the
National Federation of Merchants, said the sales of the national
assembling firms dropped by 45 percent and those of the importers
by 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
Retailers attributed the decrease to the panic of the consumers
about the high interest rates, which rose from 38 percent to 80
percent, lack of liquidity of the financial system and the
France-98 World Cup tournament.

<P>
PARIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Jan Ullrich of
Germany won the time trial on Saturday to take the overall lead as
his main rival was pushed out of the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
Ullrich won the 58-kilometer time trial by more than a minute
over a pair of Americans, Tyler Hamilton and Bobby Julich, timing
in one hour 15 minutes 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Ullrich regained the yellow jersey by a minute 18 seconds over
Bo Hailton of the United States who was fifth overall, 1:30 behind
just after Laurent Jalabert of France, 1:24 back of Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
Yet Ullrich's victory was overshadowed as Richard Virenque of
France, runner-up last year, and his Festina team was ruled out of
the race.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ullrich won by more than nine minutes over Virenque
and beat him by more than three minutes in a time trial.
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Virenque was ordered to leave the race after the
doping scandal that found three Festina officials under police
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Virenque, second and third in the Tour the last two years,
threatened legal action to pursue racing after first hearing of
the ban but then backed down.
</P>

After Saturday's time trial, two more weeks of the race remain
before it ends in Paris August 2.

NEW YORK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf continued her
comeback from knee surgery on Saturday, rallying from the first
set deficit to beat Li Fang of China in the semifinals of A and P
Tennis Classic in Mahwah, New Jersey on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With the win of 3-6, 6-2, 6-2, Graf moved into the final
against Amanda Coetzer, who beat Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna,
6-3, 7-6 (7-5) in the second semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who is still working her way back, double faulted four
times in the first set, driving forehand after forehand into the
net.
</P>
<P>
Graf, currently ranked 57th in the world after spending a
record 332 weeks at No. 1, opened the second set by winning the
first three games and 13 consecutive points.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is ranked 42nd, was in the semifinal because Amy
Frazier turned down an automatic bid she earned by winning the
USTA Challenger of Mahwah on Friday. Frazier was declared the
winner by walkover when Li failed to show up on time for the final
Friday because she was confused about the starting time.
</P>
<P>
Novotna was also tired after a busy five weeks, during which
she won three consecutive tournaments and five titles, including
her first Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon. But she ran out
of gas against Coetzer.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, No. 2 in the world, fought back from down 5-4 and a
service break to force a second-set tiebreaker. But Coetzer, who
is ranked eighth, hung on, lacing six forehand winners in the
tiebreak alone, including one on match point.

<HEADLINE> Influx of Overseas Investment Makes Retail Competition Fiercer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China still needs foreign
investment in the retail sector even though this places great
pressure on domestic retailers, said an industrial official.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign retailers can introduce capital and effective
management, both of which are currently deficient in the country's
retail sector," today's China Daily quoted Long Wenyuan, a
division chief with the Administrative Bureau of Internal Trade,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The development of China's retail sector, suffering from the
effects of the planned economy, has been held back by its
relatively small scale and the continued use of outmoded
management systems.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai No. One Department Store, the country's largest store,
only achieved a total sales of 5.52 billion yuan (665 million
U.S. dollars) last year while Shanghai Hualian Supermarket Co, the
country's largest chain store group, achieved total sales of 2.04
billion yuan (246 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the world's top 100 retailers on average achieved
annual sales ranging from 4.4 billion U.S. dollars to 93.6 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Domestic retailers have to learn more from big partners in
other countries, Long said.
</P>
<P>
Six of the world's top 100 chain store groups have entered
China's market, including US-based Wal Mart, Holland's Makro and
France-based Carefour. Foreign retailers share 1.3 percent of
China's total retail sales.
</P>
<P>
The impact the entry of overseas retailers has on domestic
retailers is obvious.
</P>
<P>
The country's top 56 department stores secured total retail
sales of 35.5 billion yuan (4.27 billion U.S. dollars) in the
first five months this year, only achieving a growth of 13.6
percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The profits of large department stores have kept dwindling in
the major cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou since 1996
when the market became oversupplied.
</P>
<P>
"The adverse impact is necessary as the domestic retail giants
should become more mature from the fierce competition, Long said.

<P>
NEW YORK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Executives for the Goodwill Games
announced here on Saturday that the 2001 Goodwill Games will be
held at Brisbane, Australia.
</P>
<P>
"The Goodwill Games will live on, and the city of Brisbane,
Australia, will be our home as we enter a new century," said Games
funder and Time Warner Vice Chairman R. E. Turner at a press
conference in announcing the decision. "Once again, the world's

excellence and history-making performances."
</P>
<P>
"Our city of Bribane, the state of Queensland and the continent
of Australia welcome the opportunity to bring the world's best
athletes to our part of the globe," said Bob Gibbs MLA, Minister
of Tourism, Sports and Racing for Queensland, at the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
It will be the fifth Goodwill Games. The fourth Games begin
Sunday through August 2 in Manhattan, Nassau County and Staten
Island in New York. More than 1,500 athletes from more than 65
countries are competing in 15 sports.
</P>
<P>
Moscow, Russia, hosted the first Goodwill Games in 1986 and
Seattle, United States, hosted the second in 1990 while the third
Games were held at St. Petersburg, Russia in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The change from the four-year rotation for the 2001 Games is to
avoid what will be a very crowded sporting calendar in 2002 with
the Winter Olympics, World Cup Soccer and other major sports
events. The next Games will return to quadrennial in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The Brisbane Games will feature 12 sports events over 12 days
in the fall, but the actual dates of competition would be
announced.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Optimisic About Future of Youth Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The vice-mayor of Moscow said here
Saturday that he was optimistic over the status of Youth Olympiad
for the World Youth Games.
</P>
<P>
"The special session of the International Olympic Committee
dedicated to giving the WYG the status of the Youth Olympiad will
be held soon," Valery Shantsev, who was also vice-chairman of he
games' organization committee, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We are sure that the answer will be affirmative because the
presidents of the international (sports) federation that arrived
in Moscow have already come out with this offer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Questions on whether there will be a second World Youth Games
have come up frequently during press opportunities during the
games.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the Moscow games' general director, Lev Kofman,
said Brazil and China's Hong Kong had expressed interest in
hosting the next World Youth Games.
</P>
<P>
According to IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch, the special
session, to be held in Lausanne, Switzerland, next September, will
hear reports on the Moscow games and then decide on "continuation
or non-continuation" of the Youth Games.
</P>
<P>
The games, which started last Saturday, will close on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Rural Consumers Important to Market Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers need more
assistance to achieve better standards of living in order to make
the rural market a more significant stimulus for the country's
consumption growth, the China Daily said today.
</P>
<P>
Stagnant growth in the urban consumption market since last year
has turned the eyes of policy makers and business people to the
rural market, where 80 percent of China's population consumes
about 40 percent of the country's retail consumer goods, the
newspaper quoted a report of the Internal Trade Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers' incomes are still generally low, representing
a key obstacle to the development of the potentially great rural
market, according to a survey of 12 provinces, whose combined
population, gross domestic product and retail sales each accounts
for about half of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
To increase farmers' incomes, governments at all levels should
make efforts to ensure a stable increase in the prices of
agricultural products, the Bureau report suggested.
</P>
<P>
Though the average incomes of Chinese farmers have been growing
faster than those of urbanities in recent years, the gap is still
considerable.
</P>
<P>
Last year the average net income of Chinese farmers was 2,080
yuan (about 250 US dollars), compared with 5,140 yuan for people
living in cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
The report said that China's manufacturing firms have for
decades been focusing on meeting the demands of urbanities and
suggested that firms should cater to the different needs of
farmers and design products in line with farmers' consumption
habits and the physical conditions in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Essential items used in daily life, agricultural production
materials and low and medium-grade durable consumer goods
currently represent the bulk of Chinese farmers' purchases, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' increasing demand for agricultural machinery, farming
vehicles, better houses, high-grade home appliances, among other
things, constitutes a rapidly expanding market in the rural areas,
it said.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Seeks Boxing License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Former world heavyweight boxing
champion Mike Tyson has applied for a license to fight in New
Jersey and will face a July 29 hearing before the State Athletic
Control Board todetermine his fitness.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, 32, has not fought since the Nevada State Athletic
Commission revoked his boxing license last year and fined him 3
million U.S. dollars for biting Evander Holyfield's ears in a Las
Vegas title bout.
</P>
<P>
Other states have voluntarily abided by Nevada's action. But
Anthony Fusco, Tyson's lawyer, said no law compels the states to
do so.
</P>
<P>
Roger Shatzkin, a spokesman for Attorney General Peter
Verniero, who recommended the hearing, said: "We aren't sure there
is any voluntary agreement."
</P>
<P>
A Fereral law calls upon states to recognize another state's
suspension except under certain conditions. "In the spirit of the
law, states should follow the revocation," said Marc Ratner,
executive director of the Nevada commission. "Mike Tyson ought to
take care of business here before going anywhere else."
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey board hearing will be in Trenton, with 6 to 10
witnesses appearing on Tyson's behalf, according to Fusco. "The
board wants evidence that he possesses the necessary character,
pursuant to the statute," Fusco said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was eligible to reapply for a license in Nevada on July
9, but instead submitted an application to New Jersey authorities
on July 10.
</P>
<P>
"New Jersey is our first goal," Fusco said. "At the moment,
Mike wants to come to New Jersey, but that doesn't preclude us
from applying to any other state, and that would include New York."
</P>
<P>
The last time the board held a licensing hearing was for Ray
Mercer four years ago after he was indicted for trying bribe Jesse
Ferguson during a 1993 fight. Shatzkin said Mercer, who was found
not guilty, got the license.

<HEADLINE> Bailey, Greene to Fight for Fastest Man Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Olympic champion Donovan
Bailey and U.S. world champion Maurice Greene will face each other
in the showdown of the men's 100 meters final to decide who is the
fastest man in the world at the Goodwill Games Tuesday at the
Mitcdhel Athletic Complex in Long Island, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The two super stars will square off over the issue which was
unsettled in 1997 when Michael Johnson of the United States
withdrew from the 150-meter race half-way from the finish due to a
leg injury against Bailey.
</P>
<P>
"This battle between two of track and field's premiere
performers is truly indicative of the high level of competition we
expect," said Mike Plant, Goodwill Games president.
</P>
<P>
Bailey, the speedy Ontario stockbroker, won the 100 meters at
the 1995 world championships and set a world record 9.84, en route
to an Olympic gold medal in Atlanda in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian, who beat Johnson in the 150 meters challenge to
win a record 1.5 million U.S. dollars as appearence fee and bonus,
troubled by an Achilles tendon injury early this season and
finished third behind Greene in Australia in February.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old wound up second in a race in April with a
clocking of 10.13 seconds, followed up with a 10.19 win in May. He
was beaten by Greene at last year's world championships in Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greene, who trains with another world sprinting star Ato Boldon
of Trinidad and Tabago, has been very sharp this season, beating
the world indoor 60 meters record in February and registering a
sprint double in 9.79 and 19.88, both wind-aided, early this year.
</P>
<P>
"We put too much emphasis on the world record this year. I have
to run the best race that I can, and forget the world record. The
100m dash is a very technical race and I will concentrate on
winning the race here this time," said Greene today.
</P>
<P>
He ran 9.84-wind-aided in the heats of the U.S. athletics
championships last month. The American has promised to beat the
9.84 world record, and the strong field including Boldon and
Dennis Mitchell of the United States Tuesday might push Greene to
run faster.
</P>
<P>
Besides Bailey, the world 200 meters champion Bolton, who ran a
blistering 9.86 this year, looks like another power to challeng
the two sprinters in the fastest man race at the Games.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that the season has just begun for me, if the world
record is still intact after the Goodwill Games, I still have a
few races coming up in Europe," said Boldon, who also set his
sight at the world record.
</P>
<P>
The other four sprinters to enter the final-only race Tuesday
are Tim Harden, U.S. championships winner this year at 9.88
(wind-aided), Brian Lewis, U.S. championships runner-up at 9.98
(wind-aided), Mitchell, defending champion who has ranked in the
world's top 10 for 10 years straight, and Brunny Surin, Canadian
world indoor champion.
