<HEADLINE> Beatty to Give Long-Awaited Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Warren Beatty, toying with a  
presidential run, got a chance Wednesday to outline his views of 
Democratic Party issues before an international audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty has said little since disclosing seven weeks ago that he  
is flirting with the idea. He wrote an opinion column lamenting the 
state of the major political parties last month, and granted a 
couple of interviews to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	His silence has only heightened interest in the speech Wednesday  
night to the Southern California Americans for Democratic Action, 
which was presenting him with an award. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists with news outlets based in Germany, Japan, France,  
Spain, Italy, Great Britain and Canada, as well as national 
reporters based in New York and Washington, D.C., flocked to the 
Beverly Hilton, as did a battery of liberal politicians and 
Hollywood stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all Warren Beatty is a movie star, as big as exists  
on the planet, and there is a celebrity frenzy all over the world 
now,'' said Lila Garrett, president of ADA, which views itself as 
guardian of the Democratic Party's ``progressive'' wing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The progressive wing of the Democratic Party has been shut  
out, and the air in that shut room of conservative Democrats become 
stale,'' Garrett said. ``Warren Beatty has opened that door 
slightly and the rancid air is moving out and the fresh air is 
moving in,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty played a brutally honest politician in the film  
``Bulworth,'' which was Beatty's call for campaign finance reform.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Urges More Cancer Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, who  
counts his victory over cancer as the ``proudest achievement'' of 
his life, urged Congress on Wednesday to increase funding for 
cancer and other medical research. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can have our local charities, our regional charities or  
even national charities, but we are only raising millions,'' the 
cyclist said at a congressional hearing. ``And the key isn't the 
`M' word. The key is the `B' word -- billions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old, who divides his time between Texas and France,  
capped a remarkable comeback from testicular cancer when he won 
cycling's most prestigious and grueling event in July. The cancer 
had spread to his lungs and brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have been an inspiration to us,'' said Sen. Connie Mack,  
R-Fla., a cancer survivor who organized the Joint Economic 
Committee biotech summit during which Armstrong and others 
appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong pronounced himself ``a living example of successful  
cancer research'' funded in part by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack and other committee members expressed support for doubling  
funding for the National Institutes of Health over the next five 
years. Democrats are pressing on other fronts, demanding Medicare 
prescription drug coverage -- a proposal the pharmaceutical industry 
is fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack urged caution, saying lawmakers must avoid stymieing  
biotech growth while seeking to expand patients' treatment options. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making miracles is hard work -- expensive work,'' he said.  
``That's why we need a system that recognizes the interplay between 
our market economy and the pursuit of medical knowledge.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Infants Sleep Safer in Cribs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Supporting recommendations that all infants sleep  
in cribs, a new study found that an average of 64 young children 
die each year while sleeping in bed with their parents or other 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Children risk getting their heads trapped or being rolled on by  
an adult when sleeping in adult beds, according to the study by the 
U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in the October issue of the Archives of  
Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, found that the greatest number 
of deaths involved children under 1 who became trapped between a 
mattress and a bed frame. Children also can suffocate on waterbeds 
or in depressions in mattresses, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers who examined three commission databases found that  
515 children died from 1990 through 1997. They said it is difficult 
to determine whether that number is accurate because the databases 
do not include all bed-related deaths for children under 2. But the 
researchers didn't know of a better source of information than the 
databases. 
</P>
<P>
	James McKenna, a University of Notre Dame professor who has  
studied parent-baby sleeping, took issue with the researchers' 
warnings that mothers who sleep with their infants to encourage 
breast feeding may be putting their children at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recommendation tries to simplify a very complicated issue,  
and it suggests that all bed-sharing is dangerous, which is not 
true,'' McKenna said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his studies show that even in the deepest stages of  
sleep, mothers respond within seconds to their baby's slightest 
noises. He said the only time his studies have shown parents to be 
unresponsive is when they are desensitized by drugs, alcohol or 
some other means.

<HEADLINE> Salaam Thankful for Browns Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Once Rashaan Salaam got himself drug-free, he  
had a second chance in pro football. Now, the Cleveland Browns are 
giving the running back a third. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam, who jeopardized his life and playing career because of  
an addiction to marijuana, signed a one-year contract with the 
Browns, who hope the former Heisman Trophy winner can help their 
sorry running game. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives me a chance to get back into the race and get my  
name back out there,'' Salaam said Wednesday. ``I'm making s new 
start, but the biggest thing for me is to learn the system as fast 
as I can. The last three years I learned a lot about life, its ups 
and downs. And as long as you hang in there and stay positive 
things will work out for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam was always able to outrun his problems, and for most of  
his life that meant merely beating a linebacker or defensive back 
to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	But while with the Chicago Bears, Salaam who won the Heisman  
Trophy in 1994 at Colorado and rushed for more than 1,000 yards his 
rookie year, was slowed by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	A pulled hamstring and sprained right knee forced him to miss  
four games in 1996, and in 1997, he broke his right leg during a 
pile up in the third game of the season against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Depressed, he became withdrawn and began smoking marijuana  
habitually. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going through a depression stage and the only way I  
could medicate myself was to use marijuana,'' he said. ``That was 
the wrong thing to do. But I thought it could help me out. But I 
was depressed. It was a time in my life when things were just 
falling apart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears, who drafted him in the first round of the 1995 draft,  
released him before the '98 season. Sitting out all of last year, 
he stayed clean and in shape as he contemplated the future and a 
possible comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam was signed by the Oakland Raiders in June, and showed  
flashes of the player who once dominated college football games. 
But the Raiders decided instead to sign Tyrone Wheatley, who like 
Salaam has had an up-and-down pro career. Salaam was released 
earlier this month by the Raiders, who said they favored Wheatley 
because of his ability to play special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a Raiders fan growing up so I was disappointed,'' he  
said. ``But this has made me more focused and made me more 
hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam had a good workout last week for the expansion Browns,  
whose roster is certain to undergo many more transformations in 
their first year back in the NFL. The Browns play host to unbeaten 
New England this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, which waived disappointing running back Sedrick Shaw,  
has gained just 192 yards on the ground in its first three games. 
Quarterback Tim Couch is the team's second leading rusher, and he's 
gotten his 89 yards in two games on scrambles. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer said Salaam's role will depend on how  
quickly he can learn the playbook. Palmer added he isn't concerned 
with Salaam's past off-field problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has happened in the past is history. We go from here  
on,'' Palmer said. ``People make mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam is sorry for his and ready to help the Browns win any way  
he can. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have a lot left,'' he said. ``I think I have a lot  
to show in this league,'' he said. ``A lot of people thought it was 
over for me in Chicago. I've got a lot to prove.''

<HEADLINE> Titans Release Kick Returner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans, needing some depth  
at tight end, released kick returner Roell Preston on Wednesday, 
two weeks after signing the Pro Bowler as an unrestricted free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans signed rookie tight end Larry Brown off the practice  
squad to replace Preston, and defensive end Keith Embray was added 
to the practice squad. Brown was signed to give the Titans a third 
tight end with Jackie Harris out indefinitely with a severe 
hamstring strain. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Derrick Mason replaces Preston as the Titans'  
primary returner on punts and kickoffs. Mason had the job until he 
had arthroscopic knee surgery on Sept. 11. For his career, the 1997 
fourth-round draft pick has averaged 20.7 yards on kickoff returns 
and 7.3 yards on punt returns. 
</P>
<P>
	In two games with Tennessee, Preston averaged 23.8 yards on  
kickoff returns and 7.4 yards on punt returns, ranking him seventh 
and ninth, respectively, in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the only option we had that we felt was workable,''  
coach Jeff Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mason is healthy again and can handle the returns. We couldn't  
go into a game with just two tight ends. It's not that we think 
Roell Preston cannot still be a productive returner in this league, 
but he hadn't had a training camp -- and we were forced to make a 
decision.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Shakes Up His Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, shaken by the  
unexpected strength of Bill Bradley's challenge for the Democratic 
presidential nomination, abruptly uprooted his inside-the-Beltway 
campaign Wednesday for a move to Tennessee and ``an opportunity for 
transformation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a hard, tough fight,'' said Gore, challenging Bradley  
to a series of issue debates. 
</P>
<P>
	By relocating his headquarters from Washington's K Street, a  
corridor of lobbying and law firms, to Nashville's Church Street, 
the former Tennessee senator who grew up in Washington said he 
hoped to ``get closer to the American people, closer to the 
grassroots and out of the Beltway and into the heartland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every election that I have won has been headquartered in  
Tennessee,'' Gore added. The move was giving some high-level Gore 
aides second thoughts about staying with the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of acting out the presumption that his only  
competitor was Republican front-runner George W. Bush, Gore said 
Wednesday that he was eager to debate Bradley as a way to ``make of 
this campaign a chance for our country to rekindle the spirit of 
democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, campaigning in California, told reporters: ``For the  
last 10 months, the vice president and his campaign have been 
ignoring me and now they want to debate me. I think that shows 
we're making some progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate statement from his headquarters in West Orange,  
N.J., Bradley made clear he will campaign on his own timeline and 
said he has already accepted a number of joint appearances with 
Gore, including an Oct. 27 town meeting in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Texas governor, weighed in: ``I think what matters  
most is your philosophy and message ... as opposed to where your 
headquarters are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News of the shakeup came shortly before the campaign announced  
that Gore had raised $6.5 million in the third quarter, bringing 
the year's total to $24 million. Senior Gore advisers, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said the vice president had $9.5 million to 
$10 million cash on hand -- meaning they saved just $300,000 to 
$800,000 of the money they raised over the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore campaign fears that Bradley is doing as well in  
gathering campaign cash -- and a better job at controlling spending. 
Bradley has not yet released his third-quarter figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spoke at a hastily called press conference just after  
dropping the news on aides suddenly faced with tough personal 
decisions about relocating. 
</P>
<P>
	The drama was reminiscent of Republican Bob Dole's resignation  
from the Senate as he desperately tried to revive his 1996 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he decided on the move in ``the past couple days'' and  
did not discuss it with President Clinton, who long advocated it as 
a way to recreate the team spirit that propelled his Little Rock, 
Ark.-based campaign to the White House in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore became convinced, aides said, as Bradley began to close the  
gap in key primary states. A Nashville ribbon-cutting already is 
set for next week and supporters there were lining up ``guest 
bedrooms'' for campaign staff, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	But one intended result of the Nashville move will be a trimming  
of his staff, which Gore has come to realize is too big, too 
expensive too slow to react, and, in some cases, too burdened by 
outside clients, said one aide on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Another aide, chief strategist Carter Eskew, put it this way:  
``It's easy to be for someone when he's got an 80-point lead and no 
opponents but there's a winnowing process for staff, too, just like 
for candidates. Now you find out who's really in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relocation -- largely symbolic since Gore will continue to  
reside at Washington's Naval Observatory and perform his official 
duties -- will also serve to put space between Gore and Clinton, 
whose scandals have been a drag on the vice president's poll 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio Democratic Party chairman David J. Leland applauded Gore.  
</P>
<P>
	``The folks in Washington, D.C., are sometimes only connected to  
their own world and I think it's important for all the campaigns -- 
especially his campaign -- to get back to the real people,'' Leland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, whose nomination by the Democratic Party was once viewed  
as a fait accompli, sounded Wednesday like a man who had just woken 
up to the two-man contest that's been underway since the start of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Bradley's apparently growing appeal in public  
opinion polls, Gore replied: ``Once it became a two-person race and 
once they established a baseline of competence and credibility, it 
was inevitable that it would tighten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When pressed, Gore laughed. ``There are only two candidates. You  
got Pepsi and Coke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign chairman Tony Coelho, Eskew and political director  
Donna Brazille will move to Nashville. It was unclear how many 
others would follow -- or be gently told there is no room for them 
in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign manager Craig Smith, press secretary Kiki Moore, deputy  
chairwoman Marla Romash, communications director Laura Quinn and 
deputy campaign manager Stacie Spector were among those who had 
decisions to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to think it out,'' said Moore. ``Everybody's got to  
go home and figure out with their wives and kids what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore supporters consider him a proven debater, recalling what  
they considered a masterful performance against Ross Perot when 
they went head to head on TV over the North American Free Trade 
Agreement in November 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidate himself tried to project a taking-control air  
Wednesday as he also announced a stylistic change to his campaign. 
He promised a series of open meetings where he can speak to voters 
``without intermediaries.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Try To Sign Primeau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Carolina Hurricanes general manager Jim  
Rutherford made a last-ditch effort to sign all-star Keith Primeau 
on Wednesday. He hopes his latest offer will lure the team captain 
to return for this weekend's opener, but that's unlikely, according 
to Todd Reynolds, one of Primeau's agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like there is a real carrot in here,'' Reynolds said  
of the team's offer. ``It is not what we had hoped for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest offer by Rutherford is a shorter-term, two-year deal  
for the 6-foot-5, 220-pound center. Prior to Wednesday's offer, the 
Hurricanes had a five-year, $20 million deal on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau, 27, who led the team with 30 goals last season, is  
seeking $5 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutherford said the new offer still puts Primeau in the $4  
million-a-year category and includes incentives close to $500,000. 
Primeau would also have an opportunity to come back to the 
bargaining table in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives him an opportunity to have a couple of big years  
and put up some bigger numbers to where he could come back to us or 
go to an arbitrator to say I'm worth the kind of money he has been 
asking for,'' Rutherford said. ``It doesn't tie his hands for as 
long as our five-year proposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Reynolds said late Wednesday night that the offer  
averages $3.5 million a year -- or $1 million less over two years -- 
and they're not interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``The term interests us -- yeah we can go back to the table in  
two years -- but not at these numbers,'' Reynolds said. ``We're in 
the wrong stratosphere here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rutherford said the nine-year NHL veteran and his agents have  
until Friday to accept the proposal. The Hurricanes, the defending 
Southeast Division champions, start their season Saturday night in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is not accepted by then, we just have to realize that  
he's not going to be with us to start the season and probably for a 
long, long time -- maybe even the whole year,'' Rutherford said. 
``We feel very strong about our position and we have to go 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau, a restricted free agent, balked at the five-year deal  
because it would have taken him one year past when he could have 
filed for unrestricted free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams can match offers given to restricted free agents or  
receive draft picks as compensation, while unrestricted free agents 
can shop on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest offer by the Hurricanes also drops any fines for  
missing training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have taken that position, but we didn't,'' Rutherford  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Primeau accepts the offer, he'll be in the lineup against the  
Bruins, Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically and mentally he's saying he's ready to go and I'm  
sure he has worked very hard, but I don't think anybody who has 
missed a training camp in any professional sports is ready to go,'' 
Rutherford said. ``But if he agrees to a contract, he'll be in the 
lineup and be the captain of our team Saturday night.''

<HEADLINE>  Ramirez: Indians RBI Man-ny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Home run hoopla has baseball fans too busy  
watching Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire to realize what kind of show 
Manny Ramirez has put on this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been unbelievable,'' Indians catcher Sandy Alomar said.  
``An RBI machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quietly. That's how Ramirez goes about his business. No muss, no  
fuss. Just grab the bat and hit the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, with little commotion, is having one of the most  
productive seasons in baseball history. But as fans again focus on 
the home run exploits of Sosa and McGwire, Ramirez's dizzying 
numbers are practically unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians right fielder has 160 RBIs.  
</P>
<P>
	That's 160 RBIs. No player in 61 years has done that.  
</P>
<P>
	``Manny is absolutely amazing,'' said Cleveland manager Mike  
Hargrove, a pretty fair hitter who never drove in more than 85 in a 
season. ``One hundred sixty RBIs? If you drive in 70 runs in a 
year, people talk about that as a good offensive year. And here 
Manny has more than doubled that. What he's done in two years is a 
career for most people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez has knocked in more runs in a season since Jimmie Foxx  
had 175 RBIs in 1938. And consider the season-high RBI totals for 
these Hall of Famers: Hank Aaron, 132; Willie Mays, 141; Ty Cobb, 
144; Ted Williams, 159; and Joe DiMaggio, 155. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez has 305 RBIs the past two seasons. He is one of only  
eight AL players ever to reach 160 RBIs in a year, and with six 
games remaining, he'll probably break Hal Trosky's club record of 
162 (1936). 
</P>
<P>
	If he can pick up 10 RBIs in Cleveland's final five games -- not  
an impossible task given he got eight Friday night and 12 last 
weekend -- Ramirez would be just the seventh player to reach 170. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to get 90 or 100 RBI a season, and if I get more  
than that, I'm even more happy,'' said Ramirez, who went 2-for-3 
Tuesday night, but failed to drive in a run in Cleveland's 2-1 win 
at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the prospect of joining the company of the 170 club --  
Foxx, Hack Wilson, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Hank Greenberg and Chuck 
Klein -- doesn't faze Ramirez. He just does his job, batting cleanup 
for baseball's best hitting team. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland needs 15 runs in its last six games to become seventh  
team to score 1,000 runs in a season, and the first since the 
Boston Red Sox in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just getting the right hits at the right time,'' he said.  
``Kenny Lofton, Omar Vizquel and Robbie Alomar are getting on base 
and doing an awesome job, but I also have to get the hits. They can 
get on base, but if I don't get the hits at the right time, they're 
not going to come home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez's RBI total would be higher still if he hadn't missed  
three games because of a suspension for charging the mound or six 
because of injuries. The missed games cooled him off to the point 
where he looked lost at the plate for long stretches. 
</P>
<P>
	In most years, Ramirez's stats would make him the front-runner  
for MVP. Not in 1999. In fact, Ramirez might not even be the 
Indians' MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Martinez, Nomar Garciaparra, Derek Jeter and Rafael  
Palmeiro are all having outstanding years, as is Indians second 
baseman Roberto Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton knows who gets his vote.  
</P>
<P>
	``Manny is MVP. If people don't vote for him it's a shame,'' he  
said. ``Guys need to write about him. He deserves MVP and that's 
the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What might hurt Ramirez is that he often draws attention with a  
bonehead defensive play or a baserunning mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old outfielder hasn't made as many mental mistakes  
this season. But last Thursday night in Detroit, he loafed after a 
foul ball down the line and was promptly yanked by Hargrove. The 
manager reportedly chased him through the tunnel behind the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez insisted his hamstring tightened, but Hargrove said  
Ramirez never told him that. Ramirez took care of any lingering 
controversy the next day by hitting a grand slam, a three-run homer 
and driving in a career-high eight runs in an 18-4 rout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manny has done it all year long,'' Sandy Alomar said. ``He has  
been unreal.''

<HEADLINE> Harding To Make Pro Skating Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Two dozen people lined up to buy  
tickets Wednesday to Tonya Harding's return to the ice, a 
professional competition she says will give her a chance to show 
she can still skate. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years after receiving a lifetime ban from amateur  
competition for her role in the knee-bashing of chief rival Nancy 
Kerrigan, Harding will compete as a professional for the first time 
Oct. 18-19 in Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little nervous because I haven't skated in front of an  
audience for some time,'' Harding said Wednesday from Portland, 
Ore. ``I'm sure there's going to be skeptics out there, but I'm 
sure the skeptical people would even like to see me skate. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was an amateur, I skated for myself. As a professional,  
I will do it for the fans. This is the way I can thank them and 
show them that I can still skate great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The event is expected to be a sellout, and fans who bought  
tickets at the 5,780-seat Huntington Civic Arena were excited about 
seeing her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything wrong with it,'' Bob Berry said. ``We  
should be a forgiving people and understanding. Nancy Kerrigan's 
forgiven her. We should be tolerant enough to do the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she's got guts,'' said Edna Holland, a self-described  
skating fanatic. ``She's had all these problems and she's still 
coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Harding says she has been training for seven  
months and can hit all her triple jumps except the triple axel. She 
is the only American woman to land that difficult jump in 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding announced her intentions in February, but it took a  
while for a promoter to bite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been calling every professional event there is and it was  
just a question of who would have the guts to take her,'' Harding's 
adviser, Michael Rosenberg, said. ``Everybody was nervous to be the 
first one to put her in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrigan was whacked with a baton as she left the ice during  
practice at the 1994 U.S. championships in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Stone, and two other men served time  
for planning and carrying out the attack. Harding avoided jail time 
despite her guilty plea to covering up the attack. She received a 
lifetime ban by the U.S. Figure Skating Association and apologized 
in person to Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding said fans won't see her and Kerrigan compete against  
each other again. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's happy and she has her baby. I've gone on with my life,''  
Harding said. ``I know everyone's going to associate with us being 
together, but we've moved on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrigan was skeptical about Harding's return to competition.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's been said before, so who knows? We'll see,'' Kerrigan  
said in Nashville, Tenn., where she was promoting a Nov. 23 skating 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair had appeared together for a network television  
interview last year. Kerrigan said she hasn't had contact with 
Harding since. 
</P>
<P>
	``What for?'' she said, laughing.  
</P>
<P>
	Harding has stayed busy as a skating coach, along with other  
ventures, including a low-budget movie as a waitress. She turned 
down an offer to wrestle in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1997, the same month she claims she was abducted by  
someone outside her Portland, Ore., home, Harding skated in a 
two-minute exhibition at a hockey game in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month will mark her debut in a pro competition. The USFSA  
has no jurisdiction over the event, which will be televised by ESPN 
on Oct. 25, Nov. 1 and Nov. 8. Others entered in the West Virginia 
competition are Elizabeth Manley, Surya Bonaly, Tonia Kwiatkowski 
and Pasha Grischuk. 
</P>
<P>
	For Kwiatkowski, who had said she would never skate again with  
Harding, time apparently has healed old wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't care one way or another, I guess,'' Kwiatkowski  
said from Lakewood, Ohio. ``I guess you need to give her a chance. 
I look at her as being another competitor.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Cops To Be Tried in Diallo Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge ordered four police officers Wednesday  
to stand trial for the fatal shooting of an unarmed West African 
immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard  
Murphy left the courthouse without comment. They have all pleaded 
innocent to second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge rejected defense arguments that public outcry and  
intense media coverage following the shooting put undue pressure on 
the grand jury to issue the murder indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were indicted in March. They are accused of firing  
41 times at Amadou Diallo while searching for a rape suspect on 
Feb. 4. Diallo was hit 19 times. Attorneys for the officers said 
their clients mistakenly believed Diallo was reaching for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants remain on restricted duty pending the outcome of  
the trial, which is scheduled for January.

<HEADLINE> Black Leaders Enraged by Plea Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A coalition of black leaders have criticized a  
pending plea agreement that would give a 12-year prison sentence to 
a reputed mob hit man who has admitted taking part in 20 killings. 
</P>
<P>
	John Martorano has agreed to confess to the killings and, in  
doing so, implicate other gangsters, attorneys said. In exchange, 
he would receive a 12 1/2-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Black leaders upset over the deal pointed to comments in a  
newspaper column last year by a retired police officer that 
Martorano ``practically used black people for target practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the 20 victims Martorano has acknowledged were black.  
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot allow this serial killer to kill people and then  
just walk,'' the Rev. Bruce Wall said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall was among a group of ministers, elected officials and  
community activists who contend Martorano may be behind more 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, they called for an investigation by the Boston  
police, Suffolk County prosecutors and the U.S. Attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Suffolk County District Attorney Ralph Martin, who participated  
in the deal, insisted there was no evidence that Martorano had 
committed any murders beyond the 20 to which he confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Police spokeswoman Margot Hill said Police Commissioner  
Paul Evans would discuss the request for an investigation with the 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any information that comes to us outside the scope of the plea  
agreement, we will vigorously pursue with the district attorney,'' 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall urged prosecutors to rescind the deal, which is scheduled  
to go before a federal judge later this week.

<HEADLINE> Some Air Systems Y2K Status Unclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON -- Thirty-four nations whose airports handled 1  
million passengers traveling to and from the United States last 
year have yet to report on steps taken to remedy possible Y2K 
computer problems, the Transportation Department inspector general 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of information is also worrisome closer to home, Inspector  
General Kenneth Mead said in testimony to be delivered Thursday to 
the Senate special panel on the Y2K problem. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that while air carriers handling 95 percent of passenger  
and cargo services in the United States say they will be Y2K-ready 
at the end of September, 1,900 smaller carriers out of 3,300 air 
carriers did not respond to a Federal Aviation Administration 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Y2K-related failures or disruptions are likely to be isolated  
local events in this country, Mead said, but ``we are disappointed 
at the lack of information concerning the readiness of many smaller 
providers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA has stressed that vital airport systems are ready for  
the year 2000 date rollover and FAA Administrator Jane Garvey has 
booked a cross-country airline flight for New Year's Eve to show 
her confidence that air travel is safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Older computers that read only the last two digits of a year  
could mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900, causing systems to 
malfunction or break down. 
</P>
<P>
	Mead said the International Civil Aviation Organization, a  
U.N.-based group that sets international flight standards, surveyed 
its 185 members and 34 had not responded as of Sept. 23. That was 
down from 53 that had not responded at the end of August. Most not 
supplying information were Asian, African and former Soviet Union 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Smart of the International Federation of Air Line Pilot  
Associations, in testimony before the Senate panel, said pilots too 
were confident of flight safety in North America and the eastern 
Pacific and northern Atlantic regions. But he said ``we are 
somewhat less confident'' about Eastern Europe and other areas of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there was a possibility of airspace and airports along  
main Asia-Europe routes being closed because of air-ground 
communications failures. His association is recommending that 
pilots carry an extra 30 minutes of fuel and that the ICAO make 
military airports available to cope with possible Y2K-induced 
delays and diversions. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA plans to impose flight restrictions if there is a known,  
verifiable safety problem. But Mead said, ``We are not persuaded 
this approach will be sufficient because FAA is not likely to have 
verified evidence of problems until after Dec. 31, 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Smallen, spokesman for the Transportation Department's Y2K  
office, said the FAA hasn't determined that lack of Y2K readiness 
necessarily translates into a safety problem. ``We are telling 
people that they should be very prudent and very careful when 
making their travel plans because they could face service 
disruptions and diversions; but at this point, we are not going 
beyond that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As examples of lack of information, Mead said only 107 of 579  
non-hub and general aviation airports had completed Y2K work as of 
March 15, and the 4,624 public airports not associated with the 
major airport associations had not been surveyed by the FAA or the 
trade associations. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from air transportation, Mead said only 33 of 83 U.S. port  
authorities had responded to an August survey, and the Coast Guard 
got a 36 percent return on its survey of more than 5,000 marine 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 30 transit authorities questioned by the Federal Transit  
Administration, four said they were Y2K compliant and 26 said they 
should be ready by the end of the year. Amtrak and major freight 
railroads are in good shape, but 541 other regional and local 
freight railroads have not been surveyed.

<HEADLINE> Percy Ross: I've Given It All Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Percy Ross is tapped out.  
</P>
<P>
	The millionaire-turned-philanthropist who doled out cash to  
readers of his syndicated column for nearly 17 years has closed his 
wallet after handing out as much as $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've achieved my goal. I've given it all away,'' Ross tells  
readers in his last ``Thanks A Million'' columns. ``You've given me 
so much over the years. In many respects, I'm far richer today than 
when I started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ross' farewell column was distributed this month, ending a run  
that saw him raise money for organ transplants, help pay for 
recreational centers and hand out silver dollars along with his 
homespun wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
	``He who gives while he lives,'' he often liked to quote, ``also  
knows where it goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ross' columns featured letters from readers -- he'd get 10,000  
each week, said his editor, Nancy Webber -- seeking help, offering 
suggestions or simply saying thank you. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks a Million'' ran in about 800 newspapers, from major  
dailies like the St. Louis Post-Dispatch to tiny weeklies like the 
Swift County Monitor in western Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The 82-year-old son of poor immigrants from Latvia and Russia  
launched the column in March 1983 after making a fortune producing 
plastic film and trash bags. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fully expected that my health would go long before my  
wealth,'' he told readers. ``In my wildest dreams I never expected 
to have survived nearly 17 years in print.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ross came up with the column idea after giving away more than  
1,000 bicycles at a holiday party for children at the Minneapolis 
Convention Center in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the few occasions when we didn't run his column, we heard  
about it,'' said Mary Panzer, an advertising manager for The 
Brainerd Daily Dispatch in central Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just found it interesting that this man would give his  
money away and draw attention to the problems we all face,'' said 
Panzer, whose newspaper will run Ross' column for the last time 
next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	One recent letter was from a 26-year-old woman whose  
bulimia-induced purging had left her teeth gray. She asked Ross for 
$1,400 to pay for dental work. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're willing to make changes because your past lifestyle  
wasn't healthy. And, you're willing to meet me halfway,'' he wrote. 
``Why on God's green earth wouldn't I be willing to help you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He sent the woman a check for $700.  
</P>
<P>
	But Ross also had no qualms about rejecting other requests, even  
with a tone of disdain. One woman in prison asked him for money so 
she could buy her son a computer. Ross said no. 
</P>
<P>
	Another wrote to criticize Ross for sending him $300 for a new  
computer. The man had meant to ask for $3,000 -- he made a typo -- 
and thought Ross would figure that out since computers cost so 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people have purchased a computer -- albeit used -- for  
$300. I know because I have received lovely thank you notes from 
these very people,'' Ross responded. ``So put that in your 
ungrateful pipe and smoke it!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime fans of Ross may find comfort in a farewell promise.  
``If by chance I can make another pile of money, I'll be back 
giving it away,'' he wrote. ``Until then... Thanks a Million!''

<HEADLINE> Police Dept. Begins Using Net Gun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Police departments now have the option of wrapping  
up suspects in a web, a nonlethal approach that gives officers time 
to slap on a pair of handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Webshot device looks a bit like a shotgun but fires a Kevlar  
net. At least 20 law enforcement agencies around the world are 
trying the product made by Foster-Miller Inc., a company in the 
Boston suburb of Waltham. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going at about 65 mph toward you, so you have no time to  
react,'' said Shawn Gaskell, a Foster-Miller engineer who has 
played the role of suspect during testing. ``It also kind of stuns 
you because it's loud and there's a big flash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A consensus is emerging in law enforcement that officers need  
more alternatives to their guns and nightsticks, partly to avoid 
the lawsuits and public relations problems that result when 
officers shoot lightly armed but belligerent suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Some departments have tried guns that fire bean bags to knock  
down uncooperative suspects. Others have experimented with a 
pump-like device that coats suspects in a sticky foam. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police officer today has basically the same instruments at  
his or her disposal as Wyatt Earp had,'' said Michael Buerger, a 
professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University. ``But 
they recognize that not all situations involving combative suspects 
require such force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster-Miller's Webshot project grew out of an Army contract and  
has been in development for about eight years, Gaskell said. The 
Army had wanted a nonlethal weapon for peacekeeping operations, but 
the Webshot doesn't meet military specifications because its range 
is only 7 to 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	But that is enough to meet the needs of police, who also can  
afford the Webshot -- nets sell for about $50 apiece. Foster-Miller 
makes a single-shot unit that sells for about $90.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Crack Down on Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The biggest name in boxing promotion wasn't on  
Capitol Hill but still was a significant factor Wednesday as a 
House committee voted to crack down on the fight business. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., suggested the legislation was intended  
to target Don King, a larger-than-life personality who for three 
decades who has promoted fights for everyone from Muhammad Ali to 
Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Another congressman said he wanted to toughen the legislation by  
having it ban felons from involvement in boxing, but opted not to, 
because of King. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ralph Hall, D-Texas, said he tried to move a no-felons  
amendment to an earlier boxing bill but it became too controversial 
because people called it the ``King amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said that wasn't the intent, even though ``I have mixed  
feelings about Mr. King.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rush quickly disagreed. ``I think that this bill is primarily  
aimed at one particular promoter,'' Rush said. ``I think we're 
setting a precedent that we will come back to regret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A King spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking  
comment about the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Before becoming a major force in boxing, King was involved in  
two killings. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1954, King killed a man who was robbing a numbers house he  
operated in Cleveland, and it was ruled justifiable homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1967, he was convicted of second-degree murder for stomping  
to death a rival numbers runner. The charge later was reduced to 
manslaughter. He served nearly four years in prison and was 
pardoned in 1983 by then-Ohio Gov. James A. Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	King also has been the target of numerous lawsuits from boxers.  
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, which now can be positioned for a vote in the  
full House, is intended to protect young fighters from exploitation 
by eliminating so-called coercive contracts, in which a boxer is 
required to sign away rights for more than 12 months or grant 
rights to another promoter as a condition of getting to fight a 
particular bout. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes conflict of interest rules and would require  
promoters, judges, referees and sanctioning bodies to fill out 
financial disclosure forms. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the outcry over the Evander Holyfield-Lennox  
Lewis heavyweight title fight March 13, the measure would require 
all boxing referees and judges to be certified and approved by 
state boxing commissions. King was in New York with both fighters 
Wednesday to help hype the rematch set for Nov. 13 at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	It addition, the bill specifies that boxers can be suspended for  
unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Commerce Committee deleted language limiting fighters'  
contracts to five years, but voted down Rush when he tried to 
delete criminal penalties for those who violate financial 
disclosure and conflict of interest rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is named in honor of Ali, and the former heavyweight  
champion testified in favor of it in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., wrote another version of the bill,  
which passed the Senate unanimously. McCain's bill was more 
far-reaching; it included restrictions on fight broadcasters, who 
would not be not allowed to have a direct or indirect financial 
interest in a boxer's manager or management company. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are S.305 and H.R.1832.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Approved As Fed Vice Chair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Wednesday confirmed Roger W.  
Ferguson to be vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, making him the 
first black to hold the No. 2 post at the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson, a Harvard-trained economist and lawyer, was confirmed  
by voice vote. He replaces Alice Rivlin, a former presidential 
economic adviser who left the Fed board in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old Ferguson was first appointed to the seven-member  
Fed board of governors two years ago by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	While on it, he as focused much of his attention technical  
matters, including overseeing the Fed's plans for dealing with the 
Year 2000 computer problem. He also headed a panel searching for 
ways to upgrade the central bank's check clearing operations for 
commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists have predicted little change in policy  
direction with the elevation of Ferguson to the No. 2 spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson is the third black to serve on the Fed board, following  
Andrew Brimmer, nominated by Lyndon Johnson in 1966, and Emmett 
Rice, nominated by Jimmy Carter in 1979.

	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Cobi Jones scored in both halves and  
Steve Jolley added a first-half goal as the Los Angeles Galaxy 
defeated the Colorado Rapids, 4-0, Wednesday night, solidifying its 
hold on first place in Major League Soccer's Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory before a Rose Bowl crowd announced at 10,098 moved  
the Galaxy (19-11) four points ahead of second-place Colorado 
(19-10) in the race for the conference lead and home field 
advantage in the first two rounds of the playoffs. Los Angeles has 
two matches remaining, the Rapids three. MLS teams receive three 
points for regulation victories, one for shootout victories and 
none for losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Kevin Hartman did not need to make a save as he  
posted his 10th shutout of the season and 20th of his MLS career, 
one behind Kansas City's Tony Meola, who holds the 4-year-old 
league's record.

	It was the first time in the Rapids' history that the team did  
not get off a shot on goal, continuing an offensive slump that has 
seen Colorado score just three goals in its last 10 matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles wasted no time scoring, with Jolley out-jumping  
Rapids forward Jorge Dely Valdes in the fifth minute to take Greg 
Vanney's corner kick, then put a header from 10 yards out into the 
upper left corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal was Jolley's second of the season and first since May  
23, when he headed in Vanney's corner kick in the third minute of a 
1-0 victory over New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' first goal gave the Galaxy a 2-0 lead in the 36th minute.  
</P>
<P>
	Roy Myers began that scoring sequence by sending a chip into the  
penalty area that was deflected by Rapids midfielder Darren 
Sawatzky to Los Angeles midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos. With his 
back to the goal, Cienfuegos volleyed the ball diagonally to the 
on-rushing Jones on the left side, who put a six-yard shot past 
goalkeeper Ian Feuer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones scored his second goal and team-leading eighth of the  
season in the 56th minute, deflecting in Ezra Hendrickson's drive 
from three yards out. Seth George came off the bench to score in 
the 89th minute off fellow rookie Marvin Quijano's assist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galaxy led 14-7 in shots and 6-0 in shots on goal. Feuer  
made one save.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Faces Murder Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARMINGTON, Utah (AP) -- Autopsies on three elderly patients who  
died while in a doctor's care show they had lethal doses of 
morphine in their system, a prosecutor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know each victim was given morphine in sufficient quantities  
to cause their death,'' Davis County Attorney Mel Wilson said after 
Dr. Robert Allan Weitzel's initial court appearance on charges that 
he killed five patients. 
</P>
<P>
	All five died between Dec. 30, 1995, and Jan. 14, 1996.  
Prosecutors say he prescribed massive doses of morphine for then 
while he was director of a geriatric-psychiatric unit run by 
Houston-based Horizons Mental Health Management Inc. at the Davis 
Hospital and Medical Center in Layton. 
</P>
<P>
	According police, none of the five had ailments that might have  
caused death or required morphine. 
</P>
<P>
	Three patients were exhumed and the Utah Medical Examiner  
performed autopsies. Investigators don't plan to exhume the two 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said the medical examiner will testify that, in at least  
one of the three autopsied cases, the death was a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the first-degree felony murder charges carries a  
sentence of five years to life. A preliminary hearing has been set 
for January. 
</P>
<P>
	Weitzel, 43, sat quietly throughout Wednesday's hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	He remains free on $100,000 bail. He was arrested last week at  
Bay City, Texas, and returned to Utah voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Weitzel also was charged in federal court with 22 counts of  
fraudulently obtaining prescription pain killers. In July, the Drug 
Enforcement Administration sought to have Weitzel's license to 
prescribe drugs revoked. A DEA affidavit alleged that he used 
illegally obtained drugs for himself.

<HEADLINE>  Serbs Block Main East-West Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbs blocked Kosovo's main  
east-west highway for a second day today, demanding better security 
following a grenade attack in an outdoor market that killed three 
Serbs and injured dozens. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people, two ethnic Albanians and two others who were  
unidentified, were detained in the attack, which occurred Tuesday 
in the Serb-populated town of Kosovo Polje, NATO spokesman Maj. Ole 
Irgens said. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.N. spokeswoman Daniela Rozgorova said the two ethnic  
Albanians were questioned and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Rozgorova also said three U.N. workers reported missing since  
Monday in northwest Kosovo had been arrested by Yugoslav police and 
taken to the Yugoslav town of Kraljevo. It was not known why they 
were detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, two workers of the World Food Program were  
detained by Serb police in northern Kosovo. They were freed later. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions between NATO peacekeepers and Kosovo's Serb minority  
rose after the grenade attack, which Serb community leader Dusan 
Ristic blamed on the officially disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the attack, Serbs blocked Kosovo's main highway  
on Tuesday, backing up hundreds of vehicles for miles on the road 
from the provincial capital of Pristina to Pec. British soldiers 
prevented civilian traffic from reaching the roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 30 Serbs were still manning a barricade today and not  
letting anyone pass. There was no sign of KFOR, the international 
peacekeeping force. Russian soldiers were seen about a half-mile 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Rozgorova said today 47 people were injured in the grenade  
attack and treated in the Kosovo Polje hospital Tuesday. Head nurse 
Jasmina Brocic said today that one of three people evacuated to Nis 
died last night, bringing the death toll to three. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. chief administrator Bernard Kouchner strongly condemned the  
grenade attack and said it undermines efforts to transform Kosovo 
into a multiethnic society. 
</P>
<P>
	``This outrageous act against innocent civilians puts in danger  
all efforts at democracy in Kosovo,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The political leader of the officially disbanded Kosovo  
Liberation Army, Hashim Thaci, also condemned the ``inhuman'' 
attack ``no matter who committed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other violence, one man was shot and killed and another was  
wounded after a quarrel in a bar in Decani on Tuesday, peacekeeper 
spokesman Irgens said today. Four Albanians were arrested Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Tuesday, an Albanian girl was killed in an explosion,  
Irgens said. It was not clear if a mine or a grenade exploded. 
Irgens also said that two Serb teachers were missing in the town of 
Urosevac. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, the Yugoslav government blamed the grenade attack  
on NATO and U.N. for transforming the former rebel KLA into the 
Kosovo Protection Corps. NATO and the United Nations say the new 
corps is a civilian organization, but Yugoslavia said the attack 
proves the KLA has not demilitarized. 
</P>
<P>
	``The KLA may recently have changed its name and undergone  
cosmetic alterations, but it continues to spread terror and thus 
prevails in Kosovo,'' said Stanimir Vukicevic, Yugoslavia's liaison 
with NATO and the United Nations, according to the state Tanjug 
news agency.

<HEADLINE> Actor Seeks Parkinson's Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Actor Michael J. Fox told a Senate hearing  
Tuesday that he had hidden his Parkinson's disease for eight years 
``through increasing amounts of medication, through surgery, and by 
employing the hundreds of little tricks and techniques a person 
with Parkinson's learns to mask his or her condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Fox, urging Congress to increase funding into the causes of  
the incurable ailment, said his days of quietly ``soldiering on'' 
were over. ``The war against Parkinson's is a winnable war, and I 
am resolved to play a role in that victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke before a crowded hearing of a Senate Appropriations  
subcommittee chaired by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox joined other Parkinson's advocates urging Congress to  
increase research funding for the disease by $75 million. In 1997, 
Congress authorized the National Institutes of Health to use $100 
million to study the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, 38, last year made public that he had been suffering from  
Parkinson's disease since 1991. He said he first noticed a twitch 
in his left little finger while on the set of the film ``Doc 
Hollywood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parkinson's disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that  
destroys brain cells that produce dopamine, a chemical important 
for movement. Symptoms include muscle stiffening, tremors and 
difficulty moving. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease affects about 1 million Americans, including former  
heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali and Attorney General Janet 
Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is the current star of the ABC sitcom ``Spin City.'' He has  
also had starring roles in the ``Back to the Future'' movies.

<HEADLINE> Russia Wary of Islamic Rebel Ploys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- While Russian jets bombed Chechnya again  
today, officials said Islamic militants might stage new attacks in 
Russia by slipping across the border among refugees fleeing the 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 60,000 people have abandoned their homes since Russian jets  
began bombing the Chechen capital of Grozny and nearby regions a 
week ago. The airstrikes today again hit communications centers, 
ammunition depots, and oil and industrial facilities, the Russian 
Defense Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen officials claimed 10 people were killed during today's  
raids. The Russian Defense Ministry said all the casualties were 
militants. The Chechens say 300 civilians have died in strikes so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow says the strikes are aimed against Chechnya-based Islamic  
rebels who twice invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan in 
August and September. The militants have also been blamed for a 
series of apartment explosions in Russia that killed some 300 
people in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The raids have fueled fears that Moscow is planning a major  
ground operation in Chechnya, which could mean a repeat of the 
disastrous 1994-96 war with Chechen separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have denied they plan to send in ground troops. But  
the Interfax news agency today quoted an unidentified Defense 
Ministry source as saying preparations for a ground operation have 
entered their final stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the airstrikes began, Russia said up to 2,000 militants  
were gathered along the border of Dagestan in preparation for a new 
invasion. Russian commanders said the militants' supply lines and 
bases must be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Sergei Pryganov said today  
that around 2,000 refugees have fled east from Chechnya toward 
Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	That has made the situation at the border chaotic, he said,  
because the refugees were trying to enter Dagestan at crossings 
where the militants were gathered. The guerrillas could try to 
infiltrate the border posing as refugees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were letting some refugees across, but only after  
strict document checks. The refugees were being accommodated in 
tent camps in Dagestan, Pryganov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those fleeing Chechnya have fled west into the  
neighboring Russian region of Ingushetia, and several regional 
leaders have warned of an impending humanitarian crisis because of 
the refugee influx. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin urged  
negotiations with Chechnya, saying the republic's leaders must 
``show a constructive approach and the willingness to free their 
territory of bandit gangs,'' Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE>  UN To Proceed With E. Timor Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations will go ahead with a  
human rights inquiry into atrocities committed in East Timor 
despite Indonesia's rejection of the probe, the U.N. spokesman said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. investigators would like to have the cooperation of  
Indonesia's own human rights organization and access to Indonesia's 
military, but neither is required for the inquiry to go forward, 
spokesman Fred Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's Justice Minister Muladi said Wednesday that the  
Indonesian government rejected the inquiry and would issue a 
government decree saying so. Indonesia has said it should be 
allowed to investigate the reports that its army and army-supported 
militias were involved in widespread killings and pillaging 
following a vote on East Timor's independence Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's foreign minister said Wednesday that some violence  
was inevitable and that the United Nations had to go ahead with the 
ballot or risk the world's condemnation for having denied East 
Timor's people the right to choose their future. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia might also never again have agreed to allow the East  
Timorese to decide whether they wanted to remain part of the 
country or become independent, Alexander Downer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could it have ever been resolved in an environment of perfect  
harmony and peace? The answer to that is `no', it couldn't have 
been,'' Downer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Passions were too high and East Timor's history too violent to  
have allowed for an easy vote or an easy transition to either 
independence or special autonomy within the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that didn't mean it should never be resolved. And those  
who say the ballot shouldn't have taken place are people who say 
the East Timor situation shouldn't be resolved,'' he told reporters 
after speaking before the U.N. General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	As he spoke, the United Nations moved ahead with plans to start  
taking over some civilian control of East Timor to try to get the 
territory's water, sanitation, transport and communications systems 
going again. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas met Wednesday with senior  
U.N. officials to discuss what the United Nations could do in the 
month before Indonesia formally hands the territory over to a 
transitional U.N. authority, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Portuguese Ambassador Antonio Monteiro said the U.N. Security  
Council should expand the mandate of the mission currently in East 
Timor to allow it to start rebuilding the territory. But U.N. 
officials said that might not be necessary and could embarrass 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, the U.N. refugee agency said Wednesday that efforts  
to reach thousands of refugees in makeshift camps across the border 
in West Timor are going slowly. There have been reports of 
pro-Indonesian militias there harassing people in the camps, some 
of whom were shipped there against their will. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of a U.N.-led mission to West Timor set out on  
Wednesday for the border town of Atambua, which reportedly holds up 
to 100,000 people under militia control, the statement from U.N. 
High Commissioner for Refugees said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the provincial capital, Kupang, authorities were insisting on  
24 hours' advance notice to police from U.N. staff planning to 
visit the refugee camps. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR staff who went to a sports stadium in the city were  
accompanied by six policemen armed with automatic rifles and 
sticks. It held some 700 East Timorese, and another 300 were 
sheltering under tarpaulins around the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was enough food, water and sanitation facilities and no  
visible military or police presence in the area,'' UNHCR said.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Export Hopes / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures pushed higher in early  
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade after Russia requested 
5 million tons of food aid from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's appeal is for a variety of grains and commodities. It  
includes 1.5 million tons of corn, 1.5 million tons of feed wheat, 
1 million tons of milling wheat, 500,000 tons of soybeans, 500,000 
tons of soy meal and 100,000 tons of soy oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks between the two countries on the prospective donations  
will take place in October, and investors appear optimistic they 
will take place. Corn, wheat, soybean and oat futures all opened 
higher on the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Continued rainy weather in the Midwest that is delaying the corn  
and soybean harvests also helped nudge prices upward. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 2 cents to $2.87 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1/2 cent to $2.14 1/4 a bushel; December oats rose 1 
cent to $1.16 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 3/4 cent to $4.91 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures both inched higher in early trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October cattle rose .20 cent to 67.15 cents a pound; October  
feeder cattle rose .27 cent to 80.07 cents a pound; October lean 
hogs rose .13 cent to 48.55 cents a pound; February frozen pork 
bellies rose .08 cent to 63.65 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Thomas Jefferson's Scrapbooks Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Scholars believe four scrapbooks  
uncovered by a history professor were put together by Thomas 
Jefferson and offer further insight into the life of the nation's 
third president. 
</P>
<P>
	The red leather-bound books contain thousands of newspaper  
articles from all over the East Coast dating to Jefferson's 
presidency, from 1801-08. They indicate that Jefferson was more 
sentimental that scholars have thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers once believed the scrapbooks were put together by  
Jefferson's granddaughters but recently discovered that some 
notations on the clippings match Jefferson's handwriting. Some 
clippings are pasted on envelopes with Jefferson's address. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident these books were compiled by Jefferson  
himself,'' said James Horn, director of the International Center 
for Jefferson Studies in Charlottesville. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert M.S. McDonald, a professor at the U.S. Military Academy  
at West Point, N.Y., found the 6-by-9-inch books this summer at the 
University of Virginia's Alderman Library while doing research. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was stunned,'' McDonald said. ``I realized that they not  
only belonged to Jefferson, but also that they were Jefferson's 
creation. It is not every day that new Jefferson materials come to 
light. And these are a treasure trove of information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald found an oak leaf pressed into one book between an  
article on friendship and a poem titled ``Scenes from My Youth.'' 
Jefferson and his boyhood friend, Dabney Carr, played together on 
Monticello and used to study under an oak tree. 
</P>
<P>
	The two promised each other the survivor would bury the other  
under that tree. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the genesis of the Monticello family graveyard,''  
McDonald said. Carr was the first buried where the oak tree was 
believed to have been. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say one of the scrapbooks was given to the library  
in 1851. The three others were donated in 1951 by Jefferson family 
members.

<HEADLINE> FBI Makes Fla. Bomb Case a Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- FBI agents tracking a bomber suspected  
of twice hitting Florida A&AMP;M University say the case is the 
bureau's No. 1 priority in northern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Two pipe bombs exploded at the predominantly black university  
Aug. 31 and Sept. 22, one in an administration building restroom 
and the other in a restroom surrounded by classrooms and offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither explosion caused any injuries, and the damage was  
slight. But many of the school's 12,000 students and its 
administrators fear they may be dealing with a serial bomber out to 
send a message. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have my pledge, until this case is solved, no stone will  
go unturned,'' Tom Kneir, head of the FBI's office in northern 
Florida, told students Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of city and county police officers have descended on the  
campus, patrolling streets and checking everyone's identification 
24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Patriots Kicker Shrugs Off Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Pressure is Bill Parcells hinting your job  
is at stake if you miss a kick. Pressure is Justin Leonard hovering 
over a 45-foot putt with the Ryder Cup on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	There's little pressure, says Adam Vinatieri, in contemplating a  
field goal attempt that could win a game in the final minute. Not, 
as in Vinatieri's case, if you haven't missed all season. 
</P>
<P>
	The kicker for the unbeaten New England Patriots has made his  
last nine attempts -- seven this season -- and doesn't flinch in 
tight situations when his teammates are counting on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just loving the opportunity to be out on the field,'' he  
said. ``I'd much rather be the one that's kicking it than the guy 
standing on the sideline watching their kicker kick it and hoping 
that he misses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vinatieri kicked at South Dakota State, then played for  
Amsterdam of the World League in 1996. He signed with the Patriots 
as a free agent before the 1996 season, with no guarantee of 
long-term employment. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the fourth game that season, Parcells, then the Patriots  
coach, discussed his rookie kicker with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably the most pressure I've felt so far was probably the  
overtime kick against Jacksonville,'' Vinatieri said. ``The week 
before, Parcells said I was game-to-game, so you all know what that 
means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he came through with five field goals, including a 40-yarder  
that gave New England a 28-25 overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went, `He'll be happy with me today. We'll see about  
tomorrow,''' Vinatieri said. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, his field goals with three seconds and 35 seconds  
left won the Patriots' first two games. They won their third game 
16-14 over the New York Giants with his three second-half field 
goals last Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	That same day, Leonard sank a pressure putt on the 17th green  
that clinched the Ryder Cup for the United States over Europe at 
The Country Club in nearby Brookline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leonard's putt was as big a game-winner, a 55-yarder in the  
Super Bowl-type thing,'' said Vinatieri, who just missed seeing it 
on television because he had to leave for his game. ``You can feel 
kind of what he's feeling and the pressures that he's feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vinatieri rarely seems flustered, even when fans are screaming  
for him to miss. He's made 90-of-110 field-goal attempts as a 
Patriot and last Sunday tied Gino Cappelletti's team record by 
making his 105th straight extra point. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's pretty much Mr. Automatic. You get down in his range and  
you know you're getting some points,'' wide receiver Shawn 
Jefferson said. ``If he had to make a 70-yarder, I'd bet money that 
he'd make it. That's the type of pressure player he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We can just about ask him to do anything at the end of these  
games,'' coach Pete Carroll said. ``He feels very good about his 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vinatieri's longest field goal is a 58-yarder with three seconds  
left in the final exhibition game at Carolina. But the Patriots 
lost 23-20 on John Kasay's 61-yard field goal with no time left. 
Both connected with the harder footballs kickers are using compared 
to last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 58-yarder ``gave me some confidence with the new balls,''  
Vinatieri said. ``I know a lot of the guys were concerned about how 
much distance it was going to'' cut from the kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	With quarterback Drew Bledsoe's ability to move the offense into  
scoring position, Vinatieri expects to get plenty of chances to add 
to his field-goal totals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider myself very fortunate to be on a team that scores a  
lot of points,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates consider themselves fortunate to have him.  
</P>
<P>
	``Adam is one of the best kickers in the game,'' Jefferson said.  
``The league knows that. We know that.''

<HEADLINE> Fired Museum Guide Gets Job Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A museum guide who was fired because of the  
way she explained an explicit sculpture to a group of fifth-grade 
girls has been offered her job back. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art told Stephanie  
Riseley they regret the circumstances that led to her dismissal in 
May and congratulated her on the ``high quality'' of her job 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate the strength of your commitment to public access  
and education,'' said Priscilla Gibbs, chairwoman of the museum's 
Docent Council, in a Sept. 14 letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Riseley was fired after she guided a tour from Hurley Elementary  
School past an Edward Kienholz sculpture entitled ``Back Seat Dodge 
'38,'' which featured life-size figures of a couple in a drunken 
embrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Riseley explained that the sculpture was an expression of an  
artist's first sexual experience and suggested Kienholz was telling 
viewers ``you only get one first sexual experience, so think before 
you act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tour guide's explanation stunned the girls' chaperones and  
teacher. The school's principal complained to museum officials, who 
then fired Riseley. 
</P>
<P>
	The firing prompted complaints from some museum members and led  
to the threat of a defamation and freedom of speech lawsuit from 
the former docent. 
</P>
<P>
	Riseley said she was pleased to have her job back and ``my good  
name restored to me.'' But she said she didn't know when she would 
resume her tour work.

<HEADLINE> More Theories on Waco Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For all the recent furor over the FBI's use of  
potentially incendiary tear gas canisters on the final day of the 
Waco siege, a lawyer suing the government on behalf of Branch 
Davidian survivors and relatives contends the inferno may have been 
triggered by other causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Cult leader David Koresh and some 80 followers perished during  
the fiery climax to the siege on April 19, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Caddell, the lead lawyer in a wrongful-death lawsuit  
against the government, is wary of tying his legal case to the 
military canisters lobbed by federal agents. Alternate theories 
under examination include the possibility that the fire was caused 
by contact between exhaust from military tanks used in the assault 
and the flimsy wooden walls of the Davidians' compound, he said, 
adding that the exhaust could have reached 1,200 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of possible explanations and I don't want  
to get sucked in too much into the whole pyrotechnic issue,'' 
Caddell said in a recent interview. ``It may turn out to be a red 
herring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials have always said the fire was set by the  
Davidians, not agents -- a position maintained after the FBI 
acknowledged last month that its agents fired a few pyrotechnic 
tear-gas projectiles on the siege's final day. There's no evidence 
those canisters, lobbed several hours before the fire, ignited the 
flames, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	That view is shared by an arson expert on the team that  
investigated the tragedy as part of the Justice Department's 1993 
Waco probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still say what we came to the conclusion on at the end of  
our investigation down there still holds today, regardless of what 
they are saying about these pyrotechnic devices,'' said Thomas 
Hitchings, chief deputy fire marshal in Allegheny County, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Caddell and others who accuse the government of a cover-up are  
examining theories that: 
</P>
<P>
	--Military tanks that punched holes into the building to insert  
non-burning tear gas knocked over lanterns the Davidians relied on 
after the FBI cut off electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	--Flash-bang devices used by federal agents ignited the building.  
Filmmaker Michael McNulty, who has espoused that theory, claims 
such devices were found near the fire's origins. The government 
disputes his assertions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Heat from the tanks' exhaust could have ignited the dwelling's  
wooden walls, which were reinforced with makeshift barricades of 
hay bales. 
</P>
<P>
	Caddell said a special forces operative told him of once trying  
to warm his gloved hands beneath the exhaust from such tanks, only 
to see his leather gloves ignite. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for General Dynamics Land Division, which  
manufactured the M728 Combat Engineer Vehicles used at Waco, said 
the tanks' diesel engines produce heat that ``does not get hot 
enough to start a fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno insists the fire was set by the  
Davidians. But stung by the FBI's recent disclosure, she named 
former Republican Sen. John Danforth of Missouri to investigate 
whether there was a cover-up or other wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI officials declined to address the scenarios suggested by  
Caddell and other skeptics, saying the fire's genesis has been 
extensively reviewed. And Danforth's inquiry ``would preclude us 
from making any comment,'' FBI spokesman Bill Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent arson investigators who combed the Waco ruins  
concluded the fire resulted from ``an intentional act'' by people 
inside the compound and that accelerants were used to speed the 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires were set in three locations, the team concluded. The fire  
began on the second floor's southeast corner, moments after a tank 
disengaged from that section's ground floor. Flames then were 
detected on the first floor's midsection and east side. 
</P>
<P>
	But former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms arson  
investigator Richard L. Sherrow, hired by the plaintiffs, concluded 
the fire started in only one location, most likely when the tank 
rammed the southeast corner. 
</P>
<P>
	David Thibodeau, one of nine Davidians who survived the final  
assault, said he does not believe agents intentionally set the 
fire. But he blames the government for the conditions leading up to 
the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although neither we nor the feds deliberately set Mount Carmel  
ablaze, the FBI must have been aware that the toxic brew they 
injected into our building in such enormous quantities would create 
a highly flammable condition that windy day,'' he writes in his new 
book. 
</P>
<P>
	For Caddell, the debate over who triggered the inferno  
ultimately may prove academic in a lawsuit that accuses the 
government of using excessive force throughout the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not have to prove how the fire started to win our  
lawsuit,'' he said. ``But I think we will prove that the 
government's actions on April 19 contributed to the spread of the 
fire ... and the deaths of Davidians as a result of the fire.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Makes Fla. Bomb Case a Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- FBI agents tracking a bomber suspected  
of twice hitting Florida A&AMP;M University told students and Gov. Jeb 
Bush on Wednesday that the case is the bureau's No. 1 priority in 
northern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Two pipe bombs exploded at the predominantly black university  
Aug. 31 and Sept. 22, one in an administration building restroom 
and the other in a restroom surrounded by classrooms and offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither explosion caused any injuries, and the damage was  
slight. But many of the school's 12,000 students and its 
administrators fear they may be dealing with a serial bomber out to 
send a message. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have my pledge, until this case is solved, no stone will  
go unturned,'' Tom Kneir, head of the FBI's office in northern 
Florida, told students Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of city and county police officers have descended on the  
hilltop campus, patrolling streets and checking everyone's 
identification 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveillance cameras paid for by the state were being installed  
across campus Wednesday. And all buildings are being checked for 
suspicious items every morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Tallahassee Police Chief Walt McNeil assured students that they  
would be safe at Saturday's home football game against Morgan 
State. ``We're going to go into that stadium and comb it from head 
to toe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he had asked Attorney General Janet Reno for $388,000  
to cover the cost of the extra security patrols until whoever is 
responsible for the bombings is caught. The governor said Reno had 
not committed, although he said she expressed sympathy and general 
support when he met with her in Washington last week.

<HEADLINE> Group: Cars Have Reduced Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators should push harder to  
reduce air pollution from power plants and factories and not put so 
much of the burden on the automobile, a leading motorists' advocacy 
group says. 
</P>
<P>
	AAA, formerly the American Automobile Association, says in a  
study being released today that pollution from automobiles, even 
when taking into account sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, 
has declined much more rapidly than chemicals from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
	It is time for the government to make sure that manufacturers,  
the utility industry and others are doing their share to clean up 
the environment, says AAA, the most widely known nationwide 
advocacy group for motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal, state and local governments ``need to go beyond  
targeting passenger vehicles if they hope to make any real progress 
in further cutting the smog in our cities,'' AAA spokeswoman Susan 
Pikrallidas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency did not challenge the AAA's  
numbers, based on data from local air planning agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA spokesman Dave Cohen said, however, that the agency wants  
``cleaner air across the board from all sources. The idea of 
suggesting this is some kind of contest is not particularly helpful 
or constructive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AAA study, which covered 25 cities, said hydrocarbons  
emissions from all sources decreased by 56 percent and nitrogen 
oxide emissions by 4 percent over the last 30 years. But autos have 
cut hydrocarbon emissions by 80 percent and nitrogen oxide by 38 
percent in the same period, despite a doubling of vehicle miles 
traveled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cars and light trucks represent the bulk of emissions  
reductions that we have observed over the last 30 years from all 
sources,'' said Dan Meszler of Energy and Environmental Analysis 
Inc., the study's author. ``If we took all cars and light trucks 
off the road, 74 percent to 78 percent of the emissions would still 
be out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Billings of the American Lung Association said cities  
struggling to meet the EPA's clean air requirements need continued 
reductions from wherever they are available. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as the number of miles traveled continues to increase,  
each incremental decrease from cars makes a difference because 
there are so many cars on the road,'' Billings said. ``The air is 
still dirty. We need to clean it for our health and to have our 
cities meet air quality standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA is expected to produce regulations by the end of the  
year that will impose tougher emissions controls on cars and trucks 
as well as require the sale of gasoline that contains much less 
sulfur. The agency also is pursuing an aggressive campaign to 
reduce smog-causing pollution from older, dirtier coal-burning 
power plants and has put into place new air quality standards that 
will require states and communities to curtail all sources of air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	The study examined pollution from cars and light trucks;  
stationary sources such as power plants, factories and commercial 
businesses; products such as paints or cleaning solvents; other 
vehicles on the road such as motorcycles and large trucks; and 
other mobile sources such as trains, boats, lawn mowers, airplanes 
and construction equipment.

<HEADLINE> Risks Still Facing World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Finance ministers and central bankers from 182  
countries are grappling with risks still facing the world economy 
despite signs of recovery in some crisis-hit nations. 
</P>
<P>
	They were discussing wide-ranging reforms of the global  
financial system designed to head off future turmoil and ways to 
start forgiving loans to the world's poorest nations more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was addressing delegates from 182 nations this  
afternoon at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund 
and the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was expected to focus his remarks on a plan to cancel as  
much as $27 billion in debt owed by the poor nations that was 
approved by major industrialized countries over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	He told religious leaders at a breakfast Tuesday that the United  
States must pay its fare share of the cost of the debt initiative 
and not let political differences between the administration and 
Congress get in the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want this to wind up being like our dues to the United  
Nations, Clinton said. ``Now that we have advocated this and gotten 
everyone else to agree to it, we have to pay our fare share, so I 
hope all of you will help us pass the legislation through Congress 
to do just that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations says the United States owes $1.6 billion in  
back dues and legislation in the Republican-controlled Congress to 
pay the arrears is stalled again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton played a major role in urging partners from the wealthy  
industrialized nations to provide quicker, faster and deeper debt 
relief to poor countries at the Cologne summit in June. 
</P>
<P>
	British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, the head of  
the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee, told the IMF-World Bank 
meeting the debt relief initiative ``signaled a worldwide alliance 
against poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that in the wake of allegations about alleged  
misuse of IMF funds by Russia the organization must ``review its 
procedures and controls to strengthen the safeguards'' on use of 
its money. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has warned no more of its money would be disbursed to  
Russia until the government and the central bank prove they were 
serious about battling corruption and publish quarterly central 
bank audits. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has denied any IMF funds were used illegally and  
complained the industrialized nations were treating it unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the controversy, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus  
said the international community should not stop working with 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be the height of irresponsibility to turn our back on  
this great nation,'' Camdessus said. He said the economic program 
that Russia and the IMF agreed on was on track and real progress 
had been made in the past seven years in helping the government 
develop a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Camdessus and James Wolfensohn, president of the World  
Bank, urged the international community to do more to fight global 
poverty.

<HEADLINE> EU OKs Funding for BBC News Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union regulators Wednesday  
ruled that public funding for the British Broadcasting Corp.'s 
24-hour television news channel does not breach EU rules on 
government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	In approving state funding for BBC News 24, the European  
Commission rejected a complaint from the channel's main competitor, 
Rupert Murdoch's Sky television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission ruled that the BBC's funding by license fees  
levied on all British television owners did constitute state aid, 
but it also ruled that subsidies for public service broadcasting 
could be exempt from EU restrictions on government handouts. 
</P>
<P>
	BBC News 24 was launched in 1997 and is delivered free of charge  
to cable and satellite operators in Britain. It is also shown on 
the terrestrial channel BBC1, in early morning hours after normal 
network programming ends.

</P>
<P>
	WENATCHEE, Wash. (AP) -- W.B. ``Babe'' Gavin, longtime owner and  
publisher of the Lake Chelan Mirror weekly newspaper, died 
Wednesday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after losing his right arm to cancer in 1970, Gavin  
continued to paste up news stories, develop pictures and set type. 
He also kept on driving a tractor in his apple orchard. 
</P>
<P>
	Gavin drove a laundry truck in Cashmere until the publisher of  
the Cashmere Valley Record hired him in 1932 to sell ads, write 
news and lay out the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper business stuck. When the Lake Chelan Mirror in the  
town of Chelan was put up for sale in 1937, Gavin's boss helped him 
buy it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gavin married Margaret Laschinger in 1939, and the two operated  
the Mirror for more than 30 years before their son Rick Gavin 
became publisher in 1973.

<P>
	Hudson was elected a Boone County judge in 1955. He served four  
terms before being elected state senator, a position he held from 
1963 through 1972.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anneli Cahn Lax, the editor of a series of  
textbooks aimed at making mathematics more accessible to the 
general reader, died Friday. She was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lax retired from New York University in 1992, where she  
taught for 31 years. In her dissertation at NYU, she made 
significant contributions to the theory of hyperbolic equations, 
which deals with the behavior of waves.

<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Air Force Gen. Gustavo Leigh Guzman, a  
key figure in the 1973 coup led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, died 
Wednesday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh was commander of the air force on Sept. 11, 1973, the day  
of the Pinochet-led coup that toppled Marxist President Salvador 
Allende. 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh quickly emerged as the toughest member in the four-man  
military junta. Just hours after the coup, Leigh vowed the military 
would ``eradicate the Marxist cancer from our fatherland, until the 
last consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was on his personal orders, he disclosed later, that the air  
force bombarded and heavily damaged the presidential palace to put 
down the resistance by Allende and a small group of his followers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, Leigh was the first junta member to urge the  
restoration of civilian rule. That cost him his position with both 
the junta and the air force. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, when Pinochet called a vote to request that Chileans  
reject the United Nation's condemnation of the regime's human 
rights record, Leigh called the move ``typical of governments in 
which power is in the hands of a single dictator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other members of the junta -- Adm. Jose Toribio Merino and  
police Gen. Cesar Mendoza -- have died. Pinochet remains under house 
arrest in Britain fighting extradition to Spain, where a judge 
wants to try him for the human rights abuses during his 17-year 
regime.

for transportation safety and health issues, died Tuesday night at 
the age of 54 after a nearly three-year battle with breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	During her illness, Mosley, a Democrat, became an advocate for  
breast cancer research and urged women in their 40s to have 
mammograms.

<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Bishop Edward W. O'Rourke, retired leader of  
the Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria, died Wednesday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a long history of health problems, including heart  
ailments and a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 55 years as a priest and bishop, he lectured on  
theological and socioeconomic issues and wrote six books. He was 
bishop of the local diocese from 1971 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	He also taught for 15 years at the University of Illinois and  
later became executive secretary of the National Catholic Rural 
Life Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered a stroke in 1985 and had heart and other ailments  
since then, but he remained active in church-related work. He 
founded Renaissance Stand, which helps the unemployed find jobs, 
soon after retiring.

<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Ancient history expert Chester G. Starr,  
professor emeritus at the University of Michigan and author of more 
than 20 books, died Sept. 22. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  
and wrote more than 20 scholarly books. He was founding president 
of the Association of Ancient Historians. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Centralia, Mo., Starr earned bachelor's and master's  
desgrees at the University of Missouri and a doctorate at Cornell 
University. He served as professor of history at the University of 
Illinois for 30 years before joining the Michigan faculty in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	The regents said his ``virtuoso performances in the classroom  
and his evident delight in explaining the complexity and 
significance of ancient societies have captivated several 
generations of students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr served with the U.S. Army from 1942-46. He was chief of  
the Historical Section with the Fifth Army in Italy, and attained 
the rank of lieutenant colonel.

</P>
<P>
	CROWN POINT, Ind. (AP) -- John Richard Zieba, who twice escaped  
execution at the Auschwitz Nazi concentration camp, died Saturday 
after a long illness. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	After earning a master's degree in chemical engineering in 1939,  
Zieba was arrested by the Nazis for his involvement in the Polish 
Underground, a rebellion group that engaged in activities designed 
to disrupt the German occupation of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	He was held at several Nazi concentration camps and was released  
in 1945 by German guards, who were ordered to kill all prisoners 
before the Allies advanced but did not. 
</P>
<P>
	After his release, Zieba moved to Germany, where he met his  
wife, Victoria Twarogowska. They were married on Aug. 7, 1946, and 
moved to the United States three years later. 
</P>
<P>
	They settled in Cleveland, where Zieba eventually went to work  
for the Robert Gair Co., which was later bought by the Continental 
Can Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, the company transferred Zieba to its Elkhart plant. He  
stayed there until 1960, when he went to work as a chemist at 
Whitehall Laboratories before retiring in 1980.

Paul, died of a heart attack after running the company for eight 
years beginning in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early years of this decade, the Fosters decided the  
company needed changes. They retained ownership, but brought in an 
outside chief executive officer and board of directors. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- John Wilds, a veteran New Orleans  
newspaperman who found a second career writing histories and 
biographies, died Monday. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilds spent more than four decades in journalism, first as  
bureau chief for The Associated Press in New Orleans, then as a 
writer and editor for the city's afternoon newspapers, The New 
Orleans States and The States-Item. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit upon his second career in the early 1970s when he was  
assigned to write a history of the States-Item, published in 1976, 
the year before the newspaper's centennial. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired in 1978 but continued writing, including histories of  
Ochsner Medical Institutions, the Orleans Parish Medical Society 
and the Port of New Orleans. He also collaborated on a biography of 
Dr. Alton Ochsner and on histories of New Orleans and of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked for the AP in Florida and New Orleans for 13 years  
before going to work at The States. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1958, The Times-Picayune Publishing Co. bought The Item and  
merged it with The States to create The States-Item. Wilds became 
the city editor. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his newspaper work, Wilds did freelance work for  
Time, Life, Fortune and Sports Illustrated, and he covered medical 
conventions for medical publications. 
</P>
<P>
	His freelance assignments ran the gamut from historic moments,  
such as James Meredith's integration of the University of 
Mississippi, to a feature on an Audubon Zoo stakeout to watch a 
whooping crane lay eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife Tommie Lee Pittman Wilds, his son  
John S. Wilds, and a grandson.

<HEADLINE> `Unmistakably' Mackie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bob Mackie has seen his life flash in front of  
his eyes: It's a purple, aqua and magenta cape decorated with a 
roulette wheel and draped over a white sequined wedding gown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Las Vegas wedding outfit, with its battery-operated blinking  
lights, is one of the most eye-catching pieces in ``Unmistakably 
Mackie,'' a glittering retrospective of the designer's work that 
will be on display at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of 
Technology through Dec. 31. The retrospective took more than a year 
to organize. It includes Mackie's childhood doodles, original 
sketches and designs from a career that has spanned nearly four 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothing designed for Cher and comedian Carol Burnett fill  
entire sections of the exhibit, which includes more than 125 
outfits and almost 20 of his special-edition Barbie dolls. Diana 
Ross, Madonna and ``Seinfeld'' regular Julia Louis-Dreyfus have 
been dressed by the ``Designer to the Stars.'' He has also dressed 
Mitzi Gaynor, Barbra Streisand, Liza Minnelli, Sharon Stone and 
RuPaul. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see things you haven't seen in a while and you think `not  
bad,''' Mackie said as he walked through the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	The retrospective includes the animal-print jumpsuit that Cher's  
``Laverne'' character wore on her 1970s variety series. The outfit 
is one of the designer's favorites. Mackie also created the sheer 
gown with black sequins that Cher wore when she accepted the Oscar 
for best actress (``Moonstruck'') in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outfits are sometimes mistaken for fashion, but they're  
costumes like for a character in a play,'' said Mackie, shaking off 
criticism of Cher's often outlandish wardrobe. ``I want people to 
have fun. I want people to say `Wasn't that interesting?' or 
`Wasn't that wild?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Mackie created 22 to 24 glamorous dresses per season for the  
opening segment of Burnett's long-running variety show, along with 
dozens of costumes for the comedy sketches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love doing funny things. One week I'd have to make Carol an  
unattractive postal worker, and who knows what I'd have to do the 
next,'' said Mackie, wearing an olive shirt, olive slacks and a 
black tie. 
</P>
<P>
	He designs miniature versions of his gowns for Barbie dolls.  
``Right now, I'm in my `international fantasy goddess' phase,'' he 
said. ``I don't do `Barbie goes to the supermarket.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit's title is also the name of a new book and a new  
fragrance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mackie continues to dress Cher, Burnett and Ross. He created the  
``Elizabeth'' gown that Whoopi Goldberg wore when she hosted this 
year's Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	Mackie, 59, is a seven-time Emmy Award winner. As a child, he  
was inspired by Hollywood's Technicolor movie musicals. Using a 
record as a soundtrack, he would create tabletop shows using 
hand-drawn puppets in elaborate costumes. He's been nominated for 
three Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	He enjoys creating costumes and eveningwear. ``It is all about  
looking good and living your fantasies. You can dream you're a 
czarina or Hedy Lamarr.''

<HEADLINE> Ventura Makes Criticisms on Religion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- In another reminder that Gov. Jesse  
Ventura is no ordinary politician, the former wrestler told Playboy 
magazine that organized religion is for ``weak-minded people'' and 
that the Navy's Tailhook sexual harassment scandal was ``much ado 
about nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he believed President Kennedy was killed by the  
``military-industrial complex'' because he opposed intervention in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who has gained national influence in the Reform Party  
since he upset two veteran politicians in Minnesota's gubernatorial 
race last year, aired his views on subjects ranging from beautiful 
women to what life in the White House would be like. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview, conducted over three days this summer with  
contributing editor Lawrence Grobel, appears in the November issue, 
which goes on sale Monday. The Associated Press obtained an advance 
copy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said legalizing prostitution should be considered but is  
an unpopular idea because of religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Organized religion is a sham and a crutch for weak-minded  
people who need strength in numbers,'' the governor said. ``It 
tells people to go out and stick their noses in other people's 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, Ventura spokesman John Wodele pointed out  
that Ventura and his wife belong to a church. ``Understand that he 
was talking about extremists of the religious right who are often 
intolerant, and the governor cannot stand intolerance,'' Wodele 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, a former Navy SEAL who spent time in Southeast  
Asia in the early 1970s, told Playboy he couldn't condone what 
happened during the Tailhook Association's conference in 1991, when 
female Navy officers were groped and fondled by aviators at a Las 
Vegas hotel. But he said he understood it. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are people who live on the razor's edge and defy death  
and do things where people die,'' he said. ``They're not going to 
consider grabbing a woman's breast or buttock a major situation. 
That's much ado about nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grobel suggested it wasn't trivial for the women.  
</P>
<P>
	``So? You have to create these people for your own protection,''  
Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura talked about the best part of his job -- ``It's good to  
be king,'' he said. ``The best thing is that there's no one in this 
state who can tell me what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the worst: ``You become a slave. I can't go anywhere without  
guards. You become a prisoner of your own success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has said he doesn't plan to run for president next  
year, Ventura said if he did, he would wait until summer to enter 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would let Gore and Bush hang each other with all the rope  
they have, to the point where the public couldn't stand either of 
them. Their disapproval ratings would skyrocket,'' he said. ``Then 
you enter the race three months before the election and take the 
whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he wouldn't run because the president ``lives in a jail  
cell. He's the king of the jail cell. He's the most powerful man in 
the free world, but he's not really free, is he?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura detailed his previously expressed belief that John F.  
Kennedy's assassination was a conspiracy. He said he believes 
assassins were hired. Playboy asked who hired them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want people to think I'm some sort of erratic nut  
running the state of Minnesota. If you truly want to know, I 
believe we did, the military-industrial complex. I believe Kennedy 
was going to withdraw us from Vietnam and there were factions that 
didn't want that,'' Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said drugs and prostitution should not be ``imprisoning  
crimes'' because the government has more important things to do. 
</P>
<P>
	And he added: ``The prohibition of drugs causes crime. You don't  
have to legalize it, just decriminalize it. Regulate it. Create 
places where the addict can go get it.''

<HEADLINE> Ditka To Chicago: Get Over It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- In Chicago, they still think of him as Da  
Coach of Da Bears. But Mike Ditka thinks only in terms of black and 
gold these days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the New Orleans Saints coach,'' Ditka said. ``It's where I  
want to be and it's where I want to stay. I don't live in the past. 
This is my team now and this is my city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints play the Bears on Sunday in Chicago and, while people  
in the Windy City might still be mourning the loss of Iron Mike, 
Ditka is thinking about just one thing -- picking up his second win 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to go up there and win,'' defensive coordinator  
Zaven Yaralian said. ``That's been Mike's focus on the game. If 
it's any different than the other 15, he hasn't shown it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Ditka's reputation was forged in Chicago -- as coach for  
11 years, he's second only to team founder George Halas in tenure 
and victories. During that time, the Bears dominated the NFC 
Central, won the division six times and the Super Bowl once. 
</P>
<P>
	Memories of victories and of Ditka stalking the sideline,  
screaming at players, coaches and officials, remain strong. It was 
the basis of many ``Saturday Night Live'' skits in which a group of 
blue-collar guys praised both ``Da Bears'' and ``Da Coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of great memories from Chicago and still have a  
lot of friends there,'' Ditka said. ``It will always be a special 
place for me. But you can't live in the past. I don't. This is my 
home now, the Saints are my team. I love this place and this team. 
They only way they'll get me out of here is to force me to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compared to the Chicago years, Ditka's reign in New Orleans has  
been unexceptional. He's made more headlines off the field than on 
-- criticizing the city, quitting -- then retracting it -- during his 
first year, and donning a dreadlocks wig and wedding attire after 
drafting Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	But now that he has the running back he wanted and has settled  
in (he's opening a New Orleans restaurant called ``Ditka's'' this 
fall), Ditka said the 6-10 records of his first two years and the 
Saints' status of being the only NFL team to never win a playoff 
game are destined to be over. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good place, the people work hard, they're good  
people and they've been more than good to me,'' he said. ``Now I 
want to be the one to bring them a Super Bowl. I can do it with 
this organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winning a Super Bowl in New Orleans is probably what it will  
take to fully cement his new image, Ditka admits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until that happens, we're not going to be as well known or  
remembered as what happened in Chicago,'' Ditka said. ``It'll 
happen here. I absolutely believe that. It will happen here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka's new team is forged along the lines of the Chicago team  
he remembers so fondly -- strong running back, journeyman 
quarterback, staunch defense. And he has stressed getting players 
with the kind of work ethic he nurtured with the Bears. These days, 
however, he refers to those blue-collar players as ``Boudreauxs,'' 
not ``Grabowskies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fortunate in Chicago because I had a lot of warriors,''  
Ditka said. ``You need a lot of warriors to win in this league. 
Guys have to have a lot of character. They have to have a lot of 
character when the going is tough. We have a lot of guys like that 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Sunday, when Ditka walks onto the field in Chicago, he'll be  
focused on only one thing -- winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of silly, isn't it?'' Ditka said of the furor his  
return to face his old team stirs. ``What happened 15 years ago 
should have no bearing on what's going on now. It doesn't really. 
You can't take the past away from you, but you can't live in the 
past. I don't do that. It's just a football game.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Chided for Tax Refund Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican proposal to delay refunds for  
more than 20 million taxpayers was criticized as unfair and poor 
tax policy Wednesday by Democrats and the nation's largest tax 
preparer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would represent a tax increase on up to 20 million working  
families and it would be an anti-work tax increase,'' said Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers of GOP plans to change refunds for 
people claiming the earned income tax credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not seem appropriate to us to hold up the incentive  
payments upon which working families depend in some cases for as 
much as two years,'' Summers told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at H&AMP;R Block Inc. said the proposal to convert the  
refunds from a lump sum to monthly payments would force millions of 
low-income people to put off major purchases such as a car or take 
out high-interest loans for everything from Christmas gifts to 
medical procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a decision that could cause confusion and disrupt the  
personal lives of hardworking American families,'' said Frank 
Salizzoni, Block chief executive officer. He added that the move 
would ``single out the working poor who are counting on these 
refunds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress want to spread the refunds over 12  
months to produce $8.7 billion in savings they can use to pay for 
fiscal 2000 appropriations bills without breaking balanced-budget 
spending caps or dipping into Social Security money. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders say the move would not reduce the refunds by a  
single dime, might cut down on the chronic EITC fraud problem by 
removing the lure of a large cash payment and would bring the 
program in line with other federal monthly assistance such as food 
stamps and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every other income transfer program we have is done on a  
monthly basis,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. 
``It is a common-sense way to do this sort of thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Created in 1975, the credit acts as an incentive to keep people  
working and contributing payroll taxes to Social Security and 
Medicare. Last year, people earning between $10,000 and $31,000 
were eligible for a maximum credit of $3,756, depending on how many 
children they have. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the Internal Revenue Service processed $23 billion in  
refunds under the credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say spreading out the payments would prevent people  
from saving more money or making credit card payments, effectively 
taking money out of their pockets in the form of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans want to steal from the working class and give  
to the rich,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Summers said, ``it would in no event be feasible''  
for the IRS to implement the change by January, particularly given 
the sensitivity of any computer reprogramming in light of the Year 
2000 glitch. It would also require the IRS to issue millions of 
extra checks, raising administrative costs.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asia stock markets closed mixed Wednesday, with  
the key indexes slipping in Tokyo and Hong Kong on profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 43.42  
points, or 0.25 percent, to close at 17,282.28. On Tuesday, the 
average closed up 504.64 points, or 3.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei fell as investors locked in profits following a surge  
in the stock market the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks also came under moderate selling following an  
overnight decline on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial 
average was down 27.86 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,275.53 on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders say the market will remain cautious until the release of  
the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment on 
Monday and the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy board meeting, also 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 106.90 yen  
late Wednesday, up 0.38 yen from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index slipped 10.04  
points, or 0.07 percent, closing at 12,834.89. On Tuesday, the 
index had gained 84.47 points, or 0.66 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said some investors took profits following losses  
overnight on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about the lack of progress on China's bid to join the  
World Trade Organization and a possible U.S. rate increase next 
week also dampened sentiment in Hong Kong, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean share prices slumped, with the key index plunging  
3.5 percent on fears of a local interest rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 31.85 points to  
868.88. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Taiwan shares rose for the first time since last week's  
earthquake, as bargain hunters gradually came off the sidelines and 
bought up oversold chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 37.60  
points or 0.5 percent, to 7,615.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed little changed. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index edged up 0.67 point to 2,015.71. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher, extending their gains  
for a second day. The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 
selected companies rose 10.98 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,081.41. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed lower, pressured by a  
wave of selling in the gold sector after its exceptional rally 
earlier in the week. The All Ordinaries Index closed at 2,897.8, 
down 22.8 points, or 0.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed lower in thin trading. The  
benchmark Straits Times Index fell 6.87 points, or 0.3 percent, to 
2,017.57. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed higher following some  
afternoon buying by government-linked institutional funds. The 
Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, rose 4.37 
points, or 0.6 percent, to 683.51. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed mixed as continued-profit  
taking in select blue chips dragged down the main index. The 
Composite Index fell 0.5 percent, or 2.752 points, to 526.469. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher. The Thailand SET Index  
rose 5.84 points, or 1.5 percent, to 391.07.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Mum on Lewis Rematch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Evander Holyfield ate his words the first time  
he fought Lennox Lewis, so ``mum'' is the word for the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a prediction, I just won't let anybody know,''  
the WBA-IBF champion said Wednesday at a media luncheon to hype the 
Nov. 13 fight in the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield said before he fought WBC champion Lewis on March 13  
in Madison Square Garden that he would win on a third-round 
knockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight ended in a draw, although most ringsiders thought  
Lewis won clearly, and led to a several hearings and a grand jury 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt the fight was even,'' said Holyfield, adding that he  
suffered abdominal cramps from a virus before the fight and leg 
cramps during the match. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he didn't pull out of the bout, Holyfield said, ``When  
I train as hard as I trained for the fight, I'm going to fight. I 
never took so many chances in my life. I knew the reason I was 
getting hit so much was that I couldn't shift my legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They call him a warrior,'' Lewis said. ``But all I can say is  
Evander always makes excuses after a poor performance. His only 
problem was me punching him. I still say Evander Holyfield has 
never seen a boxer like me, and he still don't have an answer for 
Lennox Lewis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said that he was irked by people saying that while he won  
the fight, he should have knocked out Holyfield, but that he was 
too cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at all my fights, and you can see any time Lennox is put  
under pressure, he answers with pressure, with punches. He doesn't 
run into a hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis also said, however, ``I look at the tape of the fight and  
I see things I could have done and should have done, and in this 
fight I'll do them. I don't think this fight will go the 
distance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rematch in the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center will be a pay-per-view  
bout, as was the first fight for which Holyfield was guaranteed $20 
million and Lewis $10 million. Each is guaranteed $15 million in 
November.

<HEADLINE> St. Mary's Coach Accused of Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. MARY'S CITY, Md. (AP) -- Othell Wilson, who played with Ralph  
Sampson at Virginia, has been accused of raping a student and was 
placed on leave as basketball coach at St. Mary's College. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested Monday and charged with abducting a 22-year-old  
woman and raping her at his apartment. The 38-year-old coach was 
being held without bond Wednesday at the St. Mary's County 
Detention Center in Leonardtown. He also faces charges of false 
imprisonment and assault. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to the home of a St. Mary's spokesman was not immediately  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson picked up the woman at her home in Fairfax County, Va.,  
for a date Friday night, St. Mary's County Sheriff's Lt. John Horne 
said. Police said he then drove the woman to his apartment in St. 
Inigoes, held her against her will until Sunday morning and hinted 
he had a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told her that if she left, he would kill her,'' Horne said.  
``She is very, very afraid of this guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson then is accused of driving her home and threatening to  
kill her if she told anyone what happened, Horne said. The victim 
contacted police and was examined at a hospital in Fairfax County. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson joined St. Mary's as an assistant coach in 1998 and was  
promoted to head coach in August. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a point guard for Virginia and played on Final Four teams  
in 1981 and 1984. In the NBA, he played for Sacramento and Golden 
State.

<HEADLINE>  Jockey Valenzuela Rides Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- A cheer went up as Patrick Valenzuela  
strode into Santa Anita's paddock ahead of the horses to ride his 
first race in two years Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was greeted by shouts of ``Way to go, Patrick,'' and ``We  
love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans, jockeys and horsemen knew they were witnessing what  
many believe is the final comeback of a talented jockey who won the 
1989 Kentucky Derby only to have his career implode because of 
drugs, alcohol, unexplained absences and run-ins with the police. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't screw up anymore, Pat,'' shouted Anthony Gonzales of El  
Monte. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela, 36, seems to realize he won't be back on the track  
if something goes wrong this time. Five months ago, he was pulling 
weeds at a nursery for $10 an hour. Earlier this year, he spent 30 
days in jail before armed robbery charges against him were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as horse racing, this is my last chance,'' he said.  
``There's conditions on my license where there's no mistakes to be 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela didn't win with any of his four mounts on opening day  
of Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting. He finished sixth, fourth and 
seventh on his first three. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a ball,'' he said between races. ``I feel like I  
won the big race already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riding the ironically named Holy Hope, Valenzuela was last among  
11 horses in the $100,000 Senator Ken Maddy Handicap -- the first 
stakes mount of his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically feel like a bug boy (apprentice jockey) that just  
got his license,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's OK because I'm very excited about it and I feel like I'm  
totally jazzed to go out there and ride hard on any horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela charged out of the starting gate to the lead with his  
first two mounts, a familiar position for the rider known as a 
frontrunner. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where P-Val likes to be. That's his patented spot, so  
he hasn't lost his touch,'' Hall of Fame rider Chris McCarron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, he received a one-year jockey's license. Among the  
conditions under which he can ride are required attendance at 
twice-weekly counseling sessions, random drug testing and no 
unexcused absences. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are watching me, it's OK,'' said Valenzuela, who  
claims he attends Alcoholics Anonymous four times a week. ``I 
invite them to watch me, I invite them to ask me any question 
they'd like because I'll answer it honestly and fully to the best 
of my knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Sanford Shulman took a chance on Valenzuela, just as the  
trainer has for Valenzuela's other comebacks over the last decade. 
Their friendship dates back 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really is down deep a very good person. He means well, but  
ufortunately, the demons sometimes get ahold of him,'' Shulman 
said. ``I want to help him as a person. He's not going to get many 
more chances from the horse racing board. It just makes sense that 
this is going to be the last shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela's agent, Nick Cosato, said he has 25 mounts in the  
first 11 days of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela, who said he weighed 149 pounds in May, rode at 118  
pounds Wednesday. To reach his goal of 116-117 pounds, he's eating 
one meal a day, usually salad with grilled chicken and non-fat 
dressing or chicken with a plain baked potato and plenty of water. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm cutting down a lot on my food. It takes a little bit out  
of your energy,'' he said. ``I'd say two or three weeks from now I 
will feel 100 percent the way I felt two years ago and maybe even 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is wild about having Valenzuela around. Those with  
mixed feelings remember his positive drug tests, numerous 
suspensions and a 1988 fight in the jockey's room that left him 
with a broken hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows that this is going to be probably his last chance and  
I really don't think he's going to blow it this time,'' Hall of 
Fame rider Laffit Pincay Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people probably don't like what's going on, but he keeps  
coming back and he keeps trying,'' Pincay said. ``If he had the 
guts to come back and face everybody, I don't see why I shouldn't 
wish him well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela said he was surprised by the welcome reception from  
fans and horsemen, some of whom he burned in the past by missing 
riding commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	``These last two years have been hell, but it's getting sweeter  
every day,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Beatty Mum on Presidential Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Warren Beatty, toying with the  
notion of running for president, told Hollywood's liberal elite 
Wednesday night that Democrats and Republicans alike are 
participating in ``a slow motion coup d'etat of big money interests 
over the public interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Beatty did not give the crowd what it came to hear: a yes or  
no about whether he would seek the presidency. He did promise to at 
least ``speak up'' with a liberal voice in hopes of influencing a 
Democratic Party he says has moved too far to the middle of 
American politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of Beatty's speech was a preachy, passionate address  
that called for public financing of elections and condemned the 
``centrist ways'' of the Democratic Party and its two candidates, 
Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley. He said both men were 
honorable and capable, but condemned what he said is a trend in 
which the increasingly moderate Democratic Party is looking more 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there no protest anymore?'' Beatty, an unabashed liberal,  
told a celebrity-studded audience of several hundred people during 
a speech to the Southern California Americans for Democratic 
Action, which honored him with an award. ``Are we coming to the 
point where the Democratic Party has to have a Republican president 
to find its voice again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty said both parties forget that the prosperous economy is  
leaving millions of Americans behind. ``The rising tide doesn't 
raise all boats,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said America's biggest problems -- health care, poverty,  
homelessness and the widening gulf between the rich and the poor -- 
cannot be solved until the political system is overhauled. As a 
solution, he offered public financing of elections, arguing that 
the cost of the last two national elections, if divided among 
Americans, would cost less than $4 each. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a small price to pay for knowing that elected (officials)  
don't owe anybody anything,'' Beatty said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said corporate chiefs, not public servants, are writing  
the rules of the new global economy and ignoring the interests of 
working people. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are in danger of experiencing is a slow-motion, coup  
d'etat of big money interests over the public interest,'' Beatty 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest the actor-director came to revealing his intentions  
was at the end of the speech, when he pretended to give advice to 
someone considering a presidential run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say, 'Look, there's no harm in thinking of that no matter  
how unlikely it may be but, whatever you do, go ahead and speak up. 
Speak up for people who nobody speaks for and if you speak up, 
well, maybe you'll influence some people. Maybe you'll influence 
the (Democratic) party, maybe you'll influence the candidates that 
are running,'' said Beatty, who repeatedly framed his indecision by 
referring to himself in the third person. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said little about his intentions since disclosing seven  
weeks ago that he thinking about becoming a candidate for 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lila Garrett, president of the Southern California ADA, gave  
Beatty credit for forcing Gore and Bradley to address liberal 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of Warren the liberal agenda is suddenly warming up,''  
she said. ``We've had crumbs for 18 years. Now what we want, what 
we need, what we demand, is the whole loaf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Beatty candidacy would be a magnet for attention because of  
the synergy between politics and Hollywood, but he would enter the 
race as an underdog. At best, he might force liberal issues onto 
the agenda and tip the scales in the Gore-Bradley battle, 
Democratic consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience was filled with people enthusiastic about a Beatty  
run, though their excitement was tempered by the realization that 
he likely would not win. Among them were Hustler magazine publisher 
Larry Flynt, actors Dustin Hoffman and Faye Dunaway, television 
producer Norman Lear and former Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists with news outlets from Germany, Japan, France,  
Spain, Italy, Great Britain and Canada, as well as national 
reporters, also flocked to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty even poked fund at the spectacle of the evening. He began  
the speech by placing both hands firmly on the lectern, looking 
straight into the bank of TV cameras and saying, ``My fellow 
Americans, the state of the union is sound,'' as the audience 
roared with laughter at the presidential spoof. ``Thank you very 
much, I just had to get that off my chest,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Chevron CEO Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Chevron Corp. today named a vice chairman,  
Dave O'Reilly, as its new chairman and chief executive officer, 
replacing Ken Derr, who is retiring after running the oil company 
for the last 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Nov. 1998, O'Reilly, 52, has been responsible for  
Chevron's worldwide exploration and production activities, as well 
as the effort to cut Chevron's operating costs by $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dave O'Reilly is the right person to lead Chevron in the  
future,'' said Derr, 63. ``He combines broad company experience 
with a record of achieving superior business results, and he has 
strong leadership skills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Dublin, Ireland, O'Reilly joined Chevron as an  
engineer in 1968. By 1989, he became CEO of Chevron's chemical 
subsidiary. Beginning in 1994, he led Chevron's U.S. refining and 
marketing operations, whose earnings rose from $75 million in 1995 
to $633 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	During Derr's tenure, Chevron has expanded its overseas oil  
production, cut its operating costs, increased its stock dividends 
and increased the company's market capitalization from $15 billion 
to $60 billion, the company said.

<HEADLINE> DHL Uses Truck Fleet To Carry Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The package courier DHL Worldwide Express is  
letting its U.S. truck fleet carry its advertising load. 
</P>
<P>
	The California-based company is foregoing traditional ads but  
hopes to catch customers' attention with a splashy redesign of 
signs on its entire 3,000-vehicle U.S. fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The trucks will now each carry three destination names like  
Tokyo, London, India and Turkey in big letters, and the company 
name in less prominent type to highlight DHL's international 
delivery capability. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, its bigger rival Federal Express is taking a more  
traditional approach for its industry-leading domestic express 
shipment service, running a new round of humorous commercials aimed 
at businesses selling over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	DHL, based in Redwood City, Calif., barely registers with a tiny  
2 percent share of the huge market for air express deliveries 
within the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	But it accounts for 40 percent of the smaller international  
market which counts air express shipments across national borders, 
according to figures from Air Cargo Management Group, a 
Seattle-based consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Express, which accounts for 46 percent of domestic air  
express shipments, is second at 20 percent of international 
deliveries, the consulting firm's figures show. 
</P>
<P>
	DHL is celebrating its 30th anniversary this week and has tried  
mass-market TV and print ads in the past with some success. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990's, it ran commercials that showed its vans  
flying past the competition's airplanes. More recently, its ads 
depicted local couriers hired by DHL rivals dallying at the cafe 
while DHL employees were busy making deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rising cost and competitive clutter in traditional  
advertising combined with the need to reach a narrow audience of 
business executives responsible for shipping drove DHL toward a 
different marketing plan this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realized we were sitting on a tremendous ad medium with our  
fleet of vehicles,'' said David Fonkalsrud, a spokesman for DHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Each truck will carry three different destination names along  
with drawings associated with that locale -- pyramids for Cairo, a 
windmill for Holland and the opera house arches for Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The DHL logo looks the same but will be slightly less prominent.  
</P>
<P>
	The new markings have been tested for a year in northern  
California, and should be on 75 percent of the fleet by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The redesign is expected to cost less than $1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Clive Chajet, who heads his own marketing consultancy, said DHL  
has found ``a decent media for delivering messages'' by using its 
own trucks as ad vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traditional media is not the most cost-effective media'' for  
companies trying to get attention, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Express, the Memphis, Tenn.-based courier which  
overhauled its fleet earlier this decade, is introducing several 
new ads in its ``Be Absolutely Sure'' campaign that started last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	That campaign included an ad that showed a rival courier sending  
the Stanley Cup hockey trophy to Bolivia and a bag of donkey feed 
to an arena where a hockey crowd was eager to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ads, debuting on network TV this week, show three  
executives looking on in mock amazement as Web site designers 
ranging from computer geeks to a raging man who smashes the 
machines try to win their business. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever Web designer you choose, the ads say, use FedEx to ship  
your products. ``Business people like the approach -- they can 
identify with it,'' said Jim Lyski, vice president of U.S. 
marketing for Federal Express. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to say how much it is spending on the ads, but said  
it will spend at least as much as last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade publication Advertising Age said Federal Express spent  
$125 million on ads last year.

<HEADLINE> Dean Settling Watergate Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former White House counsel John W. Dean III  
has settled a seven-year-old libel suit he filed against the author 
of a book portraying him as the mastermind of the Watergate 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan signed a one-page order  
dismissing the case on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal came after State Farm Insurance Cos., the author's  
personal liability insurance carrier, decided to pay the Deans an 
undisclosed sum to resolve the dispute, insurance company spokesman 
Joe Johnson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate deal, he said State Farm agreed to pay Leonard  
Colodny of Tampa, Fla., author of the 1991 book titled ``Silent 
Coup,'' an undisclosed amount of money for fees and expenses that 
Colodny incurred in defending the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The book claims Dean orchestrated the 1972 burglary at the  
Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington in an 
effort to obtain information on an alleged link between Democrats 
and a prostitution ring run by a friend of Dean's future wife, 
Maureen. 
</P>
<P>
	The book says Dean planned the break-in to collect damaging  
information on the Democrats to heighten his own influence at the 
White House and then concocted the cover-up without consulting 
superiors. Dean's damaging testimony to congressional investigators 
further unraveled the Watergate affair, which forced President 
Nixon to resign in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled about the settlement and we feel we have ample  
evidence proving his story is false,'' said John Garrick, the 
Deans' attorney. ``The Deans have repeatedly refuted the claim that 
there was a call girl ring linked to the Democratic National 
Committee and that Mr. Dean's wife was friends with the madam of 
the call girl ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colodny, however, says Dean agreed to accept a settlement and  
sign an agreement not to sue the author again on the same grounds 
because he wanted to avoid a public courtroom drama. Colodny said 
he wanted the court to hear the case because he was confident that 
a public trial would validate his reporting.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Gains Against Yen Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the Japanese yen  
for a third straight day Wednesday, but fell sharply against the 
euro. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.98 yen,  
up from 106.10 yen on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0641, up from $1.0554 a day earlier.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has been rebounding against the yen following a  
weekend meeting by major industrial nations where officials issued 
a statement sharing Japan's concern over the yen's rapid advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen's sharp gains could derail Japan's recovery from a  
recession by making Japanese products more expensive overseas, 
cooling demand for that nation's exports. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.5036  
Swiss francs, down from 1.5175 on Tuesday; and 1.4641 Canadian 
dollars, up from 1.4613 the day before. The British pound fell to 
$1.6442, down from $1.6502. 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are  
no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8380 
German marks, down from 1.8534 on Tuesday; 6.1644 French francs, 
down from 6.2159; and 1,819.63 Italian lire, down from 1,834.63.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Firm Sued for Bid Rigging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit  
Wednesday against a Japanese electronics company accused of rigging 
bids on contracts for telecommunications systems at a U.S. military 
base in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit against Kyowa Exeo, the first to be filed under the  
Japanese Anti-Monopoly Act, accused the company of conspiring to 
fix bids on 25 contracts from 1981 to 1988 for work at the U.S. 
Pacific Contracting Office at Yokota Air Base, near Tokyo. The 
lawsuit seeks to recover damages worth about $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kyowa's liability for its participation in the bid-rigging  
conspiracy has been clearly established,'' David Ogden, the acting 
head of Justice's Civil Division, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was filed in the Tokyo High Court.

	HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE, N.M. (AP) -- Six German air force  
representatives have begun investigating the crash of two warplanes 
that apparently collided during a training mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The European-made Tornado planes went down during a training  
mission last Friday. They had taken off from a German flight 
training center at Holloman Air Force Base, about 100 miles 
northwest of the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigators visited the crash site Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The four German air force crew members -- an instructor and  
student pilot in each plane -- parachuted to safety onto a ranch 
near Carlsbad. Two returned to Holloman earlier this week after 
treatment in Carlsbad. The other two were discharged Tuesday after 
treatment in Alamogordo. 
</P>
<P>
	The German air force training center at Holloman has about 580  
military personnel and 25 Tornado planes.

<HEADLINE> Brockermeyer Back With the Bears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- For nine days, Blake Brockermeyer's  
head throbbed. 
</P>
<P>
	This was no ordinary headache. It wasn't even an ordinary  
migraine, if there is such a thing. This was a pounding headache so 
bad it hurt just to look at a light. A migraine so severe it put 
him in the hospital for three days and made him wonder if his 
football career was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty scared,'' the Bears offensive tackle said  
Wednesday after practicing for the first time since leaving 
Chicago's Sept. 19 game against the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just being in the hospital and not really knowing exactly  
what's causing all of this was kind of a concern for everyone,'' he 
added. ``Thank God, it went away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Brockermeyer's head began to hurt Sept. 16, he figured it  
was probably a migraine. He'd had one before -- although that one 
was much less severe -- so he wasn't overly concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	When it didn't go away, team doctors thought maybe it was a  
sinus infection. That didn't sound like a big deal, either, 
Brockermeyer thought, certainly not enough to keep him out of the 
Seattle game. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the game wore on, the pain got worse.  
</P>
<P>
	``Just a real painful, pressure-type, throbbing headache,'' he  
said. ``It was constant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors were at a loss to explain what was wrong. Brockermeyer  
was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and numerous tests 
were done. A life-threatening illness was ruled out, but doctors 
couldn't tell him what was causing the headaches. 
</P>
<P>
	They did tell him football wasn't to blame, Brockermeyer said.  
Playing might have aggravated the pain, but it probably didn't 
cause it. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, doctors decided it was nothing more than a severe  
migraine and put him on medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just kind of takes its course,'' he said. ``The medication  
that they can give you for migraines, you kind of have to catch it 
right when it happens. We were a little bit late on that. They gave 
me some medication for the pain, but that just masked the headache. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just kind of went away on its own. Hopefully, it's gone  
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it is, Brockermeyer will be more fortunate than Denver  
Broncos running back Terrell Davis, who takes daily medication to 
prevent the migraines he's suffered since he was a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis missed almost the entire second quarter of Super Bowl  
XXXII with a migraine. He went back into the game after taking some 
medicine, rushed for three touchdowns and was named the MVP in 
Denver's 31-24 victory over Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something more serious than it sounds,'' said Bears  
utility man Glyn Milburn, who played with Davis in Denver. ``It's 
not just a headache where you take some aspirin and a couple of 
hours later you're OK. They affect a lot of people and they can be 
debilitating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides missing practice last week, Brockermeyer had to cancel  
the kickoff for his Blake W. Brockermeyer Foundation, a charitable 
organization to benefit children in Chicago and Fort Worth, Texas. 
The pain went away last Friday, but he sat out Sunday's game at 
Oakland as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors can't tell Brockermeyer whether the headaches will come  
back, so he's trying to go back to his normal life -- football 
included. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it comes back, I'll be a little bit upset. But so far, so  
good,'' he said. ``I'm going to go out and play like I've always 
played. If it comes back and something happens, I'll just have to 
deal with it when it comes. 
</P>
<P>
	``But right now, I'm not anticipating that. I'm just going to go  
out there and do my thing and just let the Lord take care of what's 
going to happen.''

<HEADLINE> Museum Sues NYC Over Funding Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Brooklyn Museum of Art has taken New York  
City to court over an upcoming exhibit of controversial British 
art, catapulting a philosophical debate into the legal realm. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum trustees asked for a federal court order Tuesday  
protecting the institution from retaliation by the city over a show 
that includes a dung-decorated portrait of the Virgin Mary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are seeking a declaration from the court that no punishment  
may be inflicted by the city at all against the museum for the 
exercise of its First Amendment rights,'' said museum attorney 
Floyd Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has threatened to evict the museum from  
its city-owned home and to freeze at least $7 million in funding 
unless the museum backs down. Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota said that a 
$500,000 check due to the museum on Friday would not be issued. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit is scheduled to open Saturday. It includes works  
that Giuliani has called ``sick'' and ``disgusting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Holy Virgin Mary'' the work at the center of the dispute,  
was among a collection of Chris Ofili's work that won Britain's 
prestigious Turner Prize for contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
	Ofili, who is a Roman Catholic of Nigerian descent, remained in  
his London studio Tuesday and refused to comment. He told The New 
York Times that elephant dung is symbolic of the beauty of the 
natural surroundings he observed during a visit to Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Scott Wright, Ofili's London representative, called the  
mayor's intervention ``totalitarian and fascist, a reprisal of the 
Nazi regime's censorship of the contemporary art of its time which 
it labeled `degenerate art.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The museum's board voted Tuesday to post signs warning of the  
explicit nature of some of the works rather than require visitors 
under 17 be accompanied by an adult. Giuliani had said that 
condition violated the museum's lease with the city, which calls 
for open admission. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders of more than a dozen of the city's cultural  
institutions -- including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum 
of Modern Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum -- warned 
Giuliani in a letter that his actions set ``a dangerous 
precedent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freezing the Brooklyn Museum's funds ``would have a chilling  
effect on all cultural institutions' ability to exercise their 
professional judgment and take the risks inherent in 
experimentation,'' the letter said.

completion of their merger, the two banks announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The extended family benefit will give employees the option of  
including a parent or other dependent relative on their insurance 
plan, as well as an unmarried domestic partner of the same or 
opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy has been in effect at BankBoston since July 1998, and  
it will be extended to all eligible employees of the combined bank 
beginning in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Other elements of the benefits package include $5,000 in  
assistance to parents hoping to adopt children, and two paid days 
off each year for employees to participate in community volunteer 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks' merger would create the nation's eighth-largest bank.  
It awaits approval from state regulators.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Tackle Ball Back With Vikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- The Minnesota Vikings are starting to  
look like the team they were a year ago, at least on the defensive 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Run-stuffing veteran nose tackle Jerry Ball, who signed with  
Cleveland as a free agent in the offseason after spending two years 
in Minnesota, returned to the Vikings on Wednesday in a trade with 
the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dwight asked me what I thought,'' Ball said, referring to  
Dwight Clark, Cleveland's director of football operations. ``I'm 
like, `Shoot, do it. Give me an opportunity to go on and finish up 
on a better note.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns received third-year defensive end Stalin Colinet and  
a seventh-round pick in next year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings assumed Ball's two-year, $2.6 million contract.  
</P>
<P>
	``It just gives us more depth,'' coach Dennis Green said.  
``Jerry was one of our top players last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The return of the 300-pound Ball, along with that of 37-year-old  
end Chris Doleman a week earlier, gives the struggling Vikings a 
versatile and veteran defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the biggest thing is we went from being a young  
defensive line that was trying to learn its way to being an 
experienced group now,'' defensive line coach Andre Patterson said. 
``When you can add Chris Doleman with all his years of experience 
and now Jerry Ball, already in there with Joe Phillips and John 
Randle, you know, that's a bunch of guys who have been through a 
whole lot of games in the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ball, 34, a 13-year veteran and three time Pro-Bowler, had 15  
tackles for losses last season, tied with teammate Ed McDaniel for 
the league lead. He started 25 consecutive games at nose tackle for 
the Vikings in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the fun-loving Ball had become more evasive  
with reporters in Cleveland and had begun to regret leaving 
Minnesota after seeing the expansion Browns were planning to use 
younger players to build for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough and I can tell you that I regretted it and I felt  
that it was a mistake,'' Ball said. ``But in this business you have 
to go ahead and make decisions based on the circumstances at the 
time. And at that point, there wasn't any money under the salary 
cap here. So, that pretty much put me on the outs. I had to take 
the deal that was available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's back in his element.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just hitting the recall button,'' Ball said. ``I think  
the first thing I have to do right now is get out there and get a 
good thud and let guys know that I'm still Jerry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Tampa Bay Buccaneers coming to town Sunday with their  
rushing punch of Mike Alstott and Warrick Dunn, the timing of 
Ball's return was impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs handed the Vikings their only regular season loss last  
year by rushing the ball effectively and keeping Minnesota's 
high-octane offense on the sideline in a 27-24 thriller at Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he's looking forward to having another crack at them,''  
Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The additions of Doleman and Ball, along with recent  
reacquisitions of veterans Corey Miller and Mike Morris, show the 
Vikings mean business, cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just know that the time is now to get things done,''  
Hitchcock said. ``It's not like we're trying to do this tomorrow. 
It's right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ball started his career with Detroit, then played for the old  
Browns in 1993 before moving to the Raiders and then Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball appeared to have lost about 20 pounds since leaving the  
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in real good shape. He's smaller than he was a year ago  
at this time,'' Patterson said. ``So, obviously they conditioned 
him pretty well over there in Cleveland. But I mean, hey, he's 
Jerry. First day back he's making smart comments to guys and 
practiced hard and held down the middle well. We're just excited to 
have him back.''

<HEADLINE>  Texas Tech's Williams Out for Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Ricky Williams, the key to the Texas Tech  
offense, aggravated a knee sprain during practice and is out for 
the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech doctors said Wednesday that surgery would be scheduled  
later this week. Team personnel wouldn't say whether the sprain of 
his left knee will end his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gut wrenching, no doubt,'' coach Spike Dykes said. ``The  
worst thing about athletics is injuries, because these kids put 
their whole life into it, and it can be taken away in an instant. 
It breaks my heart to see something like that happen to good 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' absence leaves the Red Raiders, already floundering  
after last weekend's 21-14 loss to North Texas, in disarray. It 
also dims Williams' chances of breaking the NCAA Division I-A 
rushing record set by Texas' Ricky Williams last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had played every game at Tech (1-2) the past two  
seasons, rushing for 1,582 yards and 13 touchdowns last year. The 
school had set up a Web site to chart his progress this season 
called ``Heisman Chase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't have more hope or optimism about a player and his  
potential,'' Dykes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had missed the team's last two games after injuring the  
knee in the opener against Arizona State, and Dykes had listed the 
running back as a ``maybe'' for Saturday's game against No. 5 Texas 
A&AMP;M. During practice Tuesday, Williams aggravated the injury while 
running in a no-contact exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just faltered and went down,'' said tight end Kyle Allamon,  
who saw a tape of the practice. ``There wasn't any hit or contact. 
... He just put too much pressure on the knee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just going to have play harder,'' offensive lineman  
Curtis Lowery said. ``We can't get too upset about losing one 
person. He isn't the whole team, he's just a good part of it. If we 
just go out there and give up, then we might as well not go out 
there at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to put Williams back on the field seems to have  
been prompted by Williams' own competitive spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	James Easterling, one of Williams' backups, said that Williams  
was itching to get on the field for the last several days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ricky Williams is not a quitter,'' Easterling said. ``He  
wanted to get back out there as soon as possible and the coaches 
liked that. But sometimes you just have to sit out until you're 
completely 100 percent well. With a knee injury, you can't try to 
come back too soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players didn't want to criticize coaches or players for putting  
the running back on the field during practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ricky knows Ricky,'' Allamon said. ``He knows his limits and  
knows what he can do. It was mainly his decision, and you can't 
really second guess yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Tech will have to replace a crucial part of its offense,  
which was built almost entirely around Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably going to be like we've done it in the past,''  
running back coach Jack Tayrien said. ``We'll play it by committee 
and go with the hot hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee will consist of Shaud Williams, a freshman who has  
posted 210 yards since Williams' injury, and Easterling, who has 
198 yards rushing. Also helping will be Ricky Hunter, who has 71 
yards rushing this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech's prospects for this weekend don't look good.  
</P>
<P>
	Texas A&AMP;M has the nation's top-ranked defense and has allowed  
just 68 yards and one touchdown against Louisiana Tech, Tulsa and 
Southern Mississippi. Tech must also contend with No. 15 Texas and 
No. 23 Oklahoma this season.

<HEADLINE> Education Goals Not Being Met </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An ambitious education plan set a decade ago  
by government and business leaders has failed to meet its goals of 
raising youngsters' skill levels and producing world-class students 
in math and science, says a key figure in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	That deflating message is what executives and governors are  
likely to hear at an education summit Thursday in Palisades, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that has been troublesome for all of the  
governors, Republican as well as Democrat, as well as to the nation 
at large,'' said Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, who 
with IBM chairman Louis Gerstner Jr. is heading the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson remembers the excitement in 1989, when President Bush  
met with governors and business leaders and set six broad education 
goals for 2000 -- from ensuring children are properly immunized and 
eating the right foods so they are ready to learn, to raising the 
high school graduation rate to at least 90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the goals were vague. Governors thought otherwise  
and adopted them. 
</P>
<P>
	The third education summit this week will assess progress on  
those goals -- included some added since President Clinton took 
office, Thompson said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush launched the education reform package, Clinton, who  
headed the governor's association at the time, has popularized the 
goals with more than $1.7 billion in grants to help states set 
standards and find ways to chart progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed the Goals 2000: Educate America Act in 1994,  
writing the original education goals into law and adding new ones 
on teacher quality and parent involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	In Georgia, Goals 2000 support for school reform has been  
described as a ``turning point.'' Democratic Gov. Thomas Carper of 
Delaware has said improved test scores in his state show ``we're on 
the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina and Texas have been recognized for creating  
national models for boosting student achievement. West Virginia was 
praised for reaching one national goal by increasing the high 
school graduation rate for people ages 18 to 24 from 83 percent in 
1990 to 90 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard Riley said recently, ``We've  
eliminated the tyranny of low expectations for children by placing 
high standards for academic achievement at the heart of education 
reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, American students have not caught up to high-performing  
children in other countries, according to the National Education 
Goals Panel, a committee of governors, legislators and federal 
officials that measures the goals' progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Only in fourth-grade science did the United States lead the  
world, according to the Third International Mathematics and Science 
Study. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Jeffords, chairman of the Senate Health, Education,  
Labor and Pensions Committee, suggests educators replicate programs 
that work and discard failing ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was always the perception that we were the biggest, the  
strongest, therefore the best,'' said Jeffords, R-Vt. ``But that's 
not necessarily true. We have to make tough decisions and 
substantial changes if we are to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some contend the goals have led to successes.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, just 14 states had set standards for learning --  
essential information students should know in certain subjects by a 
particular grade. Today, 49 states have such standards. 
</P>
<P>
	State spending for education is up and more states issue public  
report cards on schools, require tests for students' to graduate or 
move on to the next grade, punish low-performing schools and reward 
those who do well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learn with and from each other,'' said Thompson. ``That's  
one of the main reasons to have these summits.''

<HEADLINE> Dudley Moore Has Brain Disorder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- Dudley Moore is beginning to have  
vision problems as an incurable degenerative brain disorder he has 
had for several years progresses, his doctors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, 64, was diagnosed several months ago with progressive  
supranuclear palsy, a rare disorder related to Parkinson's disease, 
said Dr. Thomas Galski, who has been working with Moore at the 
Kessler Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in the very early stages of this disease, but vision  
problems have started to creep in,'' Galski said. He said Moore was 
undergoing physical and speech therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, known for the 1981 movie ``Arthur,'' said in a statement  
Wednesday: ``I understand that one person in 100,000 suffers from 
this disease, and I am also aware that there are 100,000 of my 
union, the Screen Actors Guild, who are working every day. I think, 
therefore, it is in some way considerate of me that I have taken on 
this disease for myself, thus protecting the remaining 99,999 SAG 
members from this fate.''

<HEADLINE> Kobe Steel To Build in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Kobe Steel Ltd., a major Japanese steel and  
aluminum maker, said today it will build two chemical plants in 
Saudi Arabia worth a combined $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Kobe Steel's first project in Saudi Arabia, said  
company spokesman Gary Tsuchida. 
</P>
<P>
	The final contract on the project will be concluded with Saudi  
Arabia's Arabian Industrial Development Co., or NAMA, next month, 
Tsuchida said. 
</P>
<P>
	The facilities -- one with an annual production capacity of  
70,000 metric tons of chlor-alkali and the other with a capacity of 
30,000 metric tons of epichlorohydrin per year -- will be built in 
the Al-Jubail Industrial City on the Persian Gulf about 60 miles 
northwest of Dhahran. 
</P>
<P>
	Chlor-alkali is used to make caustic soda, used in synthetic  
fibers, perfumes, pharmaceuticals, soap, paper and pulp. 
Epichlorohydrin is used in making epoxy resin which is used in 
paints, adhesives and protective covering materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction of the two plants will be completed by January  
2002, Tsuchida said. NAMA will sell both caustic soda and epoxy 
resin in Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> Facts on Bell's Long-Distance Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Facts about Bell Atlantic's application to offer long-distance  
phone service in New York: 
</P>
<P>
	--Bell Atlantic wants to offer long-distance service to more than  
8 million homes and businesses in New York, which has an $8 
billion-a-year long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
	--More than 400 companies are authorized to provide long-distance  
telephone service in New York, but the market is dominated by AT&AMP;T, 
Sprint and MCI. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bell Atlantic says competitors are providing 1 million local  
phone lines in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Federal Communications Commission has three months to  
decide on the application. If approved, Bell Atlantic could get 
into the long-distance market at any time after that. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bell Atlantic has a total of more than 43 million telephone  
lines in its local service region that covers 13 states and the 
District of Columbia, and it hopes eventually to offer 
long-distance in the other parts of its local service area. It also 
has nearly 10 million wireless customers.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Joins With 35 Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. has enlisted more than 35  
technology and media companies in its latest effort to entice 
people to use its software for watching videos and listening to 
music over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepping up its attack against rival RealNetworks Inc.,  
Microsoft said Wednesday the companies had agreed to work together 
to try to improve the quality of video and sound transmitted to 
people with high-speed connections to the Internet, such as through 
cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said companies in its coalition plan to use its  
``streaming'' software, which allows continuous sound and video, 
such as movies or high-fidelity music, to be sent and received over 
the World Wide Web. Microsoft gives away the software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said that companies in its ``Windows Media Broadband  
Jumpstart'' initiative won't be restricted to using its software, 
but that its software was ``optimized'' for high-speed networking. 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, partners in the effort such as cable TV  
companies will cooperate by optimizing their networks to accept 
richer video and audio. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the underpinning technology that enables this to  
happen,'' said Kevin Unangst, Microsoft's lead product manager in 
its streaming media division. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership is the latest bid by Microsoft to capture part  
of the customer base that uses ``streaming'' software made by 
RealNetworks, which pioneered the market and is still the dominant 
player. RealNetworks is based in Seattle, near Microsoft's base in 
Redmond, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	High-speed access to the Internet is the next battleground for  
such technology, many analysts believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Streaming media works best across high-speed networks, but the  
vast majority of Web users still gain access to the Internet 
through slower dial-up modems. This has slowed acceptance of 
streaming media. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Microsoft can gain an edge over RealNetworks,  
analysts say -- by urging industry players to step up efforts to 
build high-speed networks and technology that takes advantage of 
them.	   ''RealNetworks is at this point the industry standard,'' said 
Charles King, an industry analyst with Zona Research Inc., based in 
Redwood City, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Microsoft at the same time is extremely good at pulling  
coalitions of people to work with, and holding those coalitions 
together,'' he added. ``They are coming into this a bit late, but 
they are coming in with a big bang.'' 
</P>
<P>
	RealNetworks said through a spokesman that it was well ahead of  
Microsoft in delivering streaming media that works best with 
high-speed Internet access, and did not view the new Microsoft 
initiative as a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty far ahead on that realm,'' said RealNetworks  
spokesman Jay Wampold. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies in the Microsoft collaboration include high-speed  
cable TV companies, such as RoadRunner, which services cable TV 
giants Time Warner and MediaOne; content providers, such as 
Virginmega.com and Digitial Entertainment Network Inc.; and network 
companies, such as Akamai Technologies Inc. and Sandpiper Networks.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Moves To Help Poor Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton told a gathering of finance  
ministers and central bankers today the United States will take a 
major step to help wipe out the debt owed by some of the world's 
poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply put, unsustainable debt is helping to keep too many  
poor countries and poor people in poverty,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am directing my administration to make it possible to  
forgive 100 percent of the debt these countries owe to the United 
States, when needed to help them finance basic needs and when the 
money will be used to do so,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke at a Washington hotel before the annual  
meeting of the heads of the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted the international organizations are meeting at a  
dramatically different time than last year, when Asia's economy was 
plunging and fears of a global crisis were spreading. Clinton said 
it was perhaps the most severe crisis since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, the president said, ``Economies that were sliding are  
rising again.'' Still, he said, countries that were hit by the 
crisis were hit very hard and ``many are still reeling.'' He said 
it was ``certainly not a time for complacency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He lamented that 1.3 billion people survive on less than $1 a  
day and that nearly 40 million people die of hunger each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we will start the new millennium with a new resolve, to  
give every person in the world, through trade and technology, 
through investments in education and health care, the chance to be 
part of a widely shared prosperity in which all the people's 
potential can be developed more fully,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was a challenge for the IMF and World Bank. ``And for  
me, it is a personal priority of the highest order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said poor nations need not always be impoverished.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we can in good conscience say we support the  
idea that they should choose between making interest payments on 
their debt and investing in their children's education,'' the 
president said. ``It is an economic and moral imperative that we 
use this moment of global consensus to do better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want this to wind up being like our dues to the United  
Nations, Clinton said. ``Now that we have advocated this and gotten 
everyone else to agree to it, we have to pay our fare share, so I 
hope all of you will help us pass the legislation through Congress 
to do just that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations says the United States owes $1.6 billion in  
back dues and legislation in the Republican-controlled Congress to 
pay the arrears is stalled again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton played a major role in urging partners from the wealthy  
industrialized nations to provide quicker, faster and deeper debt 
relief to poor countries at the Cologne summit in June. 
</P>
<P>
	British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, the head of  
the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee, told the IMF-World Bank 
meeting the debt relief initiative ``signaled a worldwide alliance 
against poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that in the wake of allegations about alleged  
misuse of IMF funds by Russia the organization must ``review its 
procedures and controls to strengthen the safeguards'' on use of 
its money. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has warned no more of its money would be disbursed to  
Russia until the government and the central bank prove they were 
serious about battling corruption and publish quarterly central 
bank audits. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has denied any IMF funds were used illegally and  
complained the industrialized nations were treating it unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the controversy, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus  
said the international community should not stop working with 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be the height of irresponsibility to turn our back on  
this great nation,'' Camdessus said. He said the economic program 
that Russia and the IMF agreed on was on track and real progress 
had been made in the past seven years in helping the government 
develop a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Camdessus and James Wolfensohn, president of the World  
Bank, urged the international community to do more to fight global 
poverty.

phone pioneer Craig McCaw, revealed earlier this week that it is 
looking for ways to enter the satellite communications market 
before its broadband system is introduced in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market conditions that exist today ... have created a time  
where it's prudent for us to explore some opportunities that exist 
out there,'' Teledesic spokesman Roger Nyhus said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While there was no specific mention of Iridium, industry  
analysts say Teledesic co-founder Craig McCaw might take advantage 
of Iridium's dire straits. 
</P>
<P>
	``McCaw is an opportunist,'' said Bob Egan, director of mobile  
and wireless research for the Gartner Group. ``Iridium is saddled 
with debt. Given that Craig is an entrepreneur and could begin to 
generate some revenue and brand awareness ... it might be seen as 
an opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also noted that Motorola, Iridium's lead investor with  
a 19 percent stake, is also the prime contractor for the Teledesic 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	If McCaw steps in to help Iridium, it could strengthen  
Teledesic's relationship with Motorola and provide some operational 
experience in the satellite business, Egan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teledesic's has raised more than $1.5 billion for its satellite  
system. Other large investors include Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin 
Talal and Boeing Co.

<HEADLINE> Encephalitis May Spread Via Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The investigation into a rare strain of  
encephalitis that has killed four people in New York is growing, 
with experts testing dead birds along the East Coast to find out 
whether the virus has spread. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's possible that it could be seen in other parts of the  
country,'' said Dr. Ned Hayes, an epidemiologist for the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	The mosquito-borne West Nile virus, never before recorded in the  
Western Hemisphere, probably entered the United States in infected 
birds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With winter approaching, the birds may be migrating to other  
parts of the country from New York, where 37 people have tested 
positive for the virus, health officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of their ailments was reclassified Tuesday by the CDC,  
which originally blamed the similar St. Louis strain. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the virus has not appeared in any of the dead birds --  
mostly crows -- being tested in areas from Maryland to Florida, said 
Roger Nasci, a CDC entomologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crows die every day, but there are many, many causes, from  
diseases to shotguns,'' Nasci said. ``This is a developing 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of the virus -- fever and headache -- are similar to  
those of the St. Louis strain but are generally milder. In rare 
cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders and death. The 
elderly, young and those with weakened immune systems are most 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City, New Jersey and Connecticut have been spraying  
pesticides to kill mosquitoes. The virus is transmitted to humans 
by mosquitoes that have bitten the infected birds. It is not 
transmitted from person to person or from birds to people. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Health Commissioner Dr. Antonia Novello said 520 dead  
birds have turned up from Connecticut to Suffolk County on Long 
Island. In Suffolk County, officials also are investigating the 
deaths of several horses. 
</P>
<P>
	One dead bird in Westport, Conn., and another in Scarsdale in  
New York's Westchester County have tested positive for the West 
Nile virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 37 confirmed human cases in New York, 25 were in New York  
City, eight were in Westchester County north of the city and four 
were in Nassau County. A total of 162 cases are under investigation 
in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	In Connecticut, the virus has been found in mosquitoes and a  
dead bird but not in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last month, some dead crows were spotted near the Bronx  
Zoo. Subsequently, 20 zoo birds died -- including an American bald 
eagle, an owl and five Chilean flamingos -- and tested positive for 
the African strain, said zoo spokeswoman Linda Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
	No African bird has been imported by the zoo in six months, and  
any before that had passed standard federal quarantine checks, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know which birds were infected first, and probably  
we'll never know the answer to that question,'' CDC spokesman Tom 
Skinner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists also were testing ticks, which cannot be killed by  
aerial insecticide spraying like mosquitoes can, to see if they 
might spread the West Nile virus, the Daily News reported. The 
scientists fear that the ticks and mosquitoes, which hibernate for 
winter, could return in the spring and spread the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticks have been found infected with West Nile in other  
countries, said CDC Dr. Duane Gubler.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Sprewell Explains Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell says his bad judgment  
was to blame for a car crash last year in which two people were 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Knicks guard is being sued by Arnulfo Perlas, 55,  
and Irma Feliciano, 54, who were treated and released for minor 
injuries after the crash. Both have testified they have problems 
with nightmares and depression caused by the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell told a jury in Contra Costa Superior Court Wednesday  
that he used bad judgment when he lost control of his Mercedes 
Benz. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it was the wrong thing to do,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell admitted in court that he caused the accident when he  
tried to get back on the freeway from an exit-only lane near Walnut 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he made a mistake, Sprewell answered, ``Without a  
doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The civil suit went before a jury this week after repeated  
attempts to reach a settlement were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell pleaded no contest to reckless driving in connection  
with the crash and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, which he 
served under electronic home detention at his Milwaukee home.

<HEADLINE> Senate Keen on Espionage, Not Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate GOP investigators say that, despite the  
renewed furor over the government's role in the 1993 Waco tragedy, 
they're now more interested in whether the FBI bungled its 
investigation of alleged Chinese espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing we can do about Waco except correct procedures  
for the future,'' Sen. Arlen Specter, who will chair a task force 
into the agency's investigations on high-profile cases, said in an 
interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Espionage, I think, is the number one priority for the task  
force,'' he added. ``That's an issue of America at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Waco's history regardless of what we find out,'' agreed Sen.  
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who will join Specter on the task force. 
``In the case of the Chinese espionage and campaign contributions, 
there are still things you can do about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior  
Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said several committees 
in Congress already were looking into how the government has 
investigated Chinese spying. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sounds like yet another endless investigation, with  
open-ended targets that are shifting by the week,'' said David 
Carle, Leahy's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments by Specter and Grassley marked a retreat for Senate  
Republicans, who thundered that revelations last month about the 
government's use of force while ending the standoff with the 
Davidian cult demanded new investigations into the Justice 
Department. GOP lawmakers issued subpoenas and demanded Attorney 
General Janet Reno's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	To address the renewed outcry over Waco, Senate Republicans  
chose Specter to lead a task force probe. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pennsylvania Republican is making clear early on that  
he's more interested in using the panel's resources to examine 
another controversy -- the FBI's investigation into how U.S. nuclear 
secrets may have been leaked to China. Specter also plans to look 
into how prosecutors' handled political fund-raising abuses, mainly 
Democratic, in the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	The public furor over the 1993 siege near Waco, Texas was  
reignited this summer when the FBI belatedly admitted firing 
potentially incendiary tear gas canisters near the Branch Davidian 
compound on the day the siege ended in a spectacular fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and Justice Department had denied for years the use of  
such canisters. Despite the admission, the agencies say the 
Davidians, and not federal agents, started the fire in which some 
80 sect members died. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans demanded to know whether the disclosure was part of  
a cover-up that cast doubt on who started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno was forced to appoint former Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., to  
open an independent investigation. House Government Reform 
Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., fired off a round of 
subpoenas, and Specter sent his investigators to Texas to preserve 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., urged Reno to  
resign, and added that the revelations gave him reason to doubt the 
conclusion that the Davidians started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Specter nor Burton would comment on whether they have  
discovered evidence that would pin the blame for the fire somewhere 
other than on the Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, the two agreed, is the government's expanded  
probe into the alleged Chinese theft of secrets concerning a 
sophisticated nuclear warhead. The FBI had focused for nearly four 
years on Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at the Los Alamos laboratory in 
New Mexico who was fired in March for violating security rules. Lee 
has not been charged with any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a life or death matter,'' Specter said. ``The Judiciary  
Committee should have been doing oversight on that for a long 
time.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Approves Metal Bat Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The speed of a baseball hit with a metal bat  
would not be greater than one hit with wood under new standards 
adopted Tuesday by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	The association's executive committee affirmed a recommendation  
made last month by a research panel to limit the exit speed of 
metal bats to 97 mph in games involving NCAA schools for at least 
three years, starting in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``The moratorium will give the baseball community time to adjust  
to the new standards and for the panel to do further research,'' 
said Charles Wethington, University of Kentucky president and NCAA 
executive committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, we reserve the right to make adjustments in the  
standards for bats and balls at any time if necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to make metal bats perform more like wood, the panel  
recommended a batted-ball exit speed be adopted for non-wood bats 
equivalent to the highest average speed using major league-quality 
34-inch solid wood bats, which is less than 97 mph. The executive 
committee received the report in August but delayed implementing 
the panel's recommendations pending further tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Many college teams last season went to smaller aluminum bats,  
one of the recommendations by the panel, to increase safety and to 
reverse a trend of higher scoring than with wood bats, which broke 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
	Early metal bats were heavy and only the strongest players could  
generate much speed in their swing. But in recent years, 
manufacturers have refined their products to make them lighter and 
capable of producing power from a larger area of the bat. A 
well-hit ball off an aluminum bat can reach speeds of more than 100 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A record 62 home runs were hit in last year's College World  
Series and the tournament ended with Southern Cal's 21-14 victory 
over Arizona State. In this year's 14-game College World Series, 
with the smaller bats in use, there were only 35 homers, and the 
164 total runs were the fewest since 1994. In the title game, Miami 
beat Florida State 6-5, with each team hitting just one home run. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related matter, Easton Sports, Inc., announced it has  
settled its lawsuit against the NCAA connected to the 
organization's August 1998 ruling restricting the use of aluminum 
bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that a number of our bats have already been tested  
and meet the new standard confirms that aluminum bats can be very 
safely used in NCAA and all other levels of play,'' Jim Easton, 
chairman of Easton Sports, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement agreement, no financial figures were  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA also approved specifications recommended last year by  
the association's Baseball Rules Committee, including the reduction 
in maximum diameter from 2 3/4 inches to 2 5/8 inches and in the 
difference between the length of a bat and its weight from five 
units to three units. That is, a 34-inch bat could weigh no less 
than 31 ounces, not including the grip.

<HEADLINE> Love, Leonard at Buick Challenge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE MOUNTAIN, N.C. (AP) -- With the cheers of a Ryder Cup  
victory still ringing in his ears, Davis Love III arrived Wednesday 
for the Buick Challenge and figured it was time to get down to 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, his two children are starting to ask questions about  
that annual trip to Hawaii for the winners-only Mercedes 
Championship at the start of the season. Right now, all Love can do 
is shrug his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't won yet,'' he said. ``I'm not in Kapalua, and my  
kids are starting to put pressure on me. I want to get back to my 
goals for the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After an incredible comeback in the Ryder Cup, which Love  
described as 12 players with a single purpose, the rest of the year 
is for individual goals. Love already has won more than $1.7 
million, the most he has ever earned in 14 seasons on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	He just hasn't won.  
</P>
<P>
	This wouldn't be a bad place for him to start. Love has 10  
consecutive rounds under par on the Mountain View course at 
Callaway Gardens, and he returned from the Ryder Cup in Spain two 
years ago and won the Buick Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Better yet is his back.  
</P>
<P>
	Love missed three weeks with a pinched nerve in his neck that  
caused his fingers to go numb and didn't play 18 holes until a week 
ago Tuesday at The Country Club. But his play in the Ryder Cup 
didn't suffer -- Love was unbeaten (1-0-3), a nice turnaround from 
his 0-4 performance two years earlier at Valderrama. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of confidence in my game,'' he said. ``I felt  
like my putting would turn around and it did. I want to play well 
after last week, so my expectations are high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other three Ryder Cup players in the field for the Buick  
Challenge are Jeff Maggert, Steve Pate and Justin Leonard, who 
still hasn't fully grasped how he made that 45-foot birdie putt on 
the 17th hole that ultimately returned the Ryder Cup to American 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an emotional week,'' Leonard said.  
</P>
<P>
	Also in the field is John Daly, playing for the first time since  
Callaway Golf dumped him because Daly ended 26 months of sobriety 
and refused to go back to rehab. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending champion is Steve Elkington, who has as much to  
gain as anyone over the next four weeks. While the sweet-swinging 
Australian won earlier this year at Doral, he has slipped to No. 31 
on the money list and needs to pick it up if he wants to make the 
season-ending Tour Championship, which offers a $5 million purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Elkington, like Love, has a strong affinity for the Mountain  
View course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that easy to get here, but once you do, it's well  
worth it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buick Challenge has been feast or famine for Elkington. He  
won last year, beating Fred Funk on the first hole of a playoff, 
and he also won by five strokes in 1994 when the event was cut to 
54 holes because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	But he missed the cut in four of the other five times he has  
played the Buick. This wouldn't be a good year for that to happen. 
The Tour Championship is being played at Champions Golf Club in 
Houston, which is Elkington's home course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played terrible three years ago and finished 10th,'' he  
said. ``It's a big advantage if I get into the field.''

<HEADLINE>  McGwire Leads Home Run Race With 63 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire regained the major league home run  
lead for the first time since Aug. 18, hitting Nos. 62 and 63 
Wednesday night in a doubleheader against the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit a homer in each game to move one ahead of Chicago's  
Sammy Sosa. McGwire last led Sosa 48-47. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has 520 career homers, leaving him one behind Ted  
Williams and Willie McCovey for 10th place on the all-time list. He 
also leads the NL with 145 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire tied Sosa for the major league lead in the fourth inning  
of the opener with a two-run homer to center that traveled an 
estimated 462 feet. He sent a 1-0 pitch from Matt Clement well over 
the wall as the ball cleared an area of shrubbery just beneath the 
backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
	Center fielder Ruben Rivera threw it back over the wall, leading  
to a scramble for the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit a three-run homer off Andy Ashby, who surrendered  
Nos. 500 and 501 on Aug. 5 in St. Louis, in the sixth inning of the 
second game. The 467-foot shot also easily cleared the center-field 
wall and landed beyond the shrubbery. It bounced back onto the 
field and center fielder Mike Darr tossed it back in the stands.

<HEADLINE> Ugly Oranges Said Taste Good / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) -- Mysterious markings have shown up on  
some Rio Grande Valley oranges, making them less attractive. But 
those in the citrus industry say fruit with damaged peels tastes 
just as good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone remarked that it's such a pity that we are judged by  
the part of the fruit that they always throw away,'' said Rio Hondo 
gift basket shipper Violet Lang, who has not been affected by the 
recent batch of flawed fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	The harvest of early oranges in the Rio Grande Valley is under  
way and some of the N-33 Navel, Marrs and Everhard oranges have 
turned up with strange blemishes. The permanent spots, which cover 
up to 30 oil glands on the orange peel, are about half a centimeter 
large and are yellow to orange in color. The fruit is picked green, 
but the spots remain lighter as the oranges ripen. 
</P>
<P>
	Citrus Center entomologist Victor French estimates that less  
than 1 percent of Valley orchards have been affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not all orchards have it, by any means,'' French said. ``It's  
not prevalent at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although some of the markings have been blamed on herbicide  
damage, scientists at the Texas A&AMP;M-Kingsville Citrus Center in 
Weslaco are continuing to conduct tests on other possible causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the suspects are weather and pests.  
</P>
<P>
	The dry spells in the Valley that have been broken by heavy  
downpours could be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Another potential culprit is the leaf-footed bug, which gets  
into fruit and causes raised mounds of gum just under the surface. 
French is exposing clean fruit to leaf-footed bugs to see if he can 
duplicate the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Green stink bugs or a creature known as the false spider mite  
also might be responsible. French said false spider mites have 
usually affected Valley grapefruit in the past, and that the pests 
currently are damaging oranges in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that the cause is a mystery is not unusual.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some years there are pests we don't see and then the following  
year they're very prevalent,'' he said, adding that he expected the 
Valley's citrus crop this year to be a good one overall. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, the mystery spots have not affected the taste,  
French said. Still, growers selling the fruit on the fresh fruit 
market need oranges that appeal to the eye as well as taste buds. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lang, who had not seen or heard of the recent batch of  
damaged citrus, said the fruit she and her husband ship in 2,000 
gift baskets a year must be attractive. Damaged ``number two'' 
fruit is sold for lower prices to roadside peddlers or others. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Thompson, president of Thompson Grove Care in Weslaco,  
owns about 100 acres of citrus and looks after an additional 700 or 
800 acres for other growers. He said clean, undamaged fruit can go 
for $120 to $150 a ton in the fresh fruit market while peel-damaged 
fruit might bring only $50 a ton at a juice plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The eye appeal is what everybody buys by, which is really  
sad,'' Thompson said. ``We cull out a lot fruit that is just as 
good to eat as the other.''

$197.8 million stock deal that one analyst says ``sets up La-Z-Boy 
as an industry behemoth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal unveiled Tuesday, La-Z-Boy also will assume  
Ladd's debt of $101.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ladd, based in Greensboro, N.C.,is among North America's largest  
residential furniture makers and one of the world's leading 
suppliers to hotel and motel, assisted living and government 
markets. It markets a broad range of bedroom, dining room, and 
upholstered furniture under several brand names including American 
Drew, Barclay and Clayton Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
	La-Z-Boy is the largest U.S. maker of upholstered furniture and  
a leading manufacturer worldwide of recliners.The company, based in 
Monroe, Mich.,had sales of $1.29 billion in the fiscal 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Ladd, based in Greensboro, N.C.,had 1998 sales of $571.1  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal ``sets up La-Z-Boy as an industry behemoth'' and should  
help the company ``leverage capacity, brands and styles to be of 
greater service to retailers, and ultimately to consumers, said 
analyst Saul Cutler of BDO Seidman 
</P>
<P>
	The deal calls for the exchange of each Ladd share for 1.18  
shares of La-Z-Boy and represents a price of $24.34 per Ladd share, 
based on La-Z-Boy's closing stock price yesterday of $20.63. 
</P>
<P>
	La-Z-Boy said it expects to take a still-undetermined  
transaction-related charge in the quarter in which the deal is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction -- requiring approval by regulators and Ladd  
shareholders -- should be completed by early 2000.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Would Curb Bounty Hunters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinelle Moore says she quickly opened her  
front door when five armed men knocked on it before sunrise one 
morning because they claimed to be police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Once they got inside, they didn't act like officers.  
</P>
<P>
	Moore, a single mother in Laurel, Md., said they turned out to  
be bounty hunters -- non-government individuals who hunt down bail 
jumpers for pay, but need not heed the same laws police must 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore told a news conference Tuesday that she told them she knew  
nothing about the man they were seeking that morning in July 1998, 
but they beat her, breaking her nose, covered her with pepper spray 
and pulled a gun on her 5-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bounty hunters held us in the house against our will,''  
she said. ``They made us sit on the bed and answer questions while 
they ransacked our house and went through our drawers, our phone 
books and kept us from answering the phone,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore asked Congress to pass a bill introduced Tuesday by Rep.  
Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., that would put new restrictions on bounty 
hunters and the bail bondsmen who hire them. 
</P>
<P>
	Most bounty hunters, who are enlisted to track down people who  
have failed to show up for trial or other court appearances as 
promised, are trained and responsible professionals, Hutchinson 
said. But some are rogues ``who've seen one too many `Dirty Harry' 
movies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tragic results are obvious in the countless cases of  
innocent citizens who are shot, beaten and terrorized,'' Hutchinson 
told reporters. ``Unbelievably, these innocent victims have little 
recourse after suffering such abuse'' since outdated laws enacted 
during the ``Wild West'' period give bounty hunters more power and 
authority than police officers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson said the bill would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Make bounty hunters and the bail bondsmen who hire them liable  
for civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require bounty hunters who cross state lines to report their  
intentions to local law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require the attorney general to develop model guidelines that  
state legislatures can consider enacting to regulate bounty 
hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people are harmed by bounty hunters, the victims ... have  
little recourse at all,'' said Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., who 
supports the bill. ``It is frightening to me that individuals can 
be given the power that exceeds the power of law enforcement 
personnel.''

<HEADLINE>  Beatty to Give Long-Awaited Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Warren Beatty, toying with a  
presidential run, got a chance Wednesday to outline his views of 
Democratic Party issues before an international audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty has said little since disclosing seven weeks ago that he  
is flirting with the idea. He wrote an opinion column lamenting the 
state of the major political parties last month, and granted a 
couple of interviews to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	His silence has only heightened interest in the speech Wednesday  
night to the Southern California Americans for Democratic Action, 
which was presenting him with an award. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists with news outlets based in Germany, Japan, France,  
Spain, Italy, Great Britain and Canada, as well as national 
reporters based in New York and Washington, D.C., flocked to the 
Beverly Hilton, as did a battery of liberal politicians and 
Hollywood stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all Warren Beatty is a movie star, as big as exists  
on the planet, and there is a celebrity frenzy all over the world 
now,'' said Lila Garrett, president of ADA, which views itself as 
guardian of the Democratic Party's ``progressive'' wing.

out, and the air in that shut room of conservative Democrats become 
stale,'' Garrett said. ``Warren Beatty has opened that door 
slightly and the rancid air is moving out and the fresh air is 
moving in,'' she said.

``Bulworth,'' which was Beatty's call for campaign finance reform.

<HEADLINE> Russian Banker Denies Money Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's top central banker denied allegations  
that Russians laundered billions of dollars through a U.S.-based 
bank, but acknowledged huge amounts of money flee Russia illegally 
every month, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of Russia's Central Bank, called  
media reports of money laundering through the Bank of New York 
``far-fetched,'' in an interview in the weekly Arguments and Facts. 
</P>
<P>
	Media reports have said Russian businesses and organized crime  
may have illegally laundered billions of dollars through the bank, 
the 15th largest in the United States. The reports have said the 
scandal could be one of the largest cases of money-laundering ever 
uncovered in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Gerashchenko played down those reports, he said bank  
specialists in Russia estimate about $1 billion leaves Russia every 
month illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of Russia's Vnesheconombank, the state bank in  
charge of foreign debt, said the capital going abroad was not 
necessarily criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot categorically state that the major part of the  
Russian capital (that has left the country) is of criminal 
nature,'' Andrei Kostin said during a visit to Washington for the 
annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major part of the capital which flies from Russia is not  
worse than the capital in any Western country which tries to find 
the best place where it can be invested,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerashchenko also denied rumors that he was planning to resign  
as bank chairman despite allegations that the Central Bank may have 
improperly used loan money from the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said he was planning to step down before his four-year  
term expires. He was appointed Central Bank chief last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a family, a parrot and a cat, whom I see on rare  
occasions. It is necessary to yield to the young in good time after 
all,'' he said in the Arguments and Facts interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Financial Times newspaper in London reported  
today that a Bank of New York executive fired in connection with 
the money-laundering investigation has filed a compensation claim 
for unfair dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Lucy Edwards, a central figure in the  
money-laundering probe, filed the claim with a London industrial 
tribunal, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	A London-based vice president for the bank, Edwards was  
dismissed for gross misconduct, violation of the bank's internal 
policies, falsification of bank records and failure to cooperate 
with the bank's investigation. She has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. investigators are trying to determine whether Russian  
criminal groups laundered up to $10 billion through the bank. No 
charges have been filed in connection with their investigation.

<HEADLINE> Japan Builder Revives Tower Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- A Japanese developer said Wednesday that  
with Asian economic troubles easing, it will resume construction of 
the world's tallest skyscraper next year in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
	The 90-story, 1,518-foot-tall Shanghai Financial Center is being  
redesigned to make it even taller, said Mori Building Co. president 
Minoru Mori. He wouldn't say what the new height target is. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't announce it yet, because some people might want to  
surpass it again,'' he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Skyscraper rivalry shifted to Asia when the 1,480-foot-tall  
Petronas Towers were finished in 1996 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 
and became the world's tallest. The main building displaced the 
Sears Tower of Chicago, which had held the title since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Developers announced plans for taller buildings in Shanghai and  
Taipei, Taiwan. The Taipei competitors were later forced to scale 
down their 110-story project to a mere 90 stories to keep it from 
becoming a nuisance to airliners. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, a developer announced plans to win back  
Chicago's record-holding status with a 119-story, 1,537-foot-tall 
skyscraper. 
</P>
<P>
	Work on the Shanghai World Financial Center started in the  
mid-1990s in Pudong, a newly developed business district being 
promoted as China's financial capital. Mori Building suspended 
construction in 1997, leaving a foundation pit with support pilings 
jutting out of the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Mori blamed the Asian financial crisis, which bankrupted several  
Japanese banks backing the project and made others more reluctant 
to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned 94-story Financial Center is to rise from a square  
base to a narrow wedge at its tip, with space for offices, a hotel, 
stores and restaurants. A huge circular hole punched through its 
top floors is to contain an open-air observation deck. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost and financing arrangements will change, Mori said. Mori  
Building had planned to pay 30 percent of the $235 million cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might have to increase our share, because some of the banks  
have failed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Center would enter a depressed Shanghai real  
estate market glutted with vacant space. Vacancy rates for offices 
in some areas are as high as 70 per cent, forcing landlords to 
slash rents. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mori was optimistic about luring tenants, pointing to the  
success of a 46-story tower opened by his company in Pudong last 
year. He said it has rented 90 percent of its space to foreign 
banks and other premium customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This already demonstrated to everyone that you can achieve  
high occupancy if you maintain certain global standards,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gene Therapy Experiment Halted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- A gene therapy experiment has been halted  
following the death of an 18-year-old Arizona man who volunteered 
to join the study to help others suffering from his rare metabolic 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Gelsinger died Sept. 16, several days after researchers  
began infusing his liver with genetically engineered viruses 
designed to counter ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, a 
disease that impairs the body's ability to rid itself of ammonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The disorder often leads to coma and death in infancy.  
Gelsinger, who was first diagnosed with OTC at age 2, had coped 
with the disease through a regimen of medications and low-protein 
foods. Ammonia is produced in the breakdown of protein. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kid was as happy as can be,'' Jesse's father, Paul  
Gelsinger, told The Arizona Daily Star. ``He was saying, `Dad, they 
might be able to come up with a cure.' He wanted to do it and I 
encouraged him. I was really proud of this kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The experiment involving 18 patients has been halted until  
researchers can determine why Jesse died, The Washington Post 
reported today. The newspaper referred to the death as the first 
linked by doctors to the field of research that seeks to cure 
people by giving them new genes. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials were expected to send letters today to more  
than 100 scientists across the country conducting human research 
with similar viruses, asking them to report any evidence of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia,  
DNA without the genetic mutation that causes OTC was inserted into 
a virus. The virus was then sent directly to the organ where the 
mutated gene was active -- the liver. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first 24 hours looked pretty similar to other patients,''  
said Dr. Mark Batshaw, one of the pioneers of OTC research. ``After 
24 hours, though, he just went rapidly downhill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse became comatose, his face swelled, his body was jaundiced  
and his oxygen intake dipped to dangerously low levels. Soon his 
entire body was swelling, inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor said our son was brain dead,'' Paul Gelsinger said.  
``He was symptomatic maybe three times in his life and now we had a 
vegetable. He didn't have a mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse was taken off life support one week after he flew to  
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why this happened,'' Batshaw said. ``We view him  
as a hero. He was one of those rare people who tried to help 
others. In the history of research, these things happen.''

<HEADLINE> Judge: Pitcher's Rights Violated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- A judge said police violated a former  
baseball pitcher's rights, but did not dismiss the charges against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	John Eric Rosengren, a former Arizona Diamondback minor league  
pitcher, sought to call his father, an attorney, when he was 
involved in a fatal car crash. 
</P>
<P>
	A police officer refused to allow him to do so, Judge Richard S.  
Fields of Pima County Superior Court was told. 
</P>
<P>
	Fields said Tuesday he needed additional time to review the case  
and probably won't rule on a defense dismissal motion until next 
week. Meanwhile, he delayed the trial until Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Rosengren is charged with manslaughter in a  
one-vehicle rollover accident Feb. 28 that killed his passenger and 
Diamondbacks teammate, 29-year-old Kenneth Neal Robinson Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were in Tucson for spring training.  
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Rosengren argue that because their client wasn't  
allowed to consult his father for legal advice, he was denied a 
crucial opportunity to develop evidence in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Failing a dismissal, lawyers Michael Piccarreta and Michael  
Bloom want Fields to suppress a blood sample taken from Rosengren 
the night of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had the sample taken after obtaining a search warrant  
through a city magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
	Toxicology tests based on a blood sample drawn at St. Mary's  
Hospital showed Rosengren's blood-alcohol level the morning of the 
crash was 0.16 percent, more than 1 1/2 times the level for 
presumptive drunken driving.

<HEADLINE> Japan Bank May Alter Money Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's central bank, under intense pressure at  
home and abroad, is tempting currency markets with hints that it 
may alter its money supply policy to cap the rise of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	An about-face by the bank has been urged by Japanese finance  
officials and politicians. Worried the yen's sharp rise this summer 
could snuff out the nation's fledgling economic recovery, the 
government has been clamoring for efforts to rein it in. 
</P>
<P>
	The government wants the yen weakened against the U.S. dollar to  
help the nation's big exporters. A stronger yen hurts these 
companies by making their goods more expensive overseas. 
Export-oriented Sony Corp., for instance, saw profits plunge 55 
percent due to the rising yen in the three months ending June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Big business would not be the only beneficiary of an easing of  
monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Weakening the yen, and flirting with inflation, could be a key  
to getting Japan's close-fisted consumers to finally spend money 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy, stagnant for most of the decade, has seen  
prices and consumer spending plummet during the past several years, 
a process known as deflation that could be disastrous for any 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Theoretically, the threat of its opposite -- inflation, or rising  
prices -- could persuade consumers to start buying again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has been reluctant to weaken the yen, in part  
because of fear that inflation could get out of control and 
politically destabilize the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the BOJ does trigger inflation, then savings get  
destroyed,'' said Andrew Shipley, an economist at Schroder 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Bank of Japan has been adamant about asserting  
its independence since being freed from the aegis of the Ministry 
of Finance last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few months, the dollar has tumbled from more than  
124 yen in May to just above 103 yen earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank enraged government leaders last week by  
announcing that it would not use monetary policy to weaken the 
currency, citing the fact that short-term interest rates already 
are close to zero. 
</P>
<P>
	But last weekend BOJ governor Masaru Hayami hinted vaguely in  
Washington that the bank might switch gears and print money to 
weaken the yen. He stirred up more confusion by later denying this 
was a change in the bank's policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Several times this summer, the Bank of Japan has intervened in  
currency markets in an effort to pull back the yen. Those actions 
involved selling yen and buying dollars on the open market, but 
they did not seem to have an enduring effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Many private economists say the inflation that would result from  
a weaker yen would be good for Japan, but the positive effects 
would not be immediate because of the country's current high 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unlikely for demand to immediately recover, even if  
prices start to rise,'' Shipley said in an interview. ``There's no 
easy way out for Japan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayami's comments in Washington have already begun to push the  
yen down against the dollar this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders seem to expect the BOJ will inject money into the  
banking system, a maneuver that could lead to lower interest rates 
and a decline of the yen's value against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipley said the BOJ should buy bonds to weaken the yen rather  
than pump funds into the banking system, since the nation's 
beleaguered, debt-ridden banks are still reluctant to lend money. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some economists say a significant change in the  
yen-dollar rate may not be enough to send the lagging Japanese 
economy toward full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers' oft-cited  
advice, Kazuki Fujita of the Industrial Bank of Japan said, 
``Domestic demand-led growth, as Summers always says, is 
necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Fujita, a senior foreign exchange trader, said the Japanese  
government needs to spend more money on economic stimulus to 
increase demand to keep the nation from toppling back into 
recession. ``Japan needs budgetary help,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Loses Crew Chief Evernham </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, N.C. (AP) -- Jeff Gordon lost his crew chief  
Wednesday when Ray Evernham was released from his contract with 
Hendrick Motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham oversaw the development of Gordon from a talented but  
raw rookie in 1993 to a three-time Winston Cup champion and winner 
of 47 races in five-plus seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham was under contract with Hendrick through the 2006  
season, but in recent weeks decided he wanted to leave the team, 
which has not done as well this season as in the past. Gordon, the 
defending Winston Cup champion, is sixth in the driver standings 
and has virtually no chance of winning the title again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray let us know he had reached a point where he didn't want to  
be a crew chief anymore,'' team owner Rick Hendrick said Wednesday. 
``In response to that, we were planning to move him up in the 
organization, but he decided he wanted to pursue having a team of 
his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham thanked Hendrick for allowing him to pursue his goal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm also thankful that he enabled me to work with Jeff Gordon,  
who is an incredible winner and may be the best talent this sport 
has ever seen, as well as our Rainbow Warriors team and crew,'' 
Evernham said. ``Jeff and that crew will be winning races for a 
long time to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon said: ``My first thought is to thank Ray. He has  
contributed greatly to the success of the team, and I wish him 
success in future endeavors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's new leader is Brian Whitesell, an engineer at  
Hendrick Motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Whitesell joined the team in 1992 and became its  
engineer in 1994. He worked beside Evernham on race days, with the 
two of them positioned atop the team's pit box. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a fantastic opportunity,'' Whitesell said.  
``Working with Ray has helped me understand the dynamics involved 
between driver, crew chief and our spotter on race days. Jeff 
Gordon and I have always communicated very well also, and that's 
extremely important.''

<HEADLINE> Bauer Denies Affair Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer  
denied allegations Wednesday by two former campaign staffers -- one 
now allied with rival Steve Forbes -- that he had an 
``inappropriate'' relationship with a female campaign aide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not had any physical contact with anyone in my campaign  
or out of my campaign other than my wife,'' Bauer said at a news 
conference. He was surrounded by his wife and three children. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Jarvis, an unpaid consultant to the Forbes campaign and  
Bauer's former national campaign chairman, told The Associated 
Press on Wednesday that he had warned Bauer that he was spending 
too much time with his deputy campaign manager and it created a bad 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have confronted Gary about the appearance of  
impropriety,'' said Jarvis. ``I did it a number of times. 
Personally, I warned him in the clearest terms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis made no specific allegations beyond Bauer's spending  
``hours and hours and hours behind closed doors with a young single 
woman'' -- something he thought was ``inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer later said he thought the Forbes campaign was behind the  
allegation. ``I don't think there is any doubt about it,'' he 
replied when asked about it during an interview Wednesday with Fox 
New Channel. The Forbes campaign has denied involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim MacDonald, another former Bauer campaign aide who is not  
affiliated with the Forbes campaign, also said he expressed concern 
to Bauer about the time he was spending with the aide. He said the 
candidate assured him there was no sexual relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think there was and I believed him,'' MacDonald said.  
</P>
<P>
	At his news conference, Bauer called the allegations ``trash-can  
politics at its worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The core idea of these rumors is that I violated the vows I  
made to my wife 27 years ago,'' he said. ``These rumors and 
character assassinations are disgusting, outrageous, evil and 
sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He sidestepped questions about whether staffers had raised  
concerns about the amount of time he spent with the aide. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's campaign manager, Frank Cannon, said Bauer had, in fact,  
talked to Jarvis and MacDonald about his relationship with the 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased that somebody associated with the Forbes campaign  
is finally willing to go on the record with these baseless 
allegations,'' said Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forbes campaign adamantly denied it was involved with  
spreading the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an internal feud within the Bauer campaign that we  
have unfortunately been dragged into,'' said Forbes spokesman Greg 
Mueller.

<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Red Wings signed defenseman Jiri  
Fischer to a three-year, $2.9 million contract Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech native played last season for Hull of the Quebec Major  
Junior League. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract pays Fischer $975,000 a year, his agent, Jiri Crha,  
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5, 210-pounder played in seven exhibition games and  
was scoreless with four penalty minutes. At Hull last season, he 
had 22 goals and 56 assists in 65 games. He also had 141 penalty 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the Red Wings said they assigned four players to  
the AHL Cincinnati Mighty Ducks -- left wing Philippe Audet, center 
Darryl Laplante and defensemen Maxim Kuznetzov and Jesse Wallin. 
</P>
<P>
	The club also released veteran wing Randy Burridge.

<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- A German lawyer representing Martin  
Frankel, the former financier arrested in Germany after an 
international manhunt, said Wednesday that he has quit the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Piplak indicated that Frankel, whose bank accounts are  
frozen, had been unable to pay his legal fees. In a telephone 
interview, he said he dropped the case for ``several reasons, and 
money was one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. newspaper, The Toledo Blade, reported Wednesday that  
Frankel planned to sell his story to the media to pay his lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel's new attorney, Dirk Meinicke, could not be reached  
Wednesday. An associate, Bernd Rosenkranz, refused to comment on 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, a 44-year-old money manager from Greenwich, Conn., fled  
the United States in May after allegedly bilking insurance 
companies in five states out of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	German police arrested him in a Hamburg hotel room on Sept. 4 on  
a tip from the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel is fighting his extradition to the United States, which  
means legal proceedings in Germany will still drag on for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a U.S. lawyer withdrew from the case because of the  
bank account freeze and Frankel's inability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Keefe, a New Haven, Conn., defense attorney, said he had  
tried to convince U.S. federal prosecutors to release some of 
Frankel's assets.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- The City of Big Shoulders has taken a big step  
toward being home to the world's tallest building -- again. 
</P>
<P>
	The city council on Wednesday unanimously approved a developer's  
plans for a 108-story, 1,550-foot-tall skyscraper.

	The $500-million structure would include offices, condominiums,  
retail stores and parking spaces. It would be built at the site of 
a 17-story building located about six blocks from the 1,450-foot 
Sears Tower, knocked from its spot as world's tallest building in 
1996.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Urged on Throwing Deep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Kordell Stewart isn't scrambling or throwing  
deep, allowing opposing defenses to stack the line of scrimmage 
against running back Jerome Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a new offensive coordinator in Pittsburgh, but it sure  
sounds like old times. 
</P>
<P>
	One of offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride's main goals after  
being brought in to overhaul the underachieving offense of a season 
ago was to reinstate the deep pass and get Stewart scrambling 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to loosen defenses by throwing deep last season, and with  
Stewart seemingly chained to the pocket, the Steelers' offense 
became increasingly easy to read -- and, as the 7-9 season 
progressed, easy to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	After showing measurable improvement this season with victories  
over AFC Central doormats Baltimore and Cleveland, the Steelers 
bogged down again Sunday in a morass of mistakes, poor execution 
and easy-to-diagnose play-calling in a 29-10 loss to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never really stretched the field, and that enabled us to  
stay close and keep them from running,'' said Jay Bellamy, who made 
one of five interceptions thrown by Stewart and Mike Tomczak. ``We 
knew if they threw anything, it would be short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle linebacker Chad Brown, formerly of the Steelers,  
suggested Pittsburgh's offense limits Stewart's ability to rally 
them from a big deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Steelers' offense is based on running the football. They  
don't ask the quarterback to win the game for them. When they get 
behind like that, it's not part of the quarterback's makeup,'' 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound familiar?  
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers' offense was so inefficient -- it didn't score until  
Seattle had opened a 26-0 lead -- that coach Bill Cowher took the 
unusual step, for him, of singling out players for post-game 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of his list: Stewart, whom Cowher said should have  
been more eager to duck the blitz by scrambling out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's longest completion was for 23 yards; the week before  
against Baltimore, it was 22 yards. His longest this season was a 
42-yarder to Hines Ward in the opener in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher denies that the Steelers have erased the deep pass from  
Stewart's playbook because they fear interceptions or that their 
receivers won't get open. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Stewart averaged 12.8 yards per completion in 1997, the  
Steelers have lost their top two receivers from that season, Yancey 
Thigpen and Charles Johnson. They drafted Troy Edwards from 
Louisiana Tech to add a big-play threat, but he can't beat out 
Courtney Hawkins and plays only when extra receivers are employed. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart averages 9.3 yards per completion this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know we went downfield on two occasions against Baltimore,  
we hit Hines Ward with one and Courtney Hawkins with one,'' Cowher 
said. ``I guess last week we took a couple of chances. The 
circumstances in that game were that it got so they were not going 
to give up the long ball. If they take that away, we have to be 
able to run the football. If they're going to put a couple of 
safeties back there, we have to make the running game go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They couldn't do that, either, as Jerome Bettis was limited to  
39 yards, with 20 coming on his final carry. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Steelers (2-1) realize they probably can't rely on  
short, simple pass routes and their running game if they are to 
beat defending division champion Jacksonville (2-1) on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to score points and win football games,'' Cowher  
said. ``I don't think it's a question of trying to establish 
something. If we feel like the deep ball was there and people are 
sitting on certain routes, we need to make sure we stretch the 
field. That's always going to be the objective we have.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Trumpets Health Care Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill  
Bradley said Wednesday that his proposal to require parents to get 
health insurance for their children wouldn't necessarily need 
enforcement. Parents would jump at the opportunity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, visiting a free health clinic for the poor, responded  
to critics who questioned how he would enforce that element of the 
health care plan he unveiled a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there any resistance from the parents who bring their  
children here to having health insurance?'' he asked rhetorically 
during a meeting with a group of 15 doctors, nurses, health 
activists and parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``People said, 'Well, how are you going to force people to take  
health insurance?''' Bradley said. ``It's been my sense that if you 
were given an opportunity for health insurance, then you'd take it 
for your child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sylvia Pandy, who sat next to Bradley with her 5-year-old son  
Gregory, appeared unaware of the proposal, which also would provide 
subsidies to families that cannot afford to pay the full cost of 
health coverage for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked afterward whether she would take advantage of Bradley's  
offer should it be implemented, Pandy said she probably would. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bradley's campaign ran half-page ads Wednesday in  
newspapers in the key states of Iowa and New Hampshire with the 
details of his health care plan. Aside from mandated coverage for 
children, it also would provide subsidies to poor adults, expand 
Medicare and allow adults to buy into the federal employee health 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley made his second consecutive appearance in Los Angeles  
the same day that his rival, Vice President Al Gore, announced he 
was moving his headquarters from Washington to Tennessee, and 
challenged Bradley to a series of debates. 
</P>
<P>
	At the clinic, with his wife Ernestine looking on, Bradley  
played moderator as the medical workers and parents described 
health care difficulties facing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Larson, a nurse practitioner, said asthma had grown to  
``epidemic proportions'' among children in her low-income 
neighborhood, and Pandy said her son had been diagnosed with the 
breathing difficulty at the clinic, the St. John's Well Child 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Raquel Ceja said one of her children had become ill from eating  
lead paint, which center executive director Jim Mangia said also 
was a widespread problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the session, another of Ceja's children, 18-month-old  
Pete, squirmed and tugged at participants, including Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	The former U.S. senator from New Jersey gently grasped the boy's  
hand, and Pete whirled away toward his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew we'd come to that before this was over,'' Bradley said  
with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Marciela Frutos, another mother, said she worked for years  
without receiving health benefits for her children. Today, she has 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been struggling for four years to get those health  
insurance (benefits) for my kids,'' she said, her voice breaking 
with emotion. Frutos said she no longer uses the clinic, but told 
Bradley it was invaluable for her many neighbors without coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said Bradley's plan would take  
pressure off such clinics by helping parents afford coverage they 
could take to their own doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't give them a healthy start, then we're all going to  
have problems down the road,'' Bradley said.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Vs. Notre Dame To Proceed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Notre Dame should take reasonable steps to  
prevent fans from being injured during scrambles for footballs that 
land in the stands during games, the Indiana Court of Appeals says. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled Tuesday that Letitia Hayden, who was injured by  
someone lunging for a ball during a 1995 game, can proceed with her 
lawsuit seeking unspecified damages against the university. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision reversed a ruling by St. Joseph Circuit Court Judge  
Terry Crone that dismissed the lawsuit on grounds that Notre Dame 
did not owe a duty to protect Hayden from the criminal acts of a 
third party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notre Dame well understands and benefits from the enthusiasm  
of the fans of its football games,'' the unanimous appeals court 
ruling said. ``It is just such enthusiasm that drives some 
spectators to attempt to retrieve a football to keep as a 
souvenir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden and her husband, William, were sitting behind the goal  
post in the south end zone at a game Sept. 16, 1995, when one of 
the teams kicked a football toward the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Several people lunged for the ball and one of them struck Mrs.  
Hayden from behind, fracturing her left shoulder and collarbone. 
She sued the university for failing to exercise care to protect 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she and her husband had attended Notre Dame games for  
years and saw footballs land in the seats around them many times. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband testified that the net behind the goal post caught  
kicked footballs only about half the time. He also said student 
managers who worked for the university used to aggressively attempt 
to recover footballs, but no longer did that. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame contended that the action of the person who injured  
Mrs. Hayden was unforeseeable and it therefore owed no duty to 
anticipate it and protect her. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said there was evidence of many prior  
incidents in which people were jostled or injured by fans trying to 
retrieve balls. 
</P>
<P>
	John Ulmer, an attorney for Mrs. Hayden, said she was  
permanently impaired because of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a manager at Michigan State in the late '50s for the  
football team, and that is why we went into the stands -- to keep 
control and get the football without anyone getting hurt. Notre 
Dame used to do that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	William Hoye, an attorney for Notre Dame, was out of the office  
and unavailable for comment. Jill Bodensteiner, another Notre Dame 
attorney listed in the appeal's court ruling, did not immediately 
return a phone call seeking comment Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> House Republicans Unveil TV Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than a year before Election Day, House  
Republicans unveiled their first television commercials of the 
campaign on Wednesday, accusing Democrats of planning to raid the 
Social Security surplus for ``big government programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., chairman of the House GOP campaign  
committee, said the commercials would initially run in the 
districts of ``upwards of a dozen'' Democratic lawmakers viewed as 
vulnerable to an electoral challenge next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The only one he would name was Rep. Jim Maloney of Connecticut,  
who swiftly accused the GOP of leveling charges that ``are 
blatantly untrue. In fact they know they're untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the Democrats and the president have a budget plan  
to raid Social Security for more spending on wasteful big 
government programs,'' says the announcer in one of three 
variations of the same advertisement. Each includes the message: 
``Stop the raid on Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri rebutted that  
the Republicans were out ``to try to convince the American people 
that they're not doing something that they're doing. ... It is the 
most cynical thing I've ever seen in my time in politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, Maloney noted he had voted for a  
Republican-crafted ``lockbox'' bill to safeguard Social Security 
funds. He added that he had voted against the GOP tax cut measure 
``precisely because it used money that should have gone to protect 
Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP commercials come as Republicans are girding for a  
year-end budget battle with the White House and Democrats. After 
conceding they would not keep two earlier pledges -- meet an Oct. 1 
deadline for passing all spending bills and hold spending under 
caps in the 1997 balanced budget agreement -- Republicans now say 
they will refuse to dip into the Social Security surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercials are to underscore that policy.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis said Republicans were seeking donations from lawmakers and  
interest groups to pay for the commercials. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats had hopes for picking up a House seat in the Maryland  
suburbs around Washington as the year dawned. There was speculation 
that the incumbent, moderate seven-term Republican Rep. Connie 
Morella, would give up her seat to run for the Senate. In the 
meantime, Democrats sought to entice Mark Shriver, a state 
legislator and member of the Kennedy family, into the race for her 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
	But Morella decided to stay put, and Shriver declined to run.  
Now party officials say the only announced Democratic candidate, 
Ralph Neas, has dropped out, citing family reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Morella gained 60 percent of the vote in defeating Neas last  
year, and Democrats are now searching for a candidate in a district 
where President Clinton has twice won comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton journeyed to the Senate this  
week to tout Democratic legislation to raise the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke only briefly and made no reference to her unannounced  
campaign for the Senate from New York. Nor did the script call for 
her to respond to questions. 
</P>
<P>
	But one reporter shouted out: ``How do you like the offices  
here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that, the first lady stopped, smiled, and then headed  
wordlessly for the exit.

	Rain and scattered storms extended along a cold front from the  
Great Lakes to Alabama and Mississippi, and spread eastward during 
the afternoon through the Appalachians and into the East Coast 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of eastern North Carolina, already flooded since Hurricane  
Floyd two weeks ago, had gotten as much as 8 inches of rain in two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	And from Mississippi, the thunderstorms and heavy rain continued  
southwestward in a line across the coastal regions of Louisiana and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	A severe thunderstorm watch was posted for eastern Ohio and  
Kentucky and western sections of West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday night, several homes and businesses were damaged or  
destroyed by tornadoes that swept through central North Carolina. 
One man had his leg broken, officials said, apparently when a tree 
crashed into his home. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado also struck South Carolina Wednesday night. About 10  
mobile homes were destroyed in the northeast part of the state and 
some residents were taken to a hospital, officials said. None of 
the injuries were serious. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ohio, wind up to 60 mph knocked down power lines and trees in  
the Columbus area. An estimated 10,000 American Electric Power 
customers lost power around noon, but about half of them had 
service again by late afternoon. Heavy rain also may have been a 
factor in an afternoon school bus accident; several children were 
taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado watch was issued for sections of western New York,  
western Pennsylvania and lakes Erie and Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, a few light showers were scattered across Montana and  
North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from  
a morning low of just 15 degrees at Craig, Colo., to midday 
readings of 88 at Palm Springs, Calif., and Mayport, Fla. The 
lowest wind chill was 1 below zero at Leadville, Colo., and the 
highest heat index by the middle of the day was 107 at Biloxi, 
Miss.

<HEADLINE> Davis: Broncos Will Find Groove </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Terrell Davis has a simple remedy for what ails  
the Denver Broncos' running game. A firm tug on the rope should 
suffice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like I told somebody today, it's almost like trying to start a  
lawn mower,'' Davis said Wednesday. ``You're pulling it and pulling 
it and it wants to start, but it's not starting. But I think once 
it starts, we'll start rolling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who led the NFL with 2,008 yards rushing last season,  
barely is on pace for 1,000 this season. The Broncos, who ranked 
second in the NFL in rushing last season, stand 21st after three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Team Toro is any closer to finding solutions for its  
ground woes, Davis said, ``I don't think it's a big problem right 
now, as far as what needs to be fixed. I think it's just little 
things. We're close to breaking long runs. We're close to 
establishing drives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the main thing we need to do is just hold some  
consistent drives together. A lot of times it takes the running 
game some time to get into sync. It's hard to get a running game in 
sync when you're going three-and-out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposing defenses deserve some credit for throttling him thus  
far, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing pretty close to the line of scrimmage,'' he  
said. ``If we could break the line of scrimmage, we'd have a chance 
to make a long run. I don't know whether they're stacking or not. I 
don't see that too often. I think it's just that people are playing 
us a little harder right now, making more plays than we're 
making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who has 193 yards on 59 carries and only one touchdown,  
remains upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have all the confidence in the world that this running game  
is going to work and our offense can still move the ball and we can 
put points on the board,'' he said. ``I'm not deterred by what has 
happened these past three games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sunny disposition could suffer, however, if the Broncos  
(0-3) continue to misfire on Sunday in a home game against the New 
York Jets (0-3). 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets, who lost to Denver 23-10 in the AFC championship game  
last season, rank 20th in the league on offense and 27th on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Cornerback Dale Carter missed practice on Wednesday to be  
with his younger sister, who was assaulted during an apparent 
robbery in the Atlanta area. ... Center Jason Watts, signed to 
Denver's developmental squad on Tuesday, worked out with the team 
Wednesday. Watts was released from jail in July after serving 3 1/2 
months for a drunken-driving crash that killed a teammate and 
another man.

<HEADLINE> Six Asian Countries Reduce Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Six southeast Asian nations agreed today to  
reduce tariffs to a maximum of 5 percent for most agricultural and 
manufacturing products by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The tariff cut will apply to Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia,  
Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines -- the six founding members of 
the regional economic grouping called the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Malaysia urged ASEAN officials meeting here to postpone  
reducing tariffs on imported cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Explaining that the Malaysian auto industry was hit hard by the  
economic crisis, Malaysian Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz 
told reporters that cutting tariffs on imported cars should be 
delayed until after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens after that, we have not decided,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	ASEAN's goal is to make the region a ``zero tariff'' trade area  
by 2015 for the six founding members. The other members -- Laos, 
Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia -- are to join by 2018, ASEAN 
officials said in a joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
	today's talks precede the formal ministers' conference on  
general economic issues starting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, ASEAN economic officials agreed to open  
restricted or closed industries to regional investors by January 
2003. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, ASEAN countries have drawn up lists of proposed  
manufacturing products to be included in the deal. Lists for 
agriculture, forestry, fishery and mining industries are to be 
completed by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``This important first step makes the whole investment  
environment more transparent,'' Singapore Trade and Industry 
Minister George Yeo told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``This is not to be construed as an exclusionary  
scheme that would exclude non-ASEAN investors. ASEAN remains open 
to foreign investors.''

<HEADLINE> Network TV in Season Opening / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The new television season may not be just for  
kids after all. 
</P>
<P>
	After much attention was paid to network efforts to appeal to  
teen-agers and young adults, it was the more serious adult fare of 
dramas that did best during a promising opening week of the TV 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC narrowly won the first week's Nielsens ratings race over  
CBS, primarily because the strong ``Saturday Night Live'' 25th 
anniversary special Sunday blunted the impact of CBS's strongest 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are encouraged by the way people are tuning in to network  
television and we look forward to a good season for all of us,'' 
said Scott Sassa, NBC's West Coast president. 
</P>
<P>
	Two new dramas premiered in the week's top 10: ABC's critically  
acclaimed ``Once and Again,'' about two recently-divorced parents 
fumbling through a romance, and NBC's ``Third Watch,'' about an 
emergency medical team. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC also had strong showings by ``West Wing,'' the White House  
drama with Martin Sheen as president, and the spinoff series, ``Law 
and Order: Special Victims Unit.'' ABC was pleased with the showing 
of its new ``Snoops,'' despite tough competition Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Two legal dramas did well for CBS: ``Family Law,'' about a  
marital attorney who must rebuild her career when her own marriage 
breaks up, and ``Judging Amy,'' which fell off a bit from its 
premiere the previous week but still posted encouraging numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, audiences have proven more willing to try new dramas  
because they're intrigued by the stories, said Garth Ancier, NBC 
Entertainment president. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've all been sampled well and, by and large, they've been  
good programs,'' Ancier said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers also returned to some old favorites. ABC's Emmy-winning  
``The Practice'' had its largest audience ever last week and NBC's 
``Law and Order'' had its best season-opening audience since its 
premiere in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Comedies haven't done nearly as well. Fox's ``Action,'' perhaps  
the most critically acclaimed new series of the fall, and NBC's 
``Stark Raving Mad'' have been particular disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Ancier said comedies take a longer time to build an audience  
because viewers need to become comfortable with the characters. 
Critics generally agreed that it was an unusually weak fall season 
for new comedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox has had a tough season so far. Its average audience last  
week was 7.8 million, down from 8.6 million a year before, though 
series like ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The X-Files'' have yet to 
premiere. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 9.9 rating and 16 share and CBS had a  
9.7 rating and 16 share. ABC had an 8.3 rating and 14 share and Fox 
was at 5.3 and 9. NBC easily won among the 18-to-49-year-old 
demographic advertisers watch closely. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB had a 2.9 rating and 5 share, UPN had a 2.5 rating and 4  
share and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news ratings race  
with a 7.3 rating and 16 share. The ``NBC Nightly News'' was second 
with a 7.2 rating and 16 share, and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 
6.4 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Sept. 20-26, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were ``Friends,'' NBC, 17.8; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 16.6; 
``NFL Monday Night Football: Atlanta at Dallas,'' ABC, 15.2; 
``Third Watch'' special,'' NBC, 14.1; ``Saturday Night Live 25th 
Anniversary Special,'' NBC, 14.0; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 13.9; ``NFL 
Monday Showcase,'' ABC, 12.6; ``Country Music Association Awards,'' 
CBS, 12.3; ``Once and Again,'' ABC, 12.3; ``Stark Raving Mad,'' 
NBC, 12.3.

<HEADLINE>  Garcia's Caddie: I Was Attacked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Boorish conduct by U.S. fans at the  
Ryder Cup didn't stop at the course. 
</P>
<P>
	The American caddie for European Ryder Cup star Sergio Garcia  
said Wednesday he was attacked in a hotel bar after the tournament 
and had to go to a hospital with a head wound. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Higginbotham, sporting a black eye and bruised cheek, said  
several men taunted him because he was an American working with the 
European team. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the guys had obviously had a bad day and had definitely  
had too much to drink,'' said Higginbotham, caddie this week for 
Garcia in the German Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Boston and Brookline, Mass., on Wednesday said they  
have no record of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation is the latest instance of hostility  
surrounding the tournament, in which the United States made the 
greatest comeback in the history of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans were angered by the celebrations of the Americans  
on the 17th green after Justin Leonard made a 45-foot putt that led 
the U.S. team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The European team and British media assailed the rowdy  
galleries. European star Colin Montgomerie was heckled mercilessly 
and a fan spit on the wife of European captain Mark James. 
</P>
<P>
	James said European golfers might refuse to play another Ryder  
Cup in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Higginbotham, who caddied for American Mark O'Meara at the 1997  
Ryder Cup in Spain, described the attack in the hotel bar. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said some things I didn't like and I said a couple of  
things back to him because I'll always defend myself,'' he said. 
``And then boom, he comes up on the blind side and down I went, 
hitting my head on the way down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higginbotham took some of the blame.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I should have done was walk away,'' he said, ``but the  
whole thing leaves a sour taste in the mouth.''

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Capital Mgmt. Repays Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-Term Capital Management said Tuesday it  
will repay another $800 million to the group of financial companies 
that kept the fund from going under last year. 
</P>
<P>
	With this installment, Long-Term Capital Management will have  
repaid 75 percent of the $3.63 billion it borrowed to cover 
mounting losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve Bank of New York had to call an emergency  
meeting of industry leaders to prevent the speculative hedge fund's 
woes from spreading to other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bailout included 14 high-profile investment firms, including  
Goldman Sachs Group, Chase Manhattan Corp., Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and 
JP Morgan &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The group formed an oversight committee to monitor the fund's  
recovery efforts. On Tuesday, the committee issued a statement 
saying, ``We are very pleased to have made such progress in the 
course of one year. This would not have been possible without the 
full support of the entire LTCM organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Long-Term Capital Management has decreased its level of  
risk by 90 percent from its weakest point last year.

<HEADLINE> Senate Warns N.Y. Museum on Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a slap at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the  
Senate approved a non-binding measure Wednesday saying the museum 
should not get federal funds unless it cancels an exhibit featuring 
a picture of a feces-covered Virgin Mary. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the Senate attached the resolution, sponsored by  
Independent Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, to a spending bill 
covering the Labor, Health and Human Services departments. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can do what they want to do and they can draw what they  
want to draw,'' Smith said from the Senate floor. But, he said, 
``the government doesn't have to fund this garbage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was little debate on the measure, which simply expresses  
the Senate's opinion. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he was 
accepting it simply to speed debate on the overall bill, and said 
Smith's language would never become law. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani this week called the painting  
``sick'' and demanded it be pulled from ``Sensation,'' an upcoming 
exhibition of British work at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, a Roman Catholic, has threatened to freeze $7 million  
in public funding to the museum unless the painting is pulled -- a 
move artist Chris Ofili's London representative has called an 
infringement on free expression. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the museum has received $500,000 from the National  
Endowment for the Arts in the last three years.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Suing Precision-Optics Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The government is suing a precision-optics  
maker alleging that it faked inspection reports and shipped 
millions of dollars worth of defective parts to the military for 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	John Plummer, 84, and his company, Plummer Precision Optics Co.  
of Pennsburg, were accused along with several company officials and 
others of engaging in ``a systematic and continuous scheme'' to 
defraud the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer lenses are used in the gunner's primary sighting system  
for the Army's M-1 tank and are critical components of the Army's 
laser range finders, according to the civil complaint filed in U.S. 
District Court and made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Louis Fryman, who represents Plummer, said he could not  
comment because he had not yet seen the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations came out of a whistle-blower lawsuit, filed  
under seal in March 1997 by former Plummer marketing director 
Robert Basore. The federal False Claims Act allows individuals to 
sue any entity or person believed to be submitting false 
reimbursement claims to the government. The government has now 
joined in the case, which was unsealed last week by U.S. District 
Judge Herbert Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends Plummer made defective lenses in order to  
cut manufacturing costs. If it wins, the government would be 
entitled to recover treble damages plus $5,000 to $10,000 in civil 
penalties for each false claim knowingly submitted.

<HEADLINE> McCain Invokes Reagan's Spirit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- Presidential hopeful John McCain  
invoked Ronald Reagan's spirit Wednesday, but bent the former 
president's ``Eleventh Commandment'' against speaking ill of fellow 
Republicans with thinly veiled criticisms of his rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator never mentioned Texas Gov. George W. Bush or  
conservative candidate Pat Buchanan by name in a speech that 
stressed his own military record -- a background that distinguishes 
him from Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also defended U.S. intervention in World War II, which  
Buchanan has questioned in a new book. 
</P>
<P>
	``History speaks for itself. The service and sacrifice of  
250,000 Americans speaks for itself as well,'' McCain told 
reporters after his speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential 
Library and Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's speech blended his signature issues -- reducing the  
influence of money in politics, beefing up the military and 
restoring pride in public service -- with references to his 
experience as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War and calls 
for a firmer foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the GOP front-runner, served in the Texas Air National  
Guard during the Vietnam War, but never served overseas. Bush also 
campaigned Wednesday in southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	In a clear slap at Buchanan's anti-interventionist views and  
Bush's lack of combat experience, McCain said the United States 
must continue to intervene for good around the world but that a 
president needs ``broad and deep experience'' when making such 
life-and-death decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	His speech repeatedly invoked the spirit and words of Reagan -- a  
time-honored campaign tactic for GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Reagan sat in the front row but did not speak or give  
interviews. The former president, who has Alzheimer's disease, did 
not attend. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain later told reporters that he met with Mrs. Reagan earlier  
in the day but that she did not indicate whether she would endorse 
him over Bush.

<HEADLINE> Cosmic Burst May Be Supernova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A cosmic blast last year -- one of the most powerful explosions  
ever observed -- probably originated in a supernova and the 
formation of a black hole, astronomers reported today in the 
journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The burst of cosmic gamma rays leaves astronomers more convinced  
that these brief, but brilliant cosmic flashes are generated by the 
fiery collapse of massive, dying stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The short-lived gamma ray burst of March 26, 1998, was spotted  
by the European satellite BeppoSax, which relayed the burst's 
position. Using the Keck Telescope in Hawaii, astronomers from the 
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena say they analyzed 
the afterglow of the burst, labeled GRB 980326, but it quickly 
faded. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronomers said they expected the burst's afterglow to  
quickly be replaced by the general brightness of the surrounding 
galaxy. Instead, light rebrightened ``dramatically'' at the 
position of the gamma ray burst, obscuring the galaxy itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cal-Tech team believes it was the underlying supernova  
created when the massive star exploded. ``Galaxies don't just 
disappear,'' said astronomer Shrinivas R. Kulkarni. ``This is 
something quite new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the astronomers' theory, a black hole quickly forms  
in the center of a dying massive star whose core cannot support 
itself against gravity. When the star explodes in its death throes, 
powerful jets of high-energy particles are ejected into space. 
</P>
<P>
	These gamma rays are thousands of times more powerful than the  
energy emitted by our sun over its entire lifetime. However, the 
gamma ray jets have to be pointing toward Earth in order to be 
detected. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamma rays, discovered in 1967, are observed once a day on  
average. They have higher energy than all other forms of radiation, 
but that energy never affects Earth's surface because it gets 
absorbed by the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers have offered more than 150 theories to explain the  
origins of gamma rays, but the Cal-Tech team's supernova theory has 
gained widespread support in recent years as their observations of 
gamma ray explosions pile up. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the most powerful explosion ever observed -- a  
deep space eruption detected in January 9 billion light years from 
Earth -- was a gamma ray burst that astronomers say probably was 
associated with a supernova explosion, too. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 25, 1998, gamma rays were observed in the same location  
as a weaker supernova that exploded just 140 million light years 
from Earth.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Hula Queen, bumped at the start, went  
wide in the stretch to win the $112,900 Senator Ken Maddy Handicap 
by 3 1/2 lengths Wednesday on opening day of Santa Anita's Oak Tree 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Alex Solis, Hula Queen covered 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:13.05  
and paid $31.60, $11 and $5.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Irish-bred Desert Lady returned $4 and $2.80, while Ecudienne  
was another three-quarters of a length back and paid $4.80 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	``She broke a little slow and then I got bumped, and that's why  
I was behind,'' Solis said. ``I wasn't planning on being there, but 
it just happened and I had to just go from there and improvise and 
try to win it any way I could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first stakes victory in the United States for  
Argentine-born trainer Luis Seglin, who's been training here for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best moment for me,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Hollywood Lacks Diversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A new statewide commission charged with  
promoting tolerance and understanding of diversity has selected 
television as its first target. 
</P>
<P>
	Television's new prime-time fall lineup -- which has been  
criticized for its lack of ethnic faces -- shows Hollywood moguls 
are out of touch with the multicultural reality, panelists told the 
Commission for One California. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pure racism to me,'' said Anne-Marie Johnson, a black  
actress whose credits include the 1997 miniseries ``Asteroid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, composed of religious and civic leaders, civil  
rights lawyers, university officials and others, held its first 
meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante said the entertainment industry was the  
first subject chosen because it is a ``hot topic,'' but diversity 
in schools, housing and other issues also will be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	During the meeting at the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of  
Tolerance, a panel of activists and industry insiders said none of 
the more than two dozen new fall shows has a minority in a leading 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are close to having an all-white landscape on these new  
fall shows,'' said Greg Braxton, a TV industry reporter with The 
Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Panelists cited 1998 studies that found minorities, especially  
Hispanics, were underrepresented on prime-time TV and in movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Children want multiethnic shows and the lack of ethnic actors  
and role models ``affects the aspiration of the kids who are 
invisible,'' said Lois Salisbury, president of the advocacy group 
Children Now. 
</P>
<P>
	Panelists suggested several reasons for the minority  
underrepresentation: Hollywood jobs depend on ``who you know,'' and 
minorities don't know the right people; executives are afraid of 
using minorities for fear of being criticized for inaccurately 
portraying their cultures; and executives don't realize there is a 
vast English-speaking Hispanic market. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Masur, president of the Screen Actors Guild, said that  
media mergers and buyouts are eliminating diverse voices, 
concentrating power in ``too few hands and too few minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only network or studio that accepted an offer to appear at  
the commission meeting was the WB. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Mater, the WB's senior vice president of broadcast  
standards, said progress has been made in diversity, noting that 
more than 30 gay characters appear in prime-time network shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are success stories,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Jets, Giants Going to Grass Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Giants Stadium is going to have a  
permanent grass field starting in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Giants and New York Jets decided Wednesday to  
switch from an artificial surface to an experimental tray grass 
system after receiving assurances from a grass consultant that the 
field would hold up with two teams playing on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still financial and operational issues that need to  
be resolved, but everyone was in agreement that it was in all of 
our interests to put down the grass field permanently next 
season,'' John Mara, the Giants' executive vice president, said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will cost $4 million to $5 million to make the change, said a  
source close to the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, 
which operates the 78,000-seat stadium that has had an artificial 
surface since opening in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	About $2.5 million will be needed to buy enough trays to cover  
2 1/2 fields. The rest of the money will be needed to install a 
heating and cooling system, storage and infrastructure costs and 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	The tray system will be installed over the current AstroTurf 12  
field, which will give the authority a backup in case the grass 
fails, Mara said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sports authority, the football teams and the New York-New  
Jersey MetroStars of Major League Soccer also have to agree on 
ground rules covering stadium use for soccer, concerts, Giants' 
practices and college football games. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the key issue has always been whether a grass field  
would hold up with two NFL teams using it in an area where snow, 
rain and cold can cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Jets, who moved here in 1984, and Giants have talked  
about playing on grass since 1994, they didn't do it until last 
year, when Clark Companies of Delhi, N.Y., installed an 
experimental tray system. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-year evaluation had mixed results, but everyone  
concerned felt that modifications to the tray system made by Scott 
Clark of Clark Companies held up very well this summer. During one 
10-day span, three NFL games, the Kickoff Classic, a couple of 
college football practices and a soccer game were played, and the 
field held up well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are relying on Clark's expectation he can produce and  
deliver,'' Jets president Steve Gutman said after attending the 
two-hour meeting at the sports authority headquarters. ``This is 
the first time he has said he could produce and deliver a quality 
surface into the fall and winter months, which he did say at 
today's meeting. He feels he has developed a technology to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mara said Clark could not convince the Giants and Jets of that  
last year, but he seemed much more confident after some experiments 
at Michigan State last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The grass field may be coming in a year too late for the Jets  
(0-3). Tabbed as serious Super Bowl contenders, they lost 
quarterback Vinny Testaverde (Achilles' tendon) for the season and 
receiver Wayne Chrebet (broken foot) for six weeks to injuries that 
some associated with an artificial field. 
</P>
<P>
	``To a man, all our players prefer to play on grass,'' Mara  
said. ``We're trying to be responsive to their desires. From an 
aesthetic point of view and a traditional point of view, the game 
was meant to be played on grass.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball To Fire 4 Former Umps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball plans to fire four employees  
responsible for evaluating umpires as a part of a reorganization 
designed to rein in umps, two senior baseball officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The four employees, all former umpires, will be let go at the  
end of the season. They include Paul Runge, the National League's 
executive director of umpires and a former president of the 
umpire's union, and three evaluators: Jim Quick and Harry 
Wendelstedt of the NL and Don Denkinger of the American League. 
</P>
<P>
	While the firings weren't announced, they were confirmed by two  
high-ranking baseball officials who spoke on the condition they not 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really know,'' commissioner Bud Selig said. ``I've  
been on other stuff today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said they were not sure if the employees who were  
being fired had been notified. Some of the employees have multiyear 
contracts with the AL and NL, another baseball official said, also 
speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires' union president Jerry Crawford had not heard about the  
four firings. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's true, it's another sad day for baseball,'' Crawford  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alderson, Selig's executive vice president of baseball  
operations, didn't immediately return telephone messages. Runge 
didn't immediately return a message left on his home answering 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, officials in the commissioner's office have  
complained the system of having former umpires evaluate the current 
umps hasn't worked. As part of his plan to eliminate the American 
and National league offices, Selig wants to consolidate the umpires 
from both leagues and have them report to Alderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Nelson, a former San Francisco assistant general manager,  
was hired earlier this year as an assistant to Alderson and 
apparently will become the supervisor of the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Runge, a founder of the Major League Umpires Association, was an  
NL umpire for 24 years before retiring after the 1997 season. 
Wendelstedt (a 33-year veteran), Denkinger (30 years) and Quick (23 
years) retired after last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The sons of Runge and Wendelstedt -- Brian Runge and Harry  
Wendelstedt Jr. -- were among the 25 umpires hired from the minor 
league earlier this month as baseball accepted the resignations of 
22 umps after their mass resignation plan backfired. 
</P>
<P>
	Surviving the purge for now are Marty Springstead, the AL's  
executive director of umpiring; Phil Janssen, the AL coordinator of 
umpire operations; and Tom Lepperd, the NL umpire supervisor.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Criticize Textbooks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The most widely used middle school science  
textbooks flunked an evaluation by the nation's largest 
organization of scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the books cover too many topics and don't do any of them  
well, said the report released Tuesday by the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis said the texts ``include many classroom activities  
that are either irrelevant to learning key science ideas or don't 
help students relate what they are doing to the underlying ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Nelson, director of Project 2061, which evaluated the  
books, said: ``It's a credit to science teachers that their 
students are learning anything at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said that despite the scientific accuracy of a book, ``If  
it doesn't provide teachers and students with the right kinds of 
help in understanding and applying important concepts, then it's 
not doing its job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study rated how well textbooks for the middle grades can  
help students learn key ideas in earth science, life science and 
physical science. 
</P>
<P>
	Each text was evaluated by two independent teams of middle  
school teachers, curriculum specialists and professors of science 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study confirms our worst fears about the materials used  
to educate our children in the critical middle grades,'' said 
Nelson. ``Because textbooks are the backbone of classroom 
instruction, we must demand improvement so that our students can 
acquire the knowledge and skills they will need for more advanced 
learning in high school, college, and the workplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study also looked at three stand-alone units that are not  
part of any textbooks. Developed at Michigan State University and 
the Michigan Department of Education through research aimed at how 
students learn, the units rated much higher than the textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand that these negative evaluations will be  
disturbing for schools using these texts, but teachers should be 
able to use the explanations in the full reports to start looking 
for ways to compensate for the text's shortcomings,'' Nelson said. 
Full reports on each book evaluated are to be released next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Middle school science tests evaluated in the project were  
``Glencoe Science,'' ``MacmillanMcGraw-Hill Science,'' ``Middle 
School Science and Technology,'' ``Prentice Hall Science,'' ``PRIME 
Science,'' ``Science 2000,'' ``Science Insights,'' ``Science 
Interactions,'' ``SciencePlus: Technology and Society'' and 
``Matter and Molecules.''

<HEADLINE> Civil War Sites Under Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANASSAS, Va. (AP) -- Five years after Walt Disney Co. canceled  
plans to build a $650 million theme park near the site of the 
battles of Bull Run, urban sprawl may pose an even greater threat 
to the region's Civil War sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Developers in northern Virginia, driven by the area's booming  
economy, have chewed up land at a frantic pace with new 
condominiums, subdivisions and strip malls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like being nibbled to death by ducks,'' said Kat Imhoff,  
executive director of the Preservation Alliance of Virginia. ``You 
don't even realize the quantity of resources we're losing because 
it's so piecemeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Disney pulled the plug on plans to build an American  
history theme park four miles from Manassas National Battlefield 
Park, where the Confederate and Union armies engaged in the first 
full-scale battle of the Civil War in 1861. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting Disney was tough, but tracking the seemingly endless  
local development proposals may be even more difficult, said 
Elliott Gruber, executive vice president of the Civil War Trust, 
the country's largest Civil War battlefield preservation group. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threats just continue to expand,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Robert Sutton, superintendent of the Manassas park, spends hours  
at zoning and planning board meetings fighting proposals for hotels 
or strip malls that would ruin the views from the battlefield. A 
strip mall was built last year on the park's southern boundary. 
</P>
<P>
	``As more of the region is built up, there will be even more  
pressure'' to develop around the park, Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Lighthizer of the trust says an acre of Civil War  
battlefield is lost somewhere in the United States every 10 
minutes. With that in mind, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and 
others are urging Congress to dedicate permanent funding to buy 
historic lands and open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	When Disney announced in 1993 that it wanted to build a  
3,000-acre park in tiny Haymarket, 35 miles southwest of 
Washington, the plan ignited a national debate over urban sprawl 
and historic preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen Civil War battlefields, 14 historic towns or villages  
and 60 sites on the National Register of Historic Places were 
within a half-hour drive of the Disney site. While the project had 
the support of many elected officials, citizens soured on it when 
they envisioned the traffic, hotels, gas stations, convenience 
stores and fast-food restaurants that would accompany the park. 
</P>
<P>
	The Disney proposal served as a national referendum on urban  
sprawl, said Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for 
Historic Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disney was a watershed event,'' he said. ``There was nothing  
historic on that property, but the collateral development that 
would have sprouted in all directions would have overwhelmed the 
fragile battlefields and the beautiful landscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Urban sprawl is now considered such a threat to quality of life  
that Vice President Al Gore has made it a theme in his campaign for 
the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Disney proposal taught preservationists and  
environmentalists that they had to work more closely together. 
Although preserving history is not the mandate of environmental 
groups, by protecting battlefields they are preventing sprawl and 
its associated pollution and loss of open space. 
</P>
<P>
	``Historic preservation groups have become more concerned about  
road projects and local zoning than ever before,'' said Trip 
Pollard of the Southern Environmental Law Center, who also serves 
on the board of the Historic Preservation Alliance of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone agrees that battlefields should be set aside.  
</P>
<P>
	The federal government's purchase of land for historic  
preservation costs jobs and prevents landowners from fully 
profiting from their properties, said Carl Grenn, past president of 
the Civil War Roundtable of Fredericksburg. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is willing to give up a job because his place of  
employment may be near land once part of the fighting during the 
Civil War?'' Grenn wrote in a letter published in The Free 
Lance-Star of Fredericksburg.

<HEADLINE> White House Plans Medicare Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House officials are laying the  
groundwork for a meeting with key senators in an attempt to salvage 
major Medicare changes, including new prescription drug coverage 
for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief of staff John Podesta last week extended an invitation to  
Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., for all 
members of the committee to meet with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Roth has said that he wants to proceed,'' Podesta  
said. ``We're working now together I think to decide how to proceed 
and on what schedule, but I would anticipate that they would meet 
with the president sometime in the near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Podesta said, he and other administration officials  
are talking with some of the committee's 20 Republican and 
Democratic senators and their staffs individually. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Roth has been working to develop a Medicare proposal  
with broad enough appeal that his committee -- which has a core of 
moderates from both political parties among its members -- could 
pass it this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Although progress has been slow and the clock is running down,  
Roth spokeswoman Tara Bradshaw said, ``He's just going to take it a 
step at a time and take it as far as he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most likely area for progress, however, is not an agreement  
for a new round of sweeping Medicare changes, such as the addition 
of a new prescription drug benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I find it hard to see big changes for Medicare.  
There's a ton of reasons, topped off by lack of time, why it's 
unlikely much is going to happen,'' said John Rother, public policy 
director for the AARP, the nation's largest organization of older 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, lawmakers are closest to a deal that would undo some of  
the changes they made to Medicare as part of the 1997 balanced 
budget act -- putting back some of the billions of dollars cut from 
payments to health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Caregivers from hospitals to nursing homes are complaining that  
their budgets are too tight. And some studies have found evidence 
that Medicare patients with expensive medical problems are having 
trouble getting services such as home health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers from both political parties say they would like to  
further bolster Medicare, the nation's health insurance program for 
the elderly and disabled, in anticipation of baby boomer 
retirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats also agree that senior citizens need  
some help paying for increasingly expensive prescription drugs, 
which Medicare doesn't currently cover. 
</P>
<P>
	However, attempts to reach a deal on the details have taken a  
back seat to a broadly waged political battle over how to spend 
future government surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders want a 10-year tax cut of nearly $800  
billion, about the same amount Clinton wants to pour into Medicare, 
in part for a new prescription drug benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Possibilities for compromise exist, including less generous tax  
cuts or finding other sources of money for Medicare. Clinton, for 
example, has said he does not rule out the possibility of requiring 
wealthier senior citizens to pay more out-of-pocket overall for 
their Medicare coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 2000 presidential and congressional elections and  
advertising generated by special interest groups are encouraging 
stark political divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Television and radio ads sponsored by the AFL-CIO this month  
targeted Republican congressional districts, pitting tax cuts ``for 
big business and the rich'' against Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Citizen's for Better Medicare, a coalition that  
includes the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Pharmaceutical 
Research and Manufacturers of America, has peppered the nation with 
ads featuring a gray-haired bowler, ``Flo,'' who criticizes 
Clinton's Medicare prescription drug proposal as ``big 
government.''

<HEADLINE> New TV Season Opens With Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Whoosh! That breeze you feel from the West Coast  
comes from television executives -- some of them, at least -- 
breathing a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
	TV's fall season is off to a promising start, offering hope to  
broadcast networks numbed by a steady exodus of viewers to cable 
during the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that's most exciting to us is that network  
television did so well,'' said Scott Sassa, NBC's West Coast 
president, looking over the early numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for the six networks during premiere week were  
essentially even with the same week in 1998 -- impressive because 
they are accustomed to losing viewers. First-week ratings last year 
were off 15 percent from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sign that the networks have stopped the bleeding,''  
said Marc Berman, a television analyst for Media Week Online. 
</P>
<P>
	Dramas are hot, both old ones and new ones.  
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``Once and Again'' had the highest debut ratings among  
young adults of any new drama in four years. Created by the same 
team behind ``thirtysomething,'' it stars Sela Ward and Billy 
Campbell as two divorced parents fumbling toward romance. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS debuted two legal dramas, both with women in lead roles.  
Viewers initially embraced both ``Judging Amy,'' a 
``Providence''-like story of a woman returning home from the big 
city to be a judge, and ``Family Law,'' featuring a divorce lawyer 
starting over after her own divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	America appears ready for a Martin Sheen presidency, at least  
based on the numbers for NBC's White House drama, ``West Wing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other hour-long dramas that had good opening numbers include  
NBC's ``Third Watch'' and ``Law and Order: Special Victims Unit,'' 
ABC's ``Snoops'' and CBS's ``Now and Again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The viewers are hungry for decent dramas,'' said Tom DeCabia  
of the media buying firm Schulman/Advanswers NY. ``There haven't 
been any good new ones for awhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some old favorites are also doing well. ``The Practice,'' off  
its second Emmy Award for best drama, had its biggest audience ever 
last week, while ``Law and Order'' continues to be a commercial and 
critical hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite TV's rush to serve youth, early returns this season show  
more adult-oriented fare catching on. CBS is finding that young 
people accept shows like ``Family Law'' more readily than older 
people become fans of youthful shows, said the network's top 
researcher, David Poltrack. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're reaching too low,'' he said. ``If you go after  
teen-agers, you may get young adults to watch, but you're not going 
to get people over age 35.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While dramas are up, comedies are down, with Fox's ``Action,'' a  
critically acclaimed show with Jay Mohr as a tart-tongued movie 
executive, shaping up as the season's most spectacular failure. 
</P>
<P>
	A glut of comedies in recent years, too many modeled after NBC's  
successful ``Friends,'' has turned viewers off, DeCabia said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cerebral comedies, things like `Frasier,' are doing well,  
but I think the audience is getting tired of the dumb comedies,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some comedies, however, have caught on with a little time.  
Relatively new shows, like NBC's ``Will &AMP; Grace'' and CBS's 
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' are doing very well. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is praying for continued improvement from the Emmy-winning  
``Ally McBeal,'' which hasn't started its new season yet. In fact, 
the network's general strategy of waiting out its rivals to start 
the season is risky; Fox's ratings last week were down 9 percent 
from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN, on the other hand, is a small-scale success story with  
numbers up 39 percent from last year -- mostly because of its new 
Thursday night professional wrestling show, ``WWF Smackdown!''

<HEADLINE> NY Post Names Chandler Publisher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ken Chandler has been named publisher of the New  
York Post, retaining his title as editor-in-chief. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch said Chandler, 52, replaces  
Martin Singerman, who is stepping down after 5 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am enormously grateful to Martin Singerman for his  
stewardship of the Post,'' Murdoch said Wednesday. ``We are lucky 
to have Ken Chandler, who has both the skills and the stature to 
lead the paper forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Xana Antunes, Post deputy editor, will assume the title of  
acting editor, running the newsroom's day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler joined the Post in 1978 and rose to managing editor  
before taking over as editor of the Boston Herald in 1986. In 1993, 
Chandler went back to the Post as editor-in-chief after Murdoch 
reacquired the paper. He first worked for Murdoch at the London Sun 
in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an exciting time to be taking the helm at the Post,''  
said Chandler, referring to the paper's current management team and 
its plans to implement color presses. 
</P>
<P>
	Singerman has held a variety of positions with Murdoch's media  
interests, including a six-year reign as president of News America 
Publishing, where he headed a group of 25 newspapers and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post, with a circulation of more than 437,000, is the  
nation's 14th largest paper, according to figures released last 
year by the Audit Bureau of Circulation.

<HEADLINE> Concrete Scribblers Taken to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- Writing in wet cement may seem like child's  
play, but it landed three young scribes in court. 
</P>
<P>
	An 11-year-old girl and two boys, ages 12 and 13, were charged  
Tuesday with unlawful destruction of city property. The punishment 
so far has been just a stern lecture. 
</P>
<P>
	Roanoke Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court Judge Joseph P.  
Bounds said he'll take all three cases under advisement for a year 
and then decide if punishment is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The three had carved their first names into nine newly-laid  
cement sidewalk panels last June. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's parents called the issue innocent child's play.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're making her out to be a bank robber or something,''  
said Joseph Russell, the stepfather of the 11-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dan Bowman, who discovered the damaged cement near his house  
and called police, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's destruction of public property. It's an eyesore  
for one thing,'' said Bowman, 61. ``The city decided to replace 
that sidewalk and paid for it with my tax dollars, your tax dollars 
and the parents of those kids' tax dollars. I don't appreciate it 
being defaced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bounds said the city should decide if the children should pay an  
estimated $3,000 in restitution for replacing the 30-foot section 
of sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that the scribble squabble made it all the way to court  
outraged some Roanoke residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's just silly,'' said Lawrence Berndt, 23, a waiter.  
``This thing should have been settled at home with the parents.''

<HEADLINE> Pippen Rips Barkley in Words War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) -- The war of words between Scottie Pippen  
and Charles Barkley has escalated. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen unleashed a torrent of criticism at his teammate on  
Wednesday, calling Barkley ``selfish'' and ``fat' and saying he 
doesn't have the desire to win an NBA championship. Pippen was 
responding to criticism initiated by Barkley, who was angered that 
Pippen said he'd welcome a trade to the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably should've listened to Michael (Jordan) a year ago  
when he said that Charles will never win a championship because he 
doesn't show any dedication,'' Pippen told ESPN. ``He's a very 
selfish guy. He doesn't show the desire to want to win. That's my 
reason for wanting to get away from playing with him -- because he 
just doesn't show the dedication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley said he sacrificed to make salary cap room on the  
Rockets for Pippen, who signed a five-year, $67.2 million contract 
before last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to want to leave after one year, it disappointed me  
greatly,'' Barkley said Tuesday. ``The Rockets went out of their 
way to get Scottie, and the fans have treated him well, so I was 
just disappointed in him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was offering no apologies Wednesday and reiterated that  
he wants to play elsewhere, preferably for the Lakers and Phil 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't give Charles Barkley an apology at gunpoint,''  
Pippen said, never raising his voice. ``He can never expect an 
apology from me. ... If anything, he owes me an apology for coming 
to play with his sorry fat butt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very shocked to see what type of player he was by  
spending half a season with him,'' he said of Barkley. ``I'm a guy 
that's dedicated to winning, and I put out a lot of effort on the 
court. I expect that from my teammates, especially from a guy of 
his caliber. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charles is definitely one of the guys that needs to show more  
leadership for this ball club to be successful, and he don't show 
that to me. ... He feels that if he gets 10 rebounds and 
double-figure points, he's done a good job. But that's not what the 
game's about. It's about defending, being professional and coming 
to work every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen said one of the reasons he wants to play for Jackson is  
because he longs to return to the system in which they won six NBA 
titles together in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to play for Phil,'' Pippen said. ``(But) I'm not  
demanding a trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Chronicle and Portland Oregonian, citing  
unidentified league sources, reported today that the Rockets and 
Trail Blazers were discussing a trade that would send Pippen to 
Portland for Kelvin Cato, Stacey Augmon, Walt Williams, Ed Gray, 
Brian Shaw and Carlos Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen averaged 14.5 points last season, his lowest since his  
rookie year, and shot a career-low 43.2 percent. He also averaged 
6.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Finally Sign Kasparaitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Darius Kasparaitis, the most physical  
defenseman on a team better known for goal scorers, reached terms 
Wednesday with the Pittsburgh Penguins on a $3 million, two-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins owner Mario Lemieux suggested Kasparaitis' contract,  
worth $1.4 million this season and $1.6 million in 2000-01, puts 
the payroll slightly over budget. But he said general manager Craig 
Patrick would adjust it as the season progresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to get him signed before the season started,''  
Lemieux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis, who had reconstructive knee surgery in March, said  
his knee has been fine for months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy and relieved we were able to finally sign Darius,''  
Patrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis, a restricted free agent, spent more than a month  
negotiating the contract. The talks nearly broke down several times 
and Kasparaitis, who is from Lithuania, nearly returned to Europe 
to work out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparaitis, a former New York Islander who still lives on Long  
Island, has not skated much recently because he could not book ice 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I'm happy to be back because this is my job and I'm  
glad we got it done before the season started,'' Kasparaitis said. 
``Now, it's time for me to get back in shape and get ready to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Kasparaitis first injured his knee in a  
preseason game more than a year ago. Despite being urged to undergo 
surgery, he returned to play 48 games before reinjuring the knee 
March 5. He had surgery to repair an anterior cruciate ligament 
three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	He has not practiced with the Penguins since March, so he will  
not play in Dallas or, possibly, in the first couple of regular 
season games. But the Penguins play only five times in the first 
three weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked at the schedule, and it looks good for me not to miss  
many games,'' he said. ``I have plenty of time to get skating with 
the team and get in shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins acquired Kasparaitis and Andreas Johansson from the  
Islanders on Nov. 17, 1996 for forward Bryan Smolinski. Kasparaitis 
has seven goals, 28 points, 281 penalty minutes and a plus-39 
rating in 186 games with Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	After re-signing Kasparaitis, the Penguins assigned defenseman  
Sven Butenschon to Wilkes-Barre-Scranton (AHL).

<HEADLINE> Disneyland Paris Plans Second Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Euro Disney plans to build a second theme park next  
to its Disneyland Paris park site to give visitors a backstage look 
at the movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Les studios Disney'' (The Disney Studios) is set to open in  
the spring of 2002 at the Magic Kingdom theme park and will cost 
about $650 million, the comoany announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the new theme park, actors will come out from behind the  
screen to meet the audience. Themes will comes from French, 
European and Hollywood cinema, cartoons and television, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Euro Disney said it expects an estimated 4.2 million visitors  
annually once the park is fully operational in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had said in January that it had started discussions  
with French authorities about a 1987 agreement, which had mentioned 
building a second theme park at its site east of Paris before 2011. 
</P>
<P>
	Euro Disney, 39 percent owned by the Walt Disney Co., opened in  
April 1992 to widespread concern that American-style family 
entertainment would not catch on in the Old World. 
</P>
<P>
	Some financial analysts worried that Europeans would balk at the  
prices. Others worried that Paris's cool weather and frequent 
showers would be incompatible with a theme park that made its 
fortune under the sunny skies of California and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	But Disneyland Paris, which posted losses during its first two  
years, proved itself in 1995 by posting profits a full year ahead 
of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The park's directors saved Disneyland Paris with a complex  
restructuring of debts, cuts in ticket prices, attractive 
hotel-park packages and tight cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance seemed to level off in 1998, falling to 12.51 million  
visitors from 12.57 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the slight drop in attendance, profits were up 34  
percent from the previous year. Net income in 1998 was 290 million 
francs, or $48 million, up from 217 million francs in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	And the park's hotels, half empty during the park's first year,  
had more than 80 percent occupancy during 1998.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Tokyo Stocks Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar edged higher against the yen  
Wednesday, as Tokyo share prices dipped on profit-taking in 
relatively quiet trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar bought 106.90 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange  
market late Wednesday, up 0.38 yen from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 43.42 points,  
or 0.25 percent, to close at 17,282.28. On Tuesday, the average 
closed up 504.64 points, or 3.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback traded in a narrow range between 106.11 yen and  
107.24 yen as investors remained cautious over possible central 
bank action to stop the dollar's slide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan disappointed markets last week by refusing to  
yield to pressure from the Japanese government and inject money 
into the banking system as a way of easing interest rates and 
weakening the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	But hopes for action to press the yen down were renewed after a  
weekend meeting in Washington, where financial officials from the 
Group of Seven nations said they shared Japan's concern over the 
yen's rapid rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Zembei Mizoguchi, chief of the international bureau at Japan's  
Finance Ministry, reiterated Wednesday that the ministry will 
continue to carefully watch market moves. But he said it was too 
early to say whether the yen's recent strengthening has stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	An excessively high yen could negatively affect Japanese  
exporters by reducing profits they earn from overseas sales. That 
in turn could threaten a fledgling economic recovery in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In the stock market, Tokyo share prices fell slightly on  
profit-taking as investors locked in profits following a surge in 
the stock market the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks also came under moderate selling following an  
overnight decline on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial 
average was down 27.86 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,275.53 on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders say the market will remain cautious until the release of  
the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment on 
Monday and the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy board meeting, also 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wait-and-see attitude is very strong,'' said Masatoshi  
Sato, manager at Kankaku Securities, who added the market's 
cautious stance Wednesday was reflected in the relatively thin 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazunori Jinnai, general manager at Daiwa Securities SB Capital  
Markets, said a better-than-expected tankan could send the Nikkei 
as high as 17,800. However, the market's gains are likely to be 
capped by renewed worries about a resurgence of the yen against the 
dollar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker-than-expected tankan, meanwhile, may push the market  
down to around the 16,800 level, said Kankaku's Sato. But beyond 
that point, the Nikkei average should be supported by hopes for 
looser monetary policy by the Bank of Japan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Stock Price Index, covering all first section issues,  
fell 11.18 points to 1458.11. 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners outnumbered advancers 801 to 404, while 124 issues  
remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange was  
estimated at 373.49 million shares, higher than 350.51 million 
shares Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 112.52 yen, up from  
111.61 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.6800 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.7150 percent. Its 
price rose 0.30 point to 100.17.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Leader Says Relations Bad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Official relations between Judaism and America's  
largest Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention, 
are the worst they have been in decades, a Jewish leader says. 
</P>
<P>
	The rift with America's largest Protestant group widened when  
its 1996 annual meeting issued a resolution urging Baptists to 
``direct our energies and resources'' to evangelism among Jews, 
said Rabbi A. James Rudin, the interreligious affairs director of 
the American Jewish Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, Jewish leaders were angered when the Baptist  
foreign mission board issued a guide asking church members to pray 
for conversion of Jews to Christianity during this month's High 
Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, and Yom Kippur, 
the Day of Atonement. 
</P>
<P>
	Other U.S. Christian denominations have downplayed or repudiated  
such evangelism. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little formal discussion between Southern Baptists and  
Jews at the national level, said Rudin, who was raised among 
Baptists in northern Virginia and has held many talks with 
conservative evangelicals in his 31 years as a participant in 
efforst at dialogue with Christians. ``They're out to convert us, 
so what's there to converse about?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed, however, that there is great variety among the 15.9  
million Southern Baptists and their 41,000 congregations. Many have 
excellent relations with Jews in local communities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prayer call was ``an arrogant way of denigrating the Jewish  
religion and the sacredness of our High Holy Days,'' Abraham 
Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a 
letter to the Rev. Paige Patterson of Wake Forest, N.C., president 
of the Southern Baptist Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Foxman said such efforts invite ``theological hatred'' of the  
sort that characterized Europe for centuries and prepared the way 
for the Nazi Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson responded last week with a reference to Jesus: ``I  
really have no alternative except to follow the advice of the Jew 
who died for me on the cross.'' He told Foxman that Baptists have 
the right to profess their beliefs so long as nobody is coerced. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Foxman replied that the Baptists' ``theological  
arrogance'' had been followed by an ``arrogant response'' from 
Patterson that expressed no remorse over the prayer call. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson did not return calls for comment Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Rudin said Patterson spoke last week to a New York City  
conference on Jewish evangelism, attended by hundreds of 
conservative evangelicals and sponsored by Chosen People Ministries 
of Charlotte, N.C. The appearance linked the top leadership of the 
Baptist denomination with the ``Hebrew Christian'' or ``Jews for 
Jesus'' movement that has upset Jewish organizations for decades, 
Rudin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders in Judaism are especially offended by ``messianic''  
congregations that believe Jesus is God and the Messiah, but use 
Jewish rituals, practices and terminology to attract Jewish 
converts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbis consider such methods deceitful; the messianics reply  
that they are expressing their ethnic identity. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the Paige Pattersons are asking us to do is abandon the  
eternal covenant of faith made at Mount Sinai,'' Rudin said. ``That 
is something we cannot, will not, ever do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is as old as Christianity itself. At the start,  
virtually all Christians were Jews. The first great evangelist, 
Paul the Apostle, was Jewish and wrote that the gospel should go 
``to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudin said Jews have no quarrel with a Southern Baptist  
evangelist like the Rev. Billy Graham, who preaches conversion to 
everybody and does not target Jews as a group.

<HEADLINE> Docs Skeptical of New Heart Lasers </HEADLINE>

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Newly approved laser drills appear to relieve  
chest pain in heart patients, but a medical journal critique from 
cardiologists questions whether the benefits are an illusion. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique, called transmyocardial laser revascularization,

	The approval was based on data from two large studies that are  
being published in today's issue of the New England Journal of 
Medicine. The journal also carries an unusually negative editorial 
about the studies and the laser technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique uses a laser to drill 10 to 50 holes in the heart.  
The two studies, using the competing laser instruments, both found 
that three-quarters of severely impaired patients improve 
significantly after the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the editorial -- written by two cardiologists from the  
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas -- raises 
the possibility that the benefits were imaginary -- a placebo 
effect, as doctors call it. 
</P>
<P>
	``These apparently impressive results must be viewed with  
caution,'' wrote Drs. Richard Lange, Southwestern's director of 
cardiac catheterization, and L. David Hillis, vice chairman of 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	In the studies, half the patients got laser treatment, while the  
rest received standard medicines. Among the Texas doctors' 
concerns: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Patients knew they had gotten the laser, so their expectations  
of benefit may have made them believe their chest pain had eased. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Doctors who performed the study assessed the patients'  
conditions. These ``presumably enthusiastic'' physicians may have 
been more likely to see benefit in those getting the laser. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Patients in the group getting medicine alone were allowed to  
receive the laser if they failed to improve. This arrangement 
``implies a bias on the part of the investigators'' that the laser 
treatment was better. 
</P>
<P>
	-- No one can convincingly explain why the treatment works. One  
theory -- that it creates new blood channels -- has been discredited. 
Another is that it destroys nerves in the heart, so patients feel 
less pain. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Lange said he thought the lasers should be used  
only in studies, not routinely on heart patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Keith Allen of St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis, who  
directed one of the studies, responded: ``I've heard it all before. 
All you have to do is interview patient after patient who had this 
procedure and see the effect and realize there is more than a 
placebo effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen also noted the benefits of the laser lasted more than a  
year. By then, a placebo effect would almost certainly have worn 
off.

<HEADLINE> Gore Moves Campaign to Tenn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP ) --Vice President Al Gore, acknowledging a  
``hard, tough fight'' for a presidential nomination many once 
thought would be easily his, said today he is moving his campaign 
to Tennessee and challenging opponent Bill Bradley to a series of 
debates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to take this campaign for the presidency directly to  
the grass roots and directly to the American people,'' he told a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was indicative of the concern within the Gore campaign  
about the growing threat from Bradley and the perception among many 
Democrats that the vice president cannot beat Republican 
front-runner George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Tennessee senator, who grew up in Washington, said he  
is taking his campaign ``lock, stock and barrel'' out of the 
nation's capital and to downtown Nashville, where he will open his 
new headquarters in a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also said he wanted to debate Bradley ``a lot'' -- on issues  
such as health care, the environment and crime -- but only after a 
period of time during which both candidates can consult experts and 
``refine'' their policy positions. Gore planned to recast his 
campaign style so that he will meet voters in small groups to talk 
about issues and the nation's future. ``This is a format that, 
well, it's as old as our republic and older,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to fight my heart out for every single vote.''  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement from his West Orange, N.J., headquarters, Bradley  
sounded more like the incumbent than the insurgent. He made clear 
he will campaign on his own timeline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't made it a habit to respond to every change of tactic  
by the vice president's campaign,'' Bradley said. He added that he 
has already accepted a number of joint appearances with Gore, 
including an Oct. 27 town meeting in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's senior adviser, Anita Dunn, said that when Gore aides  
call with a debate proposal, ``We'll be happy to have that 
conversation but as you know, we are in a period in this campaign 
where Bill Bradley is laying out his specific proposals for the 
American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One intended result of the Gore campaign's move will be a  
winnowing of the staff, which Gore has come to realize is too big, 
too expensive and too slow to react, an aide said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign chairman Tony Coelho and chief strategist Carter Eskew  
will move to Nashville, but it is unclear how many members of his 
senior staff will follow. The vice president's top advisers expect 
the staff to be reduced through attrition, because many members 
will not want to move to Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	The aide said it may be made clear to others that there is no  
reason for them to move. 
</P>
<P>
	The shakeup sent tremors throughout Gore's staff at the White  
House and at his campaign offices in downtown Washington. Many 
aides, who had been worried about their jobs because of sagging 
poll numbers and weak fund raising, were caught off guard, although 
the makings of the move apparently had been under way for a couple 
of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving the campaign outside Washington was an idea pushed by  
President Clinton. The idea gained credence as Bradley began 
closing the gap on Gore in key primary states. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore declined a question today on Bradley's apparent strength,  
saying only that a tightening of the race was inevitable. ``There 
are only two candidates. You've got Pepsi and Coke,'' the vice 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move also will help distance Gore from Clinton, whose  
scandal-plagued administration has had a negative pull on the vice 
president's poll numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I welcome the new shape of this campaign,'' Gore said. ``This  
is a hard, tough fight and I'm going to fight my heart out for 
every single vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said: ``I'm taking this campaign to my roots.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Every election I have won has been headquartered in  
Tennessee,'' he said. ``Fourteen times I have gone to the voters of 
Tennessee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's supporters think of him as strong in debates, recalling  
what they considered a masterful performance against Ross Perot 
when they went head to head on TV over the North American Free 
Trade Agreement in November 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	His aides also believe he is ahead of Bradley on offering  
substantive policy positions, although the former New Jersey 
senator fought back on that front Tuesday with a detailed health 
coverage plan that -- unlike Gore's so far -- has a price tag and 
proposals on how to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	If Bradley accepts the debate challenge, that could ``lift our  
democracy,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The news of Gore's campaign shakeup came one day before both  
candidates must disclose their fund-raising totals. The Gore 
campaign fears that the reports will show Bradley is doing as good 
a job as Gore in gathering campaign cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore would not reveal his tally but said today, ``Well before  
the end of this year, we will have raised the maximum amount. 
That's not a concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been slipping in polls. In two early primary states,  
New Hampshire and New York, Bradley has pulled into a virtual dead 
heat with the vice president.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Convicted in Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The man the United Nations put in charge of  
travel arrangements for U.N. peacekeepers in the Balkans was 
convicted of stealing $800,000 from the organization by submitting 
false invoices. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Kim, the former U.N. chief of travel and traffic in  
Zagreb, Croatia, was convicted Tuesday in federal court on five 
counts of conspiracy and wire fraud. He faces five years in prison 
for each count and a fine of as much as twice the amount he stole. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim was responsible for making arrangements for U.N.  
peacekeepers traveling to Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1995 to '98. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, several airlines would waive baggage fees for  
peacekeepers. But federal prosecutors said Kim and travel agency 
Zagrebtours, based in Zagreb, submitted false invoices for excess 
baggage charges of $400,000, which the United Nations paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim also was convicted of conspiring with a former Air France  
employee to submit other inflated invoices totaling $400,000, also 
paid by the U.N. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Attorney's office said Kim tried to conceal the scheme  
by directing subordinates to destroy documents and lie to U.N. 
investigators.

<HEADLINE> Quake Disrupts Semiconductor Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The earthquake that devastated areas of  
Taiwan is sending tremors through the toy and personal computer 
industries, which both rely on Taiwanese semiconductors for 
products ranging from personal computers to interactive Furby 
dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, Christmas sales are unlikely to be affected  
because most retailers already have stocked holiday goods. Personal 
computers might be an exception, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	A prolonged disruption in the supply of memory chips and other  
computer circuitry could push PC prices up or force manufacturers 
to give shoppers less for their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Taiwan's semiconductor plants were spared serious  
structural damage when the 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck on Sept. 
21. But the jolt knocked out power for more than a week, and some 
sensitive equipment used in etching circuits onto silicon wafers 
was damaged or thrown out of alignment. 
</P>
<P>
	A plant that manufactures chips used in Hasbro's popular Furby  
dolls was knocked out of commission. So were factories that 
manufacture technology to work with Advanced Micro Devices chips -- 
a leading low-cost alternative to Intel Corp. semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD executives were still unsure when the plants might be back  
in production. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're gathering information. It's still an incomplete  
picture,'' said spokesman Scott Allen. ``We're potentially looking 
at an interruption in supply. Past that I don't think I can supply 
further detail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen declined to comment on how the disruption might affect  
revenues, saying federal securities regulations prohibited the 
company from discussing its financial performance immediately 
before the scheduled release of third-quarter results next 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple Computer Inc. manfactures its iBook and Powerbook portable  
computers in Taiwan. There was no structural damage to the 
factories, said spokeswoman Rhona Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't see any immediate impact on our business, but it's  
too early to fully assess the situation,'' she read from a company 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Kwatinez, an analyst with CS First Boston, estimated  
that Apple stands to lose about $50 million in the current quarter 
because it won't be able to produce enough iBook and Powerbook 
machines. He expects the company to make up the lost revenue, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens is they'll get it back next quarter, so it's not  
exactly tragedy,'' he said. ``IBooks have a lot of pent up 
demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan accounts for about 10 percent of semiconductors used  
worldwide, plus about 60 percent of the motherboards, the main 
circuit board for chips, analysts said. Taiwan also is a key 
supplier of memory chips, flat-panel screens used in notebook 
computers, small microprocessors used in toys and other consumer 
electronics, and core-logic chipsets, the chips that link the 
processor to the rest of the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This an important moment because Taiwan has become an  
important part of overall semiconductor production and the massive 
nature of this quake,'' said Jim Handy, an analyst with Dataquest 
Inc. ``The biggest problem right now is nobody knows how much 
damage is done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies, however, already were warning investors that the  
earthquake may hurt revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Genesis Microchip, the Canadian maker of semiconductors for  
flat-panel screens and home theater equipment, said in a statement 
that earnings in third and fourth quarters may be down. Genesis 
shares fell 11 percent Wednesday, or by $2.12 1/2 to $16.50 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is we believe there will be some short-term  
negative impact on our business as a result of the earthquake,'' 
said Paul M. Russo, the company's chairman and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer Co. announced that it expects  
to lose $88.2 million in sales. Insurance will cover about $57 
million of the loss, the company said in a statement. Taiwan 
Semiconductor shares rose 5 percent, or by $1.50, to $31 on the New 
York Stock Exchange Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Power was restored on Monday to the plant that makes chips for  
Furbies, handheld electronic games and other toys. Executives there 
also were still assessing the quake's impact, said Lana Simon, a 
spokeswoman for Tiger Electronics Inc., the Chicago-based Hasbro 
subsidiary that makes Furbies. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake was not expected to affect the availability of Furby  
dolls during the Christmas sales season, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake could have some impact on the availability of low-end  
personal computers, those prices in the $500 to $1,000 range, 
during the Christmas season if Taiwan plants are slow to get back 
into full production, Handy said. That could push retail prices up. 
A more likely scenario would be for manufacturers to offer less and 
keep prices down. That might mean less advanced graphics 
capabilities or smaller monitors, Handy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personal computers tend to stay within margins of prices,'' he  
said. ``If (chip) prices were to skyrocket, features of the PC 
wouldn't grow at the rate they have been growing.''

<HEADLINE>  Air Drops Halted in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Air drops to feed tens of thousands of  
starving East Timorese were halted today after a 3-year-old boy was 
hit by a falling box and his leg had to be amputated. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in a sign of the violence that has torn apart East  
Timor, the charred bodies of 10 men were found in a pickup truck 
near the airport outside Dili, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. investigators surrounded the grisly find, and said they  
believed the killings took place before the arrival of the 
multinational peace force nine days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest group of bodies to be found so far amid  
reports that hundreds, perhaps thousands, were killed by militias, 
backed by the Indonesian military, angry that East Timorese had 
voted Aug. 30 to break away from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia today rejected plans for a U.N. fact-finding mission  
into the reported atrocities, saying foreign experts could instead 
join its own human rights probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations' main human rights body voted Monday to  
establish an international inquiry for East Timor -- a possible 
first step toward setting up a war crimes tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	On the ground in East Timor, the cancelation of food drops  
forced aid workers to resort to convoys on roads through the 
countryside, where militias are believed to still be lurking. 
</P>
<P>
	Guarded by members of a 200-strong deployment of the elite  
Gurkhas, a convoy ventured into the region where attackers ambushed 
and killed a nine-member aid mission led by two Roman Catholic nuns 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid organizations have expressed frustration over what they say  
is the slow pace of returning security to East Timor and a looming 
humanitarian disaster if thousands of refugees who took to the 
hills during the militias' rampage don't get food soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But the troops remained stretched thin at only two-thirds of  
their authorized 7,500-member strength. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eastern districts, pro-independence guerrillas have taken  
control of areas abandoned by the Indonesian military but not yet 
reached by the multinational force, guerrilla leader Taur Matan 
Ruak said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrillas were fighting militia members and Indonesian soldiers  
for the countryside surrounding the southern coastal town of 
Betano, Ruak said, speaking by telephone from his mountain base 
southeast of Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	The air drops, which scattered some 28,000 food packets a day,  
were halted after the child was hit by a box Tuesday and Australian 
surgeons had to amputate his lower leg, said U.N. humanitarian 
coordination spokeswoman Afia Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots for the private airline conducting the drops also needed  
a rest after seven straight days of work, Ali said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials could not say if the flights would resume, but  
Ali said aid workers will shift to a land-based distribution system 
now that more refugees are coming down from the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	They will also distribute rice instead of the high-protein  
biscuits that airplanes had been showering over the countryside. 
The biscuits apparently didn't sit well with the East Timorese, who 
are accustomed to a high-starch diet, Ali said. 
</P>
<P>
	The return of thousands of people from their hideouts in the  
hills is bringing life back to the capital's once-deserted streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Australian soldiers came and they told us, `You can come  
down now. We can guarantee your safety,' '' said Ito Borges, who 
returned Tuesday after two weeks in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Borges was at a French military hospital, helping to tend five  
East Timorese who said Indonesian soldiers shot them Sunday when 
they ventured out of hiding to get rice for their families. Six 
people were killed in the shooting at a roadblock, the East 
Timorese said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tent cities are springing up in Dili as refugees scrounge  
plastic sheeting and scrap wood to build makeshift shelters in the 
courtyards of their burned houses. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the stronghold of the foreign troops was far from  
stable. Fire gutted an army barracks today, apparently the latest 
arson in pro-Indonesian forces' scorched-earth withdrawal from East 
Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight, a warehouse was looted of three tons of rice by  
unknown culprits, possibly hungry returnees, U.N. World Food 
Program spokeswoman Abby Spring said. 
</P>
<P>
	Western districts are expected to be the key scene of contention  
as pro-Indonesian militias retreat toward Indonesian-controlled 
West Timor. Up to 200,000 East Timorese are believed to be crowded 
into camps in West Timor, reportedly forced to accompany the 
retreating militias and now at their mercy.

<HEADLINE> Group Seeks New Equity Rights Act / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As Sam Beard describes it, money is the ticket  
to the greatest show on earth, that show being the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let money make money for everyone,'' he says, sounding like a  
cross between a philanthropist and a day trader who had just hit 
the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
	His spiel cannot be interrupted. ``Money is an economic tool,''  
he stresses, and ``we need to put this tool into the hands of all 
Americans'' because this, he announces, ``is the age of equity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beard is neither day trader nor philanthropist -- he founded and  
heads a nonprofit organization, Economic Security 2000, and he is 
speaking about revamping Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people do it more relentlessly, as Beard has demonstrated in  
visits to 50 cities a year, in broadcasts over 2,000 radio and TV 
outlets, and in visits to at least 140 editorial boards. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sense, it's an old story. Beard is an idea man who, mainly  
through the not-for-profit National Development Council, which he 
founded, influenced administrations as far back as Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the council, of which he is now chairman, Beard and his  
staff sought economic opportunities in the slums, and by some 
estimates raised $30 billion and created more than a million jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	He delivers his ideas apolitically to both the right and the  
left, and to leaders of foundations and large corporations. He 
squeezes funds from both and convinces them to sit on his board. 
</P>
<P>
	He has his argument down pat. There are two pillars of financial  
success, wages and savings, he says. Most Americans, as many as 
two-thirds, rely on wages alone, having no meaningful savings. 
</P>
<P>
	However, one-third of all income in this country comes from  
savings and existing wealth, which in turn create more income and 
wealth. Wage earners are largely excluded from this income source. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad enough, says Beard, when so much wealth is being created  
through stock investments made from savings and existing wealth. 
But, he says the disparity between rich and poor is now widening. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom 50 percent of Americans own just 2 percent of the  
country's wealth,'' he continues, citing a 1995 Rand Institute 
study from which he also gleans this nugget: 
</P>
<P>
	``The financial wealth of the top 10 percent of households is  
4,653 times greater than the financial wealth of the bottom 20 
percent,'' a gap, he suggests, that is widened by investments. 
</P>
<P>
	That this should continue, he contends, is senseless and  
unnecessary, since a worker earning just $20,000 a year already 
sets aside $2,480 for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The big divide widens rather than closes, however, because that  
$2,480 isn't invested. Were it put into securities, he says, the 
$20,000 worker could retire with more than $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democratize the earning power of equity,'' says Beard. Grow  
the middle class. Make its members stakeholders in prosperity. 
``Owning money has become the new breakthrough economic tool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beard and his organization preach this gospel with a staff of  
six based in Washington, and with volunteers in 88 cities in 41 
states, zealously believing they'll fulfill their mission by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic Security 2000 proposes a new ``Equity Rights Act'' that  
would set aside and invest a minimum of $500 a year into 
individually owned savings accounts for all Americans. It would be 
expanded from there. 
</P>
<P>
	Itsagenda also includes a broader savings policy for higher  
education, home ownership and business ownership, all of which 
contribute to and reflect participation in economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's arguments, developed over the past five years, are  
woven through with lesser themes built around what they view is the 
inevitable demise of the existing Social Security structure.

<HEADLINE> GOP Judge Handles Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican appointee on the federal appeals  
court is presiding over a formal complaint about the handling of 
criminal cases against Clinton friends Webster Hubbell and Charlie 
Trie. 
</P>
<P>
	Appeals Judge Stephen Williams, appointed by President Reagan in  
1986, wrote in a Sept. 3 letter that a ``judicial misconduct 
complaint'' filed by a conservative group, Judicial Watch, ``has 
been assigned to me, as acting chief judge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' letter did not explain why he was handling the  
conservative group's complaint rather than the chief judge on the 
appeals court, Harry Edwards, a 1980 Carter appointee. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative group filed the complaint after the chief judge  
of the federal district court here, Norma Holloway Johnson, 
bypassed the normal system of randomly assigning cases and sent 
prosecutions of Hubbell and campaign fund-raising figure Trie to 
appointees of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also complained about meetings of Clinton appointees  
on the district court and whether various courses of action were 
discussed in an effort to obtain favorable results for the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative group had complained earlier to Edwards, who

are seeking.''

	Williams said in his letter that ``I am aware of Chief Judge  
Edwards' earlier correspondence on this matter and regret the need 
to ask for further clarification'' with further details.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic Readies Long-distance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's largest local phone company, Bell  
Atlantic, asked federal regulators Wednesday to let it enter the 
New York long-distance market. By year's end, it could be the first 
regional Bell company to offer long-distance service to its local 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, which serves the Northeast and mid-Atlantic  
states, filed its application with the Federal Communications 
Commission detailing the steps it has taken to open its local phone 
business in New York to competition. That's the standard the 
company must meet, under the 1996 Telecommunications Act, before 
regulators will let it provide long-distance in its region. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Bell companies have tried this before, without success.  
But Bell Atlantic says its case is different. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have every confidence that we've done everything that's  
been required,'' Ivan Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic's chairman, told a 
news conference. ``The market is very competitive and irreversibly 
open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic officials pledged that if approved, consumers  
would benefit with more choices and lower costs, gaining savings 
from having a number of services -- local, long-distance and 
wireless -- provided by one company, said James Cullen, Bell 
Atlantic's chief operating officer. He said the company also would 
reach out to customers who make fewer long-distance calls, offering 
them plans with no minimum usage fee. 
</P>
<P>
	The company can deliver long-distance service over its existing  
network of phone lines going into local customers' homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic hopes to have 25 percent of residential and  
business customers in the $8 billion-a-year New York long-distance 
market in five years. The company eventually hopes to offer 
long-distance service in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New Jersey 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard, who met with Seidenberg on Wednesday,  
said, ``I look forward to the day when a Bell company is able to 
demonstrate that it has met the test of opening up its local market 
as a condition to being able to offer long-distance service in its 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has 90 days to render a decision. It must give  
substantial consideration to a Justice Department evaluation, and 
the New York Public Service Commission, which has been actively 
involved in the process, can weigh in. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the difference between Bell Atlantic's application  
and past attempts by Bell companies is a 2 1/2-year process the 
company underwent to demonstrate its local market is open to 
competition. An independent third-party consultant conducted tests 
to see whether Bell Atlantic's systems can handle orders sent by 
competitors for switching customers to other local phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests showed Bell Atlantic successfully processed the vast  
majority of orders, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It requires that kind of effort to build the confidence that  
they are meeting the requirement for parity,'' said Mark Cooper of 
the Consumer Federation of America. He stopped short of endorsing 
the application. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's competitive market -- with companies such as AT&AMP;T  
intending to deliver local service over its cable lines -- also will 
work in Bell Atlantic's favor, said Ragu Gurumurthy of Booz-Allen &AMP; 
Hamilton in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prospect of it being successful is very high,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But New York rivals, particularly long-distance companies  
getting into the local market, say Bell Atlantic still has glitches 
when it tries to switch customers to competing local phone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's critical that these orders be handled smoothly and  
accurately ... anything less means customers will be afraid or 
unable to choose a competitor,'' said Jim Cicconi, AT&AMP;T's general 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Some consumer advocates said the application may be premature.  
</P>
<P>
	``Bell Atlantic still hasn't passed the test to show it can  
fully meet consumers' needs when it switches (local) phone 
companies,'' said Richard Kirsch of Citizen Action of New York.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits 62nd Home Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire tied Sammy Sosa for the major  
league home-run lead, hitting his 62nd Wednesday in the fourth 
inning of a doubleheader opener against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit a 1-0 pitch from Matt Clement over the center-field  
wall for a two-run homer, a drive estimated at 462 feet. The ball 
cleared the shrubbery beyond the wall, then bounced back onto the 
field. Center fielder Ruben Rivera threw it back over the wall, 
leading to a scramble for the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The home run was the 519th of McGwire's career and his second in  
three days, leaving him two behind Ted Williams and Willie McCovey, 
who are tied for 10th place. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has an NL-leading 142 RBIs.  
</P>
<P>
	The homer was witnessed by the smallest home crowd since McGwire  
joined the Cardinals in 1997. Tuesday night's game was rained out 
and rescheduled as a doubleheader Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Tech Millionaires Follow Gates Idea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Few high-tech retirees have the wherewithal to  
match Bill and Melinda Gates' recent $1 billion gift to put a 
select number of deserving minority students through college. 
</P>
<P>
	But a growing number of ``mini-Bills'' are using their good  
fortune to help others. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Oki is among them. The retired Microsoft Corp. millionaire  
two years ago co-founded Social Venture Partners, in which 190 
partners each kick in at least $5,000 per year for distribution to 
worthy causes, mostly involving children and education. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle group's contributions increased from $300,000 in  
1998 to $670,000 this year. Next year's goal is just over $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Oki said the partners are doing more than just funneling money.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrusting them into the nonprofit area and saying, `Make  
a difference.' And they are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows how many high-tech millionaires the past 20 years  
have brought to the Puget Sound region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle area has more than 74,000 households with a net  
worth of at least $1 million, not counting the value of their 
primary residence, according to Tampa, Fla.-based Payment Systems 
Inc. An estimated 10,000 people alone got rich working from 
Microsoft, the huge software company run by Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of hoarding their wealth, more people are looking to  
help out others -- and charities are reaping the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're just seeing the beginning of it,'' said  
Microsoft retiree Barbara Dingfield, now board chairwoman for 
United Way of King County. ``It's incredibly exciting for the 
Pacific Northwest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1989, contributions to United Way increased overall from  
$38.9 million to $68.6 million. Microsoft's contributions have 
grown from $938,000 to $10.5 million, while gifts from the 
high-tech industry generally have risen from $2 million to $12.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Microsoft and employee giving topped $26.6 million in  
cash -- about $9.6 million from employees and $17 million in matches 
and other donations from the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dingfield shrugs off cynics who suggest all this giving may have  
something to do with getting tax breaks in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a certain amount of net worth, it's just not that  
important,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Union Gospel Mission, which feeds and shelters the homeless,  
also has received some large donations from the high-tech 
community. And Ray diCasparo, 43, who left Microsoft after 8 1/2 
years, is working to establish a National Kidney Foundation office 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	He's still putting in 50-hour weeks, ``only now it doesn't feel  
like work because it's by choice and I feel like I'm helping 
people,'' he said. ``Before I was chasing the buck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many are just getting used to the idea that they're rich.  
</P>
<P>
	``They don't feel wealthy because they don't live that way,''  
said United Way president and chief executive Joanne Harrell. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dingfield, who worked in corporate giving at Microsoft, said  
most employee donations go to human services and education, 
followed by arts and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``In general, health and education always get the lion's  
share,'' said Wendy McDowell at the Pacific Northwest Ballet. But 
she has hopes that the dance company and its school will benefit, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates, Microsoft's chairman and the world's richest man with an  
estimated net worth of $85 billion, earlier this month announced 
the ``Gates Millennium Scholars Program,'' which will provide 1,000 
scholarships a year for 20 years to Asian-American, black, Hispanic 
and American Indian students through the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	With assets of $17 billion, the foundation is the second-largest  
philanthropic foundation in the world, behind London-based Wellcome 
Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates is subscribing to Henry Ford's notion that it's ``a better  
thing to empower your employees to make their own philanthropic 
choices,'' said Peter Hall, an expert on nonprofits and a senior 
research scholar at Yale. 
</P>
<P>
	``By creating this whole cohort of millionaires,'' Hall said,  
``he's also created a philanthropic community.''

<HEADLINE> Colt's To Make Co. for 'Smart Gun' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Colt's Manufacturing Co. plans to  
create a separate company to produce its high-tech ``smart gun,'' a 
weapon that can only be fired by an authorized user, The Wall 
Street Journal reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as iColt, the new company could help distance the gun  
maker from the controversy surrounding the new weapon, which some 
gun advocates call a concession to firearm foes and some antigun 
lobbyists view as a hollow gesture toward weapon safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Sliwa, president and chief executive of Colt's, will head  
the spin-off company. Retired Gen. William Keys, a Colt's board 
member, will take over the remaining core business, focusing on 
military small arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Sliwa could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The smart gun looks like an ordinary weapon and contains a tiny  
radio transmitter. The shooter must wear a transponder, which fits 
in a ring or bracelet, to operate the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt's, with the help of a $500,000 federal research grant, is  
the closest of several gun manufacturers to production, though 
Sliwa has said the finished product is still years away. 
</P>
<P>
	Some gun makers and owners maintain the smart guns are too smart  
for their own good. On its Internet website, Beretta USA calls the 
technology ``undeveloped and unproven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, Beretta said smart gun technology could  
erroneously lead gunowners to believe their weapons are child- and 
accident-proof. Experiments have shown the ID bracelets don't 
always communicate with the sensors; owners of multiple weapons 
might be required to wear an armful of such bracelets, Beretta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of handguns argue that the technology is wrongly  
viewed as a panacea. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Diaz, a policy analyst with the Washington-based Violence  
Policy Center, said iColt will ensure the gun maker, which has 
struggled out of bankruptcy since 1992, continues to receive 
government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	The smart gun will not limit gun use, but will tap into a new  
market while insulating Colt's from lawsuits filed by cities 
against firearms makers to recoup costs of gun violence, Diaz said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Collaborates With 35 Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Trying to gain the edge over Internet rival  
RealNetworks, Microsoft Corp. organized a collaboration with 35 
companies to improve the quality of video and sound transmitted to 
people with high-speed connections to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of the partnership, unveiled Wednesday, is to hasten  
the adoption of high-speed Internet access by consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said the companies planned to use its ``streaming''  
software, which allows continuous sound and video, such as movies 
or high-fidelity music, to be sent and received over the World Wide 
Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership is the latest effort by Microsoft to capture  
part of the customer base that uses ``streaming'' software made by 
rival RealNetworks Inc., which pioneered the market and is still 
the dominant player. RealNetworks is based in Seattle, near 
Microsoft's base in Redmond, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	High-speed access to the Internet is the next battleground for  
such technology, many analysts believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Streaming media works best across high-speed networks, but the  
vast majority of Web users still gain access to the Internet 
through slower dial-up modems. This has hurt acceptance of 
streaming media. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Microsoft can gain an edge over RealNetworks,  
analysts say -- by urging industry players to step up efforts to 
build high-speed networks and technology that takes advantage of 
them. Partners in the effort, such as cable TV companies, will 
cooperate by optimizing their networks to accept richer video and 
audio. 
</P>
<P>
	``RealNetworks is at this point the industry standard,'' said  
Charles King, an industry analyst with Zona Research Inc., based in 
Redwood City, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Microsoft at the same time is extremely good at pulling  
coalitions of people to work with, and holding those coalitions 
together,'' he added. ``They are coming into this a bit late, but 
they are coming in with a big bang.'' 
</P>
<P>
	RealNetworks said through a spokesman that it was well ahead of  
Microsoft in delivering streaming media that works best with 
high-speed Internet access, and did not view the new Microsoft 
initiative as a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty far ahead on that realm,'' said RealNetworks  
spokesman Jay Wampold. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies in the Microsoft collaboration include high-speed  
cable TV companies, such as RoadRunner, which services cable TV 
giants Time Warner and MediaOne; content providers, such as 
Virginmega.com and Digitial Entertainment Network Inc.; and network 
companies, such as Akamai Technologies Inc. and Sandpiper Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said that companies in its ``Windows Media Broadband  
Jumpstart'' initiative won't be restricted to using its software, 
but that its software was ``optimized'' for high-speed networking. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the underpinning technology that enables this to  
happen,'' said Kevin Unangst, Microsoft's lead product manager in 
its streaming media division.

<HEADLINE> At ARM's Length No More? / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With mortgage rates on the rise, ARMs are no  
longer getting a cold shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjustable rate mortgages, or ARMs, as they're best known, are  
slowly making a comeback after being ignored by many borrowers who 
had felt their reduced initial rates didn't produce enough monthly 
savings to warrant the risk of higher rates later on. 
</P>
<P>
	But with rates on 30-year fixed mortgages creeping above 8  
percent -- up from a three-decade low of 6.68 percent last fall -- 
adjustable loans carrying initial rates in the 5-, 6- or 7 percent 
range are starting to look more attractive to some folks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a no-brainer to take a 30-year fixed-rate  
mortgage,'' said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president for HSH 
Associates, a Butler, N.J.-based mortgage research firm, which 
provides rate information to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't market an ARM before; it was a waste of marketing  
money,'' he said. ``But as we have progressed through the summer, 
there has been a step up in market allocations for ARMs of all 
forms. We've had an appreciable increase in the amount of consumer 
interest in ARMs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ARMs now account for about a quarter of all home mortgages, more  
than double their market share from last spring -- just weeks before 
the Federal Reserve began to hike up interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed raised short-term rates twice over the summer as a  
pre-emptive strike against inflation. As a result, long-term rates 
in the public bond markets also headed higher, and that pushed up 
consumer loan rates, including rates on 15- and 30-year mortgages. 
The rate on a 30-year loan stood at nearly 8 percent by late 
September while the rate on a 15-year loan averaged around 7.6 
percent and the rate on a one-year ARM was 6.33 percent, according 
to HSH. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who don't expect to be in their homes very long --  
perhaps under three years -- a one-year ARM with a low ``teaser'' 
rate might be a good bet. The rate is adjusted annually according 
to prevailing market rates, usually tied to the one-year Treasury 
bill. And there's usually a two-point annual cap, so the rate won't 
go sky high should interest rates rise that second year. (There's 
usually a 6 percent cap over the life of the loan.) 
</P>
<P>
	``People who have been on ARMs have done very well because rates  
have pretty much trended downward for the past decade,'' said Peter 
G. Miller, author of several consumer books on mortgages, including 
``The Common Sense Mortgage.'' (Contemporary Books, Chicago) ``So 
getting an ARM when there's a temporary spike in interest has 
proven to be a pretty good bet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, not everyone may feel comfortable with a loan that  
carries an interest rate that changes every year. For them, there 
are ``hybrid'' ARMs, in which rates are fixed for longer periods, 
usually anywhere from three to 10 years, then adjusted each year 
thereafter. There are also ARMs that are fixed for a period of 
time, adjusted once, then fixed for the remainder of the loan -- 
like a 7-23, which has seven years of stability, one change, then 
23 years of fixed payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbinger says hybrid ARMs have become increasingly popular in  
recent weeks, particularly the 5-1 loan, which carries a 7.25 
percent rate for the first five years before it's adjusted 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the next five years you can save a few bucks,'' Gumbinger  
said, comparing the current rate of a 5-1 loan to a 30-year 
fixed-rate loan. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his calculations, interest and principal on a  
$100,000 5-1 loan at 7.25 percent would be $682.17 per month during 
the first five years, with interest totaling $35,309.34 during that 
time. Someone with a 30-year fixed mortgage at 7.95 percent would 
pay $730 each month, or $38,842.99 in interest for the five years. 
Total savings in interest: $3,533.65 -- enough to fill your home 
with some furnishings or appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates on other hybrid ARMs are also lower than 30-year  
rates. By late September, the 3-1 loan initially averaged 7.13 
percent; the 7-1, 7.51 percent; and the 10-1, 7.67 percent, 
according to HSH. 
</P>
<P>
	Because borrowers have stayed away from ARMs for some time, many  
will probably have to reacquaint themselves with the concept. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to sit down and run the numbers to see what things  
really cost you.'' said Miller. ``You have to ask yourself how long 
are you going to be in the property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller says the advantage of getting an ARM right now is not  
only lower rates but more liberal qualification standards. Many 
ARMs are kept on lenders' books rather than sold into the secondary 
market, which is often the case with fixed-rate mortgage 
originators. Therefore, that means they often don't have to meet 
strict federal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone with a given income can borrow more or someone who  
might not have qualified with a fixed-rate loan will qualify with 
an ARM,'' Miller said.

<HEADLINE> Winfrey Lectures Student in Ill. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- She's counseled people for years on her  
talk show, but lecturing students in a classroom setting was a bit 
more unsettling for Oprah Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been this nervous since I danced with Tina Turner,''  
Ms. Winfrey said Tuesday after her teaching debut at Northwestern 
University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Winfrey and longtime beau Stedman Graham are teaching  
``Dynamics of Leadership'' at the top-ranked business school, where 
110 students were lucky enough to snag a spot in the 10-week 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I speak to millions every day, but it's different one-on-one  
when people have paid to hear you say something meaningful,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the nervousness subsided, Ms. Winfrey said she quickly got  
into the swing of teaching. She gave herself a B. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Winfrey's involvement in the class was announced in May.  
Graham, head of his own marketing firm and author of a best seller, 
has taught sports marketing at Kellogg for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Before class, some students spoke of their admiration for Ms.  
Winfrey. But Danielle Selinsky, 30, said she was a bit nervous 
about the new teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine calling her up if I have problems,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Nichols Gets Attorney He Wanted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Terry Nichols got the attorney he wanted  
for his state trial on murder charges in the Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Hermanson was originally appointed by the Oklahoma  
Indigent Defense System to represent Nichols, but his contract was 
canceled after state lawmakers withdrew $900,000 that had been set 
aside for Nichols' defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the Oklahoma Supreme Court has approved almost $1  
million for Nichols' defense. The money will come from a state 
court fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols wrote Associate District Judge Robert M. Murphy Jr. of  
Payne County in July asking that Hermanson be retained. He said 
replacing the attorney ``would seriously jeopardize my defense ... 
and thus, in the long run cost more money and court time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an order Wednesday, Murphy noted that Nichols and Hermanson  
had established a bond that should not be disturbed except for 
compelling reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols is serving a life sentence on federal conspiracy and  
involuntary manslaughter convictions in the April 19, 1995, bombing 
that killed 168 people and injured more than 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy McVeigh, his former Army buddy, was convicted of murder  
and weapons counts and sentenced to death.

<HEADLINE> Study Examines Spider Eyesight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A European spider uses two of its eight eyes as an ``optical  
compass'' to find its way home after an evening of prowling for 
victims, researchers reported today in the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Because three-quarters of all spider species are equipped with  
similar eyes, the research suggests they also navigate by using the 
organs to produce a sort of sky road map in polarized light. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish scientists studied Drassodes cupreus, an inch-long  
spider found in northern Europe. The spider constructs a silky nest 
under rocks and leaves and forages at dusk in search of prey. 
</P>
<P>
	As it creeps about, the brown and gray spider uses its special  
set of flat blue eyes to scan the evening sky like a pair of 
polarized sunglasses to filter out light scattered by the 
atmosphere, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spider can't actually see with the eyes. Instead, the eyes  
reveal polarized light patterns that change as the sun moves across 
the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	The patterns serve as a sort of road map the spiders pair with  
images from their regular eyes to lead them home, said Marie Dacke, 
one of the researchers and a doctoral student in zoology at the 
University of Lund. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's partly cloudy that's not a problem -- all it needs is a  
portion of clear sky to work. But if it's totally overcast or 
raining it won't work,'' said Dacke, who worked with four other 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers built a model of the eyes and found that it  
works best at dawn or dusk, when the spiders are most active. The 
model eye was useful for up to an hour after sunset, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	While some insects and vertebrates also interpret polarized  
light for navigation, Dacke said her team's research is the first 
time specialized polarizing optics have been found in any animal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dacke's team found that nine of 10 spiders that made a nest in  
one of four shelters within the enclosure returned to the same nest 
after their first foraging trip. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the spiders had their secondary eyes obscured with  
black paint, only three out of 10 returned to their original 
shelter. The same results were obtained when unpolarized light was 
projected into the spider's enclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	Dacke is currently studying 15 other species of spiders to see  
whether they also use secondary eyes to see in polarized light. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Coddington, the Smithsonian Institution's top spider  
researcher, said the research may explain the hereto unexplained 
purpose of similar eyes found in 25,000 of the world's 37,000 
spider species. 
</P>
<P>
	The secondary eyes, which cannot discern spatial structures,  
have puzzled spider experts for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be willing to bet a lot of money that what's true for  
this spider is true for many other spiders,'' Coddington said. 
``These folks have provided an explanation that is powerful. It 
will certainly rock the world of spider research.''

<HEADLINE> Patriots Sign Two, Waive Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- The New England Patriots on Wednesday  
signed running backs Jerry Ellison and Marques Brigham and waived 
offensive tackle Damon Denson and defensive tackle Garrett Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellison, who played four seasons with Tampa Bay, fills a need on  
special teams where the Patriots suffered injuries last Sunday 
night to key players Harold Shaw, Chris Floyd, Tebucky Jones and 
Bernard Russ. Shaw is a running back and Floyd a fullback. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Pete Carroll said he didn't know if any of the four would  
play next Sunday at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Denson, a fourth-round draft pick by the Patriots in 1997, was  
released on the last roster cutdown of training camp. He was 
re-signed after offensive linemen Heath Irwin and Zefross Moss were 
injured, but both could play against the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, signed as a free agent, was cut on Sept. 5 then signed  
to the Patriots practice squad Sept. 7. He was replaced on the 
practice squad by Brigham, who had been cut after signing with 
Oakland as a rookie free agent following this year's draft, then 
signed by the Patriots Aug. 17 and cut Aug. 30.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Little Bighorn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The faces staring out from the page are  
leathery, chiseled, emotionally opaque. The names -- Goes Ahead, 
White Man Runs Him, Yellow Robe, Iron Hawk -- resonate as war cries 
and gunfire once did across the treeless hills of eastern Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	These Indians were there when Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer  
and some 200 U.S. cavalry troopers met death at Little Bighorn on 
June 25, 1876. They were the Crow and Arikara scouts who rode with 
Custer, and the Sioux and Cheyenne braves who destroyed him that 
hot Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as the outcome permanently tarnished Custer's reputation,  
it left the Indians a bitter legacy that for some, has lasted 123 
years, says Herman J. Viola, author of a new book that looks at the 
famous battle from the Indians' point of view. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of the four tribes involved find any comfort in the  
events of 1876,'' says Viola, curator emeritus of the Smithsonian 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Crow and Arikara not only feel betrayed by the government  
they sought to help, but today they are more often seen as traitors 
for helping the cavalry hunt down their traditional enemies,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cheyenne and Sioux, on the other hand, suffered terribly  
for their victory. In fact, elderly descendants of the Cheyenne and 
Sioux who were present at Little Bighorn still fear some sort of 
retribution awaits them if their family connection to Custer's 
demise is revealed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viola's book, ``Little Bighorn Remembered, the Untold Indian  
Story of Custer's Last Stand,'' appears this month. It includes 
many obscure and previously unpublished details about the most 
famous event of the 19th-century Indian wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Among these are the Cheyenne oral legend that Custer's death was  
retribution by the Everywhere Spirit -- or God -- for breaking a 
promise never to attack the tribe and that some of Custer's troops 
may have drunk whiskey just before the battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The book also includes a new reconstruction of Custer's  
movements at Little Bighorn by National Park Service archaeologist 
Douglas Scott, and the first publication of all 41 drawings of the 
battle by Sioux chief Red Horse, which Viola calls a ``Native 
American Bayeux Tapestry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The overriding theme is the conflict among the Plains tribes  
that transcended war with the Army -- Crow and Arikara versus their 
traditional enemies, the Sioux and Cheyenne. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the Indians against the cowboys -- this is Indians  
against Indians,'' Viola said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very excited about this book,'' says Joseph Medicine  
Crow, of Lodge Grass, Mont., a tribal historian who at 86 may be 
the last living person to have known anyone present at the battle 
of Little Bighorn. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicine Crow's great-uncle, or ``grandfather in the Indian  
way,'' was White Man Runs Him, an imposing 6-foot-6 warrior who was 
one of the six Crow scouts with Custer that day and survived only 
because Custer released the scouts from duty. 
</P>
<P>
	As a boy, Medicine Crow listened as White Man Runs Him and four  
other former scouts told stories of their relationship with the 
flamboyant soldier they called Son of the Morning Star. 
</P>
<P>
	In the book, Medicine Crow says the Crows' friendly ties with  
the whites were based on a 100-year-old tribal prophecy that 
resistance meant eventual disaster and an 1825 treaty that was 
consummated by the ritual touching of a knife blade to tongues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a sacred oath that will be kept forever,'' Medicine  
Crow says. 
</P>
<P>
	He adds that in later years, when asked to help the army fight  
the Sioux and Cheyennes, the Crows saw themselves as using -- rather 
than being used by -- the whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crow survival was at stake. The Crows believed then -- and  
still believe -- that they honorably used the white man as allies in 
their continuing intertribal struggle with their worthy traditional 
enemies,'' Medicine Crow says. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Sioux led by the famous Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse  
have always overshadowed their Cheyenne allies, the Arikara are 
``the real forgotten people'' on the other side, says Viola, 
although they lost three scouts killed and the Crows none. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after 123 years, fear and suspicion persists, Viola says.  
``Old, old Indians still are afraid to talk about Little Bighorn. 
They still think the government is going to punish them. They say, 
`You don't know the government.''' 
</P>
<P>
	This is especially true with Cheyennes, who according to rumors  
may still have ``Custer memorabilia'' -- paper money, weapons and 
battlefield artifacts -- hidden away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the more talkative Cheyennes was the Rev. Joseph Walks  
Along, a Mennonite preacher who recalled his grandfather, Yellow 
Robe, 12 at the time, saying the Indians didn't expect a fight 
until they saw the soldiers weren't carrying a flag of truce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grandpa told us that prior to the battle, at a different  
place, Custer had told the Cheyennes that as long as the cavalry 
carried a white flag and the American flag, they would be coming in 
peace. On that day, Custer did not come in peace,'' said Joseph 
Walks Along. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1908, four surviving Custer scouts returned to Little Bighorn  
with Edward S. Curtis, a famed scholar-photographer on Indian 
culture. Curtis died in 1925 and his unpublished papers were 
rediscovered in 1988 by a son, then 95, who sent them to the 
Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on those writings, the Smithsonian's curator emeritus of  
military history, James Hutchins, contributes a chapter to Viola's 
book. He adds new details to the familiar story of how Custer 
divided his force into three parts and ordered his 
second-in-command, Major Marcus Reno, to attack the Indian 
encampment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crow scouts criticized Custer for ignoring their warnings  
that the Sioux-Cheyenne enemy were too numerous and for failing to 
ride to Reno's aid. When the scouts donned tribal regalia, ``to die 
as Indians,'' Custer let them go. As they joined Reno, according to 
White Man Runs Him, ``we looked back and saw Custer still 
fighting'' on a distant slope to the north. They did not know until 
later that the sun had set for Son of the Morning Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Arikara scouts with Reno were killed, but the Crows  
survived. Most continued to serve with the military. While Custer 
was acclaimed a fallen hero, Reno was publicly vilified for his 
actions at Little Bighorn. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchins says Curtis believed the Crows' account of Custer's  
action, but took the advice of his friend, President Theodore 
Roosevelt, not to publish a story that ``makes Custer out both a 
traitor and a fool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty years after the event it is necessary to be exceedingly  
cautious about relying on the memory of any man, Indian or white,'' 
Roosevelt wrote. ``Such a space of time is a great breeder of 
myths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a foreword, Gerard Baker, a former Park Service  
superintendent of the Little Bighorn battlefield, says modern-day 
critics who deride the Crows and Arikaras for siding with the 
government forget that the Plains tribes were already at war with 
each other, and some needed help to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indians today often look back at Little Bighorn and see only  
the harmful results of the Indian alliance with the U.S. Army,'' 
writes Baker, whose Indian descendants include Arikara. ``Hindsight 
is always 20-20, but our ancestors did not have crystal balls.''

<HEADLINE> Elvis Presley Memorabilia Displayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- It is a garage sale fit for a king.  
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of items of Elvis Presley memorabilia went on display  
Tuesday, a prelude to an auction Oct. 8-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items are Presley's Army fatigues, a trunk he used  
when he served in Germany and a 1959 photo of Presley with 
Priscilla Beaulieu, the 14-year-old daughter of an Air Force 
captain. The teen-ager would eventually become Mrs. Presley. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Soden, chief executive officer of Memphis, Tenn.-based  
Elvis Presley Enterprises Inc., looked over the display and 
explained the premise for next month's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking things that might have stayed in cold, dark  
storage and putting it into homes for the homeless,'' Soden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the auction will fund Presley Place, a  
transitional housing development in Presley's hometown of Memphis.

<HEADLINE> Gore Acting More Like Challenger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is reinventing his  
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination -- with the 
tactics of a challenger, not those of a lofty front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a role reversal for the vice president who began as the  
presumed nominee-in-waiting, with former Sen. Bill Bradley running 
but not threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	No more.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore challenged Bradley to campaign debates. He is moving his  
headquarters from Washington to Nashville, ``closer to the 
grassroots and out of the Beltway.'' The campaign payroll will be 
pruned in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I welcome the new shape of this campaign,'' Gore said  
Wednesday, as though he wouldn't have preferred the old one to the 
``hard, tough fight'' he foresees now. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he said he no longer felt like a front-runner.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like the underdog. I'm going to campaign like the  
underdog and I think that's the way to get elected,'' he said 
Wednesday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said a ``hard fought'' contest will sharpen both campaigns,  
both candidates. But campaigns are not workouts waged to make 
better candidates -- the aim is winning. Gore is no longer sure 
enough of that to run on his earlier campaign plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Not with Bradley gaining on him in polls of Democrats in the  
early primary states, and raising ample funds, despite Gore's still 
comfortable lead in national polls. That is among Democrats, not in 
matchups for the general election, which put Republican Gov. George 
W. Bush of Texas ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bradley served three terms in the Senate from New Jersey,  
he's cast himself as the outsider, the candidate of change, and the 
one with the best chance of winning. He has been making headway 
using all three. And when Gore said he would take his campaign 
``directly to the grassroots'' with open meetings in the early 
primary states, Bradley countered that he already was. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's debate challenge put him in the role usually played by  
the candidate trying to catch up with a leader, as when the 
Republicans trailing Bush tried it, unsuccessfully. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president said he wants to meet Bradley in a series of  
debates on specific issues. Bradley countered that he was not in 
the habit of responding to every change in tactics by the vice 
president. He said he'd already agreed to joint appearances, and 
the first is scheduled for Oct. 27 in New Hampshire, the first 
primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	With the first voting, in Iowa, some four months away, the  
preseason has not gone well for Gore. He came into it in apparent 
command of the Democratic campaign, with Bradley too far behind to 
require his mention. 
</P>
<P>
	That's standard procedure for a front-runner; the theory is that  
talking about rivals, let alone debating them, only gets them 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last 10 months, the vice president and his campaign  
have been ignoring me and now they want to debate me,'' said 
Bradley, campaigning in California for the primary that could be 
pivotal. ``I think that shows we're making some progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Gore, as for any front-runner, every misstep is magnified.  
As in the talk of a listless beginning, the rumors of friction with 
the president, denied on both sides. There was said to be 
infighting, indecision, a campaign spending too much money on a 
top-heavy staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley hasn't faced such strains. He can travel lighter than a  
vice president. His headquarters is West Orange, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	He also took in campaign money at a rate that surprised the Gore  
camp. While Gore leads in raising money, he also leads in spending 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of it, while Gore's lead for the nomination may have  
eroded, it is not gone. The vice president has the backing of the 
Democratic establishment, endorsements from more than 100 members 
of Congress, the advantages of the office from which no vice 
president who sought the presidential nomination has been denied it 
since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it is a worried establishment. Sen. Daniel Patrick  
Moynihan of New York said why when he endorsed Bradley. ``Nothing 
is the matter with Gore, but he can't be elected,'' Moynihan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Add the Clinton factor. Elections are about change. Gore has to  
offer change while running as Clinton's No. 2. ``I think there's 
fatigue with questions about Clinton fatigue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's still there.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the old problems lingering for the ``brand new campaign''  
he said is ahead. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Farm Bill Nears Passage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders in Congress were close  
Wednesday night to breaking a week-long impasse on agricultural 
spending after burying a Senate plan that would have allowed U.S. 
food and medicine sales to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders needed the blessing of a House-Senate conference  
committee on a proposed agreement that would provide farmers 
plagued by droughts, floods and low prices with nearly $9 billion 
in emergency assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Two leading Democrats on the panel endorsed the deal late  
Wednesday after winning a pledge that it would include $125 million 
in special subsidies for dairy farmers. Shelved was an effort to 
overturn the Clinton administration's milk pricing program. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, Rep. David Obey and Sen. Herb Kohl  
predicted that the deal would ``go forward'' to final approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are from Wisconsin. Obey is the senior Democrat on the  
House Appropriations Committee, while Kohl is the senior Democrat 
on the Senate's agricultural appropriations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Another panel member, Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., announced his  
support for the deal after winning a provision that would require 
meatpackers to report the prices they pay for livestock. ``That 
means a lot ... I'm happy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But GOP leaders refused to budge on the Cuba issue and came  
under fire from members of their own party. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be foolhardy if we addressed the emergency but failed  
to address this structure where farmers are not able to market 
their products around the world,'' said the measure's sponsor, Sen. 
John Ashcroft, R-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders didn't want non-spending provisions in the bill,  
said John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get this thing done,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Democrats complained they were excluded from negotiations, but  
they will not try to slow down the bill if it gets out of the 
conference committee, said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, 
D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think we have much leverage because we're not even in  
the room,'' Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some farm groups, including the huge American Farm Bureau  
Federation, wanted lawmakers to reject the proposed deal if it 
didn't include the dairy and trade provisions and enough money to 
cover farmers' weather-related losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also weighed in Wednesday against  
the agreement because of the Cuba issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to opening trade with Cuba, Ashcroft's measure would  
forbid the president from stopping sales of agricultural products 
and medical supplies to other countries without congressional 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers from dairy states in the South and East had opposed  
the administration's new milk-pricing system, which had been 
scheduled to take effect Friday, and tried to use the bill to 
overturn it. A federal judge on Tuesday postponed implementation of 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohl and Obey support the new system and fought to keep it out  
of the bill.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Surge / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks surged Thursday morning, bolstered  
by the dollar's relative steadiness against the yen and higher 
futures prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 324.74  
points, or 1.88 percent, to 17,607.02 at the end of the morning 
session. On Wednesday, the average closed down 43.42 points, or 
0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 106.82 yen at late morning, down 0.08 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
106.98 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices moved higher from the opening of trading as  
investors were actively buying international blue chips and other 
domestic issues, including pharmaceuticals and banking stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiroichi Nishi, deputy general manager at Nikko Securities Co.,  
said the stock market was boosted by some bullish factors, 
including the dollar's brief rise to 107 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the market was a rise in futures prices. The  
December Nikkei futures contract was up 350 points to 17,600 at 
midday Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 62.05 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,213.48. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 34.91 points, or 2.39 percent, to 1,493.02. 
The TOPIX closed down 11.18 points, or 0.76 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a slight retreat, the dollar still held onto its  
strength in New York, where the greenback gained ground for a third 
consecutive day Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders still expect the Bank of Japan may ease credit following  
a weekend meeting by major industrialized nations, a move seen as 
potentially weakening the yen. At the Washington meeting, officials 
of the Group of Seven nations expressed concern over the yen's 
rapid rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen's strong gains could derail Japan's recovery from a  
recession by making Japanese exports more expensive abroad and thus 
reducing demand for its products. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 113.74 yen, up from  
112.52 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7000 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.6750 percent. Its 
price fell 0.21 points to 100.00.

	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- The radioactive contaminant neptunium  
may have posed a greater threat than plutonium at three Energy 
Department plants where the government has acknowledged workers 
were exposed to toxic material. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been focused very much on the neptunium and it's a little  
dismaying to me all the attention that's given to plutonium,'' said 
David Michaels, the agency's assistant secretary for environment, 
safety and health. 
</P>
<P>
	He said neptunium posed a greater danger simply because there  
was so much more of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Michaels on Wednesday announced preliminary findings from a  
review of the handling of recycled uranium years ago at the gaseous 
diffusion plants in Paducah, Ky., Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Piketon, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The uranium was used in military or commercial applications  
before being recycled by the plants, which now enrich uranium 
solely for fuel in nuclear reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	The review is being performed in conjunction with an  
investigation ordered by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson into 
health, safety and environmental concerns at the plants. The 
government has acknowledged that workers at the plants were 
unwittingly exposed to plutonium and other toxic materials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paducah plant apparently processed most of the agency's  
recycled uranium -- about 100,000 tons of the material, which 
contained an estimated 12 ounces of plutonium, compared with 41 
pounds of neptunium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department said the information will allow it to  
determine whether more extensive reviews of exposures among plant 
workers or environmental contamination are required. Exposure to 
radiation has been linked to forms of cancer.

<HEADLINE> DC United 1, Olimpia (Honduras) 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Goalkeeper Tom Presthus stopped a penalty kick  
in the final minute as D.C. United beat Olimpia of Honduras 1-0 
Wednesday night in a quarterfinal of the CONCACAF Champions Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second game, Necaxa of Mexico beat Saprissa of Costa Rica  
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners will meet in a semifinal Friday, with the Chicago  
Fire playing Alajeula of Costa Rica in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Presthus dove to his right to stop a penalty kick from Arnold  
Cruz that was awarded after Presthus upended Wilmer Velasquez. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really lucky I held onto the ball,'' Presthus said. ``I  
really had a roller coaster of emotion during the last 
minute-and-a-half of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United's Jamie Moreno had tapped in a crossing pass in front of  
the net from Carey Talley in the 68th minute for the game's only 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	Presthus' penalty kick save was his second stellar play in the  
final 10 minutes of the match. In the 85th minute Olimpia's 
Denilson Costa broke free down the left side and got a shot off 
from 7 yards away. Presthus dove to his left to stop that one. 
</P>
<P>
	United outshot Olimpia 12-10 and controlled the action through  
most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first half, Moreno knocked a header off the crossbar and  
Ben Olson had another header in front of the goal thwarted by 
Olimpia defender Jorge Samuel Caballero, who headed the ball off 
the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
	Olimpia's best first-half chance came at the 20-minute mark when  
Velasquez, the Honduran National League's leading scorer, 
controlled a loose ball in front of the net but sent his shot 
sailing wide to the left.

<HEADLINE> Oil Tops $25 a Barrel; Gold Falls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures rocketed briefly above $25 a barrel Wednesday  
to a 33-month high on the New York Mercantile Exchange, propelled 
by falling U.S. stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold, too, remained above a noteworthy threshold it reached this  
week -- $300 an ounce -- but just barely after prices tumbled 3 
percent on the heels of a stunning rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium belatedly followed gold's rise, jumping 3 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Continuing a year of steady increases, crude topped $25 for the  
first time in 2 1/2 years and then rose to $25.12 before falling back 
in a flurry of late-session profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest surge came after the U.S. Department of Energy said  
Wednesday that already-low U.S. crude stockpiles had dropped by 4.3 
million barrels last week. That exceeded an earlier report by the 
American Petroleum Institute that showed a 3.7-million-barrel 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil prices have more than doubled since last spring, when the  
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries opted for significant 
production cuts in order to chip away at the world oil glut that 
had caused prices to sink. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say no end appears in sight to the trend, although  
there could be more profit-taking to slow it down. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market looks pretty favorable going forward,'' said an oil  
futures trader who asked not to be named. But, he said, ``We're due 
for a correction before we resume some upward movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the day, West Texas intermediate crude oil for November  
delivery rose 36 cents to settle at $24.69 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	October heating oil rose .45 cent to 62.13 cents a gallon;  
October unleaded regular gasoline rose half a cent to 73.25 cents a 
gallon; November natural gas fell 3.1 cents to $2.824 per million 
British thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude rose 5 cents to $23.81 a  
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold's frenzied price rally stalled and went into reverse on the  
Comex division of the New York Merc. Profit-taking sent the price 
down $8 to close at $302 per troy ounce, just a day after it had 
spiraled as high as $329 and closed 9 percent higher in the biggest 
one-day rally in nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Also driving gold down was news that Russia may place 7.3  
million ounces with Western banks, enabling it to be lent to the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the market was readjusting after the wild ride  
that has taken it from $255 an ounce in a week -- a more than 20 
percent rise until Wednesday's slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite price slides in other metals such as silver and  
platinum, palladium bucked the trend and settled up $13.70 at 
$391.85 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier the metal hit $405, in what market-watchers said was a  
delayed reaction to gold's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium is used heavily in the automotive industry in the  
manufacture of emission-control devices.

<HEADLINE> eBay Moves Against 'Piggybackers' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Online auctioneer eBay is cracking down on  
new Internet services that sift through auction Web sites to find 
the best prices for potential bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has released a new user agreement that  
prohibits individual users from collecting or sharing certain 
information found on eBay's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Kevin Pursglove said the moves were made to protect  
eBay from companies or individuals seeking to ``piggy-back'' on 
eBay's success. 
</P>
<P>
	Several new Web sites search sites for goods being auctioned and  
compare prices offered. BiddersEdge.com and another service, Ruby 
Lane, stopped using eBay auction data when eBay refused to give 
them permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, eBay also asked AuctionWatch.com to stop  
using eBay information. 
</P>
<P>
	Pursglove said part of the problem is that the other sites  
misrepresent what is being offered on eBay. For example, a search 
for Pez candy dispensers on AuctionWatch.com, which searches items 
listed on eBay, Yahoo, Amazon.com and other sites, turned up 227 
listings, at a time when eBay's site listed about 1,900 Pez items. 
</P>
<P>
	``How accurate is the information being distributed?'' Pursglove  
asked. ``Not very.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodrigo Sales, chief executive officer and cofounder of San  
Bruno, Calif.-based AuctionWatch.com, said his customers were 
concerned about eBay's new user policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an advocate of the user community, we think it is more  
important to represent user reaction rather than our own take,'' 
Sales said in a statement Wednesday. ``From the reaction on our 
message boards, I can say that users are not happy about the 
revised terms, because they feel it restricts their freedom to buy 
and sell across the Web.''

<HEADLINE> Western Digital Recalls Hard Drives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- A defective computer chip has forced  
Western Digital Corp. to recall 400,000 hard disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
	Western Digital officials said it was unclear how many of the  
affected hard drives actually were in consumer hands or how much 
the recall would cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which supplies equipment to Gateway Inc. and Compaq  
Computer Corp., said many of the disk drives were still in the 
hands of manufacturers and sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	The defect can cause the hard drives -- the part of the computer  
that stores data -- to fail to power up after six to 12 months of 
use, company officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``No data has been lost, and none is in danger of being lost,''  
said Charles Haggerty, Western Digital's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall is the latest in a string of problems, including  
recent layoffs and a plunging stock price, for the Orange 
County-based computer company. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard drives being recalled are part of the WD Cavair series.  
They were made between Aug. 27 and last Friday, and have drive 
capacities between 6.4 gigabytes and 20.5 gigabytes, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who purchased computers in the past month can check  
specification sheets on their machines to see if they include a 
Western Digital drive, officials said. The company's Web site, 
www.westerndigital.com, offers a software program that can be 
downloaded to identify affected products.

<HEADLINE> Vintner Winning Respect for Wines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOULDSBORO, Maine (AP) -- Most fruit wines either fall under the  
categories of dessert wine or cheap, sweet wine consumed from 
bottles wrapped in paper sacks. Some call them ``country wines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Robert Bartlett thinks fruit wines can be just as good as  
traditional wines made from grapes. And he is winning respect as a 
vintner using everything from honey to blackberries to pears. 
</P>
<P>
	He realizes he has a skeptical audience.  
</P>
<P>
	``We get people in the wine-tasting room who are grape wine  
connoisseurs. You can see in their face that they are impressed,'' 
Bartlett said. ``That's the hard part -- getting people to try it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bartlett, whose 18-year-old Bartlett Maine Estate Winery  
produces about 7,000 cases of wine a year, is among fewer than 200 
fruit wineries across the country, said Dan Archibald, editor of 
Fruit Winemaking Quarterly in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it makes up only a fraction of total wine sales, fruit  
wine -- the term applied to wine made from fruit other than grapes -- 
is gaining greater public acceptance, Archibald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some wineries with major lables, such as Gallo, Sutter Home  
and Arbor Mist, are experimenting with fruit flavors. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinchero Family Estates, which produces Sutter Home, has come  
up with combinations such as white zinfandel with kiwi-strawberry, 
white zinfandel with peach-mango and zinfandel with raspberry. 
</P>
<P>
	In just 18 months, wine makers nationwide have shipped between 4  
million to 5 million cases of those flavored wines, said Stan Hock, 
spokesman for Trinchero Family Estates in California, which created 
two special labels, Portico and Soleo, for its fruit-flavored 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the success of fruit-flavored grape wines translates to  
success for pure fruit wines remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartlett is nearing his maximum production unless he buys more  
equipment to expand his operation, which consists of a German 
press, 10 stainless steel vats for fermentation, wooden casks for 
aging and Italian bottling and labeling equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many fruit vintners, Bartlett opted for nontraditional  
fruits because Maine's climate is not conducive to growing grapes. 
He uses native blueberries and apples, among other fruits. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, the very thought of those fruits conjures notions of  
syrupy sweet wines, and that's how many still perceive fruit wines, 
which often have a higher sugar content than grape wines. 
</P>
<P>
	But vintners like Bartlett are winning over fans of grape wines  
by producing traditional dry wines. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartlett has put his blueberry wine up against conventional red  
wines and has done well. 
</P>
<P>
	In blindfolded tastings, people were unable to tell the  
difference between traditional red wines and his blueberry wines, 
some of which are aged in either American or French oak casks, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His Winemaker's Reserve Blueberry, which sells for $23.99, was  
ranked one of the world's top 40 red wines by the Beverage Testing 
Institute Inc., as reported in ``Wine Enthusiast'' magazine in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	His pear, blueberry and ``Coastal White'' wines, along with his  
raspberry dessert wine, also did well in the latest tests of 
domestic wines published in August in the institute's journal, 
``Tastings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I think it's becoming more mainstream,'' Bartlett  
said. ``Then sometimes I think it's not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, most fruit wine makers cater to regional niche markets,  
said Ted Huber, owner and winemaker Huber Orchard Winery in 
Starlight, Ind., across the Ohio River from Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Huber said fruit wines allow him to use excess fruit produced on  
his farm, and they also allow him to spread out his wine production 
throughout the season, starting with strawberries in the spring, 
blackberries, raspberries and peaches through the summer, Concord 
grapes in the fall, and apples in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people haven't tried a fruit wine from a small winery that  
cares about its product, they need to get out and try it,'' said 
Huber, who makes 27,000 gallons a year. ``I think they'll be 
pleasantly surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, vintners are more willing to experiment after the  
success of white zinfandel, a creation of domestic vintners that 
became a best seller despite being looked down upon by 
traditionalists and by vintners in Europe, Hock said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Purists scoff at it, but Americans love it,'' he said. ``That  
tells us we can emulate what the French do and shove it down the 
throats of Americans, or we can make what Americans want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether such small fruit vintners make a bigger splash may  
ultimately be decided by a new generation of wine drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Generation X currently doesn't drink much wine and vintners hope  
they can lure them in with the fruit wines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's this whole issue of what's going to be the buying  
interest of the 'Generation X-ers,''' Archibald said. ``Nobody has 
really taken the time to look at this emerging group and what their 
tastebuds are.''

<HEADLINE> House Seeks To Ease Budget Snags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two days from fiscal 2000, House Republican  
leaders are proposing delaying payments to low-income families and 
trimming adoption and other programs as they search for ways to pay 
for snagged spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Top House GOP lawmakers planned to discuss the plan today with  
rank-and-file Republicans as Congress continued trying to finish 
more of the remaining spending measures for the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget battle was assured a three-week extension when  
Congress overwhelmingly sent President Clinton a bill letting 
agencies function through Oct. 21. The House vote was 421-2, and 
the Senate margin was 98-1. Clinton's signature was promised by 
Friday's start of fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP's new savings package was aimed at letting them claim  
they are not using Social Security surpluses to pay for extra 
spending, a pledge that has become a central Republican tenet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, if you want more spending, tell us how you are  
going to pay for it,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, told 
reporters today. He added, ``Under no circumstances will I vote to 
spend one penny of the Social Security trust fund on anything but 
Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed savings would exceed $9 billion for next year. Most  
of it -- $8.7 billion -- would come from paying earned-income credits 
in monthly installments instead of the lump sum most of the 20 
million recipients currently receive. The money goes to people who 
owe little or no income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans dismissed the idea as too harsh when it was  
floated two weeks ago. But House Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas, called it ``a commonsense approach'' that would mainly 
affect recipients who pay no income taxes, adding, ``I would say it 
is denying them the lump sum acceptance of my money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the savings would come from consolidating federal  
adoption programs; eliminating cash payments to people whose 
companies fail due to foreign competition; and freezing 
administrative costs of federal direct student loans. They were 
also considering delaying renewal of expired housing vouchers for 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The savings, totaling $700 million, were described by  
Republicans speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``What does it say about their priorities and their values that  
they tax the poorest families ... as their preferred solution to 
escape the budgetary mess they created for themselves,'' White 
House economic adviser Gene Sperling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the political emphasis the GOP is placing on Social  
Security, House Republicans have prepared television commercials to 
underline that lawmakers should not ``raid Social Security.'' The 
commercials would run in the districts of vulnerable Democrats, but 
no final decision has been made on airing them. 
</P>
<P>
	As the partisan spending battle intensified, Clinton on Tuesday  
vetoed his first spending bill for 2000, the bill financing the 
District of Columbia's government. He blamed GOP restrictions on 
the local government's power, such as its ability to allow medical 
use of marijuana and other. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has veto threats against five other spending  
bills. Of the 13 annual spending measures, Congress has completed 
five. Clinton has signed one, vetoed one and plans to sign three 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate planned to debate the biggest spending measure of all  
today, a $324 billion bill financing labor, health and education 
programs. Clinton has threatened to veto it over cuts in his plans 
for hiring teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay for the labor-health bill and sidestep spending limits,  
Republicans shifted $11 billion into the measure, mostly from 
separate legislation financing the Pentagon. The GOP plans to 
restore that money later, and Democrats have chastised the 
transfers as an evasive shell game. 
</P>
<P>
	In other spending action, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said  
House-Senate bargainers had completed a compromise transportation 
spending bill. Resolving one contentious issue, he said the measure 
would cut highway aid to states that sell information from drivers' 
licenses to private companies without drivers' permission.

<HEADLINE> Optics Co. Accused in Army Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A precision-optics company that makes  
artillery sights for the Army's M-1 tank and other weapons systems 
faked inspection reports and shipped millions of dollars worth of 
defective parts to the military, according to a lawsuit filed by 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``The danger of that is that it might have a detrimental impact  
on the targeting system of some of the tanks,'' Assistant U.S. 
Attorney Seth Weber said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The defects ``may very well'' cause gunners to miss their  
targets, Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations came out of a whistle-blower lawsuit that Bob  
Basore, the company's former marketing director, filed under seal 
in March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	John L. Plummer, 84, and his company were accused along with  
other Plummer officials of ``a systematic and continuous scheme'' 
to defraud the government in which defective parts were shipped to 
the military for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Fryman, who represents the company as well as Plummer,  
wouldn't comment on the allegations, but said Wednesday the parties 
were trying to negotiate a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal False Claims Act allows individuals to sue any  
entity or person believed to be submitting false reimbursement 
claims to the government and entitles the government to recover 
damages plus $5,000 to $10,000 in civil penalties for each false 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has now joined in the case, which was unsealed  
last week by U.S. District Judge Herbert J. Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said plant inspectors who complained that products  
did not meet government specifications were threatened with the 
loss of their jobs if they didn't keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer had been a vital part of the U.S. war effort in World  
War II as the Allies struggled to overcome the loss of access to 
Germany's precision-optics experts. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Plummer lenses are used in the gunner's primary sighting  
system for the M-1 tank and are critical components of the Army's 
laser range finders, according to the government complaint.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) -- Scottie Pippen unleashed a torrent of  
criticism at Houston Rockets teammate Charles Barkley, calling 
Barkley ``selfish'' and ``fat' and saying he doesn't have the 
desire to win an NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably should've listened to Michael (Jordan) a year ago  
when he said that Charles will never win a championship because he 
doesn't show any dedication,'' Pippen told ESPN. ``He's a very 
selfish guy. He doesn't show the desire to want to win. That's my 
reason for wanting to get away from playing with him -- because he 
just doesn't show the dedication.'' 
</P>

	Pippen was responding to criticism initiated by Barkley, who was  
angered that Pippen said he'd welcome a trade to the Los Angeles 
Lakers. Barkley said he sacrificed greatly to make salary cap room 
on the Rockets for Pippen, who signed a five-year, $67.2 million 
contract before last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to want to leave after one year, it disappointed me  
greatly,'' Barkley said Tuesday. ``The Rockets went out of their 
way to get Scottie and the fans have treated him well, so I was 
just disappointed in him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was offering no apologies Wednesday and reiterated that  
he wants to play elsewhere, preferably for the Lakers and Phil 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't give Charles Barkley an apology at gunpoint,''  
Pippen said, never raising his voice. ``He can never expect an 
apology from me. ... If anything, he owes me an apology for coming 
to play with his fat butt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very shocked to see what type of player he was by  
spending half a season with him,'' he said of Barkley. ``I'm a guy 
that's dedicated to winning, and I put out a lot of effort on the 
court. I expect that from my teammates, especially from a guy of 
his caliber. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know he's not willing to go the distance. There's no  
reason for me to put my last three or four years at risk of never 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charles is definitely one of the guys that needs to show more  
leadership for this ball club to be successful, and he don't show 
that to me. ... He feels that if he gets 10 rebounds and 
double-figure points, he's done a good job. But that's not what the 
game's about. It's about defending, being professional and coming 
to work every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen said one of the reasons he wants to play for Jackson is  
because he longs to return to the system in which they won six NBA 
titles together in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to play for Phil,'' Pippen said. ``(But) I'm not  
demanding a trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen averaged 14.5 points per game last season, his lowest  
since his rookie year, and shot a career-low 43.2 percent. He also 
averaged 6.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists.

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Fiasco Not End of World  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It wasn't the end of the world.  
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the end of the Ryder Cup, either, when some American  
players, caddies, wives, girlfriends and team officials turned one 
side of the 17th green at The Country Club into a mosh pit last 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	If only the bad behavior ended on this side of the Atlantic. But  
no. Reading about the event in any of the overheated London 
tabloids could leave you confused about which side invented the 
soccer riot. 
</P>
<P>
	``American players and their fans belong in the gutter,'' The  
Sun said. 
</P>
<P>
	``United Slobs of America,'' The Daily Mirror said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Disgusting,'' the Daily Mail piled on.  
</P>
<P>
	This little brouhaha is far from over. The next installment  
already sounds like a cage match. The Ryder Cup is two years off, 
but it continues to make news and probably will for weeks to come. 
Especially if the details that follow are anywhere near as juicy as 
the ones that have leaked out already. 
</P>
<P>
	We now know, for example, exactly how nutty the home team was  
behind closed doors Saturday night, praying one moment and then 
watching a video with Pamela Anderson Lee and the Dallas Cowboy 
cheerleaders both pleading for an American win. 
</P>
<P>
	And we know now how much more stoked a few of their fans lining  
the fairways were Sunday. At least one of those slobs spit on Jane 
James, the wife of European captain Mark James, and a few others 
said things about Colin Montgomerie that would have started a bar 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	And speaking of that, caddie Jerry Higginbotham turned up at the  
German Masters this week sporting a head wound, black eye and 
bruised cheek from an incident in a Boston bar just after the 
matches. Higginbotham, an American fired by Mark O'Meara who now 
carries the bag for Spanish teen sensation Sergio Garcia, said he 
got blind-sided after trading taunts with some bar patrons about 
working for the Europeans at the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes two to tango,'' Higginbotham said. ``What I should  
have done was walk away, but the whole thing leaves a sour taste in 
the mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart felt the same way. He played  
Montgomerie on Sunday and was so put off by the gallery's taunting 
of the Scotsman that he conceded the match -- but only after the 
14 1/2-13 1/2 win was assured. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say to Colin is I'm sorry for some of our fans. I  
was disgusted with some of the heckling that goes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a golf event for pride and honor,'' Stewart added.  
``It's not life and death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Crenshaw, in announcing Tuesday that he wouldn't be back as  
U.S. captain, repeated the apology he first offered Sunday. James, 
meanwhile, told British newspapers he wouldn't be back, period, and 
that a few of Europe's golfers might follow his lead and refuse to 
play in any more Ryder Cups on U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of players will not be bothered competing in American  
again,'' he said. ``Certainly that is the case with me. It's not 
something I would look forward to. We don't need to be treated like 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some places, at some times, the cultural divide is as wide as  
the pond that separates us. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, soccer players score, pull their jerseys over their  
heads and sometimes behave like trick-or-treaters on steroids. But 
the spectators usually stay seated until the end. Then they riot. 
</P>
<P>
	On this side, we're used to college kids spilling into end zones  
and onto basketball courts after the decisive catch or throw -- 
BEFORE the games end. 
</P>
<P>
	After the cops chase the kids back into the stands, we turn the  
clock back on (sometimes, even restoring a few ticks) and finish 
things. Then we go nuts again. 
</P>
<P>
	This has produced some wild endings, none better than the 1982  
college football game in which Cal scored on a 57-yard, 
five-lateral kickoff return to beat Stanford by weaving through the 
marching band that came onto the field in the waning seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why the Europeans have a point. Sometimes the improbable  
happens. The presence of Michael Jordan in the gallery at Brookline 
should have reminded us that at least two people have walked into 
the lion's den and lived to tell about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Maria Olazabal, who waited for the celebration to die down  
before taking his shot at immortality, doesn't belong in that 
company. But he did have a 20-foot putt to tie the match along the 
same line as Justin Leonard's 45-foot clinching blow. And anybody 
who wants to check the Spaniard's credentials should know he's won 
two Masters, including the last one, over much slicker greens at 
Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
	Half-court shots go in all the time, but only a tiny percentage  
of the total launched. This one didn't. The one regret is Olazabal 
had to wait to try. 
</P>
<P>
	No one should doubt the U.S. golfers were too geeked. Some media  
-- including this space -- went over the top. Crenshaw made those 
rallying points as well, begging his team to win one for every 
American golfing great, from the late Bobby Jones to Carl, the 
fictional greenskeeper in ``Caddyshack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he did his successor no favors. The stakes have been raised,  
and it falls to Europe, players and fans, to see if they can behave 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	One last bit of advice for whoever follows Crenshaw: Get the  
wives out of those matching outfits. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rare Tiger Cubs Make D.C. Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three rare Sumatran Tiger cubs enjoyed their  
coming out party at the National Zoo on Wednesday, frolicking in 
their den under the watchful eye of their mother and some curious 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrissie, Eric and Mike were born June 24 to Kerinci, a  
14-year-old tigress, but have been hidden from spectators until 
now. Each weighs about 27 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to watch them, because they're playful and they're  
cute. I also think they would make good pets, because if somebody 
tried to hurt me they could save me,'' said 7-year-old Kaitlyn 
Osteguin, who was visiting the zoo with her class. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiger that sired the cubs -- 8-year-old Rokan -- was kept away  
for fear he would hurt them. But looking on like a proud papa was 
curator John Seidensticker, credited by zoo officials with bringing 
Kerinci to Washington from a zoo in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great. This is what we do,'' said Seidensticker, as he  
watched the cubs play hide and seek among bamboo leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Kerinci's third litter. Conservationists say the zoo has  
helped to save the Sumatran Tiger from extinction. Fewer than 500 
live in the wild on the island of Sumatra, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one of Kerinci's other cubs, named Soy, remains at the  
National Zoo. Soy is expected to mate with Rokan someday. 
</P>
<P>
	A certain rivalry exists between mother and daughter. ``They  
would kill each other if we didn't keep them apart,'' said lion 
keeper Brad Blaine. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kerinci will stay here, the new cubs are expected to go to  
other zoos when they are about 2 years old, Seidensticker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrissie and Eric were named for children who won an art  
contest. Mike was named for Zoo Director Michael Robinson and the 
Smithsonian's outgoing director, I. Michael Heyman. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his namesakes, Mike isn't the one with the leadership  
skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chrissie is definitely the leader. She's the bold one,''  
Seidensticker said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sample Questions From Writing Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sample questions used by the National Assessment Governing Board  
to test the writing skills of fourth-graders, eighth-graders and 
12th-graders: 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-graders:  
</P>
<P>
	We all have favorite objects that we care about and would not  
want to give up. 
</P>
<P>
	Think of one object that is important or valuable to you. For  
example, it could be a book, a piece of clothing, a game, or any 
object you care about. 
</P>
<P>
	Write about your favorite object. Be sure to describe the object  
and explain why it is valuable or important to you. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Eighth-graders:  
</P>
<P>
	Imagine this situation!  
</P>
<P>
	A noise outside awakens you one night. You look out the window  
and see a spaceship. The door of the spaceship opens, and out walks 
a space creature. What does the creature look like? What does the 
creature do? What do you do? 
</P>
<P>
	Write a story about what happens next.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	12th-graders:  
</P>
<P>
	Your school is sponsoring a voter registration drive for  
18-year-old high school students. You and three of your friends are 
talking about the project. Your friends say the following. 
</P>
<P>
	Friend 1: ``I'm working on the young voters' registration drive.  
Are you going to come to it and register? You're all 18, so you can 
do it. We're trying to help increase the number of young people who 
vote and it shouldn't be too hard -- I read that the percentage of 
18- to 20-year-olds who vote increased in recent years. We want 
that percentage to keep going up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friend 2: ``I'll be there. People should vote as soon as they  
turn 18. It's one of the responsibilities of living in a 
democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friend 3: ``I don't know if people should even bother to  
register. One vote in an election isn't going to change anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Do you agree with friend 2 or 3? Write a response to your  
friends in which you explain whether you will or will not register 
to vote. Be sure to explain why and support your position with 
examples from your reading or experience. Try to convince the 
friend with whom you disagree that your position is the right one.

<HEADLINE> Bengals' Carter Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ki-Jana Carter is going to miss another season  
because of injury, adding to his legacy as a star-crossed No. 1 
draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Bengals put Carter on injured reserve Wednesday,  
three days after he dislocated his right kneecap in a 27-3 loss at 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	They also waived fullback Brian Milne, who was inactive the last  
two games because of a sprained knee. It was a surprising move for 
an 0-3 team that has the least-experienced roster in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a shame,'' said Milne, who has started 36 games in  
Cincinnati. ``Last year, I was told I was in the top five in 
fullbacks in the NFL. The Bengals are losing a real good 
fullback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals promoted running back Michael Basnight from their  
practice squad and claimed running back Sedrick Shaw off waivers 
from Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	For the third time since he was the No. 1 overall pick in 1995,  
Carter suffered a major injury when no one touched him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's freaky. It's unfortunate,'' coach Bruce Coslet said. ``I  
don't have an adjective to describe it. It's indescribable to me 
because I was counting on him and now I don't have him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter tore up his left knee on his third carry of the 1995  
preseason, going down after making a cut in the backfield before a 
defender touched him. He had reconstructive surgery and missed the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He tore the rotator cuff in his left shoulder early in the 1997  
season but continued to play. Last year, he shattered his wrist 
when he fell backwards after making a reception in the season 
opener, causing him to miss the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals planned to feature him in the backfield with Corey  
Dillon this year, but he dislocated his kneecap while changing 
direction after Jeff Blake threw an interception. 
</P>
<P>
	As with the broken wrist, Carter wasn't near a defender when he  
got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``People talk about is he snake-bit, just unlucky, is he jinxed,  
is he not taking care of himself, is he not in shape? None of the 
above? Who knows?'' Coslet said. ``I couldn't tell you. On the last 
two -- the broken wrist and the dislocated kneecap -- he didn't get 
touched, he just fell over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter wasn't at the team's practice facility Wednesday. He'll  
begin a rehabilitation program that might allow him to avoid 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Milne's teammates were stunned when they came out of Wednesday's  
meetings and saw him packing. He received one hug after another. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you what: With the look on some of these guys' faces  
when I told them, this team's going to be devastated,'' Milne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coslet declined to talk about the move.  
</P>
<P>
	General manager Mike Brown said in a telephone interview from  
home that Milne was waived because the team felt it needed another 
running back with Carter out. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, 26, played in the Browns' first three games, picking up  
two yards on three carries and eight yards on two receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian played hard and effectively for us,'' Brown said. ``We  
don't feel that we can afford to go into a game as thin at running 
back as we are. And Shaw is a veteran. He'll come in and he'll take 
a week or two to get up to speed perhaps, but at least when he does 
he's a guy who's been there before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milne said he'll file a grievance because he was waived while he  
was still recovering from the sprained knee.

<HEADLINE> Nobel in Literature Due Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- This year's Nobel Prize in literature  
will be announced Thursday, weeks earlier than most years, and only 
the Swedish Academy knows which world author will be crowned. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans John Updike, Thomas Pynchon, Philip Roth, and Joyce  
Carol Oates as well as Mario Vargas Llosa of Peru, Mexico's Carlos 
Fuentes, Guenter Grass of Germany and Belgian Hugo Claus, have all 
been mentioned as possible winners. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy revealed the announcement date on Tuesday. Custom  
dictates that the prize date be announced just days in advance. In 
a break from tradition, the newest Nobel laureate will be crowned 
on the last day of September. Usually, the literature award is 
announced on a Thursday in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are looking to the slightly earlier-than-usual announcement  
as a possible clue to the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can mean that it was an easy choice, in which case it's a  
storyteller,'' said Thomas Steinfeld of the Frankfurter Allgemeine 
Zeitung's literary section. ``And after all the Europeans the past 
years, I think it will be an American.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinfeld said he's rooting for Updike, whose four books about  
ex-basketball player Harry ``Rabbit'' Angstrom chronicle American 
life of the past half-century. 
</P>
<P>
	New York author Cynthia Ozick, who as a member of the American  
Academy of Arts and Letters has the right to suggest recipients, 
said either Pynchon or Roth would be a worthy recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are astonishments of the kind that don't come in every  
generation,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Salman Rushdie, the Booker Prize winner who lived  
under a death threat after his book ``The Satanic Verses'' was 
accused of blaspheming Islam. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued 
the fatwa, or religious edict, on Rushdie in 1989. The threat is 
now at least partly lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Swedish Academy has something to repair there,'' Steinfeld  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Secrecy has surrounded this year's selection, just as it has  
since the academy began making its choices in 1901. The awards are 
funded by a trust set up in the will of Swedish industrialist 
Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy, founded in 1786, has 18 members, though one chair  
is vacant and three members don't participate. Academy members, 
former recipients and a select group of literature and language 
professors and specialists in the field may suggest candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobel Prize winners receive their prizes, this year worth  
$960,000, on Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Saramago of Portugal won last year's Nobel Prize in  
literature.

<HEADLINE> Garcia's Caddie: I Was Attacked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Boorish conduct by U.S. fans at the  
Ryder Cup didn't stop at the course. 
</P>
<P>
	The American caddie for European Ryder Cup star Sergio Garcia  
said Wednesday he was attacked in a hotel bar after the tournament 
and had to go to a hospital with a head wound. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Higginbotham, sporting a black eye and bruised cheek, said  
several men taunted him because he was an American working with the 
European team. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the guys had obviously had a bad day and had definitely  
had too much to drink,'' said Higginbotham, caddie this week for 
Garcia in the German Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Boston and Brookline, Mass., on Wednesday said they  
have no record of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation is the latest instance of hostility  
surrounding the tournament, in which the United States made the 
greatest comeback in the history of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans were angered by the celebrations of the Americans  
on the 17th green after Justin Leonard made a 45-foot putt that led 
the U.S. team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The European team and British media assailed the rowdy  
galleries. European star Colin Montgomerie was heckled mercilessly 
and a fan spit on the wife of European captain Mark James. 
</P>
<P>
	James said European golfers might refuse to play another Ryder  
Cup in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Higginbotham, who caddied for American Mark O'Meara at the 1997  
Ryder Cup in Spain, described the attack in the hotel bar. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said some things I didn't like and I said a couple of  
things back to him because I'll always defend myself,'' he said. 
``And then boom, he comes up on the blind side and down I went, 
hitting my head on the way down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higginbotham took some of the blame.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I should have done was walk away,'' he said, ``but the  
whole thing leaves a sour taste in the mouth.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Treasury Head Notes Complacency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert  
Rubin warned Wednesday that the world has grown complacent about 
its financial system as it has emerged from a series of crises. 
</P>
<P>
	``With each successfully averted crisis, with each near miss,  
our complacent certainty that matters will always work out grows, 
as does the unsoundness of our decisions,'' Rubin said in a 
comments prepared for delivery to a meeting of global business 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the world financial system has grown stronger after  
two to three years of crisis. He credited the international 
community, including the International Monetary Fund, for trying to 
ensure that globalization continues. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the underlying problems have not vanished,'' he said. ``I  
believe the greatest danger we now face is the danger of 
complacency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that technology, globalization and other factors are  
changing economics. 
</P>
<P>
	Vulnerable countries must continue reforms and ``too often,  
despite real progress, substantial commitments have not been fully 
met,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> UAW Deals Put Pressure on Ford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers  
appear to have patched up their relationship with a lucrative 
four-year contract -- but at steep price for GM, industry experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That deal puts even more pressure on Ford Motor Co., the last of  
the major automakers still negotiating with the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative agreements reached Tuesday between the UAW, GM and  
its former parts division Delphi Automotive Systems provide 185,000 
workers with 3 percent pay raises each year for four years and a 
signing bonus of $1,350, a source close to the talks said. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG had a similar contract approved for 75,000  
workers last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower-level talks with Ford have gone on while the UAW worked on  
contracts with GM and DaimlerChrysler. The UAW typically expects 
all three automakers to accept the same terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Ford, basically the writing's on the wall that they're  
going to take the same deal,'' said Stephen Girsky, an analyst with 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said with record sales and profits at all three  
automakers, both sides were eager to avoid a strike. That gave the 
union an opportunity to craft better deals while putting some 
pressure on the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	For GM, ``the deal is expensive,'' Girsky said. ``The UAW got a  
great deal from Chrysler and the number of things GM could do were 
limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW has not announced a date for a ratification vote, and  
said it would not release any details of the agreements until then. 
The companies also declined to release any details. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delphi contract allows workers to transfer back to GM when  
openings occur, a union source said, and gives them until Jan. 1 to 
retire with GM pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Free Press said GM also agreed to a provision in the  
DaimlerChrysler contract governing how quickly it must replace 
workers who retire. Under that clause, the companies could replace 
one of every two or three workers who retire as long as employment 
stayed above certain levels. 
</P>
<P>
	While the union and Ford have enjoyed warm relations over the  
past several years, there appear to be strains over its Visteon 
parts unit. The union opposes a spinoff of Visteon, which has about 
28,500 UAW members, saying it could lead to pay cuts, plant 
closures and fewer union jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Labor Day parade in Detroit, many marchers carried  
signs depicting Visteon as ``the alien within.'' And the 
DaimlerChrysler contract contains a promise from the company not to 
close, sell or spin-off any factory or business unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry experts said it was unlikely the UAW could stop a  
Visteon spin-off, but the union could help shape the deal by 
requiring pension and job protections like those at Delphi. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they stop Ford when everyone else has already spun off  
parts divisions, they could seem hypocritical,'' said Dale 
Brickner, an emeritus professor at Michigan State University's 
School of Labor and Industrial Relations. ``They have the political 
problem of people (working) in Ford being very upset. It may be a 
trade of dollars for principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM has been working to mend fences with the UAW after last  
summer's 54-day strike at two Flint parts factories. The strike 
virtually shut down the automaker's North American production, 
costing GM about $2 billion in lost revenue and a chunk of market 
share it has yet to recover.

<HEADLINE> Six Bodies Found in Alabama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENTERPRISE, Ala. (AP) -- A muddy 1989 Chevrolet Caprice with six  
bodies inside was pulled from the Pea River on Wednesday, ending a 
mystery that began in May when a group of friends disappeared after 
a night of partying. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle's license plate matched the missing Caprice  
belonging to Lamar Junior Stackhouse, 25, of Enterprise. It was 
discovered Wednesday afternoon by authorities still following the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsies were planned to determine how the six died, though  
investigators said the damage indicated the car ran off a bridge 
and crashed into the river. 
</P>
<P>
	Stackhouse and his friends, all in their 20s, disappeared after  
leaving a nightclub May 9. Investigators said they had found no 
evidence of foul play.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG SUR, Calif. (AP) -- Temperatures in the 90s made work tougher  
on firefighters battling wildfires that have burned more 125,000 
acres of California wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the higher temperatures, the higher winds and the low  
humidity, you do have more active fires,'' said fire information 
officer Juanita Freel. ``But that's not the main difficulty in 
fighting these fires. It's the terrain. It's steep and rugged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,300 firefighters were battling two large wildfires that  
had burned 49,543 acres in the Los Padres National Forest on the 
scenic central California coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire lines that were expanded Monday to protect homes north of  
Lucia, on the coast about 115 miles south of San Francisco, 
continued to hold Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents were evacuated from the area on Monday. Fire officials  
did not know the exact number of residents told to leave, but said 
there were up to a dozen homes and numerous other buildings at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	A camp helper in Trinity Alps Wilderness died late Monday after  
suffering a heart attack while being evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest problem was the Hare Fire, which had burned 20,993  
acres as of Tuesday and was only 20 percent contained. Another 
fire, the Tassajara fire, had burned 28,450 acres and was 45 
percent contained. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of fires started by lightning last month had burned  
more than 77,000 acres in the region by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, low humidity and winds gusting to 30 miles an hour  
pushed the so-called Megram Fire over containment lines, burning 
60,602 acres by late Tuesday. It was 40 percent contained. 
</P>
<P>
	To the south in Shasta County, fire fighters continued to  
monitor a wildfire that destroyed 49 homes and 110 other buildings 
on Sunday. The Happy Valley fire burned 2,580 acres and caused an 
estimated $1 million in damage, said Dee Floyd of the California 
Department of Forestry. Full control of the blaze was expected by 
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> After-Hours Traders To Get Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The organization that operates the New York  
Stock Exchange ticker tape -- which feeds prices to Web sites and 
streams them across TV screens -- will extend its hours of operation 
to help answer calls for a centralized stock information system. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra shift -- from 5:15 p.m. Eastern time to 6:35 p.m. --  
could begin as early as Monday. The change requires final approval 
from the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The move will give after-hours investors more information and  
follows a similar one by the organization that runs the Nasdaq 
Stock Market, meaning that the closing price for most stocks is 
effectively pushed back by one hour and 20 minutes. That could 
force mutual funds, newspapers and others who tally such figures to 
rethink how they will publish the information. 
</P>
<P>
	The proliferation of after-hours trading sessions scattered  
across a number of different stock markets and electronic trading 
networks has prompted calls for the extension of hours of 
centralized stock information systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the NYSE, Nasdaq Stock Market and American Stock  
Exchange all close at 4 p.m., trading now goes on at some regional 
exchanges and electronic networks into the early evening. However 
stock price data is currently collected until 5:15 p.m., making 
that the traditional cutoff time for official closing prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Jones, a professor of finance at the Columbia University  
Business School in New York, said the extended NYSE ticker hours 
are ``a first step'' toward creating a single, centralized market 
information system, a move recently advocated by Securities and 
Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by the Consolidated Tape Association, which  
disseminates NYSE stock quotes, means investors will have one more 
tool for obtaining ``timely stock price information on trades 
taking place in the after-hours markets,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The extension of ticker hours was prompted by a request from the  
Chicago Stock Exchange, which trades NYSE-listed stocks for 
regional customers and has applied to the SEC to extend its hours 
to 6:30 p.m. The NYSE and the Nasdaq are also planning extended 
sessions, but not until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul O'Kelly, an executive vice president at the Chicago  
exchange, said the extended session won't be approved until the 
exchange can show that information on after-hours trades will be 
properly disseminated. 
</P>
<P>
	``An essential part of running a market is dissemination of  
quotes,'' O'Kelly said. ``Now, just as there is during the day, we 
expect that there will be widespread dissemination of stock quotes 
that take place in the after-hours markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Kelly said the decision to extend Consolidated Tape  
Association ticker hours will grow in importance as additional 
regional exchanges extend their hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the tape association will only affect investors  
who trade on its member exchanges. That group includes the NYSE, 
the Nasdaq and American Stock Exchange, and the regional exchanges 
in Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of electronic networks have proposed creating their  
own centralized price dissemination system similar to the 
association. Currently, investors can only get information on the 
specific electronic network where they are trading, which has led 
to criticism that the after-hours sessions are too fragmented 
because investors may not know where to get the best price. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates  
the Nasdaq, announced last month that it will try to get more 
information to after-hours investors by making Nasdaq stock prices 
available at a central location until 6:30 p.m. beginning Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	All of this raises questions about how mutual funds, newspapers  
and other organizations that use closing stock prices will adapt to 
the changes brought on by the growing popularity of after-hours 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The mutual fund industry has said it will continue to price  
funds based on the 4 p.m. closing time of the NYSE and the Nasdaq 
until after-hours trading volume warrants a change. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers will likely adapt on an individual basis. For  
example, West Coast papers, whose deadlines are later than East 
Coast papers, may use the updated quotes for their stock tables. 
Other papers may use a list of stocks that trade actively after 
hours. Still others may choose to use the prices disseminated at 
5:15 p.m., when the Consolidated Tape Association and Nasdaq 
currently shut down their pricing systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicly traded companies, which often wait until after the  
close of the traditional markets at 4 p.m. to make important 
announcements, are not expected to change that practice.

<HEADLINE> Diet Drug Co. Still Wants To Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A court ruling against a marketer of one of  
its diet drugs will not derail American Home Products Corp.'s 
efforts to settle thousands of diet pill lawsuits filed against it, 
a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge rejected a $100 million ``limited fund''  
settlement proposed by Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. of 
Lexington, Mass., in connection with its marketing of the diet drug 
Redux, saying he was uncertain it would be fair to all who might 
have claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any settlement that American Home Products might reach in the  
diet drug litigation would in no way be a `limited fund' 
non-opt-out settlement, and the Interneuron decision is therefore 
inapplicable to American Home Products' position,'' spokesman Doug 
Petkus said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Petkus declined to comment on how or whether settlement talks  
are progressing. ``When and if the parties do enter into a final 
agreement, the details will become public,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6 million people took Redux and its chemical cousin  
Pondimin. Pondimin, whose generic name is fenfluramine, was part of 
the once-popular drug combination called fen-phen. Redux and 
fenfluramine were pulled from the market in 1997 after being linked 
to heart valve problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Interneuron marketed Redux from 1996 to 1997 under an agreement  
with American Home Products' Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories division in 
St. Davids. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 25,000 people had filed claims to share in  
Interneuron's ``limited fund'' settlement, some claiming 
heart-valve damage and others, unable to document current ailments, 
claiming fear of future health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 34-page memorandum Monday, U.S. District Judge Louis C.  
Bechtle said he had ``constitutional concerns'' because the deal 
would not allow claimants to opt out and seek separate trials if 
they wish. And he said Interneuron had additional assets that were 
not part of the settlement fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Interneuron proposed to place $15 million in cash and $28  
million in proceeds in the limited fund, and the fund was to 
receive $55 million in royalties from future products if those 
products succeed, a provision Bechtle called ``fraught with risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Wruble, an attorney for Interneuron, said the company  
probably will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The claimants also are considering whether to appeal Bechtle's  
ruling, said Michael Fishbein, an attorney for plaintiffs in the 
diet-drug litigation. He would not comment on the impact on overall 
settlement negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that the ramifications of this decision are  
far-reaching insofar as the ability to reach a settlement,'' 
Fishbein said. ``As far as remainder of litigation is concerned, we 
will just proceed forward.''

<HEADLINE> 38 Hurt in School Bus Crash in Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BLOOMFIELD, Ohio (AP) -- A school bus carrying  
seventh-graders on a field trip flipped over on the side of a rural 
highway on Wednesday, injuring 38 students. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus apparently slipped off the shoulder of the narrow  
two-lane road, and the driver overcorrected, Pickaway County 
Sheriff's Lt. J. Phillip Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the injured students and the driver had bumps and  
bruises. One child with a shoulder injury was in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Superintendent Ron Thornton said the students were on an annual  
field trip to the Ohio Renaissance Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel very fortunate that it wasn't worse,'' he said.  
``Thank God for that.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> AIDS Hitting Women More in Americas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- AIDS used to claim two men for  
every woman in Trinidad and Tobago. Today, seven out of eight young 
AIDS victims are female -- a change that augurs an explosion of the 
disease in Latin America and the Caribbean, authorities warned 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In some American nations, up to 15 percent of AIDS patients are  
children infected by their mothers and born with the disease, said 
Dr. Fernando Zacarias, director of the Pan American Health 
Organization's AIDS program said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's health minister, Hamza Rafeeq, noted that most male  
victims in Trinidad were aged 40-50 and most female ones 15-25, 
suggesting that ``older men are having sex with young girls and 
infecting more than one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report to the annual meeting of PAHO, the Western  
Hemisphere suffers one of the world's highest rates of HIV, the 
virus that leads to AIDS. PAHO estimates that 1.6 million people 
are living with HIV in Latin America and the Caribbean and close to 
1 million in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Rates of infection range from about 1 in 200 to 1 in 50 in the  
Caribbean, the hardest-hit area in the world after sub-Saharan 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Zacarias said the Americas have to wake up to the size of the  
AIDS epidemic before it reaches that of Africa, where it is 
ravaging societies and has caused a drop in food production. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally associated with homosexual men and intravenous drug  
users, in recent years the AIDS epidemic has shifted to younger 
people, and from middle-class victims to poor and illiterate 
populations with little or no access to health services, Zacarias 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His report generated the most intense discussion so far at  
PAHO's five-day conference of more than 30 health ministers, which 
ends Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several ministers said their countries cannot afford to treat  
AIDS patients and urged PAHO to find ways to lower the cost of 
medication. Chile's health minister, Alex Figueroa Munoz, suggested 
that the region's governments consider joining together to buy 
drugs in bulk. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil was the only country to report that it provides free of  
charge the antiretroviral therapy that can keep AIDS victims alive. 
Some 70,000 people are infected with the virus in the South 
American country of 170 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad and Tobago, on the other hand, cannot afford to treat  
AIDS at all, Rafeeq told the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is projected that the financial impact of HIV-AIDS alone  
could absorb our entire health budget for the year 2000,'' he said. 
The budget is nearly $160 million. PAHO estimates that it costs up 
to $15,000 a year to treat one AIDS patient. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Trinidad will start providing free treatment to  
pregnant AIDS victims to counter the increasing number of infected 
newborn babies. Researchers estimate that 400 of the 20,000 babies 
born in Trinidad last year were infected with the AIDS virus, 
Rafeeq said.

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Chagrined Chris Mims faces discipline from the  
San Diego Chargers for allegedly assaulting a man and taking his 
tacos during a confrontation outside a fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers have made a big public relations push in recent  
months, so they weren't pleased to see the defensive end's name in 
a police report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, our club in no way condones any behavior that seems  
to have occurred here,'' coach Mike Riley said after practice 
Wednesday. ``I'm very disappointed in that. At the same time, we've 
dealt with Chris behind our doors and we're making every move to 
get this thing straightened away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he had imposed some type of discipline, but he  
wouldn't give specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it's not all completed yet,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Police are investigating a 23-year-old man's claim that the  
300-pound Mims shoved his face into a wall, stole his tacos and 
struck him twice with a belt early Monday morning, some 10 hours 
after the Chargers lost their home opener to Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. McKinney told police he was attacked after he made a  
comment about Mims getting out of a limo and then urinating in the 
parking lot at a downtown Del Taco. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims seemed contrite and embarrassed when he talked with  
reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the worst thing that probably ever happened to me,''  
he said, noting all the media attention to the incident. ``I've 
just got to deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't discuss the specifics of what happened, citing legal  
concerns. ``I'm just sorry that this all happened,'' Mims said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wanted to apologize to his family, teammates, the  
Chargers organization and the fans, who he says have been 
supportive during his two stints as a Charger. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims wouldn't say if he'd apologized to McKinney. He also  
wouldn't comment on whether he'd talked to police, who say Mims 
left the scene before officers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney said Wednesday that he hadn't heard from Mims or anyone  
else with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims spent about 15 minutes on the sideline Wednesday speaking  
with the team's pastor, Shawn Mitchell. The Chargers' first-round 
draft pick in 1992, Mims was released in April 1997. He rejoined in 
June 1998 and has been a reserve ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he'd been fined, Mims said: ``I'll find out.''  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ryan Leaf had a good day. Now the third-string  
quarterback, Leaf threw for the first time since undergoing surgery 
on his right shoulder on July 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf made about 15 easy tosses of about 10-15 yards. ``I'm all  
smiles about it,'' said Leaf, who is on the active roster but 
probably won't be in playing shape until late October. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with trainer James Collins, ``I tried to test it a  
little bit, but he told me to tone it down,'' Leaf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf missed all of last week with the flu and didn't attend  
Sunday's home loss to the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers (1-1) play host to AFC West rival Kansas City (2-1)  
on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Dudley Moore Has Brain Disorder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- Dudley Moore is beginning to have  
vision problems as an incurable degenerative brain disorder he has 
had for several years progresses, his doctors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, 64, was diagnosed several months ago with progressive  
supranuclear palsy, a rare disorder related to Parkinson's disease, 
said Dr. Thomas Galski, who has been working with Moore at the 
Kessler Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in the very early stages of this disease, but vision  
problems have started to creep in,'' Galski said. He said Moore was 
undergoing physical and speech therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, known for the 1981 movie ``Arthur,'' said in a statement  
Wednesday: ``I understand that one person in 100,000 suffers from 
this disease, and I am also aware that there are 100,000 of my 
union, the Screen Actors Guild, who are working every day. I think, 
therefore, it is in some way considerate of me that I have taken on 
this disease for myself, thus protecting the remaining 99,999 SAG 
members from this fate.''

<HEADLINE> Stars Shed Debris Disks at Same Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The same gravitational shoving match that swept dense swarms of  
comets and asteroids from our solar system long ago is apparently 
at work around dozens of nearby stars, astronomers reported today 
in the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings suggest there's a distinct timeline in the  
evolution of solar systems -- at least in the violent ``clean up'' 
stage believed to cap the planet-forming process. 
</P>
<P>
	European astronomers scrutinized infrared images of 84 stars of  
varying sizes and intensity, looking for the planet-forming disks 
of dust, asteroids and comets that encircle many young stars like 
Saturn's rings. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that most of the stars shed their gritty halos at  
about 400 million years of age -- the age the sun is believed to 
have done the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The images from the European Space Agency's Infrared Space  
Observatory showed that only 15 of the 84 stars had stellar debris 
disks and nine of those encircled stars under 400 million years of 
age. Sixty-three of the 69 stars lacking disks were older than 400 
million years. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said that means 90 percent of stars cast off  
their debris disks between 300 and 400 million years of age. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were quite surprised that things separated so neatly,''  
said lead researcher H. J. Habing of the Leiden Observatory, 
Leiden, the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the team didn't see any planets orbiting the stars, their  
work matches the time frame during which our solar system's 
late-forming outer planets probably thinned out planetary leftovers 
by catapulting comets and asteroids into deep space, said Dana 
Backman, a professor of physics and astronomy at Franklin &AMP; 
Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, our solar system became an orderly place with planets  
circling the Sun in roughly the same orbits they currently occupy. 
</P>
<P>
	Backman said the disk-less stars Habing's team saw likely  
witnessed a scenario similar to that believed to have followed the 
formation of Uranus and Neptune. Scientists think the gravitational 
influence of those two outermost gas planets helped thin out the 
debris disk by ejecting material into the Kuiper Belt -- a 
collection of small, icy bodies circling the sun beyond Neptune's 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	About the same time, Jupiter -- and to a lesser degree Saturn --  
are believed to have hurled icy bodies far beyond the solar system 
to form a shell-like cloud of comets called the Oort Cloud. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller inner planets -- Mars, Mercury -- still bear the scars  
from this chaotic period, when they were pummeled with asteroid and 
comet impacts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was basically time to get under the table in the solar  
system because there was all this stuff flying around,'' Backman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weathering has erased most of the Earth's scars from this  
period, but they are well-preserved on the Moon, which lacks an 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Lunine, a professor of planetary sciences at the  
University of Arizona in Tucson, said a powerful infrared 
observatory set to launch in late 2001 will likely shed more light 
on stellar debris disks. 
</P>
<P>
	Pluto Express, a spacecraft proposed for launch in 2004, would  
swoop past Pluto and could determine if the outermost planet really 
qualifies as a planet, or -- as many astronomers suspect -- is just 
another leftover given the boot by Neptune as it tidied up its 
neighborhood, Lunine said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pluto's probably the biggest brick left over from the  
construction of the planets,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-GIs Tell AP of Korea Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *CHARLES J. HANLEY   	
</P>
<P>
                         *and MARTHA MENDOZA    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	It was a story no one wanted to hear: Early in the Korean War,  
villagers said, American soldiers machine-gunned hundreds of 
helpless civilians under a railroad bridge in the South Korean 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	When the families spoke out, seeking redress, they met only  
rejection and denial, from the U.S. military and their own 
government in Seoul. Now a dozen ex-GIs have spoken, too, and 
support their story with haunting memories from a ``forgotten'' 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	These American veterans of the Korean War say that in late July  
1950, in the conflict's first desperate weeks, U.S. troops -- young, 
green and scared -- killed a large number of South Korean refugees, 
many of them women and children, trapped beneath a bridge at a 
hamlet called No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews with The Associated Press, ex-GIs speak of 100,  
200 or simply hundreds dead. The Koreans, whose claim for 
compensation was rejected last year, say 300 were shot to death at 
the bridge and 100 died in a preceding air attack. 
</P>
<P>
	American soldiers, in their third day at the warfront, feared  
North Korean infiltrators among the fleeing South Korean peasants, 
veterans said. ``It was assumed there were enemy in these people,'' 
ex-rifleman Herman Patterson told The AP. 
</P>
<P>
	American commanders had ordered units retreating through South  
Korea to shoot civilians as a defense against disguised enemy 
soldiers, according to once-classified documents found by the AP in 
months of researching U.S. military archives and interviewing 
veterans across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Six veterans of the 1st Cavalry Division said they fired on the  
refugee throng at No Gun Ri, and six others said they witnessed the 
shootings. More said they knew or heard about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just annihilated them,'' said ex-machine gunner Norman  
Tinkler of Glasco, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	After five decades, none gave a complete, detailed account. But  
ex-GIs agreed on such elements as time and place, and on the 
preponderance of women, children and old men among the victims. 
They also disagreed: Some said they were fired on from beneath the 
bridge, but others said they don't remember hostile fire. One said 
they later found a few disguised North Korean soldiers among the 
dead. But others disputed this. 
</P>
<P>
	Some soldiers refused to shoot what one described as ``civilians  
just trying to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30 Korean claimants -- survivors and victims' relatives --  
said it was an unprovoked, three-day carnage. ``The American 
soldiers played with our lives like boys playing with flies,'' said 
Chun Choon-ja, a 12-year-old girl at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the Koreans have said in a series of petitions, some  
300 refugees lay dead under the bridge's twin arches. About 100 
others were killed in a preceding attack by U.S. Air Force planes, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
	That would make No Gun Ri one of only two known cases of  
large-scale killings of noncombatants by U.S. ground troops in this 
century's major wars, military law experts note. The other was 
Vietnam's My Lai massacre, in 1968, in which more than 500 
Vietnamese may have died. 
</P>
<P>
	From the start of the 1950-53 conflict, North Korean atrocities  
were widely reported -- killing of civilians and summary executions 
of prisoners. But the story of No Gun Ri has remained undisclosed 
for a half-century, despite sketchy news reports in 1950 implying 
U.S. troops may have fired on refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	No Gun Ri's dead were not alone. Veterans told the AP of two  
smaller but similar refugee killings in July and August 1950. They 
also told of refusing orders to fire on civilians in other cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds more South Koreans were killed on Aug. 3, 1950, when  
retreating U.S. commanders blew up two bridges as refugees streamed 
across, according to ex-GIs, Korean eyewitnesses and declassified 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans wanted to deny the crossings to the enemy,  
reported massing more than 15 miles away. But the general 
overseeing one bridge-blowing, the 1st Cavalry Division commander, 
had sought to stop the refugee flow as well. He told a 
correspondent he was sure most refugees were North Korean 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades in U.S.-allied South Korea, the No Gun Ri claimants  
were discouraged from speaking out. After they filed for 
compensation in 1997, their claim was rejected by the South Korean 
government on a technicality. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military has said repeatedly it found no basis in the  
historical record for the allegations. The AP archival research 
also found no official Army account of the events. 
</P>
<P>
	After the AP report was released Wednesday, chief Pentagon  
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, ``If there's compelling new evidence 
to look at, obviously it would be important to make sure we've left 
no stone unturned in getting to the bottom of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon commented while traveling with Defense Secretary William  
Cohen on a visit to Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Some elements of the No Gun Ri episode are unclear: What chain  
of officers gave open-fire orders? Did GIs see gunfire from the 
refugees or their own ricochets? How many soldiers refused to fire? 
How high in the ranks did knowledge of the events extend? 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean conflict, which ended in stalemate, began on June 25,  
1950, when the communist North invaded and sent the South Korean 
army and a small U.S. force reeling southward toward the 
peninsula's tip. 
</P>
<P>
	American units were rushed from Japan to stop the North Koreans.  
The 1st Cavalry Division -- poorly equipped and ill-trained -- went 
in with little understanding of Korea. Half its sergeants had been 
transferred to other divisions. Teen-age riflemen and young 
officers with no combat experience were thrust overnight into a 
hellish war, told to expect guerrilla fighting and be wary of the 
tens of thousands of South Korean civilians pouring south with 
retreating Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The untested 7th Cavalry Regiment, part of the 1st Cavalry  
Division, reached the front July 24. Within a day many of its 2nd 
Battalion infantrymen were scattering in panic, tossing away 
weapons, at word of an enemy breakthrough nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Records show that on the third day, July 26, the battalion's 660  
men were regrouped and dug in at No Gun Ri, a hamlet 100 miles 
southeast of Seoul, South Korea's capital. Word was circulating 
that northern soldiers disguised in white peasant garb might try to 
penetrate U.S. lines via refugee groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees who approached the 2nd Battalion's lines on July 26  
were South Koreans rousted from two nearby villages by American 
soldiers, who warned them the North Koreans were coming, Korean 
claimants told the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Declassified records show that 1st Cavalry Division soldiers did  
move through that village area the previous three days. 
</P>
<P>
	As the refugees neared No Gun Ri, leading ox carts, some with  
children on their backs, American soldiers ordered them off the 
southbound dirt road and onto a parallel railroad track, the South 
Koreans said. Ex-sergeant George Preece remembered the way was 
being cleared for U.S. Army vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	What then happened under the concrete bridge cannot be  
reconstructed in full detail five decades later. Some ex-GIs poured 
out chilling memories of the scene, but others offered only 
fragments, or abruptly ended their interviews. Over the three days, 
no one saw everything: Koreans were cowering under fire, and 
Americans were dug into positions over hundreds of yards of hilly 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	But old soldiers in their late 60s or 70s identified the No Gun  
Ri bridge from photographs, remembered the approximate dates, and 
corroborated the core of the Koreans' account: that American troops 
kept the refugees pinned under the bridge in late July 1950, and 
killed almost all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just wholesale slaughter,'' Patterson told the AP in an  
interview at his Greer, S.C., home. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Koreans and several ex-GIs said the killing began when  
American planes suddenly swooped in and strafed an area where the 
white-clad refugees were resting. 
</P>
<P>
	Bodies fell everywhere, and terrified parents dragged children  
into a narrow culvert beneath the tracks, the Koreans told the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Declassified U.S. Air Force mission reports from mid-1950 show  
that pilots sometimes attacked ``people in white,'' apparently 
because of suspicions North Korean soldiers were disguised among 
them. The report for one mission of four F-80 jets, for example, 
said the airborne controller ``said to fire on people in white 
clothes. Were about 50 in group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forward controllers in light planes directed pilots to such  
unplanned targets in mid-flight. The Korean claimants say a light 
plane circled their area immediately before the strafing. 
</P>
<P>
	The strafing may have been a mistake. Ex-GIs said a company  
commander had called for an airstrike, but against enemy artillery 
miles up the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran Delos Flint remembers being caught with other soldiers  
in the strafing and piling into a culvert with refugees. Then 
``somebody, maybe our guys, was shooting in at us,'' he said. He 
and his comrades eventually slipped out. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Col. Robert M. Carroll, then a 25-year-old first  
lieutenant, remembers battalion riflemen opening fire on the 
refugees from their foxholes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is right after we get orders that nobody comes through,  
civilian, military, nobody,'' said Carroll, now living in 
Lansdowne, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	That morning, the U.S. 8th Army had radioed orders throughout  
the Korean front that began, ``No repeat no refugees will be 
permitted to cross battle lines at any time,'' according to 
declassified documents located at the National Archives in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days earlier, 1st Cavalry Division headquarters issued a  
more explicit order: ``No refugees to cross the front line. Fire 
everyone trying to cross lines. Use discretion in case of women and 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the neighboring 25th Infantry Division, the commander, Maj.  
Gen. William B. Kean, told his troops that since South Koreans were 
to have been evacuated from the battle zone, ``all civilians seen 
in this area are to be considered as enemy and action taken 
accordingly.'' His staff relayed this as ``considered as unfriendly 
and shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Military experts in the law of war told the AP they had never  
heard of such blanket kill orders in the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
	``An order to fire on civilians is patently an illegal order,''  
said retired Col. Scott Silliman of Duke University, an Air Force 
lawyer for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said he ``wasn't convinced this was enemy,'' and he got  
the rifle companies to cease firing on the refugees. The lieutenant 
then shepherded a boy to safety under a double-arched concrete 
railroad bridge nearby, where shaken and wounded Koreans were 
gathered. He said he saw no threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There weren't any North Koreans in there the first day, I'll  
tell you that. It was mainly women and kids and old men,'' recalled 
Carroll, who said he then left the area and knows nothing about 
what followed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans directed the refugees into the bridge underpasses  
-- each 80 feet long, 23 feet wide, 30 feet high -- and after dark 
opened fire on them from nearby machine-gun positions, the Koreans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans said Capt. Melbourne C. Chandler, after speaking with  
superior officers by radio, had ordered machine-gunners from his 
heavy-weapons company to set up near the tunnel mouths and open 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chandler said, `The hell with all those people. Let's get rid  
of all of them,''' said Eugene Hesselman of Fort Mitchell, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know if they were North or South Koreans. ... We  
were there only a couple of days and we didn't know them from a 
load of coal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-GIs believe the order was cleared at battalion headquarters,  
a half-mile to the rear, or at a higher level. Chandler and other 
key officers are now dead, but the AP was able to locate the 
colonel who commanded the battalion, Herbert B. Heyer, 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyer, of Sandy Springs, Ga., denied knowing anything about the  
shootings and said, ``I know I didn't give such an order.'' 
Veterans said the colonel apparently was leaving battalion 
operations to subordinates at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The bursts of gunfire killed those near the tunnel entrances  
first, the Korean claimants said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People pulled dead bodies around them for protection,'' said  
Chung Koo-ho, 61. ``Mothers wrapped their children with blankets 
and hugged them with their backs toward the entrances. ... My 
mother died on the second day of shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recalled machine-gunner Edward L. Daily: ``Some may have been  
trying to crawl deeper for protection. When you see something like 
that and you're frightened, you start to claw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During three nights under fire, some trapped refugees managed to  
slip away, but others were shot as they tried to escape or crawled 
out to find clean water to drink, the Koreans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans disagreed on whether gunfire came from the underpasses.  
</P>
<P>
	Some, like ex-sergeant James T. Kerns of Piedmont, S.C., said  
the Americans were answering fire from among the refugees. 
Hesselman said, ``Every now and then you'd hear a shot, like a 
rifle shot.'' But others recalled only heavy barrages of American 
firepower, not hostile fire. ``I don't remember shooting coming 
out,'' said ex-rifleman Louis Allen of Bristol, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Koreans said the Americans may have been seeing their own  
comrades' fire, ricocheting through from the tunnels' opposite 
ends. That's possible, said Preece. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could actually have happened, that they were seeing our own  
fire. ... We were scared to death,'' said Preece, a career soldier 
who later fought in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 28, the 7th Cavalry was told to prepare to pull back  
again early the next morning. The final barrage still echoes in the 
memories of old soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``On summer nights when the breeze is blowing, I can still hear  
their cries, the little kids screaming,'' said Daily, of 
Clarksville, Tenn., who went on to earn a battlefield commission in 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds of slaughter haunt Park Hee-sook's memory, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can still hear the moans of women dying in a pool of  
blood,'' said Park, then a girl of 16. ``Children cried and clung 
to their dead mothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone fired, veterans said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some of us did and some of us didn't,'' said Flint, of Clio,  
Mich., the soldier who had been briefly caught in the culvert with 
the refugees. ``... I wouldn't fire at anybody in the tunnel like 
that. It was civilians just trying to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerns, a machine gunner, said he fired over the refugees' heads.  
``I would not fire into a bunch of women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the fury subsided, Kerns said, he, Preece and another GI  
found at least seven dead North Korean soldiers in the underpasses, 
wearing uniforms under peasant white. 
</P>
<P>
	But Preece, of Dunville, Ky., said he doesn't remember making  
such a search or even hearing that North Koreans were found. None 
of the other veterans, when asked, remembered seeing North Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerns also said weapons were recovered. Hesselman said someone  
later displayed a submachine gun. Preece recalled only ``hearsay'' 
about weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	All 24 South Korean survivors interviewed individually by the AP  
said they remembered no North Koreans or gunfire directed at the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	American military intelligence reports from those days, since  
declassified, place the North Korean front line four miles from No 
Gun Ri on July 26, when the refugees entered the underpasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on July 29, the 7th Cavalry pulled back. North Korean  
troops who moved in found ``about 400 bodies of old and young 
people and children,'' the North Korean newspaper Cho Sun In Min Bo 
reported three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Some ex-GIs today estimate 100 or fewer were killed. But those  
close to the bridge, from Chandler's H Company, generally put the 
total at about 200. ``A lot'' also were killed in the strafing, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Koreans buried some dead in unknown locations and  
surviving relatives buried others, the villagers said. Because 
families then scattered across South Korea, the claimants said, 
they have the names of only 120 dead, primarily their own 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The war, in all, claimed an estimated 1 million South Korean  
civilian casualties -- killed, wounded or missing. Almost 37,000 
Americans died. 
</P>
<P>
	At 1st Cavalry headquarters, division commander Maj. Gen. Hobart  
R. Gay was told South Korean refugees were killed by North Korean 
troops in a cross fire at No Gun Ri, the division information 
officer recalled. ``I think that's what he believed,'' said Harold 
D. Steward, an ex-colonel from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Relevant unit documents say nothing about a cross fire, about  
North Korean soldiers killed under a bridge, or anything else about 
No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	One battalion lieutenant located by the AP said he was in the  
area but knew nothing about the killing of civilians. ``I have 
honestly never, ever heard of this from either my soldiers or 
superiors or my friends,'' said John C. Lippincott of Stone 
Mountain, Ga. He said he could have missed it because ``we were 
extremely spread out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The villagers say they tried to file a compensation claim with a  
U.S. claims office in Seoul in 1960, but were told they missed a 
deadline. Later, they say, Korean police warned one man, survivor 
Yang Hae-chan, to keep quiet about the 1950 events. But as 
authoritarian South Korea liberalized in the 1990s, they revived 
their case and sent petitions to Washington. None was acknowledged, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1997, a claim signed by 30 petitioners was filed with  
South Korea's Government Compensation Committee. Having researched 
histories, they pointed a finger at the 1st Cavalry. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the U.S. Armed Forces Claims Service said there was  
``no evidence ... to show that the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division was in 
the area.'' A lower-level South Korean compensation committee said 
people were killed at No Gun Ri but it had no proof of U.S. 
involvement. In April 1998, the national panel rejected the case, 
saying a five-year statute of limitations expired long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP subsequently reconstructed unit movements from map  
coordinates in declassified war records. They showed that four 1st 
Cavalry Division battalions were in the area at the time of the 
alleged incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Months of tracing veterans -- some 130 interviews by telephone  
and in person -- then pinpointed the companies involved. The AP also 
pored through hundreds of boxes of once-secret documents at the 
National Archives and other repositories to find pieces of the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	The laws and customs of war condemn indiscriminate killing of  
civilians, even if a few enemy soldiers are among a large number of 
noncombatants killed, military experts note. The Korean War record 
shows Army courts-martial only for individual murders of Koreans, 
nothing on a large scale. 
</P>
<P>
	As for civil liability, the U.S. government is largely protected  
by U.S. law against foreign claims related to ``combatant 
activities.'' The Korean claimants say the killings were not 
combat-related -- the enemy was miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the truth, justice and due respect for our human  
rights,'' they wrote in a 1997 petition to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	One ex-GI objects that ``a bunch of lawyers'' can't run a war.  
</P>
<P>
	``War is not just,'' said Norman Tinkler. ``There's things that  
goes on that we can't comprehend, but it has to be done. And it's 
the individual that has to make the decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others who were there said No Gun Ri didn't have to happen.  
The refugees could have been screened up on the road or checked out 
under the bridge, Kerns and Hesselman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The command looked at it as getting rid of the problem in the  
easiest way. That was to shoot them in a group,'' said Daily. 
Today, he said, ``we all share a guilt feeling, something that 
remains with everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The late Col. Gilmon A. Huff, who took over the 2nd Battalion  
from Heyer three days after the pullback from No Gun Ri, was 
interviewed before his death earlier this year and said he knew 
nothing of what happened at the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	But he ``heard'' about refugee killings and told his men it was  
wrong, Huff recalled at his Abbeville, S.C., home. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't kill people just for being there,'' he told the AP.  
</P>
<P>
	The bridge at No Gun Ri still stands today. For 49 years its  
concrete was deeply scarred by bullets -- until railroad workers 
this month patched over the holes.

	Stocks Close Lower; Dow Down 62.05  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower at the close of trading  
today, breaking out of a tight range as investors worried about 
interest rates and corporate earnings. The Dow Jones industrial 
average closed down 62.05 at 10,213.48. Broader stock indicators 
also ended lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell 22.16 to 
2,734.09. Concerns that the Fed will raise rates for the third time 
this year have contributed to a steep decline in the stock market 
this month. Stocks were also hurt by the latest round of corporate 
profit warnings. Gillette said late yesterday that third-quarter 
sales will be about 1 percent below last year's levels, prompting a 
number of downgrades from Wall Street analysts.

	Clinton Moves To Help Poor Nations  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton told finance ministers and  
central bankers today the United States will take a major step to 
help wipe out the debt owed by some of the world's poorest 
countries. He said his administration envisions forgiving the 
entire debt that some of the poorest nations owe the United States 
when such a step is necessary to meet basic needs and the money 
will be used for that purpose. Clinton spoke before the annual 
meetings of the World Bank and the International Moneyary fund. He 
noted that many economies are still reeling following last year's 
economic crises.

	Execs More Bullish on 4th Quarter  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American executives are bullish about the final  
three months of 1999, according to a Dun &AMP; Bradstreet survey that 
reports the first gain in the outlook for exports since the Asian 
financial crisis arose in mid-1997. The survey of approximately 
3,000 executives, conducted in August, had especially strong 
results in its indexes measuring sentiment about exports, sales, 
profits and employment. The survey found that a boost in hiring 
plans might further tighten labor markets, but executives said they 
did not expect wage pressures to significantly increase inflation. 

</P>
<P>
	Durable Goods Orders Rise in August  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket  
manufactured goods rose 0.9 percent in August, led by an increase 
in demand for airplanes, automobiles and other transportation 
equipment. Many analysts had expected the figure to be down by that 
amount. The Commerce Department reported today that orders for 
durable goods -- items expected to last at least three years -- grew 
last month to a seasonally adjusted $206.9 billion. The increase 
followed a revised 4 percent gain in July. August's performance was 
the 12th increase in the last 15 months.

May. Regulatory clearance for the merger of the two 
Mississippi-based companies was granted by the Federal 
Communications Commission on Aug. 26. The deal is now expected to 
close on Friday, said John Stupka, SkyTel's president and chief 
executive. SkyTel shares were at 18 1/2, down 5/16. MCI WorldCom 
shares were at 72 5/8, down 1 9/16.

	CIA Sets Up Venture Capital Firm

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA is publicly setting up in California's  
Silicon Valley to invest in young companies developing technologies 
with spying potential. In a nod toward the James Bond movie 
character who presides over gadgets, the spy agency named the 
company ``In-Q-It.'' Using $28 million in previously classified 
startup money from Congress, the nonprofit company will invest in 
some high-tech companies and form joint ventures with others to 
nurture Internet-age projects that could benefit the CIA, said the 
new company's chief operating officer, Gilman Louie.

	La-Z-Boy Buying Furniture Maker

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Not sitting idle as one of the world's largest  
furniture makers, La-Z-Boy Inc. is buying Ladd Furniture Inc. in a 
$197.8 million stock deal that one analyst says ``sets up La-Z-Boy 
as an industry behemoth.'' Under the deal unveiled yesterday, 
La-Z-Boy also will assume Ladd's debt of $101.5 million. Ladd, 
based in Greensboro, N.C.,is among North America's largest 
residential furniture makers and one of the world's leading 
suppliers to hotel and motel, assisted living and government 
markets. The transaction -- requiring approval by regulators and 
Ladd shareholders -- should be completed by early 2000.

	Japan Builder Revives Tower Plan

<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- A Japanese developer said today that with  
Asian economic troubles easing, it will resume construction of the 
world's tallest skyscraper next year in Shanghai. The 90-story, 
1,518-foot-tall Shanghai Financial Center is being redesigned to 
make it even taller, said Mori Building Co. president Minoru Mori. 
He wouldn't say what the new height target is. Skyscraper rivalry 
shifted to Asia when the 1,480-foot-tall Petronas Towers were 
finished in 1996 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and became the world's 
tallest. The main building displaced the Sears Tower of Chicago, 
which had held the title since 1973.

<HEADLINE> Court Says Gunmaker Can Be Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A California appeals court ruled Wednesday  
that the families of eight people shot to death in a law office in 
1993 are entitled to sue the manufacturer of a gun used in the 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time any appellate court has allowed a gun  
maker to be sued for a criminal shooting. The justices acknowledged 
that other appeals courts to consider the issue have ruled that 
manufacturers of legal, non-defective guns cannot be sued for their 
criminal misuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The families contend the manufacturer of the TEC-DC9 marketed it  
to criminals and should have foreseen that it would be used in a 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-member appeals panel ruled 2-1 to reinstate the  
families' lawsuit against Navegar Inc., a case that had been 
dismissed by a lower court. The dissenting justice said shooter 
Gian Luigi Ferri was solely responsible for the 1993 attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling ``provides legal precedent for finding that (the) gun  
industry can be held accountable for irresponsible conduct leading 
to death and injury,'' the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, 
which represented the families, said in a statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Navegar lawyer Ernest Getto said the company probably will  
appeal to the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the court seemed to be creating a new type of damage  
suit and was relying on marketing statements that the gunman never 
saw. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices acknowledged that other courts have supported the  
gun industry's claim it should not be held responsible for criminal 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	But they said the San Francisco case was unusual. An identical  
gun has been banned in California, though not in Florida, where the 
pistols were made, or Nevada, where they were sold; there is 
evidence that the TEC-DC9 has no legitimate civilian use; and the 
company's ads, including one that touted the gun as 
fingerprint-resistant, suggested criminals were among its intended 
customers, the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
	A TEC-DC9 also was used in the shootings at Columbine High  
School.

<HEADLINE> Injured Deion Still Worries Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Even a wounded Deion Sanders puts fear into  
Jake Plummer and the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``At 90, 95 percent, he's better than probably most DBs in the  
league,'' Plummer said. ``He's still in the top echelon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders will play his first game this season Sunday when the  
Dallas Cowboys take on the Cardinals. It remains to be seen whether 
Sanders can be at his All-Pro best five months after toe surgery 
and nine months since his last meaningful game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders is praying that Plummer tries testing him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm laying before the Lord saying, `Lord, please let Jake  
throw this ball to me,' because I've got a new holy ghost dance I'm 
going to give you guys out there on that field,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer admits he's tempted to throw in Sanders' direction.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't go into game-planning and say we're going to go  
right after No. 21 and win the ballgame, because it doesn't 
happen,'' Plummer said. ``Still, you might want to test him to see 
what he's got. But he knows that's coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona coach Vince Tobin said his staff will determine during  
the game how big of a risk it would be to challenge Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might observe him, watch him and see if he can cover,''  
Tobin said. ``I presume he's healthy enough to play, but we've got 
to make sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders sprained his left big toe early in a Nov. 15 game in  
Arizona. He missed five games, then returned for a Jan. 2 playoff 
game also against the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders played in the Pro Bowl, then hoped the pain would go  
away in the offseason. It didn't, so he underwent surgery in April. 
He began practicing earlier this month and finally feels ready to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sunday will be my time,'' said the guy known as Prime Time.  
``I'm excited about getting back to the field and doing what I'm 
accustomed to doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Cowboys are 2-0 without Sanders, their secondary  
has allowed an NFL-worst 304 yards passing per game. Kevin Mathis 
and Charlie Williams have given up 11 plays of 20 yards or more, 
including touchdowns of 41, 45 and 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	When Sanders is on the field, there's always a highlight waiting  
to happen. He's one of the handful of guys around the league you 
can't take your eyes off because he's capable of doing something 
exciting on any play. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sanders loves to entertain, whether it's taunting opponents  
by holding out the ball, high-stepping down the sidelines or doing 
one of his victory dances. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' antics annoy opponents as much as his ability can hurt  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	As a cornerback, he had five interceptions last year, his most  
in four years. That's even more impressive considering he only 
played nine full games and teams usually tried to avoid throwing to 
his side. 
</P>
<P>
	As a punt returner, Sanders also led the NFL last season with an  
average of 15.6 yards. Sanders took six kicks at least 30 yards, 
reaching the end zone twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Along with his obvious God-given physical skills -- his speed  
and his ability as an athlete -- I'd have to put right at the top 
his awareness and his mental understanding of the strategy of the 
game,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. ``Deion is one of the most 
intelligent players I've been around.''

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rick Fox, a star athlete whose rugged good  
looks opened the door to acting opportunities, and Vanessa L. 
Williams, a deposed Miss America who later found fame in the 
entertainment field, have married. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, who signed a six-year, $24 million contract with the Los  
Angeles Lakers last month, and Williams, a Grammy Award-winning 
singer who has starred in several movies, were wed last Sunday in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	About 55 guests made up of family and close friends attended the  
ceremony at the Holy Trinity Church, according to Douglas Johnson, 
Fox's business manager. A reception followed at the St. Regis 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very beautiful and wonderful ceremony,'' Johnson  
said, adding that no Lakers and no entertainers attended. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, 30, has a 5-year-old son, Kyle, while Williams, 36, has  
three children from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, who appeared in the movie ``He Got Game'' as well as the  
HBO series ``Oz,'' begins training camp with the Lakers next week. 
Williams is currently filming a remake of the movie ``Shaft,'' 
starring Samuel L. Jackson.

after nude pictures of her appeared in Penthouse magazine during

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Ends Down 62.05 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower at the close of trading  
Wednesday, breaking out of a tight range as continuing worries 
about interest rates and the latest warning about corporate 
earnings rattled the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell for the sixth time in  
seven sessions, losing 62.05 points to close at 10,213.48. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also ended lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 fell 13.83 to 1,268.37, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 
25.98 to 2,730.27. 
</P>
<P>
	As stocks swung in a narrow range in choppy trading for much of  
the session, analysts said most investors appeared reluctant to buy 
in the sessions before the Federal Reserve's Oct. 5 meeting on 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns that the Fed will raise rates for the third time this  
year have contributed to a steep decline in the stock market this 
month. The Dow is now 1,112 points, or 9.8 percent, from its record 
high of 11,326.04 set on Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``A follow-through from that sharp selloff has yet to take  
hold,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at 
Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``Ahead of the Fed's meeting, no one is willing to 
step in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate  
profits as it becomes more expensive to borrow money. Rising rates 
also make fixed-return investments, like bonds, more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.12 percent,  
from 6.08 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also hurt by the latest round of corporate profit  
warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette fell 3 9/16 to 33 7/16 after saying late Tuesday  
third-quarter sales will be about 1 percent below last year's 
levels. And Avon, the direct seller of cosmetics, tumbled 9 7/8 to 25 
13/16 after saying its fourth-quarter earnings and sales may miss 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	While most companies are expected to report strong profit growth  
in the third quarter, those that have warned Wall Street about 
their earnings outlook have been harshly punished. 
</P>
<P>
	The warnings from Gillette and Avon hurt several other  
consumer-products companies. Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 3 1/8 to 95 13/16 
and Colgate-Palmolive dropped 2 15/16 to 46 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's technology components performed poorly Wednesday. IBM  
fell 3 7/16 to 120 1/16 after Merrill Lynch removed the stock from 
its list of 10 top stock picks, replacing it with Mercury 
Interactive, a maker of automated software testing programs. 
Mercury shares rose 3 3/4 to 62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill, which has had some concerns about IBM's hardware  
revenue growth, continues to recommend IBM shares, and maintained 
its estimates for third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard fell 5 15/16 to 89 1/4, weighing most heavily on  
the Dow. The computer maker has been one of the strongest stocks in 
the Dow so far this year, and analysts said investors may be trying 
to lock in their gains in case the broader market declines further. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies were mostly higher as the price of crude oil  
futures topped $25 a barrel for the first time since January 1997. 
Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported a decline 
in U.S. crude supplies, providing the latest evidence that a glut 
of oil that depressed prices over the past year is ending. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron rose 9/16 to 88 3/16.  
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market was not significantly affected by a  
Commerce Department report that showed orders to U.S. factories for 
big-ticket manufactured goods unexpectedly rose 0.9 percent in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	``Durable goods data are notoriously volatile and won't change  
the economic view,'' said Scott J. Brown, chief economist at 
Raymond James &AMP; Associates Inc. in St. Petersburg, Fla. ``There's 
no evidence that manufacturing is generating any sort of 
inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Volume of all listed shares came to 
1.01 billion, compared with 1.05 billion in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.03 to 421.52.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.3 percent.  
European indexes were mixed, as Germany's DAX index rose 0.3 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 
fell 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Leads Home Run Race With 63 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire regained the major league home run  
lead for the first time since Aug. 18, hitting Nos. 62 and 63 
Wednesday night in a doubleheader against the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit a homer in each game to move one ahead of Chicago's  
Sammy Sosa. McGwire last led Sosa 48-47. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has 520 career homers, leaving him one behind Ted  
Williams and Willie McCovey for 10th place on the all-time list. He 
also leads the NL with 145 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire tied Sosa for the major league lead in the fourth inning  
of the opener with a two-run homer to center that traveled an 
estimated 462 feet. He sent a 1-0 pitch from Matt Clement well over 
the wall as the ball cleared an area of shrubbery just beneath the 
backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
	Center fielder Ruben Rivera threw it back over the wall, leading  
to a scramble for the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit a three-run homer off Andy Ashby, who surrendered  
Nos. 500 and 501 on Aug. 5 in St. Louis, in the sixth inning of the 
second game. The 467-foot shot also easily cleared the center-field 
wall and landed beyond the shrubbery. It bounced back onto the 
field and center fielder Mike Darr tossed it back in the stands.

<HEADLINE> Findings on DOE Plants Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- A federal official said Wednesday the  
radioactive contaminant neptunium posed a greater threat to workers 
than plutonium at three Energy Department plants because there was 
so much more of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been focused very much on the neptunium and it's a little  
dismaying to me all the attention that's given to plutonium,'' said 
David Michaels, the Department of Energy's assistant secretary for 
environment, safety and health. 
</P>
<P>
	Michaels made the comment during a teleconference with reporters  
to announce preliminary findings from a review of the handling of 
recycled uranium years ago at the Energy Department's three gaseous 
diffusion plants in Paducah, Ky., Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Piketon, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The uranium was used in military or commercial applications  
before being recycled by the plants, which now enrich uranium 
solely for fuel in nuclear reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	The review is being performed in conjunction with an  
investigation ordered by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson into 
health, safety and environmental concerns at the plants. The 
government has acknowledged that workers at the plants were 
unwittingly exposed to plutonium and other toxic materials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paducah plant apparently processed most of the agency's  
recycled uranium -- about 100,000 tons of the material, which 
contained an estimated 12 ounces of plutonium, compared with 41 
pounds of neptunium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department said the information will allow it to  
determine whether more extensive reviews of exposures among plant 
workers or environmental contamination are required. Exposure to 
radiation has been linked to forms of cancer.

<HEADLINE> Boy Sentenced in Fla. Dragging Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A 15-year-old boy who was in the  
back seat of a stolen car when his buddy hit the gas and ran over 
an elderly woman, dragging her to death, has cut a deal to stay out 
of prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Martroy Futch will spend the next six to eight months in a  
juvenile detention center after pleading guilty Tuesday to being an 
accessory after the fact in the purse-snatching and death of Ida 
Mirel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mirel, 84, was killed when she tried to get back her purse  
from two boys in the parking lot of a Boca Raton restaurant. The 
boys in the stolen 1991 Dodge ran her over and dragged her body 
2,000 feet down a busy road. 
</P>
<P>
	Futch was charged in August with trying to wipe fingerprints off  
the car and helping to push it into a canal. If he had been charged 
as an adult with the same felony, he could have faced 30 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Futch will testify in the trial of two other  
boys charged with murder in the May 8 attack. They face life in 
prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> SkyTel Shareholders OK MCI WorldCom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Shareholders of SkyTel Communications Inc.  
on Wednesday approved the pager company's acquisition by MCI 
WorldCom Inc. for $1.3 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors holding 68 percent of the company's stock voted in  
favor of the deal, which was announced in May. Regulatory clearance 
for the merger of the two Mississippi-based companies was granted 
by the Federal Communications Commission on Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is now expected to close on Friday, said John Stupka,  
SkyTel's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	SkyTel, with about 1.6 million customers, has been a leader in  
developing two-way pagers that enable customers to exchange 
messages with other pagers and send e-mail on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom is the nation's No. 2 long-distance phone company  
and one of the world's biggest operators of the ``backbone'' 
networks that make up the Internet, but has almost no stake in the 
rapidly expanding market for wireless voice and data 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson-based SkyTel fills part of that gap, but the equipment  
and the part of the radio spectrum used by paging networks aren't 
good for carrying voices or high-speed data. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, MCI WorldCom made an overture to acquire the  
mobile phone company AirTouch Communications, but was trumped by 
Vodafone PLC of Britain. MCI WorldCom then started negotiating with 
Nextel Communications, but those talks fell apart in May in a 
dispute over price. 
</P>
<P>
	Now MCI WorldCom is reportedly discussing a merger with Sprint,  
the No. 3 long-distance provider and parent of the wireless phone 
company Sprint PCS. Both companies have declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramkrishna Kasargod, an industry analyst with Morgan Keegan &AMP;  
Co., said the companies may be a good match. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the benefits would be that WorldCom would get exposure  
into the wireless business because Sprint has done a good job of 
building out a nationwide wireless presence,'' he said. ``With a 
national wireless presence, WorldCom would have the full suite of 
products.''

<HEADLINE> UN To Proceed With E. Timor Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations will go ahead with a  
human rights inquiry into atrocities committed in East Timor 
despite Indonesia's rejection of the probe, the U.N. spokesman said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. investigators would like to have the cooperation of  
Indonesia's own human rights organization and access to Indonesia's 
military, but neither is required for the inquiry to go forward, 
spokesman Fred Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's Justice Minister Muladi said Wednesday that the  
Indonesian government rejected the inquiry and would issue a 
government decree saying so. Indonesia has said it should be 
allowed to investigate the reports that its army and army-supported 
militias were involved in widespread killings and pillaging 
following a vote on East Timor's independence Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's foreign minister said Wednesday that some violence  
was inevitable and that the United Nations had to go ahead with the 
ballot or risk the world's condemnation for having denied East 
Timor's people the right to choose their future. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia might also never again have agreed to allow the East  
Timorese to decide whether they wanted to remain part of the 
country or become independent, Alexander Downer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could it have ever been resolved in an environment of perfect  
harmony and peace? The answer to that is `no', it couldn't have 
been,'' Downer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Passions were too high and East Timor's history too violent to  
have allowed for an easy vote or an easy transition to either 
independence or special autonomy within the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that didn't mean it should never be resolved. And those  
who say the ballot shouldn't have taken place are people who say 
the East Timor situation shouldn't be resolved,'' he told reporters 
after speaking before the U.N. General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	As he spoke, the United Nations moved ahead with plans to start  
taking over some civilian control of East Timor to try to get the 
territory's water, sanitation, transport and communications systems 
going again. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas met Wednesday with senior  
U.N. officials to discuss what the United Nations could do in the 
month before Indonesia formally hands the territory over to a 
transitional U.N. authority, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Portuguese Ambassador Antonio Monteiro said the U.N. Security  
Council should expand the mandate of the mission currently in East 
Timor to allow it to start rebuilding the territory. But U.N. 
officials said that might not be necessary and could embarrass 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, the U.N. refugee agency said Wednesday that efforts  
to reach thousands of refugees in makeshift camps across the border 
in West Timor are going slowly. There have been reports of 
pro-Indonesian militias there harassing people in the camps, some 
of whom were shipped there against their will. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of a U.N.-led mission to West Timor set out on  
Wednesday for the border town of Atambua, which reportedly holds up 
to 100,000 people under militia control, the statement from U.N. 
High Commissioner for Refugees said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the provincial capital, Kupang, authorities were insisting on  
24 hours' advance notice to police from U.N. staff planning to 
visit the refugee camps. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR staff who went to a sports stadium in the city were  
accompanied by six policemen armed with automatic rifles and 
sticks. It held some 700 East Timorese, and another 300 were 
sheltering under tarpaulins around the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was enough food, water and sanitation facilities and no  
visible military or police presence in the area,'' UNHCR said.

<HEADLINE> N.H., Iowa Protect Their Turf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- In a quadrennial tussle, New Hampshire  
and Iowa officials are moving to protect their turf and defend 
challenges to their traditional spots opening the presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure from other states seeking to grab some  
campaign-opening limelight, New Hampshire officials pulled a 
surprise Tuesday and set their primary date for Feb. 1, just a day 
after the tentative date for Iowa's leadoff precinct caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa officials called that ``a glitch'' that will quickly be  
fixed, but left little doubt that they want the traditional 
eight-day gap between the opening caucuses in Iowa and the first 
primary in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Iowa and New Hampshire have always had an agreement that Iowa  
will go eight days before them,'' said Joe Shannahan, an aide to 
Iowa Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack. ``We will maintain that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others counseled patience, and predicted a solution through  
quiet bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake is the campaign time and attention that presidential  
candidates and the national political media devote to states that 
open the presidential campaign season. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on agreements from the past several election cycles, Iowa  
officials had tentatively set precinct caucuses for Jan. 31, on the 
assumption that New Hampshire would hold its primary on Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	But New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner threw a wrench  
into those plans by announcing the Feb. 1 date. Gardner argued he 
was reacting to then-likelihood that Delaware officials would hold 
their voting on Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was enough for me to decide to set this on Feb. 1,''  
Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa Republican Chairman Kayne Robinson and Democratic Chairman  
Rob Tully huddled to talk about their next step, and suggested that 
some quiet diplomacy and pressure from both political parties could 
resolve the snarl. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to resolve it in a way that we could stay (on  
Jan. 31) and we are working with them,'' Robinson said. ``We're 
going to continue to work very hard to make that happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got an awful lot of powerful interests working on this.  
I think what we'll see is that this will be taken care of and New 
Hampshire will go back to the eighth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tully predicted that leaders in both parties would pressure  
Delaware to move back to Feb. 15, allowing New Hampshire's date to 
return to Feb. 8. Both Tully and Robinson said, however, that they 
wouldn't rule out moving the caucuses even earlier if there was no 
change in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannahan said officials could base their decision on a state  
law requiring that Iowa's caucuses be eight days before New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore led Bill Bradley in a new  
survey by Mason-Dixon Polling Research for several Iowa news 
organizations, but Bradley was close enough to suggest the 
potential for a competitive fight between the two Democratic 
presidential candidates. Texas Gov. George W. Bush led among the 
eight Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was backed by 45 percent of those questioned, compared with  
Bradley, the former New Jersey senator who was backed by 33 
percent. Bush was favored by 41 percent, followed by Steve Forbes 
with 22 percent and Elizabeth Dole with 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey was conducted Sept. 20-22 among Republicans  
and Democrats who said they were likely to attend the Jan. 31 
precinct caucuses. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.5 
percentage points for each group.

<HEADLINE> NL Tiebreak Game Would Be Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If a playoff game is needed to determine the  
National League's final postseason team, it would be played Monday 
at 2:05 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	If a playoff is needed to determine the NL Central title,  
Houston would play at the Cincinnati Reds. This would be needed 
only if the New York Mets win the wild card and have a better 
record than the other two after 162 games. 
</P>
<P>
	If a tiebreaker is needed to determine the wild card, the New  
York Mets would play at Cincinnati or the Astros would play at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	In the event Cincinnati, Houston and New York all finish with  
the same record, the Astros would play at the Reds to determine the 
Central champion and the Mets would be the wild card because the 
tiebreaker loser would have a lower percentage than New York. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Astros and Reds finished tied but both have better  
records than New York, no playoff is necessary. The Reds would be 
the NL Central champion based on a better head-to-head record 
against the Astros. Houston would be the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	The home teams for the tiebreakers were determined by coin flips  
on Sept. 13. 
</P>

	The first round of the postseason playoffs will begin Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Prison Video May Show Inmate Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GALVESTON, Texas (AP) -- Three Texas jail guards violated the  
constitutional rights of a Missouri inmate when they attacked a 
group of inmates in 1996, and a videotape will prove that, a 
prosecutor said in opening statements today at the officers' trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape, exposed in 1997 by The Facts newspaper of Brazoria  
County, shows prisoners being attacked by a police dog, 
electrically jolted and kicked during a 30-minute raid at the 
Brazoria County Detention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our laws state that inmates may lose their liberty, but  
they're not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment,'' 
prosecutor Barry Williams said. ``They were not to be punished by 
the defendants. That is not their job as jailers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The video ostensibly was made for training purposes. The inmates  
were held at the jail under a contract with the state of Missouri 
to relieve overcrowding. The contract was canceled after the tape 
became public. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cisneros, 39, Wilton David Wallace, 52, and Robert  
Percival, 37, each face one count of depriving inmate Toby 
Hawthorne of his civil rights during the Sept. 18, 1996, shakedown. 
They could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Guy Womack, Percival's defense attorney, said in his opening  
statement that jurors might be disturbed by what's shown on the 
videotape but he called the federal prosecution unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad example of the federal government interfering in  
a state matter where they had little expertise,'' Womack said. 
``These were not schoolchildren. These were hardened criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Ely, Wallace's attorney, accused the federal government  
of ``Monday morning quarterbacking'' following the videotape's 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth defendant, 50-year-old Lester Arnold, entered into a  
plea arrangement Tuesday in which he agreed to cooperate with 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold, who had been accused of using a stun gun on two other  
inmates as well as aiding in an assault on Hawthorne, pleaded 
guilty to one misdemeanor civil rights charge and faces less than a 
year in prison or probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Several civil lawsuits filed by Missouri inmates stemming from  
their treatment in Texas have been settled tentatively for $2.22 
million. Wallace is awaiting a second trial on an unrelated civil 
rights deprivation charge after the first ended this summer in a 
hung jury.

<HEADLINE> Americans Defend Ryder Cup Action  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. (AP) -- It took the Americans four years and  
the greatest comeback in history to win back the Ryder Cup, and 
they aren't about to let Europe spoil the thrill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't cry when we lost two years in a row,'' Davis Love  
III said Wednesday on the eve of the Buick Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, David Duval said Mark James was nothing more than a  
``sore loser'' if the European captain's suggestion of a Ryder Cup 
boycott in America was aimed at the U.S. team instead of the 
boorish behavior by the Boston gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can understand a little bit of it, especially the reaction  
of what they viewed as some very poor fans, which I would agree 
with,'' Duval said on ESPN's ``Up Close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But to direct some of the remarks the have towards the  
players, I think it is inexcusable,'' Duval said. ``And I think it 
is a case of sore losers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love accused Europe of purposely playing slowly to rattle the  
Americans. He also said excessive partisanship that marked the 
matches last week at The Country Club was no different from what 
Love heard at Ryder Cups played on the other side of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	At The Belfry in 1993, Love said fans poked umbrellas through  
the ropes trying to trip people going from tee to green. 
</P>
<P>
	``And how long have they been calling our wives `flight  
attendants' and `bimbos'? They act like we're the only ones who do 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of Europe's bitter complaints is a fan who spit on  
James' wife. Others heckled Colin Montgomerie with such profanity 
that the Scotsman's father, a former secretary of Royal Troon, left 
the course after seven holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Wednesday, the American caddie for European Ryder Cup  
star Sergio Garcia said he was attacked in a hotel bar after the 
tournament and had to go to a hospital with a head wound. Jerry 
Higginbotham said several men taunted him because he was an 
American working with the European team. 
</P>
<P>
	After a Ryder Cup that featured shots holed from the fairway,  
the rough and a 45-foot birdie by Justin Leonard regarded even now 
as the one of the most dramatic putts in the 20th century, the 
shots keep flying. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavily favored Americans trailed 10-6 after two days, but  
won 8 1/2 points from the 12 singles matches Sunday to complete the 
greatest comeback in the 72-year history of the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The European team is on the losing side of a historic  
comeback,'' Duval said. ``That is probably not the most comfortable 
thing to be a part of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love agreed that the fact Europe had a large lead, and then lost  
it, fueled the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it had been even the whole way and one of us eked it out at  
the end, then maybe they wouldn't be feeling so bad,'' he said. 
``But they just got pounded into the ground on Sunday, and they're 
embarrassed by it -- as we were at Oak Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team led 9-7 at Oak Hill in 1995, but were outscored  
7 1/2-4 1/2 in singles and lost the cup. Europe celebrated on the 18th 
green, but only after the hole was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``They beat us into the ground there, but we didn't complain  
about all the celebrating,'' he said. ``That's been going on a long 
time. For them to say it all of a sudden happened on Sunday, or it 
all of a sudden happened this week ... it didn't just start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing both sides seem to agree on is the U.S. players'  
reaction to Leonard's monster putt that eventually gave the 
Americans to the Ryder Cup for the first time since 1993. Jose 
Maria Olazabal still had a 25-footer that would have halved the 
hole and kept the match tied going to the final hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Europeans have complained that Americans walked -- and jumped and  
jigged -- in the line of Olazabal's putt, which he missed. 
</P>
<P>
	While Love conceded the celebration was ``a little out of  
control,'' he immediately took issue with what he considered slow 
play by Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In the match ahead of Leonard, Padraig Harrington walked from  
the fairway to the green to step off his shot and get a look at the 
pin position. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never heard Mark O'Meara complain that Padraig took 10  
minutes to hit his second shot on 17,'' Love said. ``I'll bet you 
$1 million that their strategy was to play slow, because they knew 
it would frustrate us. They played as slow as they possibly could 
all week and we never complained about it. We are now, obviously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman apologized for excessive celebration on the green,  
but not for being excited about winning. U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw 
and Leonard also apologized for the football-like atmosphere on the 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie, subjected to constant heckling, said no apology  
could suffice. 
</P>
<P>
	That prompted Love to recall how Montgomerie spoke harshly of  
some U.S. players before the 1997 Ryder Cup at Valderrama. Among 
other things, the Scotsman said Brad Faxon might not play well 
because he was going through a divorce, and Scott Hoch showed in 
the 1989 Masters that he did not respond well to pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We accepted Colin's apology at Valderrama for how bad he  
ripped our whole team, and we've kept being friends,'' Love said. 
``They should be able to accept our apology for the 17th green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next Ryder Cup is scheduled for The Belfry in 2001. At this  
rate, what began in 1927 as friendly matches once every two years 
could really get nasty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what this will do,'' Leonard said. ``I hope most  
of the criticism is from European writers, and they're not getting 
this stuff directly from the players. If grudges are held, there's 
nothing I can do.''

<HEADLINE> Gene Therapy Death Raises Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Gene therapy, a growing field of research  
that holds promise in curing ailments from heart disease to cancer, 
may come under closer scrutiny following the death of a teen-ager 
during an experiment at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly should cause us to pause and reflect,'' Jeffrey  
Kahn, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of 
Minnesota, said Wednesday. ``It's a very difficult thing for us to 
confront, especially when the death is attributed to the 
research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors do not know why Jesse Gelsinger, 18, of Tucson, Ariz.,  
died Sept. 17. He was four days into an experiment in which 
researchers placed healthy genes in his liver to combat a disease 
that inhibits the body's ability to rid itself of ammonia, which is 
produced when protein is processed. 
</P>
<P>
	Most victims of the rare disorder -- known as ornithine  
transcarbamylase deficiency, or OTC -- die as infants. Gelsinger, 
who was first diagnosed with OTC at age 2, had a mild form of the 
disease that he kept in check with medications and low-protein 
foods. He volunteered for the study to help other sufferers, said 
his father, Paul Gelsinger. 
</P>
<P>
	While gene therapy studies usually involve people whose diseases  
are so advanced that traditional treatment does not work, the Penn 
experiment included OTC sufferers with less severe symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a good reason, therapeutically, to do gene therapy  
before people are so sick it can't help them. But if the person is 
relatively healthy and the research poses a significant risk of 
harm or death, it poses a difficult dilemma,'' Kahn said. ``When do 
you engage in what could be quite risky research when the 
individual could live a long time?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In gene therapy, working genes are inserted to compensate for  
genetic flaws, such as the ones that lead to OTC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Research is a risky business,'' said Dr. John Lantos,  
associate director of the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical 
Ethics at the University of Chicago. ``Often, experimental 
interventions are themselves dangerous. The hope is they're less 
dangerous than the disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kahn disagrees with those who say gene therapy has moved too  
quickly from lab animals to the thousands of humans who have taken 
part in gene therapy trials nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a very hard case to make (that) this has been a  
quick journey,'' Kahn said. ``Lots of very smart people have 
thought about (gene therapy) for a very long time and it has been 
very closely scrutinized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn's experiment involving 18 patients has been halted until  
researchers can determine why Gelsinger died. Officials at the 
university's Institute for Human Gene Therapy said his case will be 
closely reviewed, and an autopsy will be conducted to determine the 
cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
	``This death will certainly fuel the debate about how fast and  
how far gene therapy has come,'' Kahn said. ``But that's a general 
question we need to ask, and do ask, about all kinds (of medical 
research). These questions are not unique to gene therapy.''

<HEADLINE> Counterfeit Kona Bean Case Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaiian coffee growers reached a $1.26 million  
settlement with some of the nation's largest coffee retailers, who 
allegedly sold coffee falsely labeled and priced as being from Kona 
on the west side of Hawaii Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement on the class-action lawsuit filed in 1997 against  
the now defunct California-based wholesaler Kona Kai Farms and top 
retailers such as Starbucks and Costco is subject to approval by a 
California state court, said Mark Davis, an attorney representing 
650 Kona coffee growers, who announced the deal at a news 
conference with farmers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farmers undertook a difficult battle to fight for the  
protection of the Kona name and to send a message that coffee 
farmers would seek to fight the expropriation of the fraudulent use 
of their product for profit,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil case stems from federal criminal charges brought in  
1996 against Kona Kai and its owner, Michael Norton, for allegedly 
distributing a cheaper and inferior grade Central American coffee 
labeled as Kona, considered one of the world's finest coffee beans. 
</P>
<P>
	Norton is awaiting trial, Davis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kona Kai and its insurance company agreed to pay $1 million to  
the farmers while the $255,000 balance comes from retailers 
including Nestle's Beverage Co., Price Costco Inc., First Colony &AMP; 
Tea Co., S&AMP;W Fine Foods, Gloria Jeans' Gourmet Coffee Corp., 
Peerless Coffee Co., The Coffee Beanery, Starbucks Corp., Brothers 
Gourmet Coffee, Peets Coffee and Tea Inc. and Klein Brothers, Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 million is all the assets and insurance coverage  
available from the defunct Kona Kai. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is no evidence the retailers were aware of Kona  
Kai's fraud, ``we all have a responsibility to ensure that when we 
buy coffee and make a representation to the public about what it is 
that we ensure that it is authentic,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deals consummated by some of the retailers were too good  
to be true and they were, in fact, too good to be true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starbucks' attorney here, Daniel Bent, said the company agreed  
to settle because it was the best business decision to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``We settled for less than a month's legal fees,'' Bent said.  
``There was no evidence whatsoever that Starbucks received any of 
the phony coffee. We don't think we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the time difference, attempts to reach mainland  
distributors were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, some of the retailers have agreed to  
buy 161,000 pounds of green Kona coffee over the next five years 
from Kona farmers, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	When attorneys' fees and expenses are paid, the settlement will  
give the farmers about $600,000, or about $300 per acre in 
production during the 1987-1995 period of Kona Kai's scheme, Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement falls far short of the losses suffered by Kona  
farmers when 20 million pounds of Kona Kai's falsely labeled and 
lower-priced coffee hit the world market, artificially depressing 
Kona prices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thousand acres in Kona annually produce about 2 million  
pounds of green coffee which, after roasting, retails for an 
average $20-$22 per pound. That's second only to Jamaican Blue 
Mountain Coffee, which can fetch up to $40 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kona coffee is one of the finest and most expensive coffees in  
the world and there are many who capitalize on that fact and take 
advantage of the public,'' said Gus Brocksen of the Kona Farmers 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Kona farmers have been seeking a federal  
certification mark for their coffee but have been blocked by local 
processors who make money off so-called Kona blends, which under 
state law can be marketed with as little as 10 percent Kona beans, 
farmer John Langenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Hawaii Coffee Association is close to gaining  
separate certification marks designating Kona and other growing 
regions, including Kauai and Molokai. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what's used with the Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee  
industry,'' Colombian coffee and Idaho potatoes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farmers are united to protect the Kona coffee name and we  
will continue our ongoing battle.''

<HEADLINE> Love Chides Europe Ryder Cup Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. (AP) -- Still glowing over a Ryder Cup  
victory, Davis Love III isn't about to let European complaints of 
the 17th green celebration or boorish behavior by the Boston 
gallery spoil America's great comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't cry when we lost two in a row,'' said Love, one of  
four Ryder Cup players at Callaway Gardens for the Buick Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Love on Wednesday also accused the European team of purposely  
playing slowly to rattle the Americans, and said the excessive 
partisanship was no different from what was heard at Valderrama in 
Spain two years ago or at The Belfry in England in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were poking umbrellas through the ropes trying to trip  
people going from tee to green,'' Love said. ``And how long have 
they been calling our wives 'flight attendants' and 'bimbos'? They 
act like we're the only ones who do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One fan last weekend spit on the wife of European captain Mark  
James, and others profanely heckled Colin Montgomerie, prompting 
his father to leave the course after seven holes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the American caddie for European Ryder Cup star  
Sergio Garcia said he was attacked in a hotel bar after the 
tournament and had to go to a hospital with a head wound. Jerry 
Higginbotham said several men taunted him because he was an 
American working with the European team. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavily favored Americans trailed 10-6 after two days, but  
won 8 1/2 points from the 12 singles matches Sunday to complete the 
greatest comeback in the 72-year history of the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Love said the fact America won with such a dramatic rally only  
fueled the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it had been even the whole way and one of us eked it out at  
the end, then maybe they wouldn't be feeling so bad,'' he said. 
``But they just got pounded into the ground on Sunday, and they're 
embarrassed by it -- as we were at Oak Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team led 9-7 at Oak Hill in 1995, but were outscored  
7 1/2-4 1/2 in singles and lost the cup. Europe celebrated on the 18th 
green, but only after the hole was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``They beat us into the ground there, but we didn't complain  
about all the celebrating,'' he said. ``That's been going on a long 
time. For them to say it all of a sudden happened on Sunday, or it 
all of a sudden happened this week ... it didn't just start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love's comments are sure to stoke the controversy over whether  
the United States went to an extreme to win back the Ryder Cup -- 
whether it was the crowd spitting and screaming insults, or the 
players and their wives jumping for joy on the 17th green after 
Justin Leonard made his 45-foot birdie putt that ultimately secured 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Maria Olazabal still had a 25-footer that would have halved  
the hole and kept the match tied going to the final hole. Europeans 
have complained that Americans walked -- and jumped and jigged -- in 
the line of Olazabal's putt, which he missed. 
</P>
<P>
	While Love conceded the celebration was ``a little out of  
control,'' he immediately took issue with what he considered slow 
play by Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In the match ahead of Leonard, Padraig Harrington walked from  
the fairway to the green to step off his shot and get a look at the 
pin position. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never heard Mark O'Meara complain that Padraig took 10  
minutes to hit second shot on 17,'' Love said. ``I'll bet you $1 
million that their strategy was to play slow, because they knew it 
would frustrate us. They played as slow as they possibly could all 
week and we never complained about it. We are now, obviously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark James has said some Europeans may not play another Ryder  
Cup in America. 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval, speaking on ESPN's ``Up Close'' on Wednesday, said  
he thinks much of the European team's anger concerns the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he was making reference to the U.S. team, then he is a very  
sore loser, is what he is,'' Duval said. This is my first Ryder 
Cup, but I have watched it on television and nothing different 
happened this time than has happened in the past Ryder Cups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie said no apology could suffice, even though Ben  
Crenshaw and others offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Love noted that Montgomerie spoke harshly of some U.S. players  
before the 1997 Ryder Cup at Valderrama. Among other things, the 
Scotsman said Brad Faxon might not play well because he was going 
through a divorce, and Scott Hoch showed in the 1989 Masters that

rate, what began in 1927 as friendly matches once every two years 
could really get nasty.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Decline for Third Session / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Wednesday for the third  
straight session, as fears of rising inflation continued to roil 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 9/16  
point, or $5.63 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 6.12 percent from 6.08 percent late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices began to slide early in Wednesday's session after a  
government report of stronger-than-expected orders to manufacturers 
for durable goods in August. With the economy still growing 
briskly, worries persist that it will overheat, rekindling 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors continued to speculate that the Federal Reserve Board  
may raise interest rates again at its meeting Tuesday in an effort 
to keep economic growth at a noninflationary pace. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down 3/32 to 1/16 point, while intermediate maturities fell 
7/32 to 13/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Looks to Opener as Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANONSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins will have an  
extra passenger on their trip to Dallas for Friday's season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	But even NHL MVP Jaromir Jagr couldn't convince him to pull on a  
game sweater. 
</P>
<P>
	Seems the NHL has this rule that owners can't be players.  
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean that Mario Lemieux, the owner, isn't just as  
thrilled about starting a new season as was Mario Lemieux, the Hall 
of Fame player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited about opening night Friday, especially  
against the Stars, the team that just won the Stanley Cup,'' 
Lemieux said Wednesday. ``It's going to be exciting for everyone in 
the organization to go there and see all of the festivities and, 
hopefully, one day to come back here and regain the cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only seven years after leading the Penguins to consecutive  
Stanley Cup titles as one of the most dominating and innovative 
scorers in NHL history, Lemieux moves into the owner's box at age 
33 -- the youngest owner in major professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is only two years removed from playing, and several of  
his former linemates now are his employees. Bob Errey, who was 
released last week and now is a team broadcaster, played a season 
in Pittsburgh before Lemieux joined the Penguins in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The player who seems the least affected by Lemieux's transition  
from the blue line to analyzing the bottom line is Jagr, the NHL 
scoring champion before and after Lemieux took a year off for 
health reasons in 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've only been here a couple of times for practices and I  
haven't seen any change in attitude among the players -- except, 
maybe Jagr a little bit,'' Lemieux said. ``He's a different cat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite wrapping up his purchase of the bankrupt franchise on  
Sept. 3, Lemieux still has money matters on his mind. He continues 
to seek additional investors to put up $10 million to $15 million 
to give the Penguins the financial stability they have long lacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux spent last week attending the Ryder Cup matches with  
Michael Jordan, and made a second pitch to Jordan to join his 
group, Just as he did during Lemieux's charity golf tournament in 
June, Jordan gave him a thumb's down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him again and he refused again,'' Lemieux said,  
smiling. ``I think he wants to buy his own (basketball) team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Lemieux is as surprised as anyone at making a relatively  
easy transition from retired millionaire player and golf addict to 
owner. He is more than a figurehead; he visits team offices nearly 
daily to learn the ropes of ownership from newly hired team 
executives Tom Rooney and Ken Sawyer. Lemieux also will sit on the 
NHL Board of Governors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, dressed in a natty dark blue suit and matching blue  
tie, said club employees still can't get over watching him keep 
regular office hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very surprised when I started this new job and new life  
that I felt very comfortable,'' he said. ``I've surrounded myself 
with smart people who have taught me a lot of things, and I feel 
like I'm learning very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is keeping a hands-off role on hockey matters, including  
the re-signing of defenseman Darius Kasparaitis to a $3 million, 
two-year contract that may have put the payroll slightly over 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux won't seek out general manager Craig Patrick to offer  
advice, but will wait until Patrick seeks it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best in business,'' Lemieux said. ``We gave a budget  
to Craig at the beginning of the year and he has to meet that 
budget. I have to answer to our investors and the people that have 
supported me and believed in me throughout this process. If we're 
over budget, I'm sure Craig will do something about it in the near 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins have sold 9,000 season tickets, about 1,000 more  
than last year but thousands below Lemieux's initial projection of 
12,000. However, Lemieux didn't close on the purchase until two 
months later than expected, delaying the most ambitious marketing 
campaign in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remain very optimistic that we'll get the support we need  
from our fans. We've made great strides over the last month,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com To Let Anyone Sell There </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com will start looking like an online  
flea market on Thursday as the Internet powerhouse begins allowing 
anyone -- from industrial giants to artistic grandmothers -- to sell 
products through its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the vast expansion -- which will add more than 500,000  
items, including fly-fishing rods and buffalo steaks, to 
Amazon.com's product mix -- sent the company's stock soaring 22.5 
percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amazon wants to get their fingers in every Internet purchase  
that takes place,'' said Ken Cassar, an analyst at online research 
firm Jupiter Communications. ``This is getting them closer to that 
goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com shares soared $14.81 1/4 to close at $80.68 3/4 on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Amazon.com has built itself into an Internet  
shopping hub in just four years. While it once exclusively sold 
books online, it now offers music, videos, auctions, toys and 
consumer electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	It has more than 12 million customers, up from 10.7 million just  
three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com also has been pouring millions of dollars into  
outside ventures, such as online pharmacy drugstore.com and 
Internet pet shop Pets.com. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new services announced Wednesday will make Amazon.com  
even bigger and more far-reaching, and will allow the company to 
expand without incurring huge startup costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought that Amazon's success would be based on their  
becoming a landlord online, not just a tenant, and here we go. They 
are doing just that,'' said Lauren Cooks Levitan, an analyst at 
BancBoston Robertson Stephens in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The new service, zSHOPS, lets almost anyone -- regardless of  
size, product or location -- sell online. Amazon.com will only 
prohibit the sale of guns and live animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers can link to zSHOPS from Amazon.com's home page. They  
can search for a specific item, such as a digital camera, or an 
entire product category, like clothing, books or toys. 
</P>
<P>
	If shoppers like a particular zSHOPS merchant, they can click on  
the merchant's name to find a list of all the products that the 
seller is offering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amazon is not the only site out there to host small businesses  
on their site,'' said analyst Cassar, noting that Yahoo! and Lycos 
offer similar services. 
</P>
<P>
	``What makes them different is that Amazon attracts more  
shoppers than any other site on the Web ... and provides a major 
thoroughfare that many shoppers will come through,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers pay $9.99 a month for space on Amazon.com's Web site,  
with premiums charged for retailers who want their goods 
prominently displayed on the home page of zSHOPS. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Amazon.com also gets paid by the sellerwhen an item  
is purchased, with the size of the fee depending on the purchase 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers are required to stock the items they are offering and  
are responsible for shipping the products promptly. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers can pay zSHOPS sellers directly by credit card, money  
order or check. Amazon.com will also allow zSHOPS buyers to use its 
proprietary 1-Click payment feature, which keeps track of a 
shopper's credit-card number and address so the information doesn't 
have to be typed in for each purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	To protect consumers from unscrupulous merchants, Amazon.com  
will guarantee refunds of up to $250 for any item that is broken or 
not as the buyer expected. Those shoppers who use 1-Click payments 
are guaranteed up to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, shoppers can find reviews and ratings from other  
customers as they check out a product on zSHOPS. 
</P>
<P>
	For the small merchant, zSHOPS is a way to get products to a  
huge buying audience without the costs of developing and marketing 
a separate Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix businessman Keith Hertz sees zSHOPS as an opportunity to  
tap shoppers that he'd never reach otherwise for his hand-carved 
replicas of sports stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of competition out there and you can never get  
enough exposure to keep your business growing,'' said Hertz, who 
heads Sport Collectors Guild. 
</P>
<P>
	ZSHOPS sellers also have the option to cross link their products  
with items Amazon.com sells itself, such as toys, books and music. 
That means a shopper who searches for a list of books on college 
sports stadiums will see other related products, such as Hertz' 
mini stadium replicas. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the zSHOPS launch, Amazon.com also will unveil a  
new Internet search engine this week. That means if shoppers can't 
find something, they can search other shopping sites directly from 
Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The search program also lets shoppers compare products and  
prices found on Amazon.com with those offered by other Internet 
merchants. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Amazon.com receives no commission for referring  
shoppers to other online retailers, the company still benefits 
indirectly because its new services will attract additional Web 
surfers to its site.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Sign Shandon Anderson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Houston Rockets have signed free agent shooting guard  
Shandon Anderson, who left the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed in the team announcement  
today, but a a league source with knowledge of the negotiations, 
speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press 
that the Rockets had offered Anderson a two-year, $4.2 million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson had told the Jazz that he preferred to sign elsewhere.  
The Indiana Pacers were the only other team offering Anderson a 
similar deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer, including a player option for a third year at $2.4  
million, is the most the Rockets can give Anderson because the club 
is over the $34 million salary cap for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Anderson has played his entire three-year career  
in Utah, averaging 7.6 points a game. Last week, Jazz owner Larry 
Miller said the team was had been told by Anderson that he wanted a 
change, in part because of he preferred a more urban setting that 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah also said it would refuse to make a sign-and-trade deal,  
which would bring them something in return for Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz had offered Anderson more that $3 million per season  
and a guaranteed spot in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Rockets, he would play alongside rookie Steve Francis  
in the backcourt.

<HEADLINE> Tonya Harding Making Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Tonya Harding, aware that seven months  
of training cannot make up for a five-year absence from competitive 
skating, is grateful for one more chance to restart her career. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding will compete professionally for the first time Oct.  
18-19 at the Huntington Civic Arena, more than five years after she 
was banished from sanctioned amateur competition for her role in 
the knee-bashing of rival Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding's adviser, Michael Rosenberg, persuaded a California  
promoter to sign the 28-year-old skater for one show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I owe everything to him,'' Harding said Wednesday from her  
hometown of Portland, Ore. ``He has put his name and everything on 
the line. I'm definitely not going to let him down. 
</P>
<P>
	``For my second chance back, I've got to give it everything I've  
got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harding has been training since March, shortly after she  
announced her intention to return to competition. She can hit all 
her triple jumps except the triple axel. She is the only American 
woman to land that difficult jump in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding also has taken steps to rebuild her personal life. She's  
had a boyfriend for 27 months and works five days a week teaching 
children and others how to skate in her hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg believes Harding's life is back on solid ground, and a  
good reception and showing by her next month could signal the 
beginning of her return to the sport's forefront. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be that she tries it, she doesn't enjoy it and she  
quits. But I predict that she will enjoy it and she will come 
back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	```Of course, Tonya will be nervous, and there's a lot on the  
line. Because if she does well and handles herself well, both pre- 
and post-event, she'll be invited to more competitions. And I'll be 
sweating blood the whole show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harding knows not everyone will welcome her or be convinced she  
is fit to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm sure the skeptical people would even like to see me  
skate,'' she said. ``When I was an amateur, I skated for myself. As 
a professional, I will do it for the fans. This is the way I can 
thank them and show them that I can still skate great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrigan is skeptical about Harding's return to competition.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's been said before, so who knows? We'll see,'' Kerrigan  
said in Nashville, Tenn., where she was promoting a Nov. 23 skating 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair had appeared together for a network television  
interview last year. Kerrigan said she hasn't had contact with 
Harding since. 
</P>
<P>
	``What for?'' she said, laughing.  
</P>
<P>
	Harding doesn't see competing against Kerrigan again as a  
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's happy and she has her baby. I've gone on with my life,''  
Harding said. ``I know everyone's going to associate with us being 
together, but we've moved on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time she gave a public exhibition, Harding was booed  
and taunted at a hockey game in Reno, Nev. Some fans even threw 
batons resembling the weapon used to injure Kerrigan in Detroit in 
January 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready for a circus atmosphere,'' Rosenberg said.  
``She'll either go home in triumph or disaster or somewhere in 
between.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans who gobbled up tickets Wednesday at the 5,780-seat  
Huntington Civic Arena welcomed Harding for the expected sellout 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she's served her time,'' Bob Roberts said. ``I  
personally think she's helped make skating what it is today for the 
other skaters. Let's give her a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Figure Skating Association, which imposed Harding's  
lifetime ban from amateur competition following her guilty plea to 
covering up Kerrigan's attack, has no jurisdiction over next 
month's event. It will be televised by ESPN on Oct. 25, Nov. 1 and 
Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Others entered in the competition are Elizabeth Manley, Surya  
Bonaly, Tonia Kwiatkowski and Pasha Grischuk. 
</P>
<P>
	For Kwiatkowski, who had said she would never skate again with  
Harding, time apparently has healed old wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't care one way or another, I guess,'' Kwiatkowski  
said from Lakewood, Ohio. ``I guess you need to give her a chance. 
I look at her as being another competitor.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-GIs Tell AP of Korea Killings </HEADLINE>

                      *Associated Press Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	From freshly dug foxholes, the GIs looked out over their  
gunsights. Hundreds of civilians, many of them women and children, 
were moving toward their lines, trying to cross to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The young American soldiers, new at the warfront, were wary.  
Orders had come down: No one crosses the line. ``It was assumed 
there were enemy in these people,'' veteran Herman Patterson 
remembers. 
</P>
<P>
	A terrible episode was about to unfold in a ``forgotten war,'' a  
chapter of the 1950-53 Korean conflict that would remain unwritten 
until a dozen ex-soldiers, in interviews with The Associated Press, 
corroborated the allegations of South Koreans who say they survived 
a mass killing at the U.S. Army's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	In late July 1950, the American veterans said, their Army  
battalion killed a large number of South Korean refugees beneath a 
railroad bridge at a place called No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-GIs speak of 100, 200 or simply hundreds dead. The Koreans,  
whose claim for compensation was rejected last year, say 300 were 
shot to death at the bridge and 100 died in a preceding U.S. air 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans described other refugee killings as well in the  
war's first weeks, when U.S. commanders ordered their troops to 
shoot civilians, citizens of an allied nation, as a defense against 
disguised enemy soldiers, according to once-classified documents 
found by the AP in U.S. military archives. 
</P>
<P>
	Six veterans of the 1st Cavalry Division said they fired on the  
civilians at No Gun Ri, and six others said they witnessed the mass 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just annihilated them,'' said ex-machine gunner Norman  
Tinkler of Glasco, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	After five decades, none gave a complete, detailed account. But  
the ex-GIs agreed on such elements as time and place, and on the 
preponderance of women, children and old men among the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said they were fired on from among the refugees beneath the  
bridge. But others said they don't remember hostile fire. One said 
they later found a few disguised North Korean soldiers among the 
dead. But others disputed this. 
</P>
<P>
	Some soldiers refused to shoot what one described as ``civilians  
just trying to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30 Korean claimants -- survivors and victims' relatives --  
said what happened July 26-29, 1950, was an unprovoked, three-day 
carnage. ``The American soldiers played with our lives like boys 
playing with flies,'' said Chun Choon-ja, a 12-year-old girl at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with new evidence that U.S. GIs had confirmed much of  
their account, the Korean claimants called for a U.S. investigation 
into the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the U.S. government will meet our demands and console  
the wandering souls of those who died an unfair death,'' the 
claimants said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military has said repeatedly it found no basis for the  
allegations. On Wednesday, after the AP report was released, 
Pentagon spokesman P.J. Crowley said, ``We just have no information 
in historical files to lend any clarity to what might have happened 
in July 1950.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AP's research also found no official Army account of the  
events. 
</P>
<P>
	The reported death toll would make No Gun Ri one of only two  
known cases of large-scale killings of noncombatants by U.S. ground 
troops in this century's major wars, military law experts note. The 
other was Vietnam's My Lai massacre, in 1968, in which more than 
500 Vietnamese may have died. 
</P>
<P>
	From the start of the 1950-53 conflict, North Korean atrocities  
were widely reported -- the killing of civilians and summary 
executions of prisoners. But the story of No Gun Ri has remained 
undisclosed for a half-century. 
</P>
<P>
	Some elements of the No Gun Ri episode are unclear: What chain  
of officers gave open-fire orders? Did GIs see gunfire from the 
refugees or their own ricochets? How many soldiers refused to fire? 
How high in the ranks did knowledge of the events extend? 
</P>
<P>
	The troops dug in at No Gun Ri, 100 miles southeast of Seoul,  
South Korea's capital, were members of the 7th Cavalry, a regiment 
of the 1st Cavalry Division. The refugees who encountered them had 
been rousted by U.S. soldiers from nearby villages as the invading 
army of communist North Korea approached, the Korean claimants 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth week of the Korean War. Word was circulating  
among U.S. troops that northern soldiers disguised in white peasant 
garb might try to penetrate American lines via refugee groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was assumed there were enemy in these people,'' ex-rifleman  
Herman W. Patterson of Greer, S.C., said of the civilian throng. 
</P>
<P>
	As they neared No Gun Ri, leading ox carts, with children on  
their backs, the hundreds of refugees were ordered off the dirt 
road by American soldiers and onto parallel railroad tracks, the 
Koreans said. 
</P>
<P>
	What then happened under the concrete bridge cannot be  
reconstructed in full detail. Although some ex-GIs poured out 
chilling memories, others offered only fragments, or abruptly ended 
their interviews. Over the three days, soldiers were dug in over 
hundreds of yards of hilly terrain, and no one -- Korean or American 
-- saw everything. 
</P>
<P>
	But the veterans corroborated the core of the Koreans' account:  
that American troops kept the large group of refugees pinned under 
the No Gun Ri railroad bridge and killed almost all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just wholesale slaughter,'' said Patterson.  
</P>
<P>
	Both the Koreans and several ex-GIs said the killing began when  
American planes suddenly swooped in and strafed an area where the 
white-clad refugees were resting. Bodies fell everywhere, and 
terrified parents dragged their children into a narrow culvert 
beneath the tracks, the Koreans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some ex-GIs believe the strafing was a mistake, that the pilots  
were supposed to strike enemy artillery miles up the road. But 
declassified U.S. Air Force reports from mid-1950, found by the AP, 
show that pilots also sometimes deliberately attacked ``people in 
white,'' apparently suspecting disguised North Korean soldiers were 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-GI Delos Flint said he and other soldiers were caught in the  
U.S. air attack and piled into the culvert with the refugees. Then 
``somebody -- maybe our guys -- was shooting in at us,'' he recalled. 
The soldiers managed to slip out. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Col. Robert M. Carroll, then a first lieutenant,  
remembers 7th Cavalry riflemen opening fire on the refugees from 
nearby positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is right after we get orders that nobody comes through,  
civilian, military, nobody,'' said Carroll, of Lansdowne, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days earlier, 1st Cavalry Division headquarters had issued  
an order: ``No refugees to cross the front line. Fire everyone 
trying to cross lines. Use discretion in case of women and 
children.'' A neighboring U.S. Army division, in its order, said 
civilians ``are to be considered enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts in the law of war told the AP that such orders, to shoot  
civilians, are plainly illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said he got the rifle companies to cease fire. ``I  
wasn't convinced this was enemy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He then shepherded a boy to safety under a double-arched  
concrete railroad bridge nearby, where shaken and wounded Koreans 
were gathering. He saw no threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There weren't any North Koreans in there the first day. ... It  
was mainly women and kids and old men,'' recalled Carroll, who said 
he then left the area and knows nothing about what followed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans directed the refugees into the 80-foot-long bridge  
underpasses and after dark opened fire on them from nearby 
machine-gun positions, the Koreans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans said the heavy-weapons company commander, Capt.  
Melbourne C. Chandler, after speaking with superior officers by 
radio, had ordered machine-gunners to set up near the tunnel mouths 
and open fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chandler said, `The hell with all those people. Let's get rid  
of all of them,''' said Eugene Hesselman of Fort Mitchell, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know if they were North or South Koreans. ... We  
were there only a couple of days and we didn't know them from a 
load of coal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler and other key officers are dead. The colonel who  
commanded the battalion, Herbert B. Heyer, 88, of Sandy Springs, 
Ga., told the AP he knew nothing about the shootings and ``I know I 
didn't give such an order.'' Veterans said the colonel apparently 
was leaving operations to subordinates at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean claimants said those near the tunnel entrances died  
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``People pulled dead bodies around them for protection,'' said  
survivor Chung Koo-ho, 61. ``Mothers wrapped their children with 
blankets and hugged them with their backs toward the entrances. ... 
My mother died on the second day of shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some ex-soldiers said gunfire was coming out of the underpasses,  
but others don't remember any. None of the ex-GIs interviewed 
supported one veteran's statement that he and others afterward 
discovered ``at least seven'' dead North Korean soldiers in the 
underpasses, in uniform under peasant white. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GIs didn't fire, veterans said. ``It was civilians just  
trying to hide,'' said Flint, of Clio, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	All 24 South Korean survivors interviewed individually by the AP  
said they remembered no North Koreans or gunfire directed at the 
Americans. One suggested the Americans were seeing their own 
comrades' gunfire ricocheting through from the tunnels' opposite 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Relevant U.S. Army documents say nothing about North Korean  
soldiers killed under a bridge or anything else about No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	The precise death toll will never be known. The survivors  
believe 300 were killed at the bridge and 100 in the air attack. 
Ex-GIs close to the bridge generally put the dead there at about 
200. ``A lot'' also were killed in the strafing, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	One battalion lieutenant located by the AP said he was in the  
area but knew nothing about the killing of civilians. ``I have 
honestly never, ever heard of this from either my soldiers or 
superiors or my friends,'' said John C. Lippincott of Stone 
Mountain, Ga. He said he could have missed it because ``we were 
extremely spread out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In authoritarian, U.S.-allied South Korea, the survivors were  
long discouraged from speaking out. In 1997, in a liberalized 
political atmosphere, they filed a claim with South Korea's 
Government Compensation Committee. But the committee rejected it in 
April 1998, saying a five-year statute of limitations had expired 
long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP reconstructed U.S. troop movements from map coordinates  
in declassified U.S. war records, narrowed the possibilities among 
Army units, then spent months tracing veterans -- some 130 
interviews by telephone and in person -- to pinpoint the companies 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government's civil liability may be limited. It is  
largely protected by U.S. law against foreign lawsuits related to 
``combatant activities,'' although the claimants say the killings 
were not directly combat-related. 
</P>
<P>
	War crimes prosecution appears even less likely. The U.S.  
military code condemns indiscriminate killing of civilians, even if 
a few enemy soldiers are among a large number of noncombatants 
killed, legal experts note. But prosecution so many years later is 
a practical impossibility, they say.

<HEADLINE> Accident Sidelines Rangers' Munoz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers' highly rated bullpen  
received a scare on Wednesday when left-hander Mike Munoz broke his 
right foot in an accident at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Munoz dropped a computer monitor on his foot Wednesday  
afternoon. X-rays revealed the fracture, but the Rangers think 
Munoz will be available for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers said Munoz will return to the bullpen after he is  
fitted with a protective plate in his right shoe. Team orthopedic 
consultant Dr. John Conway examined him on Wednesday night and 
found no further complications. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has had only two left-handers in its bullpen most of the  
season -- Munoz and Mike Venafro. Munoz had allowed only one run in 
his previous nine outings and is 1-0 with a 2.40 ERA in his last 17 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers relievers have combined for 30 victories and a  
club-record 47 saves this season.

<HEADLINE> Nabisco To Acquire Candy Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- Nabisco Holdings Corp. plans to acquire  
troubled candymaker Favorite Brands International Inc. for $475 
million, company officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bannockburn, Ill-based Favorite Brands is the nation's fourth  
largest non-chocolate candy company, with annual sales of $700 
million, but is currently reorganizing under Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco hopes to close on the deal in the fourth quarter, said  
Henry Sandbach, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Favorite Brands is the largest manufacturer of marshmallow  
products, including Jet-Puffed and private label brands, and the 
second-largest producer of gummy candy in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco's most recent acquisition took place on Sept. 9, when it  
purchased Canale of Argentina, a producer of biscuits and other 
food products with sales of $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Nabisco reported a decline in its operating profits for  
the second quarter to $231 million, compared with $253 million a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Parsippany, N.J.-based Nabisco produces such brands as Oreo  
cookies, Ritz crackers, Planters nuts and A.1. steak sauces. The 
company markets its products in the United States, Canada and more 
than 85 other countries worldwide.

<HEADLINE> New Republic Editor Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New Republic editor Charles Lane has resigned  
after running the magazine for two years. He will be replaced by 
Peter Beinart, a senior editor at the publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Lane nor New Republic owner and editor-in-chief Martin  
Peretz accepted calls Wednesday seeking comment. No further 
information on the management change, including when it becomes 
effective, was released by the publication. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Lane quit after  
learning about Peretz's plan to replace him with Beinart, a 
28-year-old Yale graduate close to Peretz. Lane apparently had been 
seeking another job while Peretz was planning to install Beinart, 
but neither knew of the other's intention, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane told the Post he will become an editor-at-large at the  
Washington-based magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've accomplished what I can accomplish,'' he said.  
``I'm going to enjoy writing. I really do need to stop inflicting 
the late hours and anxious weekends on my wife and kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peretz declined to comment to the Post.  
</P>
<P>
	Lane, a former Newsweek reporter, became known last year for  
firing associate editor Stephen Glass after he admitted making up 
an article about a teen-age computer hacker. Lane apologized to 
readers after he found fabrications in two-thirds of the 41 
articles Glass wrote.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars' Lake Eyes Steelers Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- When Jaguars safety Carnell Lake left  
Pittsburgh, he knew eventually he would have to return. What Lake 
won't know until Sunday is how Steelers fans will respond when he 
comes back. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a common feeling for former Steelers, that long list of  
free-agent defectors that grows each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake, who left Pittsburgh for Jacksonville after last season,  
remembers Chad Brown and Willie Williams being booed upon their 
returns. Greg Lloyd got a warm reception. Rod Woodson received 
mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those players, however, ended up with the team that  
supplanted the Steelers at the top of the AFC Central and has begun 
to make a claim as Pittsburgh's top rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure what will happen,'' Lake said. ``I'll just gear  
myself for the worst, the boos and everything. But whatever 
reaction I get, positive or negative, I know they'll still remember 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, they will.  
</P>
<P>
	Lake spent 10 years in Pittsburgh, where he built a reputation  
as a hardworking playmaker who was willing to sacrifice his own 
game for the sake of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody will forget his shift from his natural position of  
safety, to play cornerback over most of the last two seasons, when 
injuries altered the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	They loved him for his willingness to stay, and thrive, despite  
the free-agent defections that came so often. And they were unhappy 
that the Steelers refused to offer him a contract when his latest 
one expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the same business principles that forced so many others  
out of Pittsburgh finally had the same effect on Lake. The Jaguars 
offered him $18 million for four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very disappointing to see that happen to a very  
competitive team,'' Lake said. ``We were going to the playoffs 
every year, we thought we had Super Bowl chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars may give Lake the best chance to win a Super Bowl  
ring that is the main piece missing from a career in which he has 
made four Pro Bowls and missed only six of 163 games. 
</P>
<P>
	His presence on a defense being run by Dom Capers -- a former  
Steelers coach -- has helped rocket the Jaguars to No. 4 in the 
league in yards allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carnell has seen just about everything you can see from an  
offense,'' said rookie cornerback Fernando Bryant. ``He's been in 
the Pro Bowl four times. It's the way he practices, plays, 
everything. He's the consummate pro. As a rookie, seeing that, you 
can only try to live up to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In many ways, his past successes are the biggest forces working  
against Lake as he prepares to be introduced at Three Rivers 
Stadium for the first time in a visiting uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	The question, meanwhile, will linger until kickoff: do Steelers  
fans still like Lake? 
</P>
<P>
	``They all know he was a commodity to the organization and to  
the city for 10 years,'' said former Steeler Leon Searcy. ``But 
come Sunday, they're going to act like they don't know him. They're 
going to try to beat him down any way they can to get him out of 
his game. Because they know as well as anybody, that he's 
definitely an impact player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lake says he'll accept whatever reaction he gets.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would never say anything negative about Pittsburgh fans,''  
Lake said. ``They're just loyal to Pittsburgh. That's how they are. 
I don't blame them.''

<HEADLINE> Nike Loses Co. Name Battle in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike has lost a legal battle in Spain  
that has lasted nearly a decade over who has rights to the company 
name -- the shoe giant or a small sporting goods distributor that 
owns the Spanish rights to the name for the Greek goddess of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The practical effect in Spain could be that Nike can sell  
clothing only with its swoosh logo and no name, a change Nike says 
would have little impact on overall sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that's important to note is the decision doesn't  
impact our ability to sell Nike shoes, accessories or equipment in 
Spain. This has to do only with Nike apparel in Spain,'' said Lee 
Weinstein, Nike spokesman at company headquarters in Beaverton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish Supreme Court ruled last week in favor of former  
Nike distributor Cidesport, ending a nine-year lawsuit over rights 
to the Nike name, which Cidesport Chairman Lorenzo Rosal claimed 
was registered in Spain in 1932, long before the U.S. company was 
created. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Rosal and Cidesport in Spain were not immediately  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike officials are still deciding how to respond to the ruling,  
Weinstein said. He declined to say whether the company now would 
negotiate with Cidesport. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling does not require Nike to withdraw clothing already in  
stores, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe has been the best regional market overall for Nike in  
recent years, but Britain is tops in sales by far, with Spain 
trailing well behind, said Brenda Gall, an analyst with Merrill 
Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know what will come of it,'' Gall said. ``But  
Spain is one of their top five markets in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Spanish attorney, Juan Amigo, had bought the Nike trademark in  
1981 from a Barcelona sock company that had registered it based on 
a photograph of a statue of the Greek goddess Nike. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike had refused to negotiate with Amigo and Cidesport, who had  
asked up to $30 million for rights to the trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	Cidesport objected to Nike using the brand name in Spain during  
the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. The Spanish government asked a 
Barcelona judge to allow Nike to continue selling its clothing 
under its name until a ruling had been issued.

<HEADLINE> Indian Museum Breaks Ground in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tribal leaders from across the Americas joined  
Smithsonian Institution officials to break ground for the National 
Museum of the American Indian. 
</P>
<P>
	The $110 million-plus museum, first proposed in the 1980s, has  
been beset by squabbles over its design and content. The five-story 
limestone structure is scheduled for opening on the summer solstice 
in 2002, taking its place as the last Smithsonian museum on the 
National Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum's goal will be ``to show and tell the world who and  
what we really are and to use our own voices in the telling,'' said 
museum director Rick West, a Southern Cheyenne. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian architect who drafted the museum's original design  
refused an invitation to the groundbreaking, calling the modified 
design now being used ``an artistic forgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian fired Douglas Cardinal as the project's  
architect in 1998 in a dispute over deadlines and money and final 
plans were developed by a panel of Indian and non-Indian 
architects. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Commission on Fine Arts delayed the groundbreaking  
even longer earlier this year by rejecting the panel's design. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians attending Tuesday's ceremony said they were glad to have  
an Indian museum as part of the Smithsonian and even more heartened 
that Indians are to be heavily involved in crafting exhibits and 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people have the misconception that Indian people are  
all alike, but we're not,'' said Hankie Poafpybitty, a Kiowa 
attorney who came dressed in the traditional beaded buckskins of 
her southern Plains tribe. ``It'll add something here that's been 
missing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others, such as Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Northern  
Cheyenne, said the new museum would help the Smithsonian 
Institution move on from its legacy of collecting, studying and 
exhibiting Indian remains and religious objects. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, R-Colo., then a Democratic member of the House, was  
instrumental in requiring the Smithsonian to agree to return 
remains to tribes before getting the go-ahead for the new museum.

<HEADLINE>  Dimitrius Underwood Is Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood was adjusting to life  
as an NFL player and was in good spirits when the Miami Dolphins 
saw him before the weekend. Emergency personnel who saw him a night 
later were so concerned by his appearance that they called police. 
</P>
<P>
	``He appeared somewhat confused,'' said Lt. Ray Hall, spokesman  
for the Lansing Police Department. ``He did appear to be talking to 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day later, on Sunday, he was found on a city street bleeding  
from his neck with a life-threatening knife wound that police 
determined was self-inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Between Saturday and Sunday, Underwood was arrested for failure  
to make child support payments and had refused to leave jail 
immediately after bail was posted, choosing instead to talk to 
another prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
	The series of events has those closest to the former Michigan  
State defensive end worried, with his mother fearful that he may be 
under the influence of a ``cult that's posing as a church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Underwood was still listed in fair condition today at  
Sparrow Hospital after surgery Sunday. He was able to talk and get 
out of bed Tuesday, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the 6-foot-6, 270-pound Underwood slashed his neck  
with a knife on Sunday during a visit with his twin 17-month-old 
children and their mother in Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood first drew national attention after being picked by  
Minnesota in the first round and then leaving the Vikings in August 
without explanation a day after signing a five-year, $5.3 million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter later found him in a Philadelphia hotel, where he  
said he had been torn between his faith in God and his football 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	When Underwood decided to return to football to support his  
family, the Miami Dolphins picked him up on waivers. He played one 
preseason game on Sept. 2, then injured his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's mother, Eileen Underwood, told The Miami Herald that  
she wanted to speak out against a church Underwood began attending 
while at Michigan State. She did not identify the church, but said 
she might take action against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are controlling spirits in there,'' Underwood, an  
ordained minister, told the newspaper in Tuesday's editions. ``I 
visited one time and the pastor was talking about if a young man 
and woman in the church are dating and then they break up, he won't 
let them date anyone else for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not in the Bible. I know the Bible. That's just someone  
trying to control people. It's a den of witches sitting up in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She could not be reached for more comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Underwood had been attending Immanuel's Temple Community Church  
for about a year, the Lansing State Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Phillip Owens, the church's pastor, walked away from an  
Associated Press reporter without comment at the church's office in 
a downtown Lansing office building Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens told the State Journal on Tuesday that neither he nor his  
wife, Patricia, had ever counseled Underwood. He said Underwood 
attended the church sporadically since he joined about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In a story in the State Journal today, Owens dismissed the  
allegations by Underwood's mother that the church is a cult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any mother would be distraught,'' he said. ``She's grasping at  
straws. What she may not be facing here is that her son has some 
problems. The church is not a cult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he had not had contact with Underwood since he left  
for Miami and did not know he had returned to Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
	The nondenominational Christian church is not affiliated with  
any national organization, Owens told the newspaper. It holds 
services in a union hall, but is building a $6.8 million church 
across the street, without borrowing money, Patricia Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said Tuesday that the team was  
placing Underwood on the reserved-nonfootball injury list. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will allow him to focus on his recovery, both medically  
and physically,'' Johnson said. ``It takes away the thought of 
playing this year and lets him get back on the right track and go 
through some counseling and focus on next year as far as playing 
for the Dolphins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stu Weinstein, Dolphins team security investigator, described  
Underwood as ``a little withdrawn'' when he first arrived in Miami, 
but said everything appeared to be fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I last him Friday, he had a big smile on his face and was  
totally upbeat. He was going up to visit his twins,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Sued Over Police Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lawyers for a 2-year-old girl whose father  
was shot by police and framed for assault have filed a $20 million 
claim against the city, alleging civil rights violations, 
negligence and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Javier Ovando spent more than two years in prison on false  
charges, depriving his daughter, Destiny Ovando, of even meeting 
him, attorney Gregory Smith said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the city and the Los Angeles Police Department  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has 45 days to review the claim, which was filed  
Tuesday. If it rejects it, the girl's lawyers can sue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to set an example that law enforcement officers are  
going to pay attention to,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovando was released from prison two weeks ago after prosecutors,  
investigating corruption in an LAPD anti-gang unit, discovered 
evidence that the officers had planted a gun on Ovando and lied 
about the events leading up to his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	One officer has been fired and 11 others put on leave as a  
result of the corruption investigation.

<HEADLINE> Mattel Sues Over Barbie Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mattel is not toying around with what it sees as  
a threat to Barbie, its billion-dollar doll and a favorite of many 
children for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The company filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against a company  
that sponsors a Web site, claiming http://www.barbiesplaypen.com promises a 
free live chat ``with our sexy girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit targets Internet Dimensions Inc. There was no phone  
listing in Las Vegas for the company. A message left Tuesday with 
lawyers for Mattel was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet location prominently features the words  
``Barbie's'' and ``Barbie's Play Pen,'' infringing on the 
trademarks of a toy that generates more than $1.6 billion in annual 
sales worldwide, according to the lawsuit filed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel said the words and images in the site may confuse readers  
into thinking that the toy company is somehow condoning or 
sponsoring the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit sought to block the company from using the Barbie  
trademarks. It also sought any profits from the site as well as 
damages to the Mattel business and the cost of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The site features a woman in a tie, stockings and a black top  
hat beneath the words, ``Barbie's Playpen,'' promising ``Hot sexual 
party games, free live sex feeds and 1,000 plus video feeds,'' 
according to the lawsuit. It also advertises a free live chat 
``with our sexy girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel said in its lawsuit that the Web site is toying with an  
image it had carefully crafted since the company's co-founder, Ruth 
Handler, created the Barbie doll in 1959. She named it after her 
daughter, Barbara.

<HEADLINE> Leafs Sign Berard to Two-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Maple Leafs re-signed Bryan Berard to  
a two-year contract on Wednesday, ending an offseason impasse that 
had kept Berard and fellow defenseman Dimitri Yushkevich off the 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract will pay Berard, 22, a reported $3.3 million over  
the two years, $1.5 million this year and $1.8 million in the 
second year. 
</P>
<P>
	Berard and Yushkevich were no-shows for training camp while  
their contracts were being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	Yushkevich, Toronto's best defender last season, remained  
unsigned three days before the Leafs open the season at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Leafs acquired Berard from the New York Islanders in  
January. He had five goals and 14 assists for the Leafs, adding a 
goal and eight assists during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Berard was the first overall draft pick in 1995 by the Ottawa  
Senators and was selected rookie of the year in 1997 with the 
Islanders, with eight goals and 40 assists in 82 games.

<HEADLINE> Scottie Pippen Criticizes Barkley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) -- Scottie Pippen unleashed a torrent of  
criticism at Houston Rockets teammate Charles Barkley, calling 
Barkley ``selfish'' and ``fat' and saying he doesn't have the 
desire to win an NBA championship. Also, the Houston Chronicle 
reported that Pippen could be traded to Portland before training 
camp opens next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably should've listened to Michael (Jordan) a year ago  
when he said that Charles will never win a championship because he 
doesn't show any dedication,'' Pippen told ESPN. ``He's a very 
selfish guy. He doesn't show the desire to want to win. That's my 
reason for wanting to get away from playing with him -- because he 
just doesn't show the dedication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was responding to criticism initiated by Barkley, who was  
angered that Pippen said he'd welcome a trade to the Los Angeles 
Lakers. Barkley said he sacrificed greatly to make salary cap room 
on the Rockets for Pippen, who signed a five-year, $67.2 million 
contract before last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to want to leave after one year, it disappointed me  
greatly,'' Barkley said Tuesday. ``The Rockets went out of their 
way to get Scottie and the fans have treated him well, so I was 
just disappointed in him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chronicle, citing unidentified league sources, reported  
Thursday that the Rockets and Trail Blazers were discussing a trade 
that would send Pippen to Portland for Kelvin Cato, Stacey Augmon, 
Walt Williams, Ed Gray, Brian Shaw and Carlos Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was offering no apologies Wednesday and reiterated that  
he wants to play elsewhere, preferably for the Lakers and Phil 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't give Charles Barkley an apology at gunpoint,''  
Pippen said, never raising his voice. ``He can never expect an 
apology from me. ... If anything, he owes me an apology for coming 
to play with his fat butt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very shocked to see what type of player he was by  
spending half a season with him,'' he said of Barkley. ``I'm a guy 
that's dedicated to winning, and I put out a lot of effort on the 
court. I expect that from my teammates, especially from a guy of 
his caliber. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know he's not willing to go the distance. There's no  
reason for me to put my last three or four years at risk of never 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charles is definitely one of the guys that needs to show more  
leadership for this ball club to be successful, and he don't show 
that to me. ... He feels that if he gets 10 rebounds and 
double-figure points, he's done a good job. But that's not what the 
game's about. It's about defending, being professional and coming 
to work every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen said one of the reasons he wants to play for Jackson is  
because he longs to return to the system in which they won six NBA 
titles together in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to play for Phil,'' Pippen said. ``(But) I'm not  
demanding a trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen averaged 14.5 points per game last season, his lowest  
since his rookie year, and shot a career-low 43.2 percent. He also 
averaged 6.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists.

<HEADLINE> State Farm Repairs Suit Nears End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARION, Ill. (AP) -- A lawsuit accusing State Farm of cheating  
customers by paying only for cheap auto-body repair parts neared 
its end Wednesday, with lawyers for dissatisfied policyholders 
asking for at least $1.4 billion in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers representing State Farm policyholders said the company  
deliberately withheld concerns about the parts' quality and safety. 
Attorneys for the Bloomington, Ill.-based insurer said their 
opponents failed to provide any substantial proof of their claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't even bothered to show you a photo of a bad repair  
to a State Farm customer,'' said Barney Schultz, the company's lead 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury deliberations began Wednesday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	The class-action lawsuit accuses State Farm of breach of  
contract for failing to restore customers' cars to pre-accident 
condition. The lawsuit also accuses the insurer of consumer fraud 
for failing to properly disclose its use of the parts. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm, the nation's largest auto insurer, covers one of  
every five cars in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit involves aftermarket parts, which are modeled on  
factory original parts but are made without benefit of factory 
specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the parts make cars less valuable by failing to  
provide the same level of fit, finish and corrosion protection as 
original parts. Some parts, such as hoods, may also pose a safety 
threat, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm, however, says the parts it uses are of the same  
quality as original parts. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 percent of vehicles are repaired using aftermarket  
parts, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an 
insurance-industry group. The lawsuit combines the potential claims 
of 4.7 million current and former State Farm policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Tom Thrash in closing arguments said State Farm was  
promoting its aftermarket parts as equal to original factory parts 
even as executives were circulating internal memos questioning 
their quality and safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew all this. It's documented in their files,'' Thrash  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schultz said those memos had been twisted to depict State  
Farm as a business out to cheat its customers. He said State Farm's 
concerns about some aftermarket parts represent the company's 
effort to improve the industry and look out for customers. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said the company's customers are satisfied -- saying 0.59  
percent of policyholders whose cars were repaired using aftermarket 
parts complained. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is a case about bad parts and damage that people have  
suffered as the result of bad parts, why have they not brought you 
a bad part?'' Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the five State Farm policyholders chosen to represent the  
class, Schultz said two received fair market value for their cars 
when they disposed of their cars, even though they were repaired 
using aftermarket parts. Two others received original equipment 
parts at no extra cost to them and complaints brought by the fifth 
plaintiff could be traced to another accident, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury must decide whether State Farm broke its contract with  
consumers by specifying use of the imitation parts. The consumer 
fraud count will be decided by Williamson County Judge John 
Speroni. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs asked for $243.7 million, or about $51 for each  
person who received an estimate for aftermarket parts -- whether the 
parts were installed or not. They also asked for $1.2 billion to 
cover the costs of removing aftermarket parts and installing 
original equipment replacements on the cars of customers whose cars 
were repaired with imitation parts.

<HEADLINE> FAA Bans Entertainment System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government on Wednesday banned U.S.  
airlines from installing in Boeing MD-11 planes the type of 
in-flight entertainment system that was in a Swissair plane that 
crashed last year off Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration order is a pre-emptive  
action, since only 15 of the MD-11s in the world have the system 
and Swissair owns them all. The agency said it was issuing the 
order in case Swissair sold any of the aircraft to a U.S. carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The order highlights lingering questions about the safety of  
systems installed after an aircraft leaves the assembly plant, as 
well as the oversight of companies that design and install such 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian government, which is investigating the crash, still  
has not determined the cause of the Sept. 2, 1998 accident that 
killed all 229 aboard. The MD-11 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean 16 
minutes after the pilots reported smoke in the cockpit. Since then, 
investigators have focused on wiring in the cockpit roof and 
potentially flammable coating on the airplane's insulation. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1998, Swissair announced that as a precautionary  
measure, it was disconnecting the in-flight entertainment systems 
in its 15 remaining MD-11s, as well as three Boeing 747s that also 
used them. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the airline also revealed that it had filed a  
``precautionary'' complaint against the system's suppliers because 
its right to do so would have expired one year after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal papers were filed in Switzerland against the supplier,  
Interactive Flight Technologies Inc. of Phoenix, the company that 
certified it, Santa Barbara Aerospace of California, and the 
company that installed it. Swissair was the only buyer of 
Interactive Flight's systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA took its action after concluding the Interactive Flight  
system's electrical power switching is incompatible with the 
MD-11's design concept since it limits the crew's ability to 
respond to a smoke or fume emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	During such emergencies, the crew is supposed to shut down  
nonessential electrical service in different parts of the plane to 
isolate the source of smoke or flames. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way to remove power to the Interactive Flight system is  
to pull a circuit breaker in the cockpit, a task that would occur 
far down the emergency checklist. A delay in shutting off power 
could have fatal consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swissair system was installed under the authority of  
Switzerland's Federal Office for Civil Aviation. The work was based 
on an FAA certificate issued to Santa Barbara Aerospace, which had 
been a designated aircraft alteration station; it surrendered its 
certificate July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokesman Les Dorr said the new order's ``impact on the air  
traveling public is nil.'' He denied that it indicated 
investigators believe the entertainment system may have caused the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't make that judgment at all,'' said Dorr. ``The  
Canadians have not made a cause of the crash. The Canadians have 
not even said this system was implicated. What we did was go out 
(after the crash) and look at the plane and its systems and we 
found a situation like this that needed to be addressed.''

<HEADLINE> Stock Experts at McDonald's for Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- It's not what you'd expect to hear from your  
stock analyst: ``You want fries with that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's is putting 100 of its toughest customers -- analysts  
and portfolio managers who rate the company and its stock -- to work 
in its restaurants in an effort to impress them with its new 
made-to-order cooking system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I don't goof up the system,'' Kenneth Shank, a  
securities analyst, said with a grin Tuesday as he helped make 
sandwiches at a McDonald's in the Chicago suburb of Darien. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is stressful,'' said Shank, who works at Northern Trust  
Co. in Chicago. ``The work's much harder than sitting and thinking 
about things in my office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonalds' officials say ``Made for You'' -- the company's  
biggest innovation since Chicken McNuggets -- is luring back 
customers who abandoned the chain for its competitors in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The system, introduced last year, speeds up the food preparation  
process. Computerized equipment controls the cooking of french 
fries and computer-run holding bins keep cooked meat hot and juicy, 
leaving employees free to make items to order -- adding pickles or 
skipping special sauce as requested. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts who accepted McDonald's invitation are working during  
the midday rush, when long lines of hurried customers can turn even 
the best burger joints into a fast-food frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better for us if they understand firsthand how the system  
works -- why is it good for us and why is it good for the 
customers,'' said Paul Price, head of company-run McDonald's 
restaurants in the Chicago region. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in purple McDonald's caps and black aprons, Shank and  
Herbert Blutenthal, managing director of Hartline Investment Corp., 
concentrated on inserting buns into a toaster and squirting mustard 
and ketchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Blutenthal said during his 39 years as an analyst, he had never  
before had a hands-on work experience at a company whose stock he 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
	During his two-hour stint, he slapped burgers on buns, helped  
monitor customers' orders on a computer screen and pumped 
McDonald's managers for information. 
</P>
<P>
	He found it much more productive than his usual on-site  
McDonald's research -- studying the service while standing in line 
for burgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's important with any company to see the product and  
how they're doing it,'' Blutenthal said. ``Are they working hard? 
Do they like it? You want to see if they have fire in their eyes 
and new ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The robotized kitchens are being installed in McDonald's  
locations in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers have apparently liked the results. McDonald's sales  
were up in the second quarter, and the company's stock has nearly 
doubled in price over the last two years, from about $23 to the $43 
range.

<HEADLINE> EU Regulators OK 2 Big Oil Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union regulators on Wednesday  
approved Exxon Corp.'s $82 billion purchase of Mobil Corp. after 
securing antitrust concessions in the deal to create the world's 
largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is awaiting approval from the U.S. Federal Trade  
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	To secure EU approval, Exxon and Mobil agreed to pull out of  
businesses where the EU had concerns about competition in the 
15-nation bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	``As initially notified, the operation would have created or  
strengthened dominant positions on eight markets,'' the European 
Commission said in a statement. ``Exxon and Mobil have made a 
series of undertakings to eliminate those concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said Mobil had agreed to dissolve the fuels part  
of a European joint-venture with BP Amoco, and to divest its share 
in the Aral network of gas stations in Germany, Austria and 
Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobil also agreed to drop its natural gas trading business in  
the Netherlands; and to sell certain rights in natural gas storage 
in southern Germany, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company will divest businesses in the European market  
for base oils used to make lubricants, where it would have had a 
market share of over 40 percent. Exxon also agreed to dispose of 
its aviation lubricants business where the commission feared the 
merger would create a dominant position in the worldwide market. 
</P>
<P>
	At the commission's insistence, the companies will also divest  
interests in fuel pipelines supplying London's Gatwick airport. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Exxon and Mobil welcomed the commission's  
decision and confirmed they would comply fully with the EU's 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	In another huge oil company deal, the European Commission also  
gave the green light to BP Amoco PLC's merger with Atlantic 
Richfield Co. It also awaits Federal Trade Commission approval. 
</P>
<P>
	But to allay competition concerns in the transport of natural  
gas to Britain from fields in the North Sea, as well as in the 
processing of Britain's North Sea gas, BP Amoco agreed to sell some 
pipeline and processing units. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said its investigations into the two mergers had  
dispelled concerns that the recent spate of mega-mergers in the oil 
sector would create a dangerously small group of big players 
dominating oil exploration worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 'super majors' would still be facing competitive  
constraints from smaller oil companies, and countries on whose 
territory oil and gas is found have no incentives to let oil 
companies restrict production,'' the EU concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission investigates all mergers and takeovers with a  
major impact on markets within the bloc, and can demand changes or 
veto those judged to violate EU rules on fair business competition.

<HEADLINE> NPS Pharmaceuticals To Buy Allelix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- NPS Pharmaceuticals announced that it  
plans to acquire the Canadian company Allelix Biopharmaceuticals in 
a stock deal valued at $45.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	NPS will issue about 6.5 million shares of stock to Allelix  
shareholders, exchanging 0.3238 of an NPS share for each Allelix 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will operate as NPS Pharmaceuticals in the United  
States and as NPS Allelix in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Both firms have been exploring treatments for osteoporosis and  
central nervous system disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the announcement Tuesday, shares in NPS fell $1,  
closing at $6 on trading of 65,600 shares. 
</P>
<P>
	NPS said it will cut more than 35 positions from its 100-member  
work force in Salt Lake City. Allelix, which recently cuts its 
staff by 50 percent, has about 115 employees in Toronto and New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, NPS reported a net loss of nearly $10.8 million for  
the first six months of this year, with revenue of $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition is subject to the approval of shareholders in  
both companies and Canadian judicial review. It is expected to 
close in the first quarter of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Red Tide Hits Florida's Coasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Poisonous red tide algae blooms --  
which can cause eye and respiratory problems and kill large numbers 
of fish -- are making a rare appearance this week on Florida's east 
coast and along the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``I live two blocks off the ocean,'' said Jimmie Wilkins, head  
of Jacksonville Beach's parks, recreation, and ocean-rescue 
department. ``The breeze was blowing and you could just feel it in 
your throat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State health officials on Wednesday were urging residents of  
beach areas where red tide has been reported to close their windows 
and run their air conditioners, and if outdoors to wear a paper 
filter mask. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaches remained open, however.  
</P>
<P>
	While common in southwest Florida, red tide is unusual along the  
Atlantic coast and the upper Gulf of Mexico, according to Beverly 
Roberts, research director for the Florida Marine Research 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The critter causing all the problem is known as Gymnodinium  
breve, a stingray-shaped single cell with two whiplike tails. Even 
pieces of the organism contain toxins.

	AP Investigation Uncovers Korean War Civilian Killings  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- South Korean civilian refugees were killed by  
the U.S. military in an unwritten chapter of the Korean War, 
according to an Associated Press investigation that cites villagers 
and veterans who witnessed or participated in the incident in the 
early days of the war. Many women and children were among the 
hundreds who died underneath a bridge at No Gun Ri, a hamlet about 
100 miles southeast of the South Korean capital of Seoul. American 
soldiers, in their third day at the warfront, believed that North 
Korean infiltrators were among the refugees. Once-classified 
documents show U.S. commanders issued orders to treat civilians as 
``enemy.''

	Bell Atlantic Readies Long-distance  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's largest local phone company, Bell  
Atlantic, asked federal regulators today to let it enter the New 
York long-distance market. By year's end, it could be the first 
regional Bell company to offer long-distance service to its local 
customers. Bell Atlantic, which serves the Northeast and 
mid-Atlantic states, filed its application with the Federal 
Communications Commission detailing the steps it has taken to open 
its local phone business in New York to competition. That's the 
standard the company must meet, under the 1996 Telecommunications 
Act, before regulators will let it provide long-distance in its 
region.

	Study: Infants Sleep Safer in Cribs

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Supporting recommendations that all infants sleep  
in cribs, a new study found that an average of 64 young children 
die each year while sleeping in bed with their parents or other 
adults. Children risk getting their heads trapped or being rolled 
on by an adult when sleeping in adult beds, according to the study 
by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The study, 
published in the October issue of the Archives of Pediatrics and 
Adolescent Medicine, found that the greatest number of deaths 
involved children under 1 who became trapped between a mattress and 
a bed frame.

talking peace without conditions. David Levy also called on Lebanon 
to enter negotiations on a possible withdrawal of Israeli troops 
from southern Lebanon. Also during his speech, Levy reiterated 
Israel's longstanding position that a united Jerusalem will remain 
the capital of the Jewish state -- an issue that is supposed to be 
decided in final status negotiations with the Palestinians. Levy 
addressed the General Assembly six days after Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat appealed to its 188 member nations for increased 
support for an independent Palestinian state which he said would be 
established in the coming year.

new Internet services that sift through auction Web sites to find 
the best prices for potential bidders. Spokesman Kevin Pursglove 
said the action was made to protect eBay from companies or 
individuals seeking to ``piggy-back'' on eBay's success. Several 
new Web sites search sites for goods being auctioned and compare 
prices offered. BiddersEdge.com and another service, Ruby Lane, 
stopped using eBay auction data when eBay refused to give them 
permission.

justices acknowledged that other appeals courts to consider the 
issue have ruled that manufacturers of legal, non-defective guns 
cannot be sued for their criminal misuse.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Olerud's grand slam highlighted a startling  
seven-run burst in the fourth inning and the New York Mets stopped 
a seven-game losing streak, beating the Atlanta Braves 9-2 tonight. 
New York, which had a team-record nine hits in the inning, ended 
the Braves' eight-game winning string. But while the outcome 
clearly improved the mood at Shea Stadium, it was not certain to 
help the Mets in the standings.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Interviews Consultants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton interviewed potential  
campaign media strategists Wednesday, moving ahead with plans for 
her expected Senate race in New York next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Consultants David Doak and David Axelrod were among those  
invited to the White House for interviews with the first lady and a 
group of top advisers, according to Democratic sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's Senate exploratory committee  
refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Doak was the media consultant for Gray Davis' winning  
campaign for governor in California and for the losing 
gubernatorial campaign of Democrat Peter Vallone in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Doak also ran the media operations for David Dinkins when he won  
the New York City mayor's race in 1989 over Republican Rudolph 
Giuliani and again in 1993 when Dinkins lost to Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani is considered the likely Republican candidate in the  
race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Axelrod has served as media consultant for New York state  
Comptroller H. Carl McCall and for Andrew Span, the Westchester 
County executive. The New York suburbs, including Westchester, are 
crucial battlegrounds in statewide races. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Doak nor Axelrod immediately returned telephone messages  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady also is considering a day-to-day manager for her  
campaign. Among the names mentioned are her former chief of staff, 
Maggie Williams, and Bill DiBlasio, a veteran New York Democratic 
operative who is the regional director in New York for the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development.

<HEADLINE> Heisman Not on Purdue Star's Mind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Purdue quarterback Drew Brees isn't paying  
attention to talk that he's a strong candidate for the Heisman 
Trophy at a school known as a cradle of NFL quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The junior from Texas has been busy helping the 11th-ranked  
Boilermakers putting together a 10-game winning streak -- the 
school's longest since winning 11 straight from 1928-30. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't sit there and say, `Vote for me for Heisman.' I just  
try and go out there and have fun and play football. Everything 
else will take care of itself. I know it will, if you're winning 
and you're successful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers face a tough challenge to extend the streak  
this week at No. 4 Michigan. Both teams are 4-0 this year after 
winning their conference openers Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look to every game like it is just another game,'' Brees  
said. ``We want to come out with a win, so I'm going to do my best 
that week to watch film, in the weight room and do my best in 
practice. ... Just go out that weekend and try and win the football 
game, not think about any of the outside pressures or the 
distractions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brees has completed 487 of 784 passes (62.1 percent) for a  
school whose former quarterbacks includes Hall of Famers Len Dawson 
and Bob Griese, and NFL veterans such as Mark Herrmann, Jim Everett 
and Mike Phipps. The percentage is the highest in school history 
for any Purdue quarterback who has thrown 450 passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Joe Tiller does see a weakness in his star.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes he has a tendency to be a little too hard on  
himself. He's a very competitive person and he wants to be right 
every time,'' Tiller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He actually does believe he can play a perfect game and  
complete every pass. I appreciate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brees, who knew nothing of Purdue's quarterback history while in  
high school, is among Purdue's career leaders in nearly every 
passing stat after only 24 games with 17 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think I should complete every pass, unless I'm trying  
to throw the ball away to avoid a sack,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite passing frequently, Brees has been sacked only once in  
four games this year. Tiller says that's a credit to the entire 
offensive unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every team will blitz. If nothing else, they're going to blitz  
to check out to see if you've worked on the blitz during the 
week,'' Tiller said. ``If you pick up the blitz, you're probably 
not going to see it as much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Tiller is confident Brees and the spread offense with five  
or six potential receivers on many plays keeps opposing defenses 
busy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michigan probably feels like they can match up athlete-wise,  
and they're not real concerned about our receivers in terms of 
1-on-1 situations, so maybe we will see a little more blitz than 
usual out of Michigan,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiller said he has ``stopped paying that much attention to the  
numbers that he's putting up,'' instead focusing on his 
quarterback's ``demeanor and how he carries himself, his presence 
on the field around the team.''

<HEADLINE> Eurotunnel May Have Second Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Eurotunnel PLC expects to have a proposal for a  
second Anglo-French transportation link ready by the end of the 
year, the company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Further details will be announced within the next few months,  
Eurotunnel officials said at a press conference called to outline a 
recent deal to reduce the company's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurotunnel operates the 31-mile tunnel beneath the English  
Channel that links France and England by rail. It holds the right 
to operate the existing linkage until 2086. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has not said whether the new tunnel will be for  
trains or cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 1986 legislation setting up the link, the company is  
required to produce proposals for a second tunnel by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurotunnel's debt deal involved the repurchase of its own bonds  
at a substantial discount to their face value. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurotunnel spent 143 million pounds ($235.3 million) buying back  
debt securities with a face value of 317 million pounds ($521 
million) by taking advantage of a downturn in the market for such 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyback is expected to add about 174 million pounds ($286  
million) to net income for the second half of the year, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurotunnel will finance the deal with proceeds from a new issue  
of shares worth up to 160 million pounds ($263.2 million). The 
company initially will offer the shares to existing shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	After buying back the debt, Eurotunnel still will owe more than  
7 billion pounds ($11.5 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Before the announcement, trading in the company's shares was  
suspended. Eurotunnel is jointly listed on the London and Paris 
stock exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Martyr May Not Have Been </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Cassie Bernall may not have been the  
student who said yes when asked by one of the Columbine High School 
gunmen if she believed in God, a story repeated around the world 
after her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Val Schnurr, 18, said in Tuesday's Denver Post that it was she  
who uttered that response after a shotgun blast knocked her out 
from under a library table where she hid during April's attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Schnurr said that as she bled from her wounds, she pleaded,  
``Oh my God, oh my God, don't let me die.'' That, she said, was 
when one of the student shooters asked her if she believed in God 
and she said yes. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Schnurr said she crawled away as the gunman reloaded. She  
suffered nearly three dozen shotgun wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Townsend, a friend hiding with her, was killed, along  
with Miss Bernall, 10 other students and a teacher. The two 
teen-age gunmen killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said a student who helped authorities retrace the events  
in the library got sick when he realized it was Miss Schnurr's 
table, not Miss Bernall's, that he was pointing out in describing 
the exchange between gunman and victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said determining who said yes is  
not a priority for investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have conflicting witness statements from several kids who  
were in the library,'' he said. ``But this is not something we're 
out to prove or disprove. It's not really a part of the 
investigation we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Bernall's story turned her into a martyr who had found God  
after falling in with the wrong crowd, dabbling in the occult and 
experimenting with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother, Misty Bernall, wrote a book -- ``She Said Yes: The  
Unlikely Martyrdom of Cassie Bernall,'' and she has been honored at 
youth rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Schnurr, who now attends college, said she has no idea  
whether Miss Bernall was asked the same question in her final 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be famous or deemed anything,'' she said. ``I  
said I believed in God out of respect for myself and respect for 
God. That's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a Littleton church will not replant two of 15  
memorial trees cut down Sunday by relatives and friends of 
Columbine victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``We planted 15 trees, and there are 13 trees there now, and  
we'll leave it just like that,'' said Dave McPherson, pastor at the 
West Bowles Community Church, where the trees were planted in a 
memorial garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and relatives of shooting victims Dan Rohrbough and Kyle  
Velasquez cut down two trees in protest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not mean, heartless people -- we just lost our son,''  
said Rich Petrone, Rohrbough's stepfather. ``We're just adamant 
about not honoring murderers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Church officials had said the two trees were not meant to honor  
gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, but were for their families.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov. Signs Seat Belt Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Vehicles that transport farm workers  
will need to have seat belts under a new law prompted by the deaths 
of 13 tomato pickers whose van crashed into a tractor-trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, signed Wednesday by Gov. Gray Davis, takes effect Jan.  
1. 
</P>
<P>
	Current state law allows farm-worker vehicles that carry more  
than 10 passengers to be classified as buses and operate without 
passenger seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law was proposed after the crash that killed 13 in  
Fresno County last month. The van was driven by an unlicensed 
driver, and most of the occupants were sitting on carpeted benches 
without seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	United Farm Workers spokesman Marc Grossman called the new law  
``a good first step.''

<HEADLINE> Ricky Williams Won't Play This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Texas Tech star running back Ricky  
Williams aggravated his sprained knee during practice this week and 
will not play in Saturday's game against No. 6 Texas A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Spike Dykes had listed Williams as a ``maybe'' for  
Saturday's contest, but the injury during practice means the 
running back is sidelined for at least another week. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the third straight game Williams will miss.  
</P>
<P>
	He injured his knee in the first half of the season opener  
against Arizona State University. When the ASU defense collapsed 
the Tech offensive line on top of Williams, he simply bandaged his 
left knee and returned to play minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second half, he told trainers he felt the knee give out  
and was helped off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not play in Tech's 38-17 victory over  
Louisiana-Lafayette, or the team's stunning 21-14 loss to North 
Texas last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the initial injury, Williams had played every game at  
Tech (2-1) the past two seasons, rushing for 1,582 yards and 13 
touchdowns last year. He also was on pace to eclipse the all-time 
rushing record held by Texas' former running back of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
	The team plans to use several backups to replace Williams.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably going to be like we've done it in the past,''  
said running back coach Jack Tayrien. ``We'll play it by committee 
and go with the hot hand.''

<HEADLINE> Refund Sought From Pa. Dance Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The Mummers -- known for their elaborately  
choreographed New Year's Day parades with hundreds of feathered 
dancers playing music and twirling through Philadelphia -- are being 
accused of being too drab. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greensburg Volunteer Fire Department expected all the flair  
of New Year's Day when it paid the group's Greater Overbrook String 
Band $12,138 to perform for a parade Saturday where the state 
firemen's convention was the host. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's demanding a refund.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was utterly disgraceful,'' convention chairman Glenn E.  
Thomas said in Wednesday's Greensburg Tribune-Review. ``Everyone 
said they were lousy and they looked lousy. ... They sounded like 
they picked some people off the street to come here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was for 25 costumed musicians and an unspecified  
number of dancers, as many as 50 Mummers in all, to join the 
four-hour parade. But only 21 dancers and musicians showed up, 
Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They owe us a lot of money,'' Thomas said. He said the  
department hadn't decided how large a refund to request. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Philadelphia Mummers said he was not aware  
of any complaints about the performance. The group has 19 musical 
organizations with about 15,000 members. Their performances raise 
money for the Philadelphia New Year's Day parade.

<HEADLINE> Durable Goods Orders Rise in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Strong demand for cars and airplanes pushed up  
overall orders for big-ticket manufactured goods in August, fresh 
evidence that U.S. manufacturers are still gaining ground after a 
global financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders to U.S. factories for all durable goods -- those expected  
to last at least three years -- unexpectedly rose 0.9 percent last 
month to a seasonally adjusted $206.9 billion, the Commerce 
Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	August's performance -- the 12th increase in the last 15 months --  
was better than many analysts had expected. They were forecasting 
orders would fall by 0.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``All but a few barometers of manufacturing activity are  
currently running full throttle with expectations of an impressive 
second-half performance well in the making,'' said Richard 
Yamarone, an economist with Argus Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, durable goods orders rose a revised 4 percent, better  
than the government previously estimated, and the biggest one-month 
gain since November 1997 when orders grew by 4.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong report, many analysts said they don't expect  
the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for a third time this 
year when its policy-makers meet next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's looks more and more like the Fed will sit tight and let  
this one go by,'' said Robert Dederick, an economic consultant with 
The Northern Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Zandi, an economist at Regional Financial Associates,  
agreed that the central bank will probably leave its target for the 
federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge on overnight 
loans, at 5.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zandi believes the Fed will switch its policy directive --  
intended to signal future moves -- from neutral to one favoring an 
interest rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	August's increase in durable goods orders was led by a 4.6  
percent gain -- the fourth consecutive increase -- in orders for 
transportation equipment. In July, transportation equipment orders 
rose 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers  
Association, said Americans feeling wealthy from stock market 
gains, higher incomes and savings left over after refinancing homes 
continue to be in a buying mood. 
</P>
<P>
	The auto industry expects a record 16.8 million units of cars  
and light trucks to be sold this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The transportation sector is often volatile from month to month  
because it includes such big-ticket purchases as airplanes. 
Excluding transportation, orders for durable goods would have 
fallen 0.2 percent in August, the fifth decrease in the last eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists expect foreign demand for U.S. durable goods to  
continue to improve as economies in Asia and Latin America recover 
from the global crisis. That crisis had cut sharply into American 
manufacturers' overseas sales and also opened them up to stiffer 
competition from cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in overall durable-goods orders in August came  
despite decreases in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for industrial machinery, including computers and machine  
tools, fell 2 percent in August, following a hefty 10.5 percent 
gain in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic and other electrical equipment, which includes  
everything from semiconductors, circuit boards and 
telecommunications equipment to home appliances, fell 0.1 percent 
after a strong 7.1 percent gain in July. 
</P>
<P>
	And orders for primary metals, the category that includes steel,  
fell 1.7 percent in August, down for the first time since March. In 
July, orders for primary metals rose a solid 2.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of durable goods, a good sign of current demand, went  
up by 1.3 percent in August. This was the 13th increase in the last 
15 months. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association 
of Manufacturers, said he expects healthy demand in coming months.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Brokers Internet Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Network Solutions Inc. will remain keeper of  
the master list of World Wide Web addresses for at least four more 
years in exchange for paying $1.25 million to the cash-strapped 
organization that is gradually assuming management of much of the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Praised by participants as a landmark in the 30-year history of  
the Internet, a complex settlement announced Tuesday aims to 
resolve the most contentious arguments surrounding transition of 
control over the Web from the federal government to the 
California-based Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and 
Numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate impact on typical Internet users was negligible  
because the agreement largely involved behind-the-scenes management 
of technical issues and standards. But organizers said there would 
have been serious problems had the talks failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's clear there would have been significant risk of  
disruption to electronic commerce, to the growth of the Internet 
... if there was instability and controversy,'' said Andrew Pincus, 
general counsel for the Commerce Department, which helped 
coordinate the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives at Network Solutions, the world's largest seller of  
Internet addresses, promised they will recognize the California 
group's authority over the Web, a festering issue during 
negotiations that started last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also agreed to continue offering public access to an  
important Internet directory that functions like a giant telephone 
book for the Web, listing people who register for Internet 
addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	But Network Solutions officials also were confident the deal  
held a promise of financial security for shareholders in their 
company, whose stock climbed from $65.38 last week to $85.50 at 
close of trading Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1992, Network Solutions has coordinated the Internet's  
most important functions under its role as a government contractor 
and registered more than 5 million addresses with the ``com,'' 
``net'' and ``org'' suffixes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Network Solutions will act as one of about a  
dozen wholesalers of Internet domains, selling Web addresses 
directly to the public for about $35 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also will continue for at least four more years to  
maintain the master list of Internet domains, called the registry. 
In that capacity, it agreed to charge other wholesalers no more 
than $6 annually for each Web address a customer buys. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, Network Solutions offered to pay in advance half  
the expected $2 million in fees ICANN expects to charge it as a 
name wholesaler, plus the full $250,000 it will pay for maintaining 
the Internet's master address list.

<HEADLINE> Athens Leaders Try To Reassure IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- With the IOC in Athens for the first time  
since the city was awarded the 2004 Olympics two years ago, 
organizers are trying to dispel reports of delays and 
disorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	Although organizers claim preparations are on schedule, one  
president has already quit, local media report Socialist Prime 
Minister Costas Simitis is unhappy with preparations, and the 
government denies rumors the general manager may step down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are right where we should be, right on time. There is a  
schedule that we are following that does not allow a lot of 
delays,'' said George Kazantzopoulos, a member of the projects 
coordination division. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers hope to show there are no delays to the IOC executive  
board, which holds four days of meetings starting Friday. It's the 
first board meeting in Athens since the games were awarded in Sept. 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no period for laxity,'' said Costas Bakouris, general  
manager of the 16-month-old Athens committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But there already have been some setbacks. The 2004 president,  
Stratis Stratigis, resigned July 6. He reportedly quit following a 
feud with the Socialist government over his intention to attend the 
wedding of the daughter of Greece's deposed king. 
</P>
<P>
	Local media have reported that Simitis may replace Bakouris with  
Niki Tzavella, who he hand-picked as the committee's vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism has also focused on the fact that no new Olympic  
construction has taken place since Athens was awarded the games. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch ``is aware of the schedule,  
so he won't be surprised this time when he learns that no brick 
will be laid until 2001,'' Bakouris said after meeting Simitis 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 75 percent of the venues were already built before the  
bid was won, the remaining sites include large-scale projects like 
the Olympic Village, which will house about 16,000 athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic Village will be built in northwestern Athens on land  
that is privately owned by 2,500 people. It can only be sold with 
an unanimous decision, so it will have to expropriated. 
</P>
<P>
	The land, originally outside of the municipality limits, had to  
be included in the town's zoning plans, a process that took eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction funding, estimated at $384 million, will come from  
a public housing organization, which will then turn the village 
into homes for workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Village construction is scheduled for mid-2001 with completion 6  
months before the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The first sports venue slated for construction is the equestrian  
center. An existing horse center has to be moved from its current 
location near the city center by August 2001, so that a 
multipurpose sports complex can be built in its place. 
</P>
<P>
	The most controversial of all venues, the rowing and canoeing  
center, will be constructed in the seaside town of Schinias, 48 
miles north of the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers claim plans for two man-made channels on what is now  
an airport will revitalize the area's ecosystem. Environmentalists 
counter it will destroy Athens' most significant coastal habitat.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Education Goals 2000 adopted in 1989:

matter. A voluntary national test in reading, math and other 
subjects is used to measure this goal as states have their own 
achievement tests. 
</P>
<P>
	4) Teachers will have the knowledge and skills they need.  
</P>
<P>
	5) U.S. students will be the first in the world in math and

<HEADLINE> Denver Voters Would Get Trolley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A brochure for a proposed light-rail transit  
system shows a sleek bullet train that can reach speeds of up to 
100 mph. Trouble is, that is not what Denver-area voters would get 
if they approve the idea Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the wrong train,'' said Glenn Scott, a Republican state  
senator from the suburb of Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're building a trolley system,'' he said Wednesday. ``I  
don't want to speak to their motives, but it's certainly 
suspicious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the plan admit that the train pictured in the  
campaign literature is not the same train being proposed. The 
planned train would be boxy, use overhead electric lines and travel 
no faster than 55 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign officials said they did not have time to get a  
photograph of the actual train before printing the 125,000 
brochures distributed to voters. The Regional Transportation 
District, which runs the area's mass transit system, refused to 
comment because the issue is on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure asks voters for $457 million to help finance a  
19-mile line along Interstate 25 between downtown Denver and the 
southern tip of the metropolitan area in Douglas County, one of the 
fastest-growing in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The line, which would cost $874 million, also would be financed  
by federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the project is too expensive, and would be outdated  
by its completion in 2020.
