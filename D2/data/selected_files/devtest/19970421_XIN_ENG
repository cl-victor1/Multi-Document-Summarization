<HEADLINE> Round-up: PATA Travel Fair in China Successful (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The annual Travel Mart of the
Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), which was successfully
convened in Beijing from April 17-19, marks a milestone in the
fair's 20-year history.
</P>
<P>
The event drew a record-breaking 1,650 buyers and sellers from
about 60 countries and regions the world over.
</P>
<P>
"The strength of this year's mart comes from the broad-based
support from throughout the region, and shows the growing interest
in Pacific Asia travel products and the industry's interest in
China as a destination," said Milton Cooke, PATA Director of
Marketing.
</P>
<P>
He praised the China Host Committee for its work in
incorporating the PATA event into the "Visit China 97" activities.
</P>
<P>
The first-time appearance at the mart of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK DPRK) was a highlight of the
two-and-a-half-day show.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good opportunity for our country to promote its tourist
products to China and to other countries," said Kim Hyok, a senior
manager of Korea International Travel Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
According to Kim, DPRK opened to overseas tourists on a large
scale in 1987. Last year, overseas tourist arrivals to DPRK topped
100,000, of which Chinese mainlanders accounted for 70 percent,
with the rest coming from Japan, Taiwan, southeast Asian and
European countries.
</P>
<P>
During the fair, representatives at DPRK's two booths held
business talks with about 80 travel businesses from China,
Australia, and European countries.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Mart will help boost the tourism industry of our
country," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
While the strong presence of major players of the tourism and
travel industry of southeast Asian countries, such as Singapore,
Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia was evident, the dozen booths
set up by Vietnam -- a new member of the Association of Southeast
Asian Countries -- also attracted huge crowds.
</P>
<P>
According to Pham Phuoc Long, President of the Vietnam Chapter
of PATA, Vietnam sent its largest-ever delegation to this year's
show. While most of the participants were State-run travel
agencies, airlines, and hotels, the travel business which he
manages was the only private Vietnamese firm present.
</P>
<P>
"It is the economic opening-up policy that has pushed up the
tourism development of our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam received one million overseas tourists in 1996 and this
year's target is set at 1.6 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese tourism officials think China was fortunate to
host this year's mart, since from 1998 on, the venue of PATA Mart
will be permanently located at the Suntec Exhibition Center in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Many PATA officials attributed the success of this year's fair
largely to China's charm as the world's fifth largest tourist
destination.
</P>
<P>
Leading Chinese travel agencies, major airlines, and upscale
hotels hosted 54 booths, the largest number among participating
countries.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that on the first day, 638 foreign buyers went
to 41 Chinese booths to talk business, with 114 letters of intent
signed.
</P>
<P>
"The Mart will contribute remarkably to the growth of China's
international tourism in 1998," said Zhao Ming, a sales manager of
the Head Office of China International Travel Agency, the
country's largest.
</P>
<P>
A number of tourist routes jointly promoted by Hong Kong, Macao
and the Chinese mainland also attracted attention.
</P>
<P>
Also present were Taiwan's travel agencies, airlines and
hotels. Tourist authorities from both sides of the Taiwan Straits
said they hope to see exchanges between tourist and travel
personnel of the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Wall Street at Crossroads (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Investors at Wall Street is now
at the crossroads, wondering whether to buy, sell or hold.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, the Dow Jones industrial average recouped
312 points, having erased nearly half of its recent 700-point
slide. Asian and European markets generally followed suit.
</P>
<P>
Last week's relatively low volume and the limited blue-chip
focus of the market's advance prompted many analysts to question
the rebound's resiliency.
</P>
<P>
Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard &AMP; Poor's weekly newsletter
The Outlook, said, "There's still a feeling that this is a minor
pullback, that people should buy on the dips."
</P>
<P>
When the blue chip gauge slid to 6,391.69 points on April 11,
some cooler heads warned against panic selling, saying that a
correction of 10 percent is a healthy sign after the extraordinary
gains of recent months. Since 1994, the stock market kept on going
up and hasn't had a major correction. The Dow touched 7,085.16,
the highest ever, on March 11.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has practically removed one of the main
supports for the bull market. Last month, the central bank raised
one of its key lending rates for the first time in two years as a
bid to slow the economy and prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
Stocks have fallen sharply over the past month amid worries
that profits will suffer if the Federal Reserve raises interest
rates again to reduce inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
It is even more difficult now to discuss bulls or bears after
the market has recovered a big proportion of lost territories.
</P>
<P>
In any case, the triple-digit losses on the Dow are less
dramatic than they look. With the Dow near 7,000, a fall of 150
points represents only 2 percent of the market's value. To match
the percentage loss of the October 1987 crash, the Dow would have
to lose about 1,420 points in one day.
</P>
<P>
As a trend of the past two weeks, strong earnings reports by
major technology issues like Intel and Microsoft did little to
bolster the sector.
</P>
<P>
While many are predicting that the market will either climb or
plunge, there's another saying: Maybe the market will simply
remain somewhere between bull and bear, or barely rising -- for a
long, long time.
</P>
<P>
To minimize the risk of devastating losses, some experts are
giving advice as to shifting some funds to the treasury or foreign
exchange market where yielding is getting higher.

<TEXT>
<P>
Generally speaking, the stock market has been growing in an
ideal economic environment, in which inflation and interest rates
have been kept low, the economy is growing, and corporate profits
are on the rise. But some analysts said that when things can't get
any better, they can only get worse, and that is something also
worried by many investors.
</P>
<P>
Most of the attention and worries are now focused on the
Federal Reserve. Chairman Alan Greenspan said several times that
the current stock prices are too high, and, with the Fed also
still worried about inflation, there is a real fear that last
month's interest-rate increase could lead to one or more.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the market is hanging more on high technology now.
When banks and financial-services companies do poorly when rates
are rising, investors turn their eyes more to technology shares.
The ups and downs of bellwether technology stocks, whose value
almost doubled over the past year, insert greater influence to the
market.
</P>
<P>
The hidden factors affecting growth of the market also include
the performance of major companies whose returns are so affected
by interest rates and support of investors.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that personal savings in the U.S. have fallen
from 9 percent in 1975 to about 5 percent today. Much of the money
now going into the stock market is money that used to go into
banks. But the flow has slowed down over the past month. The money
flown into the stock market through mutual funds decreased to 9.5
billion U.S. dollars in March from 18.5 billion U.S. dollars in
February.
</P>
<P>
According to some market observers, the market will have
trouble when the influx of funds was getting much slower. The New
York stock market's double-digit increase over the past two years
was also helped by the fast increase of investment.
</P>
<P>
It will probably be an all-time truth that investors who have
realistic goals and follow sound, long-term strategies can still
do well in a turbulent stock market.

<HEADLINE> Teen-age Smokers in US Rise Sharply Over Last 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Teen-age Smokers in the United
States climbed sharply over the last five years, triggering off a
hot debate in the country of what has caused the teen-age smoking
rate rising so quickly.
</P>
<P>
Teen-age smoking rates declined in the 1970s and leveled off in
the 1980s. But last year, the percentage of 12th graders who
smoked daily was up 20 percent from 1991, to 22 percent, and the
rate among 10th graders jumped 45 percent, to 18.3 percent, and
the rate for 8th graders was up 44 percent, to 10.4 percent,
according to the most recent edition of the University of
Michigan's Monitoring the Future Survey, an annual study widely
followed by tobacco researchers.
</P>
<P>
Five people now younger than 18 will eventually die of
tobacco-related illnesses, at current smoking rates, according to
the most recent projections from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta City.
</P>
<P>
Rising youth smoking rates have been cited by the Food and Drug
Administration and President Bill Clinton as evidence that the
tobacco industry is marketing its products in youths.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times said in a report today that the surge in
teen-age smoking in the 1990s coincided with a sharp expansion by
both Reynolds and Philip Moris, two big tobacco companies in the
United States, in giveaways of items like T-shirt in return for
coupons accumulated by buying their cigarettes.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi today blamed the
African National Congress for its social problems when calling on
his party members to prepare for the 1999 national elections.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a mass rally at Lindelant, Kwazulu Natal Province,
Buthelezi said the IFP is needed in government to solve the
"bread-and-butter" problems of the people.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that escalating crime, unemployment and the
failure to create jobs was due to weaknesses in the African
National Congress-led government.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi, also minister of home affairs in the cabinet,
criticized the ANC for monopolizing all aspects of policy
formation, noting that more autonomous provincial rule would
allow the IFP-controlled provincial legislature to deal with
social problems effectively.
</P>
<P>
He called on all the IFP communities, their leaders and
supporters to be more proactive in election campaigning.

NEW DELHI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Shanker Dayal
Sharma said today that he appointed United Front (UF) leader I. K.
Gujral the country's 12th prime minister in a bid to avert a
mid-term poll in less than a year, the Press Trust of India
reported.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the Presidential Palace here tonight
said the decision to invite Gujral to form a new government was
taken in view of the Congress Party pledge to support the new UF
government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s indication of
not being in a position to form the government.
</P>
<P>
It said the decision was also taken on balance of
considerations relevant to national interest particularly the need
to avert a mid-term poll so soon after the general elections held
in 1996, less than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Before Gujral was invited to form the government, the president
had held intensive discussions with senior BJP leaders Atal Behari
Vajpayee and L. K. Advani and Congress Party President Sitaram
Kesri.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Shanker Dayal
Sharma tonight appointed United Front (UF) leader I. K. Gujral the
country's 12th prime minister, bringing to an end three weeks of
political turmoil triggered by the Congress Party's withdrawal of
support to the government led by H. D. Deve Gowda on March 30.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Gujral, who will head a 16-party coalition,
came within less than 12 hours of his unanimous election as leader
of the UF parliamentary party earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The requisite oath of office and secrecy is scheduled to take
place at 10:00 hours tomorrow morning, an hour before the
parliament meets for a special session to pass the budget for
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The president directed Gujral to seek a vote of confidence in
the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) by Tuesday (April
22).
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old Janata Dal (a major constituent of the United
Front) veteran, who was asked by the president to give the names
of those to be included in the Council of Ministers, told
reporters at the Presidential Palace here that he will finalize
the list tonight.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the United Front went to the president this morning
formally staking the front's claim to form a new government
shortly after electing Gujral as its parliamentary party leader.
</P>
<P>
The president decided to invite Gujral to form the government
after intensive discussions during the day with Senior leaders of
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Atal Behari Vajpayee and L. K.
Advani, and Congress Party President Sitaram Kesri.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir to Ferry Back Libyan Pilgrims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- EgyptAir, the Egyptian national
flag carrier, will start ferrying back Libyan pilgrims from Saudi
Arabia from Saturday, an EgyptAir official said today.
</P>
<P>
The return flights will continue until May 8, Regional
Director of the airliner Nagdi Faraag told the Egyptian news
agency MENA.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir has done its best to make the annual Hajj season a
success for the Libyan pilgrims because of the special
relationship between the two brotherly countries and between
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi, he said.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir operated about 90 flights to carry 10,750 Libyans
from the Libyan cities of Benghazi and Tripoli to Mecca, the
Islamic holiest site, this year.
</P>
<P>
It has been allowed by the U.N. Security Council Committee on
Libya to provide the transport in the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
The move comes to relieve the difficulties that Libyan pilgrims
face in traveling on land or by sea, because of the U.N.
sanctions that limit diplomatic contacts, ban arms sales and
prohibit air traffic in and out of the African country.
</P>
<P>
However, Libya broke the embargo for the third consecutive
year on April 4 by flying 105 pilgrims, including members of an
official Libyan delegation, to Saudi Arabia on a Libyan Arab
Airways flight.
</P>
<P>
The plane returned to Libya the next morning.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has imposed an international embargo on Libya since
April 1992 for its refusal to hand over two Libyans suspected of
involvement in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet in Lockbie,
Scotland, which killed 270 people.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Floods resulted from heavy
rain have killed 23 people and injured 22 others in Ethiopia's
southwestern town of Arba Minch, a report from the Ethiopian News
Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The report said, most of the victims were children. The bodies
of many people were found some 5 kms away from their localities.
</P>
<P>
"The death toll could increase because rocks rolled by the
floods from the nearby basin have crushed the houses of many
people," said the report by quoting local administrators.
</P>
<P>
The local police and members of the riot police with the
support of the general public are continuing to look for more
corpses, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The rain that fell on Saturday destroyed many residential
units and damaged property whose value is not yet known. Electric
and telephone lines in the town were dismantled by the floods.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Calls for Votes in British Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the Irish Republican Army (IRA), held an annual party conference
today with a call for votes in Britain's May 1 election to force
the incoming government to lift a ban on its entry to Northern
Ireland peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, told some 500 delegates
that Sinn Fein votes in the election would put pressure on the
British government and pro-British unionist parties to end the ban
and talk.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, which shares the IRA goal of an end to British rule
and the reunification of Ireland, is confident of winning two to
three seats, which would present the next British government with
the dilemma of refusing to talk to elected representatives.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Ireland and the United States have banned all contact
with Sinn Fein since the IRA ended a 17-month cease-fire in its
war against British rule in Northern Ireland in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Observers here suggest the IRA may call a truce after the
British election in a bid to get Sinn Fein to the peace talks
which are due to resume on June 3.
</P>
<P>
The Sinn Fein conference, in the Irish border town of Monaghan,
took place one day after the IRA claimed responsibility for bomb
blasts and warnings that created transport havoc on the British
mainland last week.

<HEADLINE> 1stadd: Israeli Prosecutor Drop Indictment Against Netanyahu (By Zhi Linfei) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Attorney-General
Elyakim Rubinstein announced today that no indictment would be
filed against Netanyahu for his involvement in the Bar-On
scandal, citing lack of sufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced at a news conference here
attended by State Attorney Edana Arbel and other police and
justice officials. Repeatedly describing the alleged "Bar-On for
Hebron" scandal as a very difficult and complicated matter,
Rubinstein said the state prosecution decided to reject the
police recommendation to indict Netanyahu as well as Justice
Minister Tzahi Hanegbi because they thought there were no
court-tight evidence to file the indictments.
</P>
<P>
But Rubinstein said Shas party leader Aryeh Deri would be
charged with extortion in pushing for the appointment of
former Jerusalem Roni Bar-On as the attorney-general in order
to serve his private interests.
</P>
<P>
According to the exposure of Bar-On affair by the state
television Channel I, Deri reportedly conditioned Shas' support on
the Bar-On's appointment in hope to obtain a plea bargain
deal in pushing for Bar-On's appointment.
</P>
<P>
No decision was made on the police recommendation of
indictment against the Prime Minister's Office Director-General
Avigdor Liberman.
</P>
<P>
The tone of Rubinstein's statements was relatively soft on
Netanyahu, who he said that indeed suggested Bar-On's
appointment in order to appease his coalition ally Deri. But
the attorney-general pointed out that no solid evidence had
been obtained to prove that Deri's threats had reached
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"After closing the deliberation, we drew the conclusion that
we do not have sufficient and physical evidence with
sufficient grounds for proving that indeed there is criminal
offense on the part of the prime minister," Rubinstein.
</P>
<P>
However, detailed report on the state Attorney's Office
reviewing of the police recommendations and materials will be
released late by State Attorney Arbel in a 80-page report.
The language used in her report is regarded as crucial to
Netanyahu who is striving to avert the collapse of the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Despite the escape from an indictment, Netanyahu still faces
a crisis of survival as some ministers might consider leaving
the government, whose image and credibility have been seriously
damaged by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that the likely defectors within the
cabinet included Likud's Finance Minister Dan Meridor and
Communications Minister Limor Livnat, Yisrael Baaliya's Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky and Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein,
and The Third Way's Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani.
</P>
<P>
They have indicated their willingness to leave the government
if the state attorney's report contained scathing criticism of
Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Britain's White Collar Staff Getting Sicker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain's white collar workers are
getting sicker, according to an absenteeism survey by the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
The finding that sick leave among professionals has soared by
25 percent in the past two years is expected to be one of the main
conclusions of the biennial survey.
</P>
<P>
Manual workers are in better health than their professional
counterparts with the number of days off sick unchanged since the
last survey in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Management experts argue that Britain's industry is only now
taking the 12 billion pound (19.2 billion US dollar) annual cost
of sick days seriously by checking up on absent workers.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the CBI said, "Figures for 1996 show that 187
million working days were lost due to absence which averages 8.4
days per employee and cost employers around 530 pounds (848 US
dollars) per employee."
</P>
<P>
"While the absence rate for manual workers is largely unchanged
since 1994, there was a 25 percent increase in the rate for
skilled and professional staff," he added.
</P>
<P>
The figures also reveal that workers in the public sector are
33 percent more likely to be "off" than those in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
The survey found employers that introduced family-friendly
policies were usually able to cut absence rates.
</P>
<P>
Companies were reported to be attempting to cut the number of
"sick" days taken by staff by mounting raids on those allegedly
ill.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The gender imbalances that
existed among graduates 10 years ago have virtually been
eradicated in South Africa, according to a latest survey by the
Human Sciences Research Council.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, only 39 percent of those who graduated from South
African universities were women, whereas in 1994 women
constituted almost half of the graduates, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 35 percent of all graduates in South
Africa held a postgraduate qualification in 1994, the survey
said.
</P>
<P>
On occupational income of graduates in the country, the survey
showed that the average income package of self-employed people
was 142,600 Rands (about 32,500 U.S. Dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, employees in the public sector earned 90,300
Rands (about 20,500 U.S. Dollars) and employees in the private
sector 117,100 Rands (nearly 26,600 U.S. Dollars). The top
earners were self-employed brokers, the survey added.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Refugees in Nigeria not Included in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The 7,000 Liberian refugees in
Nigeria will not participate in the voluntary repatriation
program of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR), scheduled to begin later this month.
</P>
<P>
This was reported today by the official News Agency of
Nigeria, which added that west African host countries arranged
for a phased repatriation of the Liberian refugees at a meeting
in Monrovia last month.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are about 750,000 Liberians seeking
refuge abroad, most of whom are hosted by Guinea, Cote D'Ivoire,
Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of the refugees will cost about 60 million
U.S. Dollars, half of which will be spent in the host countries,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It recalled that during a visit to the refugees' camp in Ogun
State, southwest Nigeria last month, Nigerian Minister of Special
Duties, Laz Unaogu said that the repatriation of the refugees in
the camp will start later this year.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking official with the National Refugee Commission
of Nigeria, who pleaded anonymity, however, was quoted as saying
that the repatriation will not start until the officials are
convinced that the peace process in Liberia is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
A repatriation program was to be implemented in April last
year but had to be given up when new violence broke out, the
official explained.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to exercise some patience this time," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Gets Message From Arafat Amid Intensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa received a message from Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat today amid intensified Egyptian diplomatic drive to
break the Mideast impasse.
</P>
<P>
Arafat gave a full assessment of the current situation in the
Middle East in the message handed over by Arafat's adviser
Marawan Kanafani, said Nabil Fahmi, political adviser to the
Egyptian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Fahmi said that the coming stage will witness intensified
Egyptian and Palestinian coordination at all levels.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt will also continue its contacts with all quarters
involved in the peace process, with the U.S. and EU in the lead,
in order to surmount the current crisis that stalks the peace
process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa has carried out intensive contacts and consultations
with senior officials at the Palestinian National Authority over
the past three days, according to Egyptian Gazette today.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Moussa also joined a meeting between Arafat and
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in Malta, in the first direct
official meeting between the Palestinian and Israeli sides since
the peace process plunged to the worst crisis in its seven-year
history since Israel decided to build a Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem last month.
</P>
<P>
In another move to step up its diplomatic campaign to restart
the peace talks, Egypt sent a top envoy to Washington last Tuesday
to present its ideas to push forward Arab-Israeli negotiations
when separate initiatives from the U.S. and the EU had flopped.
</P>
<P>
"We are awaiting the American initiative that U.S. President
Bill Clinton has referred to," Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu Redina
said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he reasserted the Palestinian determination to keep
East Jerusalem intact before the final talks and to stop any
unilateral decision concerning the holy city.
</P>
<P>
"East Jerusalem is the red line that could not be trespassed, a
fact already recorded in the American letter of guarantees at
Madrid and the Oslo agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Contradicting to the Israeli claim, however, he pointed out
that security coordination with Israel has not been resumed after
two rounds of talks in Gaza since last Thursday that grouped
Arafat and senior U.S. and Israeli security officials.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had demanded
Palestinians to halt violence but refused to halt the construction
of the Har Homa neighborhood, a move that has stranded the peace
talks and sparked almost daily clashes in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

<HEADLINE> 2ndadd: Netanyahu Slams Opponents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- following the prosecution's
decision not to indict him over the Bar-On scandal, Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu slammed his opponents for launching a
de-legitimizing campaign against him and vowed to continue his
policies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the nation on the private television Channel 2,
Netanyahu described himself as a victim of the witch-hunt
campaign launched by his political opponents who refused to
accept the results of last year's elections that swept him to
power.
</P>
<P>
"These attacks against me stem from one central motive, namely
the attempt to cause the government to fall because of
fundamental disagreements at all levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
He specifically attacked his political opponents for launching
the campaign to topple him just because he favored building the
Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem, being committed to
maintaining the unity of Jerusalem, rejecting establishment of a
Palestinian state and refusing to return the Golan Heights to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
"They will not succeed ... we will continue to speaking on
your behalf: you, the voters who voted for me," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he might have made a mistake in the Bar-On
affair, but committed definitely no criminal offense. He said he
would draw a lession from the scandal and do everything possible
to correct the damage that had been done to his government.
</P>
<P>
He also blasted the media, especially state television Channel
I which broke the news on Bar-On affair in January, for personal
attacks against him. By deliberately choosing to speak on the
private Channel 2, Netanyahu was apparently venting his anger
toward Channel I.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was ready to accept the challenge ahead,
calling for the public trust and support to him in order to build
a better future.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this evening, Israeli Attorney-General Elyakim
Rubinstein announced not to indict Netanyahu as well as Justice
Minister Tzahi Hanegbi for their alleged involvement in the
"Bar-On for Hebron scandal" for lack of solid evidence in the
police recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Only Shas leader Aryeh Deri would be charged with extortion in
pushing for the appointment of former Jerusalem lawyer Roni
Bar-On as the attorney-general in January in hope to obtain a
plea bargain deal in his bribery trial.

the exporting sector had helped improve Zimbabwe's gross foreign
reserves, which at the end of 1996 were estimated at 720 million
U.S. Dollars, or four months import cover.
</P>
<P>
The foreign reserves have, however, recently been under
pressure from importers ahead of new high tariffs which came into
effect last month, and import cover has since fallen to about
three months.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts expect the import cover to increase from
this month because of the large inflow of proceeds from this
year's tobacco auctions, which open on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the exporting sector has posted remarkable
gains in the past three years, with the cumulative increase in
exports in U.S. Dollars rising to 55 percent by the end of 1996.

<HEADLINE> More SLA Militiamen Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Two members of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) were killed and at least two others
wounded in two consecutive military operations today in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent retaliation for the death of its collaborators,
Israel sent warplanes to strike a suspicious guerrilla target on
the edge of the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone."
</P>
<P>
Police sources reported that Israeli warplanes launched an air
raid at vicinities of Sujoud, Jezzin, at 4:30 p.m. (13:30 GMT)
and fired two air-to-surface missiles. No casualties were caused
in the air strike.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Israeli-backed SLA Militia, led by retired
Lebanese army General Antoine Lahd, said that a SLA officer
identified as Asad Namour was Killed in a bomb blast in Bakasin,
Jezzin, this morning.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese guerrillas detonated a second bomb when a group of
militiamen led by Rimon Abu Marad, SLA's commander of the
Jezzin area, arrived at the scene to check the incident, killing
one militiaman and wounding at least two others.
</P>
<P>
Voice of the South, radio of the SLA armed by Israel to
patrol the buffer zone, confirmed that one of SLA officer was
killed in the town of Bakasin by a bomb planted apparently by
guerrillas in his car.
</P>
<P>
It added that in another attack, the guerrillas detonated a
bomb near the town when a SLA patrol comprising two vehicles was
passing by.
</P>
<P>
One vehicle was destroyed in the explosion, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Israeli guerrillas, especially fighters of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God. escalated their campaign
against the 2,500-strong SLA militia this month and refrained
from directly attacking the 1,000 Israeli occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
Today's operations raised the casualties of the SLA since this
year to five killed and 19 injured.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon also reported that early in
the afternoon, the guerrillas carried out attacks at Israeli
positions at Bir Kalab, Sujoud and Kassarah Aroush with
machine-guns and rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
But no word on casualties was available.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli artillery bombarded Iglim Al-Toffah, or
Province of Apple, a mountain area some 60 kilometers southeast
of the capital of Beirut and often used by Lebanese guerrillas as
a springboard to attack the border enclave.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces bombarded Iglim Al-Toffah and West Beqaa on
Saturday night and early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes carried out reconnaissance flights over
Western Beqaa this morning, drawing upward ground fire opened by
the Lebanese Army's anti-air units in the area.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also flew over the south Lebanese port city
of Tyre and nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 to curb cross-border attacks on northern Israel.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Reduce Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean president Robert
Mugabe today said his government is committed to bringing down
the budget deficit which analysts said is one of the major
problem frustrating rapid economic growth of the country.
</P>
<P>
In his annual message to exhibitors at this year's 38th trade
fair, which starts on April 22 in Bulawayo, the country's second
largest city, the president noted the budget deficit was one of
the causes of macro-economic instability Zimbabwe has been
experiencing ever since market reforms were launched in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit is in the year to June 1997 expected to
exceed 11 percent of gdp, compared with a target of about 8.5
percent, and this was mainly due to unbudgeted expenditure on
civil servants salary and bonus payments.
</P>
<P>
The president said measures being taken included rationalising
spending by commercialising parastatals, and in some cases
privatising them.
</P>
<P>
He added, "we are also improving efficiency and effectiveness
in the delivery of public services, while at the same time
enhancing our revenue collection systems without necessarily
raising taxes."

JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat's spokesman Marwan Kanafani said tonight that Israeli prime
minister Netanyahu is cleared now of charges against him, he will
have to concentrate his mind on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the escape of indictment of the Israeli prime
minister, he said, "We have recognized from the very beginning
that the whole issue is a domestic and internal Israeli affair and
we are not going to interfere in the situation."
</P>
<P>
Kanafani said that Israeli Attorney-General "Mr. Rubinstein
declared the decision of the Israeli judiciary system, we respect
that." However, he said, the Palestinians are most interested in
the peace process hoping that the whole affair will not affect
it.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem the Palestinians are having with the
Israelis is not security coordination, but that Netanyahu should
make up his mind to resume the peace process if he is a true
partner of the Palestinians and President Yasser Arafat on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"(U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis) Ross was here
last week, we didn't get anything going because of what is
happening in Israel now," he said, adding "We think we should, with
the Israelis, go back on the right track of the peace process."

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Meets With Carter on Peace in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
Al-Bashir met here today with the visiting former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter on arrangements for the signing of a peace agreement
due on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese "Om Durman" radio reported that emerging from the
meeting, Carter said he and Al-Bashir discussed the progress of
the peace process in Sudan. The talks also dealt with the issue of
peace between Sudan and its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese government is scheduled to sign a peace agreement
Monday with the leaders of four small rebel factions. But the
largest anti-government group operating in southern Sudan, the
Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), has refused to join the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The radio report quoted Sudanese Ambassador to Washington Mahdi
Ibrahim, who attended the Bashir-Carter meeting, as saying that
"the talks dealt with the prospective admission of other parties
to the peace agreement, the attainment of the cherished peace in
southern Sudan and making it an example to be followed in the
African continent which had suffered from conflicts and external
interference."
</P>
<P>
The radio reported that Carter also met with Sudanese Foreign
Minister Ali Osman Mohammed Taha and Dr Hassan Abdulla Al Turabi,
speaker of the Sudanese National Assembly, on the preparatory
steps to sign the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been raging in the war-torn country since the
beginning of this year between the government forces on the one
side and the northern opposition parties of the National
Democratic Alliance and rebel troops of the SPLA on the other in
the Sudanese eastern and southern border areas.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Carter arrived in Khartoum Saturday on a week-long trip
which will also take him to Uganda, Eritrea and Ethiopia, three
Sudanese neighbors that have been charged of supporting the
Sudanese rebels.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Firefighters in Grand Forks,
North Dakota of the United States, have contained a fire that
destroyed at least six buildings on three different blocks
overnight.
</P>
<P>
The blaze was still burning at midday today, but was expected
to be completely out by this evening, said news reports.
</P>
<P>
As floodwaters hampered conventional fire-fighting efforts,
fire crews assisted by U.S. Coast Guard personnel and other
agencies used fire-bombing planes to dump chemicals on the blaze.
</P>
<P>
Fire equipment was also brought in to pump floodwaters from the
overflowing Red River onto the burning buildings. Grand Forks Air
Force Base sent in a floating pumper truck.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of injuries, but concerns about
structural safety were keeping crews from searching the damaged
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Several other buildings were damaged by the fire in addition to
the six that were totally destroyed, but early damage assessments
were still under way.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire, which began burning at about 4 p.m.
Saturday, has not been determined.

<HEADLINE> Funds-Raising Key to Liberian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- How to raise the 13 million U.S.
dollars needed for the May 30 Liberian elections has now become a
key issue in ensuring final peace and democracy in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency of Nigeria said in a report today
that a detailed budget for the elections has been submitted to
general Sani Abacha, the Nigerian head of state and chairman of
the west African Economic Community of West African States
(ECOMAS), the peace-maker in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
However, the report indicated that raising of the fund has now
become a major task fore the ECOMAS leaders, who are already
having difficulties in maintaining the 10,000-odd peace-keeping
force in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, as well as some members of the
international community had indicated their intention to help
finance the elections.
</P>
<P>
However, one month to the elections, none of them have
redeemed their pledges, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Gambari, Nigerian's permanent representative to the
United Nations and the newly-re-elected chairman of the UN
special committee on peace-keeping operations, had last week
called on the international society to redeem their pledges to
fund the Liberian elections.
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, officials at the Nigerian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs are optimistic that the ECOMAS leaders will rise
to the challenge, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and it would
be risky to lose the present momentum in the implementation of
the peace plan," an official said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Crisis Not Over Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu had a temporary sigh of relief tonight following the
state prosecution's decision to drop indictment against him over
the Bar-On scandal.
</P>
<P>
But for the near future, the government crisis will continue
looming large in Netanyahu's mind and he has to fight the
possible defections within his cabinet and the legal challenge
from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein announced this evening
that he and State Attorney Edana Arbel decided not to accept the
 police recommendation of indictments against Netanyahu and
Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi, citing lack of sufficient
evidence that can stand the rigors of the court.
</P>
<P>
Only Shas party leader Aryeh Deri was charged with extortion
and fraud in pushing the government to appoint former Jerusalem
lawyer Roni Bar-On as the attorney-general in January in hope to
obtain a plea bargain deal in his bribery trial.
</P>
<P>
The acquittal of charges and the relatively soft language
used by the attorney-general on Netanyahu's role in the Bar-On
affair in fact virtually averted the immediate downfall of the
Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
Is was almost certain that if Netanyahu is indicted, he would
be forced to resign to pave the way for new elections. And if
attorney-general's report on the affair contained harsh criticism
could also bring down the government due to possible subsequent
cabinet defections.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still not completely clear now that if
Netanyahu has overcome the crisis to survive, because some
ministers will carefully read the 80-page prosecution's final
report on Bar-On affair.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein in fact did not clear all the cloud over
Netanyahu's head for his role in the short-lived appointment of
Bar-On. The attorney-general did note that "suspicions and
doubts" still existed over Netanyahu's role in the controversial
appointment, and the main reason to drop indictment was only for
the lack of solid evidence.
</P>
<P>
So the prosecution's report is still wide open to different
interpretation by the whole society, and crucial for some
ministers who are described as "the weak links" in the
coalition. Some of them might still think that the current
government's credibility and image have been severely damaged,
thus losing the public trust and moral ground to continue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, even when local media predicted no indictment
to be filed against Netanyahu, several cabinet ministers were
reportedly considering leaving the coalition: they included
Likud's Finance Minister Dan Meridor and Communications Minister
Limor Livnat, Yisrael Baaliya's Trade Minister Natan Sharansky
and Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein, and The Third Way's
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani.
</P>
<P>
Both Yisrael Baaliya and The Third Way will hold urgent
meetings tonight to decide their future participation in the
current government. Netanyahu and his aides have been trying
hard since the weekend to prevent cabinet defections, holding
dialogues with both party leaderships.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli law, if the coalition loses its majority of 61
seats in the 120-seat Knesset (Parliament), it should resign to
pave the way for holding new elections within 60 days. The
Likud-led coalition holds 66 Knesset seats, including Yisrael
Baaliya's 7 seats and The Third Way's 4 seats.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leading opposition parties Labor and Meretz have
planned to press on with their campaign to topple the government
by petitioning the High Court of Justice to overrule the
attorney-general's decision not to indict Netanyahu and other
officials. This will be long legal battle that might continue
haunting the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
So today's decision by the state prosecution to refrain from
filing charges against him only provided Netanyahu a very short
sigh of relieve, and the crisis of survival is still lurking
somewhere.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Calls for Pooled Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today urged exhaustive efforts to salvage the faltering
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The stalled Mideast peace should be salvaged and should be out
of the present bottleneck for the good of all parties," Moussa
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He called for holding all necessary contacts to rescue the
peace march and to return it back to its right track in line with
the principles of reaching a balanced peace.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the message he received from Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat today, in which Arafat gave a full assessment of the
current situation of the Mideast peace process, Moussa said that
it comes within the context of the Egyptian-Palestinian
coordination to save the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
"Intensive contacts are under way with the parties concerned,"
Moussa added, in a reference to his recent meetings in Malta with
European, Palestinian and Israeli officials as well as the
contacts made by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's Political
Advisor Osama el-Baz in Washington.
</P>
<P>
However, he lamented that these contacts have not yet yielded
any results.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, siding with the Palestinians, has intensified its
diplomatic drive in a bid to stop the Israeli Jewish settlement
construction in disputed East Jerusalem and revive the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has insisted that
Arafat stop the riots and crack down on militants. Arafat, in
turn, has said that Israel must stop the settlement construction
in East Jerusalem and in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu Redina said today that the
Palestinians have made no decision on resuming security
cooperation with Israel, despite Israel's claim that it has
secured Palestinian promise to curb violence.
</P>
<P>
Arafat broke contacts with Israeli security forces in
mid-March, angered by Israeli Jewish home-building in East
Jerusalem. The security cooperation had been a success of
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking, and was deemed vital for foiling
suicide attacks on Israeli targets.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Irish PM Allegedly Involved in Bribery Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Irish Prime Minister
Charles Haughey is alleged to get involved into a bribery case in
which he has received more than 1.6 million U.S. dollars from a
department store millionaire, said reports from Dublin, capital of
Ireland, today.
</P>
<P>
An inquiry into charges that millionaire Ben Dunne paid
millions of dollars to Irish politicians opened Monday, and
Haughey, prime minister four times between 1979 and 1992, will be
named as a recipient.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is likely to stoke the fires under a
smouldering election campaign pitting Prime Minister John Bruton's
three-party coalition against the Fianna Fail opposition which
Haughey once led.
</P>
<P>
According to The Sunday Times, Haughey received money through
intermediaries in 1989. The money, paid in several instalments,
ended up in an account in the Cayman Islands, which has strict
secrecy laws protecting account holders
</P>
<P>
However, Haughey, a veteran politician in the country, has
denied his involvement in the scandal which burst last December
although Irish Transport Minister Michael Lowry has resigned after
admitting that Dunne paid for a quarter-million pound house
renovation.
</P>
<P>
The scandal raised calls for an overhaul of the way political
parties are funded in Ireland and more openness in the links
between big business and politics.
</P>
<P>
Dunne is expected to be among the first called to give evidence
when the tribunal of inquiry begins at Dublin Castle Monday.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Netanyahu Escapes Indictment Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Attorney-General
Elyakim Rubinstein announced today that no indictment would be
filed against Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu for his
involvement in the Bar-On scandal, citing lack of sufficient
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here, Rubinstein described the
"Bar-On for Hebron" scandal as a very difficult and
complicated matter. He said he and State Attorney Edana Arbel
decided to close the case against Netanyahu and Justice
Minister Tzahi Hanegbi for reason of insufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
The police investigators probing the Bar-On affair last week
recommended indicting Netanyahu, Tzahi Hanegbi, Prime Minister's
Office Director-General Avigdor Liberman with breach of trust
and fraud for their involvement in the short-lived appointment
of former Jerusalem lawyer Roni Bar-On as the attorney-general
in January.
</P>
<P>
But Rubinstein said there was sufficient evidence to indict
Shas party leader Aryeh Deri for extortion and fraud in
pushing for Bar-On's appointment in order to serve his private
interests.
</P>
<P>
According to the original report which exposed the Bar-On
affair by the state television Channel I, Deri reportedly
conditioned Shas' support to the Hebron agreement on the
Bar-On's appointment in hope to obtain a plea bargain deal
in his bribery trial.
</P>
<P>
No decision was made on the police charges against
Prime Minister's Office Director-General Avigdor Liberman,
and the investigation on his role would continue, Rubinstein
said.
</P>
<P>
The tone of Rubinstein's statements was relatively soft on
Netanyahu, who he said that indeed suggested Bar-On's
appointment in order to appease his coalition ally Deri. But
the attorney-general pointed out that no solid evidence had
been obtained to prove that Deri's threats had reached
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"After closing the deliberation, we drew the conclusion that
we do not have sufficient and physical evidence with
sufficient grounds for proving that indeed there is criminal
offense on the part of the prime minister," Rubinstein.
</P>
<P>
Arbel released a 80-page detailed report on the State
Attorney's Office's reviewing of the police recommendations and
materials. The language used in her report is regarded as
crucial to Netanyahu who is striving to avert the collapse
of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
In his immediate reaction, Netanyahu welcomed the state
prosecution's decision, saying he had been vindicated. He
described himself as the victim of the de-legitematizing campaign
launched by his political opponents and the media, particularly
the Channel I Television which first exposed the Bar-On
scandal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the private television Channel 2, Netanyahu
blasted the Bar-On affair as part of the leftists' campaign
aimed at bringing down his elected government, simply because
of its policies of building in Har Homa, opposing division
of Jerusalem, rejecting a Palestinian state and refusing return
of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the nation to look forward, Netanyahu denied he
had committed any crime though he might have made a mistake.
He called for the public's trust and support to him in
order to build a better future.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor's leader Shimon Peres said attorney-general's
ruling proved two things: though there was no enough evidence
to bring Netanyahu to trial, but there was reason and
evidence to put Netanyahu before the public for judgement. He
predicted that Netanyahu could not go on in the shadow of
one of the most serious accusations.
</P>
<P>
Leading candidate for Labor's leadership Ehud Barak called on
every honest citizen to question about the moral authority of
Netanyahu, who he said only escaped an indictment because of
insufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition Meretz leader Rossi Sarid said he would
appeal to the High Court of Justice to overturn the state
prosecution's decision on indictments against Netanyahu and
Hanegbi. He believed that the prime minister would find it
difficult to function.
</P>
<P>
Despite the escape from an indictment, Netanyahu still faces
a crisis of survival as some ministers might consider leaving
the government, whose image and credibility have been seriously
damaged by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that the likely defectors within the
cabinet included Likud's Finance Minister Dan Meridor and
Communications Minister Limor Livnat, Yisrael Baaliya's Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky and Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein,
and The Third Way's Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Baaliya and The Third Way are holding emergency
meetings late tonight to discuss their future participation in
the current government. Their decision would be crucial to the
fate of the Netanyahu government, which holds only a majority
of 66 seats in the 120-seat Knesset (Parliament), including
Yisrael Baaliya's seven seats and The Third Way's four seats.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli law, new elections will be held within 60
days if the government loses its 61 seat majority at the
Knesset.

tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> Uzbekistan Joins U.N. Program to Benefit Disabled People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan has signed a document
to join a United Nations regional program for providing more
benefits to people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
The program, said an Itar-Tass news agency report from Tashkent
today, stems from a U.N. proclamation calling for the full
participation and equality of disabled people.
</P>
<P>
By endorsing the document, Uzbek Social Protection Minister
Bakhodyr Umurzakov was quoted as saying, the country would join
the international community in protecting the disabled.
</P>
<P>
The move made Uzbekistan eligible for 240,000 U.S. dollars from
the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific
(ESCAP) for creating 5,000 job positions for disabled people.
</P>
<P>
Umurzakov noted that the Uzbek government is carrying out its
own 1996-2000 program for protecting disabled people.
</P>
<P>
Five rehabilitation centers are scheduled for opening within
this year to provide social, medical and labor assistance to over
50,000 people in the Central Asian country, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Also this year, he added, about 30,000 disabled people will
have an opportunity to spend holidays at state-owned health
centers and holiday hotels for free.

<HEADLINE> OIC Chief Arrives in Egypt on Mideast Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Izzidine Laraki, secretary
general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)
arrived here today starting his four-nation tour designed to show
solidarity with the Arab and Islamic countries' stance on the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The visit, which is the first of its kind to be paid by Laraki
since he became new OIC chief early this year, will also take him
to Palestinian self-rule Gaza, Jordan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, the Moroccan-origin Laraki said his visit is
aimed at expressing the organization's support for Arab and
Islamic efforts exerted within the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the peace process should be based on agreements
concluded by the Palestinians and Israelis as well as on the
Palestinian rights to establish their own state, with Jerusalem
as its capital.
</P>
<P>
"The OIC is exerting strenuous efforts to back the Palestinian
cause in general and to defend Jerusalem in particular through
contacts with other organizations and countries," according to
Laraki.
</P>
<P>
The 52-member OIC has called for Islamic countries to
reconsider their ties with Israel at its March summit meeting in
Islamabad, Pakistan, in light of Israel's settlement activities
in Jerusalem, a city holy to Muslims, Christians and Jews alike.
</P>
<P>
A special OIC Jerusalem Committee held in Rabat, Morocco, also
condemned the Israeli decision to build new Jewish settlement in
disputed East Jerusalem, a move that has now stalled the Mideast
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier's Speech at PATA Annual Conference (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text of
a speech entitled "Enhancing International Exchanges and
Cooperation, Promoting All-round Development of Tourism Industry,"
delivered by Chinese Premier Li Peng at the Opening Ceremony of an
annual conference of the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA)
held here today:

Delegates,
Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the opening of the 46th Annual Conference of
PATA in Beijing today, I'd like to extend, on behalf of the
Chinese Government and people, our warm welcome to all the
delegates and guests present, and our warm congratulations on the
convocation of the conference.
</P>
<P>
As a highly comprehensive sector in the modern economy, the
tourism industry is not only part and parcel of the global
economy, but also an important symbol of the improvement of
people's livelihood in the modern era. To develop tourism is of
great significance in promoting the friendly exchanges among
people of all countries, deepening the mutual understanding and
friendship among them and accelerating economic growth and social
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the 21st century, we believe that the tourism
industry boasts broad prospects for its future development and
will offer more job opportunities to all the countries, thereby
becoming a major driving force in advancing world economy. In
recent years, with its rapid growth, tourism in the Asia-Pacific
region is holding an increasingly prominent position in the world
tourism industry. As a member of the Asia-Pacific, China is ready
to make positive contributions to the development of tourism in
this region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Being a multi-ethnic country with a vast territory and a long
history of several millennia, China abounds in tourism resources
with its beautiful natural scenery, numerous places of historic
interest and cultural sites and its splendid and colorful
culture. Since reform and opening-up, China has enjoyed a
sustained economic growth, averaging nearly 10 percent per year, a
vigorous development of all its undertakings and a marked rise in
its people's living standards. All this constitutes a solid
foundation for the prosperity in its tourism industry. China's
political stability, economic growth and market prosperity, and
the Chinese Government's opening-up endeavor and its active
efforts to develop its relations with other countries in the world
have also helped create favorable conditions for the development
of tourism. Attaching great importance to tourism, the Chinese
Government has accorded priority to tourism in the development of
the tertiary industries. It has made constant efforts in
developing its tourism resources, improving tourism facilities and
enhancing service quality, thus promoting the speedy development
of tourism both at home and abroad. In 1996, China received over
51 million overseas tourists. Domestic tourists amounted to 640
million person/times. At the same time, as the living standards of
the Chinese people continue to improve, the number of Chinese
people traveling abroad is increasing year by year, which has
instilled fresh vitality into the development of the international
tourism industry.

<P>
This year has been designated as the "Visit China '97"
year. The Chinese Government will give its full support to ensure
the success of this event and will help create better conditons
for promoting the development of China's tourism and the
cooperation between China's tourism community and that of the
world. We hope more friends from overseas will come to China as
tourists and see with their own eyes China's famous mountains,
great rivers and other places of historical interest and scenic
spots, as well as the great changes that have taken place in China
since reform and opening-up. This will contribute to the
enhancement of our mutual understanding and friendship.
</P>
<P>
As an important international tourism organization, PATA has,
over the years, played a positive role in promoting the
development and cooperation in the tourism industry in the
Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole. During this Annual
Conference, the participants will conduct extensive and in-depth
discussions on a variety of important issues concerning the future
development of the tourism industry. I am convinced that with the
joint efforts of all the participants, this Conference will yield
positive results and push further ahead the development of tourism
in this region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
I would like to conclude by wishing this Annual Conference of
PATA will be a crowning success!
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

<HEADLINE> China Starts Massive Campaign against Narcotic Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China announced today it will
carry out a massive targeted fight against narcotics-related
crimes from this month through the end of September, to curb
rampant drug smuggling and the increase of drug use.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was outlined at a national anti-drug conference
late last month, and announced today by the National Committee of
Narcotics Control (NCNC).
</P>
<P>
According to the NCNC, the Chinese authorities have attached
great importance to the drug problem since it re-emerged in the
country in the early 1980s, and have launched a series of
offensives against drug-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by worsening international drug crimes, China is now
confronted with an unprecedented situation: 520,000 drug users
across the country had been registered with government medical
institutions by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
But some local authorities have not fully recognized the
seriousness of the problem, and have not done enough to crack down
on drug-related crime, the NCNC said.
</P>
<P>
It was discovered that some grassroots level authorities have
privately given the green light to drug growers, which has
stimulated the spread of drug production and use.
</P>
<P>
The NCNC demanded party and government bodies at all levels
concentrate on the problems of drug use, planting and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Tight control should be exercised in regions that produce
natural ephedra, which is used to make methamphetamine, or "ice,"
and all illegal dealings in the substance should be eliminated,
the NCNC said.
</P>
<P>
Departments concerned must avoid wranglings over duties and
responsibilities and coordinate with each other, it was urged.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the NCNC said, criminals involved in
drug-related activities must be dealt with strictly in accordance
with law, and fines should never be levied in place of harsher
punishment.
</P>
<P>
It also encouraged public trials to be held for the offenders
in order to educate the public and deter crime, and to mobilize
the public to actively participate in the anti-drug drive,
according to the NCNC.
</P>
<P>
The NCNC set up a general headquarters today for the campaign
and published a hotline number, 65204111, to take reports and
opinions and offer legal advice.

<HEADLINE> MILF-Held Areas Not Separate Territory: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary
Renato de Villa reiterated today that the areas held by the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in the southern Philippines are
not separate territory.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely out of the question to grant any separate
territory to those who disagree with the government," de Villa
stressed in an interview with the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
De Villa said the government allows the MILF liberal access to
some areas in central Mindanao, but that does not mean "we
recognize these areas as belonging to them."
</P>
<P>
Renewed tit-for-tat fighting has continued between the MILF and
the government forces in Mindanao island, the southern
Philippines, since early last week.
</P>
<P>
The military confirmed earlier that as of Sunday, the renewed
fighting had killed 25 MILF rebels and 2 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear whether the fighting will derail the scheduled
third-round of low-level peace talks between the MILF and the
government, which have been delayed several times.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the MILF and the government agreed to
resume low-level peace talks to discuss issues regarding a
comprehensive ceasefire between the two sides in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has set as preconditions for reaching a comprehensive
truce the government's recognition of the MILF-controlled areas
and the government troops' withdrawal from these areas.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), was not part of a peace deal signed last September
by the MNLF and the government.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the largest Muslim rebel group in the
country, with an estimated membership of 12,000. The group has
sought to establish an independent Islamic state.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Finnish Defense Minister
Anneli Taina said here today that the Finnish armed forces are
ready to further advance their "friendly and cooperative"
relations with the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
She made the statement during talks with her Chinese
counterpart Chi Haotian, who is also vice-chairman of China's
Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Chi expressed the belief that Taina's current visit will not
only help develop ties between the two armed forces, but also
benefit the overall growth in the relationship of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese people "need, love and cherish"
peace, adding that China will firmly and unswervingly observe its
independent foreign policy of peace in order to safeguard global
peace and seek common development.
</P>
<P>
China will join all other countries in contributing to the
establishment of a new political order in the world marked by
peace, stability, and rationality, said Chi, who was also briefed
by Taina on the European security situation and Finland's national
defense policy.
</P>
<P>
Kui Fulin, deputy chief of the General Staff of the PLA,
attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Chi presided over a welcoming ceremony in
honor of Taina, who arrived here earlier today as Chi's
guest.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Lower House to Urge Cut on Okinawa Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The House of Representatives, the
lower house of the Japanese Diet (parliament), will urge the
government to cut the U.S. bases in Okinawa, Kyodo News Service
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The demand is expected to be made in a resolution ready for a
vote at a plenary session of the lower house Tuesday, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
A final draft of the resolution says lawmakers believe that the
government's policies have been quite insufficient for the
"excessive burdens" placed by U.S. military bases on Okinawa, the
news service said.
</P>
<P>
The draft urges the government to make utmost efforts to
consolidate, realign and reduce U.S. bases in Okinawa and to
proceed with consultations with the United States on military
postures including the U.S. forces structure in the Asian-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
The draft also calls for "drastic reforms" to help develop
Okinawa's economy to turn the island prefecture into "an
economically and culturally prominent foothold for international
exchanges," Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa is home to 75 percent of all U.S. military facilities
in Japan. More than half of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan are
stationed on the island.
</P>
<P>
A government-proposed bill to revise legislation to allow the
continued compulsory lease of land for use by the U.S. military
was passed by the Diet last week, bringing protests from both
local authorities and residents in Okinawa.

<HEADLINE> Petitions Filed Against Decision not to Indict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Five petitions were presented
to Israel's High Court of Justice today against the state
prosecution's decision not to indict Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu over the Bar-On scandal.
</P>
<P>
Among those submitting the petitions included four opposition
lawmakers: Meretz leader Yossi Sarid and Labor's Yossi Beilin,
Ofer Pines and Yona Yahav. A watchdog group The Movement for
Quality Government (MQG) also presented a petition over the
decision not to charge Netanyahu and Justice Minister Tzahi
Hanegbi.
</P>
<P>
They argued that the decision by Attorney-General Elyakim
Rubinstein and State Attorney Edana Arbel not to indict
Netanyahu and Hanegbi for their involvement in the Bar-On
scandal was highly unreasonable since police investigators
recommended charging them with breach of trust and fraud.
</P>
<P>
Sarid, Beilin and Yahav requested the court to try Hanegbi
and Liberman, director-general of Prime Minister's Office, while
Pines also called for Netanyahu's resignation.
</P>
<P>
The MQG asked the court to suspend Hanegbi and Liberman from
their official positions and order the release of the 900-page
materials compiled by the police team investigating the Bar-On
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The high court is expected to hear the petitions at the
beginning of next month. It is premature to predict the likely
outcome of the legal battle, but the court has set several
precedents in overturning the attorney-general's decision not to
accept police recommendations of indictments against government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein and Arbel announced Sunday not to indict Netanyahu
and Hanegbi, citing the lack of solid evidence in the police
recommendations. But they admitted that deep suspicions existed
over the prime minister's role in the short-lived appointment of
former Jerusalem lawyer Roni Bar-On as the attorney-general in
January.
</P>
<P>
Only Shas leader Aryeh Deri will be charged with extortion
and fraud in pushing for Bar-On's appointment in the hope to
gain a plea bargain deal in his future bribery trial. Deri was
suspected of threatening to vote against the Hebron agreement by
his party if Bar-On was not appointed.
</P>
<P>
In reaction Sunday night, Netanyahu blasted the scandal,
exposed by the state television Channel I, as a conspiracy by
the leftist camp and the pro-leftist media to "overturn the
voters' verdict" in the last elections by toppling his
government.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted having made a mistake in the Bar-On
affair despite denying any crime committed. He promised to
broaden the future process of decision-making by setting up a
ministerial committee to oversee future appointments of
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that, although Netanyahu has now averted a
government crisis, the shadow of the Bar-On scandal has not been
cleared, and it will continue haunting his government once the
high court begins the hearing of the opposition's petitions.

<HEADLINE> Most Japanese Automakers Expand Exports in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Four of Japan's top five automakers
boosted motor vehicle exports in fiscal 1996 ending March 31,
supported by the yen's recent weakness against the U.S. dollar,
the companies said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Exports of Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's leading car maker,
jumped 12.4 percent to 1.31 million vehicles, marking the first
year-on-year rise in six years, a Toyota spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the export growth to brisk demand for
such sport-utility vehicles as the 4Runner and the Rav4 to the
United States, as well as increased shipments to European and
Middle Eastern nations.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the U.S. accounted for 460,361 in the fiscal year,
up 12.5 percent, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Exports for Nissan Motor Co. rose 0.8 percent to 598,000, the
first year-on-year rise in five years. Honda Motor Co. and Mazda
Motor Corp. saw exports pick up 6.7 percent and 8.6 percent to
407,000 and 463,000 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Motors Corp., whose exports dropped 5.0 percent to
462,000, was the only company among the nation's top five
automakers to fail to bolster its exports in the latest reporting
year.
</P>
<P>
A weak yen makes car manufacturers and other Japanese exporters
more competitive by allowing them to lower prices on their goods
sold abroad.

BONN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- UEFA president Lennart Johansson
hopes England will withdraw their bid for the 2006 World Cup,
European football's Swedish head told the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung on Monday.
</P>
<P>
UEFA, who Johansson insists came to a gentleman's agreement
over England staging the 1996 European Championships and Germany
bidding for the 2006 World Cup, withdrew their public support for
Germany last week.
</P>
<P>
However, the Germans, who had been convinced they would be the
sole European candidate, will have taken heart from Johansson's
backing.
</P>
<P>
"The English are going to get worried the day they see we keep
our word," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Egypt and Morocco have already
announced they will be bidding for the 2006 tournament. The
winner will be named by FIFA, the world's governing body, in
2000.

<HEADLINE> Pak Government Urged to Arrest High Maternal Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government was
urged today to take measures to arrest the high maternal mortality
rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
Local mothers running a risk of dying 100 times higher than
their counterparts in the rest of the world urgently require
improved maternal health services at the community and first
referral levels, said professor Sadqa Jaffery, a senior
gynecologist in Karachi, according to a report by the Associated
Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Improved prenatal and delivery care for all women, supported
by appropriate family planning services, must be among the top
priorities of our policy makers," she said.
</P>
<P>
Jaffery also called on the government to improve the
socio-economic and political status for women.
</P>
<P>
"There is need to create awareness and build commitment among
decision makers to ensure that appropriate programs are launched
and sustained," she said.
</P>
<P>
She cited hemorrhage, pregnancy related hypertension,
infection, obstructed labor and unsafe abortion as some of the
major medical causes of maternal deaths in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"The problem stems not only from inadequate health services but
from the social, cultural and economic environment in which women
live," she observed.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders Intensified Drive Against Gunrunning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today ordered Interior and Local Governments Secretary Robert
Barbers to step up the campaign against arms trafficking and
gunrunning in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the directive in the wake of an earlier newspaper
report claiming that Muslim rebels in the southern Philippines
were buying arms like "fish from the market."
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Al Haj Murad, military chief of the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, as saying "it's as easy as buying fish
from the market" for the MILF to acquire arms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The president tasked Barbers and Defense Secretary Renato de
Villa to come up with a joint program to crack down on arms
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also asked them to submit their first progress report on
the actions they have taken not later than May 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) which signed a peace deal with the
government last September.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has been engaged with the government forces in
sporadic fighting in Mindanao island, the southern Philippines,
since early last week.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the military confirmed that the renewed fighting
killed 25 MILF rebels and two soldiers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The 46th annual conference of

hailed by an inaugural speech from Chinese Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
About 1,800 people attended today's opening ceremony of the

The premier said that in recent years, Asia and Pacific regions

motivating force behind the world's economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li told participants that China, with rich tourism resources,

development since 1978, which has in turn laid a solid foundation
for the boom of the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
China's stable political situation, sustained economic
development, a prosperous economy, the Chinese government's firm
implementation of opening-up drive and its active development of
relations with other countries of the world have also created

billion U.S. dollars from related services in 1996. It also
reported 640 million domestic tourists who spent 160 billion yuan
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Li said that as the living standards of the Chinese people
continues to improve, the outbound trips of Chinese citizens will
also increase year by year.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government places great importance on the
development of the tourism industry and will list accelerating the
development of tourism as an important part of its social and
economic development plan for the 1996-2010 period.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Luo Gan also delivered a speech at today's
opening session, and a number of Chinese artists performed.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Drysdale, PATA chairman, also briefed the crowd on the
tourism developments in the world and the Asia-Pacific region, and
reviewed the work PATA has so far done to advance the growth of
the sector.
</P>
<P>
Lakshman Ratnapala, PATA president and CEO, presented the
PATA '96 annual work report at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>

aimed at advancing the tourism industry in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- About five percent of adult
population in Pakistan are using drugs and an estimated fifty tons
of opium is smuggled into the country for processing into heroin
for domestic use, according to a report released here today.
</P>

It is estimated that almost 80 per cent of the opium processed
in Pakistan comes from neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> German Finance Minister Denies Plan to Increase Gas Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
today denied a report that he had planned to raise gasoline tax in
the coming summer, describing it as "pure speculation."
</P>
<P>
Waigel made the remarks in response to a report in the Bild
daily, which said that the minister planned to increase the tax on
unleaded gasoline by 18 pfennigs (about 0.11 U.S. dollar) from the
current 98 pfennigs (0.57 dollar) per liter from July 1.
</P>
<P>
This move would boost the state revenues by 15 billion marks
(8.8 billion dollars) annually, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
An increased gasoline tax has been urged by Germany's main
opposition Social Democratic Party, known as SPD in German, to
support Chancellor Helmut Kohl's proposed cuts on income tax.
</P>
<P>
But Kohl's government intended to raise value added tax (VAT)
by one percentage point to 16 percent, which would also add about
15 billion marks (8.8 billion dollars) annually to the state
coffers.
</P>
<P>
The federal chancellor was due to meet with SPD leaders on
Wednesday to negotiate a compromise on tax reform legislation. The
SPD controls Bundesrat, the upper house of German parliament.
</P>
<P>
The gasoline tax in Germany was last raised by 16 pfennigs
(0.10 dollar) in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
held talks here today with Uruguayan President Julio Maria
Sanguinetti, saying that China and Latin American countries will

</P>
<P>
Jiang said he appreciated Uruguay's efforts to back China's
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the America

provide understanding and support to China on the human rights
issue.

Sanguinetti spoke highly of the fruitful bilateral ties based
on mutual trust, pointing out that the two countries have become
reliable cooperative partners.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is a trend of multi-polarization in the
world. Since China is playing an important role in the world, he

would like both sides to continue to support each other in
international affairs and expand bilateral ties in various fields,
including trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>

countries is in the early stage, the development trend is good.
</P>

China would like to explore new fields and patterns of
cooperation with Uruguay, Jiang said, adding that many businessmen

opportunities for exchange with the Chinese business circle.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the governments of the two countries
will encourage the cooperation between the enterprises of the two
countries.

greater rate, Jiang said, and as a result there are bright
prospects for the economic cooperation between China and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China is pleased to see that Latin American
countries have been more aware of the importance of unity,
cooperation and opposition to power politics, and that the
integration process of Latin America is growing rapidly.

Jiang expressed his hope that the Latin American countries will
make more progress in increasing economic prosperity and social
development, and eliminating poverty.

developing, have much common ground, and China would like to
strengthen cooperation with them to safeguard peace and promote
mutual development.

among Latin American countries, especially the growth of Mercosur,
adding that such cooperation has political significance.

important, and his country will help Chinese businesses to enter
Mercosur.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Continue Producing "Timor" National Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia today decided to
continue producing the 'Timor' national car despite the fact that
Japan had officially brought its complaints to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) panel.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after President Soeharto met with several
cabinet ministers at the Bina Graha Presidential Office,
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Japan decided to ask the WTO to create a panel to
rule on Japan's complaints against Indonesia's national car
policy.
</P>
<P>
The move came as the two countries failed to make progress in
bilateral talks during which Japan insisted on action to redress
discriminatory car-making practices under the Indonesian national
car policy.
</P>
<P>
Under the Indonesian car policy, domestic car makers can enjoy
tax exemptions on condition they raise their local content ratios
to 60 percent in three years.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture established by Pt. Timor Nasional, controlled
by President Soeharto's youngest son Hutomo Mandala Putra, and Kia
Corp. of South Korea is the only company qualified for tax
exemption privileges in the country.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is disappointed over Japan's move, Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
The president also decided to stop the bilateral discussions
between Indonesia and Japan on the national car, Moerdiono added.
</P>
<P>
"Should the WTO panel discuss the national car, the WTO will
likely make its decision on the national car in 1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the European Union also raised their
complaints over the Indonesian national car policy.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said Indonesia now capable of producing aircraft and
ships, will go ahead with the national car.

JAKARTA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Merpati Nusantara
Airlines has sent its ill-fated plane's black box to Australia for
analysis, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The black box, which was found early Sunday, has been sent to
Australia as the country is considered a leading expert on black
box technology, Transportation Minister Haryano Dhanutirto said.
</P>

A Merpati plane carrying 53 people on board crashed in Belitung
island, South Sumatra, last Saturday, killing 15 of the passengers

The government has ordered Merpati to ground its remaining
fleet of British-made advanced Turbo prop (ATP) aircraft after the
accident.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister acknowledged that the supply of spare
parts for the ATP planes used by Merpati has not seen smooth.
</P>

As a result three of the five ATPs used by the state-owned
airline company are now grounded, he said.

Merpati Nusantara which has a fleet of over 100 airplanes
mainly serve domestic routes.

HONG KONG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) have
agreed that the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) of the HKMA will
join hands with RBA's Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System
(RITS).
</P>
<P>
An HKMA spokesman said that it is a step towards closer
bilateral relations between Australian and Hong Kong financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
RBA will explore with the HKMA further reciprocal arrangements
to extend more widely the benefits that such co-operative
arrangements can provide.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, CMU is the central clearing and
settlement system for debt securities in Hong Kong and RITS is a
similar system for Australian government paper.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations believe that this bilateral linkage will
broaden the investor base of the debt markets in Hong Kong and
Australia by making cross system trading and holding of securities
much easier.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the agreement was reached at a meeting
between Joseph Yam, chief executive of HKMA, and Ian Macfarlane,
governor of RBA in Sydney at the second bilateral annual meeting
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The annual meetings have been established in the context of
fostering enhanced mutual cooperation between the two banks.

discussed, including regional central bank cooperation, recent
economic developments and banking supervision policy and practice,

<HEADLINE> Senior Diplomat: Kazakhstan Active in U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan has been active in
the United Nations since gaining independence and the world body's
membership five years ago, a senior Kazak diplomat has said.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan has become an inseparable part of the international
community, the country's permanent representative to the United
Nations was quoted as saying by a published report available here
today.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, Akmaral Khaidaidarkyzy Arystanbekova, told weekly
Panorama magazine that Kazakhstan's foreign policy of maintaining
world peace has been recognized and backed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In nuclear disarmament, Arystanbekova said, Kazakhstan has
signed the first-phase strategic arms reduction treaty, the
non-proliferation treaty and the comprehensive test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
In addition, by destroying some of its nuclear weapons and
transferring all others out of its territory, the former Soviet
republic has declared itself a nuclear-free nation, she said.
</P>
<P>
Among its major efforts to ensure regional security, she said,
Kazakhstan initiated in 1995 a mechanism for consultations and the
building-up of mutual trust among countries in Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
The country, together with Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, has also
mobilized a peace-keeping force for the entire region, and pushed
forward the peace process in Tajikistan, Arystanbekova noted.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she said, Kazakhstan is poised to play a more
active role in U.N-sponsored activities, and to cooperate with
other U.N. members to enhence its own international status.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan joined the United Nations in March 1992.

<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) will send experts to help the
Philippines rehabilitate lands affected by volcanic ash and mud
slides around Mount Pinatubo in the northern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
UNFAO representative to the Philippines Virander Sibal earlier
informed Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero of the agency's
agreement to send such a team, the Philippine News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The mission will visit Pinatubo later this month in central
Luzon to assess the constraints, potential and scope for
investment and technical support needed for the rehabilitation and
development of the lands affected by volcanic ash and mud slides.
</P>
<P>
The UNFAO has also pledged financial support to the
rehabilitation project, but has yet to determine the amount of
financial support needed based on the assessment of the
reconnaissance mission.
</P>
<P>
Pinatubo volcano erupted in June 1991, releasing a lot of
volcanic ash to its nearby area and displacing thousands of
families.
</P>
<P>
The UN mission is expected to come up with an assessment of the
results of the first cycle of rehabilitation efforts and identify
a possible second phase rehabilitation program related to
agriculture, natural resources management and rural
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government will form a committee to cooperate
with the UN mission.
</P>

International financing institutions such as the Asian
Development Bank, the World Bank and the U.N. Development Program
shall be tapped for possible investment projects in the Mt.

DHAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah
Ams Kibria has stated that the South Asia Development Triangle
(SADT) had tremendous opportunities for reaching benefits to the
people of the region, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a preparatory meeting on the SADT initiated by the
World Bank Sunday, he said that the people in this region would be
immensely benefited with this cooperation while he also warned not
to mix the emotional issues with the economic issues.
</P>
<P>
The so-called SADT, which was proposed last year by Dhaka to be
constituted with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and eastern and
north-eastern parts of India, has a population of 500 million,
two-thirds of whom live on less than one U.S. dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's main opposition party has been opposing the
formation of the SADT, alleging that the sovereignty of Bangladesh
would be threatened if the transit facilities were offered to
India.

The World Bank's resident mission chief Pierre Landell Mills
also emphasized the need of solving the political problems, saying
the future of the transboundary cooperation would largely depend
on the effective solution of the political problems.

understanding among the political leadership regarding the
opportunities that "now exist in this region".

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Population Control, Hard Nut to Crack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- While giving top priority to
reviving the depressed national economy, the government led by
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is paying greater attention to
curtailing the country's ever growing population.
</P>
<P>
The Nawaz government, which came to power in mid February, is
now formulating a population control strategy in a bid to raise
the overall living standard of the people.
</P>
<P>
A result-oriented approach is the key to success in population
programs in Pakistan, Minister for Population Welfare Abida
Hussain said recently at a meeting on the country's population
problem.
</P>
<P>
The Nawaz government, which has vowed to make Pakistan an
"Asian Tiger," will formulate a viable strategy to ensure
effective implementation of policies on population control, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Population experts here believe that fast population growth, an
acute chronic problem, is the most crucial factor retarding the
development of the country, and it may well cast a blight on all
ideas envisaged by the Nawaz government to turn the country into a
welfare state.
</P>
<P>
As a result of a galloping annual growth rate of about 3
percent, Pakistan, with a population of around 140 million, has
now moved up to the rank of the world's seventh most populous
nation from the ninth position it occupied two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
If the present growth rate continues, the country will have
more people than the United States and Indonesia by the middle of
the next century. Pakistan might then become the third largest
country in the world in terms of population after China and India.
</P>
<P>
With an estimated annual increase of 3 million, the country
will find it very difficult to provide its people with food,
water, jobs, education and medicines from its limited resources
since every effort and scheme to develop additional resources to
improve the lot of the people is being outstripped by a faster
growing population.
</P>
<P>
Population experts here are of the view that Pakistan's present
gloomy state of the economy, law and order problem, corruption,
illiteracy, poverty and scarcity of essential food items are
directly attributable to excessive population growth.
</P>
<P>
The main cause of Pakistan's high population growth is widely
believed to be the high fertility rate which goes with poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to the Economic Survey of the 1995-1996 fiscal year,
Pakistan's total fertility rate -- the average number of children
a woman can expect to have -- is 5.9 and infant mortality is 95
per 1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that Pakistan's galloping population
growth is closely linked with the relatively low contraceptive
prevalence rate, which shows that family planning and reproductive
health services are still not available to, or used by, the
majority of people who need or want them.
</P>
<P>
The recent Contraceptive Prevalence Survey by the United
Nations Fund for Population Activities showed that contraceptive
use in Pakistan increased from 11.8 percent in 1990-1991 to 17.8
percent in 1994-1995. But it is still the lowest in the South
Asian region. Much remains to be done to raise the level to where
it can make a significant impact on population growth.
</P>
<P>
In view of the alarming estimates of Pakistan's population,
population control is the need of the hour in the country, yet it
is not an easy job for the Nawaz government.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that population growth can only be brought down
through the provision of family planning and reproductive health
services.

<HEADLINE> Macao Mobilizes Youngsters to Help Maintain Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Macao has started a special course
for the young people to mobilize them to help crack down on rising
crimes in the territory.
</P>
<P>
The "Macao Youth Anti-Crime Course," which began last week and
will last for six months, is aimed at improving the youngsters'
sense of responsibility for social justice and caring for others,
said organizers of the movement.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 students and youngsters have joined in the
course, co-sponsored by the Macao Security Department and the
Macao Students' Union.
</P>
<P>
Apart from lectures on ways of contacting police department and
on traffic control, they will visit police school, headquarters of
marine police and fire squad. They will also learn ways of
emergency treatment in case of injuries.
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate that the course will help students gain a better
 knowledge of crimes, improve their self-discipline and relations
between police and civilians," said a top executive of the Macao
Students' Union.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the youngsters will enhance their sense of social
responsibility through the course, thus contributing partly to
maintaining a good social order," said the executive.
</P>
<P>
A wave of gang-related killings and injury cases occurred in
Macao over the past months, triggering increasing worries in the
territory. Juvenile delinquency, in particular, has risen sharply
over the last few years.

<HEADLINE> Major Confident Of Winning Coming Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
said today that he is confident of winning the coming election on
May 1st.
</P>
<P>
Major, however, admitted in an interview with the Times that he
was "baffled" by the opinion polls showing a big Labor lead which
"bear no relationship to what I fell going round the country".
</P>
<P>
Dismissing protests about the Conservative Party advertisement
showing a small Labor leader Tony Blair on the knee of a giant
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Major said "Politics has become so
pompous", describing the "rough and tumble of politics" as part of
its charm.
</P>
<P>
He said: "If Tony Blair were Prime Minister and he asked my
advice about how to handle European negotiations, he could have it
in complete privacy and in complete frankness."
</P>
<P>
Major said other European leaders were pushing the national
patience in more than one country to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed for the first time that Conservative members of
the parliament would probably be offered a free vote on any
decision to take Britain into a single currency.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he is "sick and tired" of the fact that
whenever he tells truth in Brussels, it is portrayed as "poor old
Britain, isolated again, taking a different Eurosceptic line."
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing Eurosceptic about pointing out that this
institution is creaking ... it is pushing the national states too
far and it will break up ... if it carries on as it is going," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Ethiopia to Continue Border Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan and Ethiopian government
officials are scheduled to meet today in Embu, northern Kenya,
for further talks on last month's border incidents, according to
a Daily Nation report today.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper said the new round of border talks would
begin in Illet in Marsabit where the incidents occurred,
resulting in the killing of 66 Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the two-day meeting would discuss the possibility
of the Ethiopian government to compensate Kenya for the losses
during the attacks in the border area by armed gangsters from the
Ethiopian side.
</P>
<P>
During the attacks, about 80 people, including 17 Kenyan
security officers and 16 armed bandits, were killed when
Shangilla and Armakolle bandits attacked the area bordering
Ethiopia.

Early this month, a Kenyan delegation led by the Rift Valley
Provincial Commissioner Yusuf Haji visited Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
to press for compensation for life and property losses during the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Haji said that the Ethiopians were very
sympathetic and regretted the incidents, adding that both sides
had agreed to work together to stamp out lawlessness in the
border areas.

figure of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the export value of textile and garment products,
which account for 84.8 percent of all exports, rose 20 percent,
while the exports of non-textile products, including machinery,

<P>
The United States and the European Union, Macao's leading
export markets, bought 78.2 percent of all Macao export goods.
</P>
<P>
The main import market is still in the Asian-Pacific region,
including the Chinese mainland, Taiwan, Japan and Australia, which
in a row have recorded import growth.
</P>
<P>
But imports from the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong have
declined 20.8 percent and 1.2 percent respectively.

Imports from the United States, European Union, Britain and

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Kick off Major Gas Pipeline Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will kick off a major gas
pipeline project next month that will bring rich natural gas from
oil fields in the south to industrial areas in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
The Business Times reported today that the project will cost
26 million U.S. Dollars and will be completed by July next year.
</P>
<P>
It will serve the Ikeja and Isolo industrial areas in Lagos
and the Agbara industrial area in the neighboring Ogun state,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline will be extended to other west African countries
in the future, as being planned by the governments.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has rich natural gas resources, but a large sum of
them are being flared daily at many oil fields.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Nigerian Gas Company said natural gas
will serve as an ideal alternative source of energy to
enterprises in the said industrial areas where power supply has
been poor and unreliable.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the use of natural gas in two plants of the
West African Portland Cement Company has resulted in higher
productivity and lower cost.

LUSAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is likely to earn at least
400 million U.S. Dollars annually from its non-traditional
exports by 2000 if proper policies are put in place, a Farmer
Union official has predicted.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted Ajay Vashee, president of the

<HEADLINE> Gujral Sworn in as India's 12th Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Newly elected leader of the
13-party United Front (UF) and External Affairs Minister I. K.
Gujral was sworn in by President S. D. Sharma as India's 12th
prime minister here today, ending 22 days of political uncertainty
following the withdrawal of support of the Congress party to the
UF government headed by Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
Gujral retained all the 34 ministers of the Deve Gowda
government except the four ministers from the Tamil Maanila
Congress (TMC) and one minister from Janata Dal, the biggest
constituent of the UF.
</P>
<P>
The TMC has decided to keep away from the new government while
the surprise exclusion of Food and Civil Supplies Minister D. P.
Yadav from the new cabinet was reportedly related to internal
conflicts of the Janata Dal.
</P>
<P>
The retention of the Gowda government ministers was based on a
decision taken by top Front leaders late last night to send a
signal that the coalition UF stands for unity, continuity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Of the 34 ministers, 16 are of cabinet rank while the rest are
ministers of state. The new prime minister said here today that he
would undertake expansion of his 35-member council of ministers
but declined to specify when he would effect it. He expressed the
hope that the TMC would be persuaded to participate in his
government. The TMC was reportedly unhappy with the attitude of
some UF constituents towards it during the race for premiership.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen soon after the swearing-in ceremony, Gujral
said that economic and foreign policies pursued by the Deve Gowda
government would be maintained and further strengthened. On the
foreign policy initiatives taken by the previous government,
specially in the context of improving relations with neighbors
including Pakistan, he said that all foreign policy initiatives
would continue.
</P>
<P>
Congress President Sitaram Kesri, who took part in the
swearing-in ceremony here today, said that the new UF government
under the leadership of I. K. Gujral would remain safe and stable.
The Congress would always extend cooperation to the UF and it
would not destabilize the government. On March 30, Kesri suddenly
announced that his party withdrew its support to the Gowda
government, which was voted out in Parliament on the late evening
of April 11.
</P>
<P>
Trade and industry chambers of India today said that the
installation of the government headed by Prime Minister I. K.
Gujral would ensure stability and provide a stimulus to economic
decision-making. Welcoming Gujral's commitment to the UF's common
minimum program, the apex trade organizations hoped that the
government would speed up implementation of various programs to
get the economy, hurt by political uncertainties, back on track.
</P>
<P>
Required by the president, the new prime minister will seek a
vote of confidence in the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament)
Tuesday and he is expected to obtain a majority in the house.

<HEADLINE> S. African Govt Vows to Improve Police Morale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- South African Police
Commissioner George Fivaz admitted that domestic police had
morale problems, but denied it as popular in the police service.
</P>
<P>
Local daily the Citizen today quoted Fivaz as saying that
police officials are uncertain about their country, their duties
and the police.
</P>
<P>
However, he insisted that "a large number of police officials
are still very positive."
</P>
<P>
Fivaz made the remarks in Pretoria, the administrative capital
of South Africa, after a memorial service for the 211 police
officials who died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by police authorities, 69 percent of
respondents in the police said they had no confidence in the
police management while 35 percent even indicated that they were
considering leaving the police.
</P>
<P>
Fivaz said it was normal for the morale graph to go downward
when South Africa is in a process of transformation.
</P>
<P>
"We estimated that it would take between five and eight years
before the situation would improve and it is very probable that
we will see a dramatic improvement from the next year on ward,"
he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 45 Found Positive of HIV Virus in HK in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A total of 45 persons were
found to be positive for the HIV antibody test in the first
quarter this year, the Department of Health announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The newest finding brought the cumulative total figures of
reported HIV infections to 821 while the number of new HIV
infections reported in the first quarter is the highest ever
received in a single quarter since 1984, when the surveillance
system was established.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen AIDS cases were reported in the same period leading to
a total of 263 confirmed cases.
</P>
<P>
Heterosexual contact remains the major route of transmission,
accounting for 69 percent and 62 percent of the sexually acquired
cases in the first quarter and the cumulative total respectively.
</P>
<P>
A significant proportion of the reported cases are diagnosed in
symptomatic AIDS patients. Of the 18 AIDS cases reported in the
first quarter, 15 (83.3 percent) are new HIV infections reported
in the same quarter, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of HIV infection found at AIDS diagnosis were
64.7 percent and 46.2 percent in the last quarter of 1996 and the
first quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the 821 HIV-infected, 414 acquired the infection through
heterosexual and 525 through homosexual or bisexual sex; 16 were
injecting drug users; four were mother-to-child transmission
around the time of birth; and 66 acquired the infection through
contaminated blood or blood products before 1985 when HIV antibody
test and safe heat treated clotting concentrates were not
available.
</P>
<P>
As for the remaining 69, the information available was
inadequate for classification, according to the department.

<HEADLINE> Manila Stocks Trading Suspended Due to Power Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Trading at the Philippine Stock
Exchange was suspended here today after a power failure occurred
at the East Tower Building where the Exchange holds its regular
trading.
</P>
<P>
The power failure at the same time forced thousands of
employees, including brokers and officials, to be left with no
choice but to stay outside since early hours this morning.
</P>
<P>
Carmelita Rapal, spokesperson of the building's administration
office, said the situation is now under control after the
technicians were able to immediately attend to the generator which
eventually overheated on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, another employee who requested not to be named said
that transactions will no longer be possible today owing to the
continuous repair work on the electrical system.
</P>
<P>
The Exchange building is divided into the West Tower Building
and East Tower Building. Many are surprised as to why only the
east one where the stock exchange is housed was affected by the
power failure.
</P>
<P>
Rapal said that the maintenance department of the building
informed all the offices inside that there would be a power
shutdown owing to an impending repair work on the electrical
system of the building.
</P>
<P>
But a disgruntled broker said that he really does not know the
motive behind the power failure.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that power problems have taken place
at the Stock Exchange building. Computer problems also often
caused fire failure in the building, said a broker.
</P>
<P>
Stock market analysts expressed disappointment over the
suspension of the stock trading as this will mean millions of
pesos of losses to the trading floors.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama: Promoter of Peace Or Fomenter of Riots? (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A commentary by Xinhua News
Agency today repudiates the Dalai Lama's remarks over the past
several decades, which have disrupted stability and development in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The article "An Apologist for Peace or A Fomenter of Riots"
reads as follows:
</P>
<P>
For a long time the Dalai Lama has run about overseas preaching
his doctrine repeatedly, giving lengthy speeches and interviews
with foreign media, speaking glibly about his alleged goal of
"turning the Tibetan Plateau into a holy land filled with peace
and non-violence, where people can live in harmony with nature",
and that "only when the whole Earth is regarded as one family and
are our family members, will mankind be able to continue to
survive."
</P>
<P>
He has also claimed that what he has done "is entirely for the
happiness of the Tibetan people," and has masqueraded himself as
an apologist for peace and "Ahimsa" (Love and Non-violence).
</P>
<P>
However, there is an old Tibetan saying that goes, "mere talk
only churns up bubbles, but doing practical things is digging
gold", so, behind all this talk about "Ahimsa", what has the Dalai
Lama really done? History and fact provide us with the answer.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama has stayed outside China for 38 years, since
fleeing overseas after the failed armed rebellion of March, 1959
in Lhasa by a small number of splittists of the Tibetan
upper-class. Since then, he has gone farther and farther down the
road of dividing the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, he and his followers set up overseas the "Exiled
Tibetan Government", whose "head of state" was he himself. He
re-organized the rebellious forces and harassed the Chinese border
militarily for a period of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
These activities were aided by intelligence services of a
certain Western power, which taught the splittists "guerrilla
tactics" at its military bases and sent them into Tibet for the
purpose of sabotage and murder. These facts came to light in an
article in the "Chicago Tribune" on January 20. It said that:
</P>
<P>
-- In the 1970s, the Dalai Lama's clique began overseas radio
broadcasts in the Tibetan language to Tibet to create and spread a
great number of rumors. The act was intended to produce political
chaos, instigate separation, and incite contradictions among
ethnic groups, and preach confrontation in Tibet.

<TEXT>
<P>
-- From 1979 to 1980, China's Central Government agreed that
the Dalai Lama could send people to visit Tibet. The "visiting
group", however, took advantage of the opportunity to fan the
flames of "Tibetan independence" in Lhasa and other places. A
"visiting group" headed by Zhaidong Danzim Namgyai started giving
demagogic speeches in front of the Johkang Temple as soon as they
got off the bus. They then organized an illegal gathering at the
Gandain Monastery to overtly push for "Tibetan independence".
</P>
<P>
-- In 1986, the Dalai Lama's clique frequently held
"high-level" meetings in Dharmsala, India, where they tried to
mobilize people and plan riots in Lhasa. These included the sixth
meeting of the "Tibetan Youth Federation"; the first working
conference of the "Association of Tibetan Women"; a seminar on
"Tibetan Independence Campaign"; and a special political education
meeting for officials above grade nine, the themes of all of which
were "taking concrete actions for the independence of Tibet".
</P>
<P>
-- In April 1987, the Dalai Lama's clique held various meetings
in Dharmsala again, where they drew up action plans for a series
of riots and splitist activities, organizing illegal
demonstrations and creating social chaos in Tibet. Then, the
"Tibetan Youth Federation" sent people surreptitiously into Lhasa
and other places in Tibet from time to time to stir up unrest,
joining forces inside Tibet.

<P>
-- On September 21, 1987, the Dalai Lama addressed the US
Congress, and on the 24th held a press conference at the
University of Indiana, where he openly claimed that "Tibet is not
a part of China and is an independent state". After these
addresses were broadcast to Tibet by the Dalai Lama's radio
station outside China and through other channels, serious rioting
broke out in Lhasa on the 27th. Shouting "Tibetan Independence",
rioters attacked local government buildings, damaged automobiles,
looted, started fires in shops and public buildings, and injured
many on-duty police officers.
</P>
<P>
A series of ensuing riots in Lhasa resulted in deaths and
further injuries and serious property losses, greatly affecting
normal life of local residents and a normal production order. They
paralyzed the Moinlam Qenmo, Tibetan Buddhism's most solemn
religious ceremony, which was to take place January 3-15.
</P>
<P>
In March 1988, rioters attacked the office in charge of summon
ceremony under the Lhasa Buddhist Association, killing a Tibetan
squad leader of the armed police, injuring 399 people, and
looted hotels and restaurants in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
In March the next year, Lhasa was hit by riots again. Within
two days rioters killed many innocent people, wounded more than
100 others, looted and destroyed more than 900 shops, attacked 24
government offices, enterprises and schools, and destroyed and
burned some 20 automobiles.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama delivered a speech encouraging this after each
riot and called on splittists to continue their activities. On
October 7, 1987, he made a speech in Dharasala, expressing his
"full support" to the riots in Lhasa. On the fifth day after the
rioting, which broke out in Lhasa on March 5, 1988, he lavishly
praised the riot in Lhasa at a gathering where he said, "Tibetans
inside China have high morale and great determination, and dare to
shed blood and make sacrifices."

<P>
The democratic reforms in Tibet in 1959 put an end once and for
all to the barbarous and backward serfdom during the Dalai Lama's
rule combining political and religious power and brought about
tremendous changes in the destiny and lives of the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy for Tibetans has increased substantially from
36, before 1959, to today's 65. The Tibetan population, which had
remained around one million for several hundred years, has more than
doubled over the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
In the past, there were only a few schools in Tibet, which
accommodated monks and the children of aristocrats. Illiterates
and semi-literates accounted for more than 90 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 3,000 schools at various levels in
Tibet, and 73.5 percent of Tibetan children of school age have had
access to an education.
</P>
<P>
In old Tibet, there were only two small government-run clinics
in Lhasa. But the region now has over 1,000 medical institutions,
with 2.3 hospital beds and 2.1 doctors for every 1,000 people, a
larger figure than for the rest of the country on average.
</P>
<P>
A road network of more than 20,000 kilometers has been built in
Tibet that previously did not have a single road and relied
entirely on humans and animals for transport.
</P>
<P>
Electricity was not available in Tibet formerly, but there are
now more than 500 hydro-electric power stations, with a combined
annual output of over 300 million kilowatt-hours, and a number of
such stations are being built.
</P>
<P>
In the past, there were nearly 1,000 families of beggars and
poor people in areas around Lhasa, which was a city of only
20,000, living in huts made from broken gunnysacks.

It was also common to see everywhere in Lhasa "prisoners" in
handcuffs, shackles, and wooden cangues begging along the
streets. These scenes are long gone in Tibet, and the overwhelming
majority of farmers and herdsmen in the autonomous region now have
enough food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that Tibet has scored great development and
progress and is making further progress. It is the common
aspiration of the Tibetan people and it is in their fundamental
interests that their standard of living continues to improve with
social and economic development. But it is only in an environment
of social stability that this can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
What has the Dalai Lama in fact done during these years? He
has done nothing for social and economic development in the region
or for improvement of people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he has given no thought to the fundamental
interests of the country and the Tibetan people, and, in order to
achieve his political aims of "Tibetan independence", he has made
up lies, created animosity between different ethnic groups, and
has tried everything possible to stir up riots in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that this will impede the development and progress of
the region and will help separate Tibet from the motherland and
restore his rule. How dare he call this "bringing happiness to the
Tibetan people"?
</P>
<P>
Former serfs and slaves in Tibet, who now have become masters
of their own destiny, will never allow themselves to return to the
dark and miserable past. The Dalai Lama's political conspiracy to
stir up social riots in Tibet is doomed to a complete failure.

<P>
The facts show that the Dalai Lama is not the "apologist of
peace" as he pretends to be, but is the fomenter of repeated chaos
in Tibet under the banner of "Independence of Tibet".
</P>
<P>
He professes to be the "protector of the snowland" and claims
that his actions are all for the welfare of the Tibetan
people. But, the facts tell a different story.
</P>
<P>
In old Tibet, under the Dalai Lama's rule, more than 95 percent
of the population were serfs or slaves, who were subject to cruel
oppression and exploitation by the three manorial lords.
</P>
<P>
Alexandra David-Neel, the famous French explorer and
Tibetologist who visited Tibet three times, and Sir Charles Bell,
a senior British officer who held posts in Tibet and Sikkim for 21
years, and who claimed to be a close friend of the earlier Dalai
Lama, made detailed descriptions of the cruel oppression the serfs
and slaves suffered and of their tragic life in their books; in
the case of the former, "Le Vieux Tibet Face A La Chine Nouvelle",
and the latter, "Tibet: Past and Present".
</P>
<P>
"...the exorbitant taxes and levies and heavy corvee imposed on
them...They were never paid any salary, nor were they given any
food.
</P>
<P>
"All these farmers were pitiable serfs, and they had no right
to leave their native place, which was impossible anyway, for
another land with a headman who was less harsh. Some of them had
fled to neighboring areas, only to be abducted by their former
headmen from their new homes, and brought back to their native
villages to be clubbed and fined a huge sum of money.
</P>
<P>
"For fear of the punishments the headman would inflict on their
families, those who wanted to flee did not dare to leave. If one
fled, one's families could be in hot water."
</P>
<P>
"Tibet was still in the feudal age, with its aristocracy
holding absolute power and haing vast influence. The nobility
could exercise official power upon the tenant-peasants...They
could at any time inflict punishments on the peasants, which
ranged from confiscation of draught animals, fining, caning,
short-term custody, to all other kinds."

<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Five London railway stations and
parts of Heathrow and Gatwick airports closed today in a series of
bomb warnings.
</P>
<P>
Police said the central London railway stations were evacuated
and surrounding roads were closed after they received a number of
"threatening phone calls."
</P>
<P>
Parts of Heathrow airport were closed off, and the Gatwick
airport train station and Stansted airport were also shut as a
result of the warnings.
</P>
<P>
Police warned people not to travel to central London if
possible. But hundreds of thousands of people were already
stranded on trains, stuck in traffic jams or forced behind police
barriers on the streets.
</P>
<P>
"This is causing massive disruption. It has been timed just as
the morning rush hour is about to hit its peak," a railtrack
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The security alert followed two Irish Republican Army (IRA)
bomb blasts and warnings last Friday which paralyzed road and rail
systems in northern England.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has stepped up its campaign against British rule in
Northern Ireland in the runup to the May 1 national election.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac will announce this evening the
dissolution of the National Assembly (lower house of parliament) and
the organization of early legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first secretary of the opposition Socialist Party,
Lionel Jospin, announced last evening the platform for his party's
legislative campaign, which rejects the rigid criteria set by the
Maastricht Treaty for entering the European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
-- Citing ``insufficient evidence,'' Israeli judicial authorities
saved on Sunday Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu from judicial

of conspiring a plot against him by creating a political scandal.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Fifty-three percent of the French people think that a
dissolution of the National Assembly will be a good thing, while 33
percent consider it a bad thing, and 14 fail to give their opinion,
according to a opinion poll conducted by Le Figaro and the SOFRES
polling institute.
</P>
<P>
The poll also shows that the ruling Rassemblement pour la
Republique and Union pour la Democratie Francaise will lose 150

absolute majority required.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslim Rebels Attack Government Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) guerrillas have launched separate attacks against
Philippine government troops over the weekend despite scheduled
peace talks this week.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported today that two government
soldiers were hurt Sunday morning in an attack staged by the MILF
near Carmen town in the southern province of Cotabato.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Captain Noel Detoyato, spokesman of the
Army's Sixth Infantry Division, as saying that the wounded were
members of a military unit tasked to guard a nearby irrigation
project.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were on their way back to the headquarters when
they were attacked by a number of MILF rebels, Detoyato said. He
said he did not know if the enemy side suffered casualties in the
20-minute firefight.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MILF rebels have also been repeatedly harassing
military installation of government troops for the past three days
in Buldon town in Maguindanao province, where 10 students and a
teacher were killed in an attack last month.
</P>
<P>
The intermittent attacks started last Friday, but Detoyato
said, there are no government casualties reported during the
series of MILF offensives.
</P>
<P>
"We just responded with enough firepower to prevent them from
closing in (our) position," he said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, government troops Sunday overran a
military base of the MILF in Zamboanga del Norte, killing four
commanders and several MILF fighters and bringing the total number
of MILF deaths to 25 in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Detoyato said that such attacks by the MILF should be prevented
by their leaders so as not to jeopardize the ongoing peace talks
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Government and MILF peace negotiators are set to resume their
third round of talks on April 23 in an attempt to possibly forge a
general ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-member MILF is a break-away faction of the
mainstream Moro National Liberation Front which signed a final
peace agreement with the government last September.

HONG KONG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A 40-strong advance party of
the People Liberation Army (PLA) arrived at the Prince of Wales
Barracks in Central Hong Kong at 2:35 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
The PLA contingent, comprising 22 field officers, eight junior

Borong, deputy commander of the future PLA Hong Kong Garrison, who
led the advance personnel into Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news briefing shortly after arrival, Zhou said:
"We come to Hong Kong just 71 days away from July 1, 1997. I and
my officers will make full use of the valuable time. We expect
support and cooperation from the British side and hope the two
sides can make joint efforts for the smooth transfer of defense
responsibility for Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in accordance with the agreement reached at
the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), the main task of the
PLA advance party is to make all necessary preparations for the
PLA to take over responsibility for defense of Hong Kong on July
1, 1997. "This (the arrangement) is of great significance to
enhance mutual understanding and cooperation between the Chinese
and British armed forces," Zhou said.

<P>
Speaking at a simple welcoming ceremony, Major General Bryan
Dutton said: "This is a historic moment for both British and
Chinese armed forces. We will be working hard together to achieve
our common purpose -- the smooth transfer of defense for Hong
Kong."

The commander of the British forces promised to "give the
future garrison every possible assistance as they prepare for
their role".
</P>
<P>
The PLA advance unit will be divided into two, with 28 placed
at the Prince of Wales Barracks and 12 in military accommodation
on Stonecutter Island, the future navy base for the PLA. Their
work in the next ten weeks will include familiarization with the
14 military sites to be taken over, liaison with the British
Garrison and Hong Kong government and coordination of

<P>
LUSAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's ruling party has
demanded the relocation of the headquarters of the opposition
United National Independence Party (UNIP), claiming that its
current location is a threat to public peace.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka District Youth Chairman Michael Bwalya of the ruling
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) demanded on Sunday a immediate
removal of the UNIP headquarters from capital LUSAKA to a place
where its internal conflicts will not affect the public.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail reported today that two UNIP factions, one
supporting Sam Moyo, an expelled member of the UNIP central
committee, and another one loyal to UNIP leader Kenneth Kaunda,
clashed on Saturday at the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Bwalya said the headquarters has become a fighting scene of
UNIP which affected innocent people, discouraged investment and
disrupted local residents' daily life.
</P>
<P>
He refuted claims that his party was behind Moyo's protest
march.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moyo, who was expelled earlier this month for
"conducts which as compromised the standing of the party", has
refuted charges that he has been bought by MMD, insisting he is
still a UNIP member.
</P>
<P>
Lungu said the confrontation was organized by Lusaka Province
MMD Chairman Christopher Chawinga, adding he was allegedly seen
at the scene of the incident.

<HEADLINE> PNA Denies Resumption of Security Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat denied in Gaza
Sunday night press reports that the PNA has resumed security
cooperation with Israel, the state-run Israel Radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, Arafat's spokesman, emphasized that such
cooperation will not be resumed until Israel holds the expansion
of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and puts an end to the
construction of a new Jewish settlement at Har Homa in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel Television and Army Radio reported over the weekend
that Arafat had agreed to a resumption of the cooperation,
stalled for the past month, after he met with Israeli Chief of the
General Staff Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak and U.S. Middle East
peace coordinator Dennis Ross Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat's another spokesman, Marwan Kanafani, said in
Gaza that the problem the Palestinians are having with the
Israelis is not security cooperation, but that Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu should make up his mind to get back
on the right track of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In his reaction to Israel's Attorney-General Eliyakim
Rubinstein's decision not to indict Netanyahu in the Bar-On
corruption scandal, Kanafani said that since Netanyahu is cleared
now of the charges, he should make a serious consideration on
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been on the full alert throughout
the country fearing that terrorist attacks should occur during
the Jewish Passover holiday which lasts from April 21 to 28 this
year. A total indefinite closure imposed on the West Bank
Tuesday night remains in force. The closure does not include the
Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> France, Russia Seek Investment Opportunities in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The number of French and Russian
firms seeking new investment opportunities in east Africa has
increased with many selecting Kenya as the base for their
regional operations.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, three new French companies -- Sanofi,
Baccmus and AGS -- have set up offices in Kenya while Renault,
which was absent for a long time, is back to the Kenya's tire
market.
</P>
<P>
According to the French Trade Commission in Nairobi, more
French companies are seeking information on investment
opportunities in Kenya than ever before.
</P>
<P>
Pascal Maccioni, Trade Commissioner of the French Embassy to
Kenya, was quoted as saying here recently that "we see
Sub-Saharan Africa as the last frontier for French investment."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that France was facing increasing competition in
Francophone countries and French companies had to take a wider
view of the global market.
</P>
<P>
Internal conflicts in some Francophone countries such as
Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire has discouraged French firms for
further investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Local industrial sources said that French firms would have to
compete with the companies of Britain, the United States,
Germany, Japan, Korea and India.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia is also making its efforts to expand export
operations in the east African region with two trade delegations
touring Kenya recently.
</P>
<P>
A cultural and trade delegation of 200 private businessmen,
tourists and media personnel just ended a week-long visit to
Nairobi and Mombasa on April 18.
</P>
<P>
A delegation organized by Russian manufacturers from Moscow
is scheduled to visit Kenya from April 27 to seek investment
partners and plan a meeting with regional manufacturers.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Indonesia will
open a new air route to expand commercial cooperation between the
two countries and meet the increasing demands of exchanges in
various fields, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Kuwaiti Airways Corporation, the only
state-run airways company in the country, was currently
discussing plans to open a new route to the Indonesian
island of Bali, the second destination of the company in
Indonesia after Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
They said talks are being held with a delegation from the
Indonesian airline Garuda. A number of essential issues were
covered, including strengthening commercial cooperation between
the two national carriers.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the expansion of cooperation to
include new destinations and cities to be covered by commercial
arrangements in the future.
</P>
<P>
One official from the Kuwait Airways Corporation told Xinhua
that the idea of opening the route was to "make the island of
Bali as a second stop after the capital of Jakarta in a bid to
promote tourism trade."
</P>
<P>
Bali is located east of Java and has a population of more than
2.2 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said an agreement was expected to be signed after next
meeting scheduled to be held later this year. Final preparations
for the opening of the Bali route were also postponed until next
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Gujral, Veteran Freedom Fighter, Politician </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- I. K. Gujral, who was sworn in
as India's 12th prime minister here today, is a veteran freedom
fighter and statesman in the country enjoying high prestige.
</P>
<P>
He was born on December 4, 1919 at Jhelum town (now in
Pakistan). Inspired by his parents, who actively took part in
India's struggle against British colonialism and for independence,
he joined the national movement at the age of 11. He began his
political life when he was a student in Lahore's colleges serving
as president of Lahore students' union and general secretary of
the Pubjab unit of All India Students' Federation.
</P>
<P>
Partition of the Indian Subcontinent in 1947 brought the Gujral
family to Delhi and I.K. Gujral devoted himself to the
rehabilitation of thousands of people displaced by the partition.
His stint with big-time politics began when he joined the Congress
Party in the 1950s and became the vice-president of New Delhi
Municipal Committee in 1959, a post he held till 1964.
</P>
<P>
He was elected to Rajya Sabha (Upper House of Parliament) from
Delhi on a Congress ticket in 1964 and three years later he made
his debut as an administrator when he was appointed minister of
state for parliamentary affairs. Re-elected to Rajya Sabha in
1970, he remained its member till 1976 and held several portfolios
in the Indira Gandhi government before he was sent as India's
ambassador to the Soviet Union. He later parted ways with the
Congress and was actively associated with the move for opposition
unity in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, he entered the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament)
and served as external affairs minister in the V.P. Singh
government, which lasted just less than one year. He again became
external affairs minister in the Deve Gowda government when it
came to power on June 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Gujral has launched a series of initiatives to improve India's
relations with its neighbors. As a result, India and Bangladesh
signed a historic Ganges water-sharing treaty in December last
year, removing a major long-standing irritant in their bilateral
relations. Last month, he, in a bid to boost ties with Pakistan,
announced measures to ease travel restrictions on Pakistani
nationals, an action that contributed to the resumption of
Indo-Pak foreign secretary level talks stalled for over three
years.

<HEADLINE> Railway Ensures Smooth Food Supplies to Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The No. 753 train, which starts
from Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, has
delivered more than 2.6 million tons of cargo to Hong Kong in the
past 35 years.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the three speediest freight trains whose sole
purpose is to provide livestock and fresh and frozen food to Hong
Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
The trains went into operation in 1962 on orders of late
Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou Railway Sub-Bureau has given priority to the
loading and operation of the No. 753 train, to ensure the
sufficient, safe and quick transport of goods to Hong Kong,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that Jinhua, a major pig-raising base in
China, delivered a total of 463 cars of pigs to Hong Kong last
year, compared with less than 70 cars in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Statistics of the past five years show that 96.8 percent of the
trains arrived in Hong Kong on schedule, with the rate topping the
list of all cargo trains in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the pigs and cattle on Hong Kong's market are
supplied by the three fast trains, sources say.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Third Wave of Immigrants (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Fast economic growth in
Shanghai, especially in the Pudong New Area, has resulted in the
city's "third wave" of immigrants in 150 years.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say a great number of professionals from China
and overseas continue to flow here at the rate of 100 per day.
</P>
<P>
A latest survey shows that each month the municipality has an
average of ten new businesses started by Chinese students who have
returned from abroad, and the total number has come to 400 now.
</P>
<P>
As China's largest city of immigrants, Shanghai's prosperity
has long been tied to talent coming from outside since it became
an opening trading port more than 150 years ago. The first peak
occurred in the 1930s. Shortly after that Shanghai grew into the
biggest trade, finance and manufacturing center in China and the
Far East.
</P>
<P>
The second peak came in the 1950s when New China was founded
and the city grew into China's biggest industrial base and
all-purpose central city.
</P>
<P>
Sun Changmin, director of the Population and Development
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Shanghai
Branch said, "The third wave of talent now will far exceed the
previous two waves in scale and the impact on Shanghai's social
and economic development."
</P>
<P>
More than 17,000 students studying overseas have come to work
in Shanghai. Some have started manufacturing businesses in the
three parks specially designed for them, others working in hi-tech
research programs.
</P>
<P>
Dr. He Lin, of the Shanghai Life Science Research Center of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, is one example of those students who
have returned from overseas. He now heads a research team
researching genes that may lead to diseases like Alzheimer's
Disease and to cures. He left the Edinburgh Human Genetics
Institute of the British Academy of Medical Sciences in 1996,
where he had worked for many years.

<P>
A recent survey showed that 70 to 80 percent of Shanghai's
young people are satisfied with the city's political and economic
situation and cultural atmosphere, and 86 percent believe that
Shanghai has the most development opportunities for anyone.
</P>
<P>
There has obviously been a cooling down of the craze to go
abroad in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Statistics of the
Municipal Public Security Bureau show that more than 40,000 people
here applied to go abroad for language study in 1988 alone,
compared with 600 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The number of people from Hong Kong, Macao, or Taiwan who have
worked or lived in the city for more than a year is greater than
33,000. There are also more than 10,000 foreign experts and
scholars working on key projects, or in major scientific research,
educational programs, or other areas.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has grown into an international metropolis of
concerts, first-class museums, and libraries, with a myriad of
commercial opportunities available.
</P>
<P>
There are about 16,000 overseas-backed enterprises
here. Industrial output value of overseas-funded enterprises rose
35 percent in 1996 from the previous year, and sales increased 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
There are 38 foreign banks authorized to do business in the
city, which reported an increase of 42 percent in annual profits.
</P>
<P>
In addition to having recruited annually 10,000 college
graduates and more than 3,000 people with senior technological and
management titles, Shanghai has issued blue cards for long-term
residence to over 2,500 people from other parts of China, who have
invested 4.74 billion yuan, including 286 million U.S. dollars in
the city.
</P>
<P>
Huang Dalin, a native of Wenzhou City, in east China's Zhejiang
Province, who has gotten his blue card, said, "I found that
Shanghai had the most development potential after travelling
extensively over the past decade." He added that he plans to move
his company headquarters from Qinhuangdao City in Hebei Province
to Shanghai, after having invested 10 million yuan in it.

<HEADLINE> Commercial Swindles Harm Chinese Consumers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide survey has shown
that 78.4 percent of Chinese consumers have been affected by
commercial swindles in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The annual survey, conducted by the China Consumers'
Association, places so-called "direct sales" at the top of its
list of commercial swindles, today's China Business Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Direct sales mean manufacturers selling directly to consumers
to reduce prices by chopping off profit margin reaped by the
distributor. But in fact, in many of these "direct sales",
consumers are duped into buying goods that are priced higher than
normal or that are fake.
</P>
<P>
Direct sales ranked No. 9 in 1995's survey of bad business
practices, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the number of complaints lodged by consumers was up
almost 50 percent from 1995, which shows that more and more people
are aware of the importance of protecting their own economic
rights, according to the association. Consumers said they were
most unhappy about the following: repair work, food service,
medical care, public utilities, clothes, washing and dyeing,
entertainment, house purchases, and interior decoration.
</P>
<P>
To protect consumers' rights, the paper says, the government
will increase its efforts to crack down on commercial
swindles.

<HEADLINE> Background: PLA Forces to Be Stationed in HKSAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Forty advance personnel of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) arrived in Hong Kong today to make
practical preparations for the PLA garrison's stationing in the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the first batch of the advance personnel of the
PLA marks the progress of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
(JLG) in their 12-month talks concerning the entry of the advance
contingent in HK.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the military forces of the PLA to be stationed
in the HKSAR was completed on January 28, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Made up of PLA ground, naval and air forces and with strict
political, military, and disciplinary training, the forces will be
officially stationed in Hong Kong at zero hour on July 1.
</P>
<P>
All members in the forces were selected strictly. They have
been required to study the Basic Law and Hong Kong's local laws,
customs, economy, geography, as well as the English language.
</P>
<P>
The military forces have been formed in accordance with the PLA
missions stipulated in the Constitution of the People's Republic
of China, and the relevant stipulation of the Basic Law that the
Central People's Government shall be responsible for the defense
of the HKSAR, in a bid to safeguard the state sovereignty,
reunification and territorial integrity and maintain the
prosperity and stability of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The military forces will not interfere in local affairs of the
HKSAR.
In addition to abiding by the national laws, members of the
garrison shall abide by the laws of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Expenditure of the garrison shall be borne by the Central
People's Government.
</P>
<P>
The military forces have received Hong Kong people from various
sectors, including the news media.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with mainland and Hong Kong journalists, Major
General Liu Zhenwu, commander of the forces, said that his forces
and the HKSAR government will operate separately according to
their respective military and executive systems and will not
interfere in each other's affairs.
</P>
<P>
Liu paid two working visits to Hong Kong last July and August
at the invitation of Commander of the British Garrison Major
General Bryan Dutton and with the arrangement of the JLG.
</P>
<P>
On December 30, 1996, the 23rd Session of the Standing
Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) endorsed
the Law on Stationing Troops in the HKSAR which received positive
response from people of various sectors in HK.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the law fully represented the Chinese
government's stance that the PLA forces are necessary for
safeguarding state security and maintaining HK's stability and
prosperity.

<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua)-- The 800-year-old town of Dayan in
earthquake-hit Lijiang County of South China's Yunnan Province is
making strenuous efforts to reclaim its former glory, "China
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
M A Halim, a UN-designated expert on historic relics is making
a three-day tour of Lijiang to decide whether to place the town on
the UN World Heritage list.
</P>
<P>
"It is rare for a county to apply for world heritage after an
earthquake," said Chen Jiang, deputy-magistrate of Lijiang Naxi
Minority Autonomous County.
</P>
<P>
Dayan makes up 80 percent of the county shattered by an
earthquake measuring 7 on the Richter scale in February last year,
with economic losses climbing to 4.6 billion yuan (554 million Us
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The UN granted Lijiang 30,000 US dollars to encourage it to
overcome its difficulties.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars) has been
allocated by the government for reconstruction. "Over 20 million
yuan (2.4 million US dollars) has been spent to make the town look
like what it was," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Starting in June, an even more ambitious rebuilding project
should begin with the assistance of an expected World Bank loan.
</P>
<P>
The project to be completed by August next years, aims to
rebuild the house of the Mu Clan, the "forbidden city" of the
town, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Declines in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade
continued to decline in March as total trade in the month
decreased by 2.3 percent on a three-month moving basis, the
Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports declined by 4.1 percent, re-exports
fell by 0.6 percent, while oil domestic exports dropped by 4.3
percent in March, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, non-oil domestic exports decreased by 2.1
percent in March this year, the TDB said, commenting that although
this was less severe than the 7.9 percent contraction in the
previous month, it reflected continued weakness in the global
demand for some electronics and related products such as
semi-conductors.
</P>
<P>
As a result of its 4.1 percent decline, non-oil domestic
exports shrank to 7.7 billion Singapore dollars (about 5.35
billion US dollars) in March. The TDB said that the performance of
key markets remained mixed.
</P>
<P>
While non-oil domestic exports to the United States, Japan and
Hong Kong were still weak, non-oil domestic exports to the
European Union and Malaysia went up by 4.9 percent and 2.7 percent
respectively, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that oil domestic exports decreased by 4.3 percent in
March with the softening of oil prices as well as a drop in volume
due to lackluster demand from Japan and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
According to the TDB figures, imports fell by 1.9 percent to
16.8 billion Singapore dollars (about 11.67 billion US dollars) in
March. Decreases were reflected in imports of integrated circuits,
parts of diodes, photocells and transistors, capacitors, and other
products.

GUANGZHOU, April 21 (Xinhua) -- This capital city of south

of the arrest of a refugee leader by Indian authorities, reports
reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
The refugees from eight refugee camps in east Nepal also held a
mass meeting in Damak, about 250 km from here, to call for
immediate release of Rongthong Dorij, who was arrested in a New
Delhi suburb Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Dorij, chairman of refugee political group the
United Front for Democracy (UFD), was illegal as a Bhutanese
national can freely travel in India without passport under an
existing treaty between Bhutan and India, refugees said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian authorities reportedly charged the Bhutanese refugee
leader for violating the Foreigners' Registration Act.
</P>
<P>
According to UFD sources, Dorij had gone to India to mobilize
support for his organization's program against the Bhutanese
authorities, which have forced some 100,000 refugees to flee to
Nepal since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, various Nepali social organizations Sunday also
flayed Dorij's arrest in India and have planned to organize
protest programs including sit-in in front of the Indian Embassy
here to press for his release, the local press said.

are joining hands to organize a festival to promote beef
consumption as fears of anthrax are haunting the country.
</P>
<P>
The event is being organized by the interior, agriculture and

to slaughter houses and sellers, while helping training them to
ensure that the beef sold will be free of anthrax.
</P>

Thai public health officials said that the disease is
non-communicable to human beings and it can be destroyed under 140
degrees Celsius temperature for one to three hours or if exposed
under 100 degrees Celsius of moist heat for five to 30 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Visits Czech Republic on NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin arrived here today for a three-day visit to discuss
NATO's eastward expansion with Czech leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, the first Russian prime minister to visit the
country since the former Czechoslovakia split in 1993, will meet
his Czech counterpart, Vaclav Klaus, and Czech parliament leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic is one the countries most likely to be
admitted into NATO during the military alliance's summit in July.
</P>
<P>
Russia strongly opposes the planned NATO eastward enlargement,
fearing it would bring nuclear and other weapons to its border. It
has demanded a binding treaty with NATO on a new Russian-NATO
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure, Chernomyrdin said that Moscow was
enhancing ties with the Czechs in many areas, with economic
cooperation as the priority, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
However, a Czech official remarked several days ago that the
Czech Republic would use the visit to tell Russia about its
position and interests in becoming a full NATO member.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is also concerned about a Czech decision last week to
buy 53 billion cubic meters of Norwegian natural gas over the next
20 years, since its Gazprom has been Czech's sole gas supplier.

<HEADLINE> Schools to Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China will establish a number of
green schools to help protect environment in the country by the
turn of the century, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted information from the National
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) as saying that students in
these schools will have access to materials concerning
environmental protection distributed by the environmental
departments. They will also be required to master the
environmental protection contents in their textbooks.
</P>
<P>
But the sources did not elaborate how many green schools will
be set up this year.
</P>
<P>
Green Schools must improve not only their own teachers' and
students' environmental awareness but also that of neighboring
units, and must keep their school yards clean and beautiful,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Education materials satisfying different needs of colleges,
professional, high and primary schools for environmental education
will be edited and published in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
This program initiated by NEPA is designed to guide the
environmental education and publication work throughout the
country. Its goal is to help the country's young people and
children obtain basic knowledge of environmental conservation by
the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and members of the Chinese Communist
Party, as well as enterprises' legal persons, should receive some
training on environmental conservation and sustained development,
according to the program.
</P>
<P>
All on-job officials in education and environmental departments
should also receive comprehensive training on environment-friendly
economic development.
</P>
<P>
By the year of 2010, the environmental education system will be
standardized and regulated in accordance with regulations, as
targeted by the program.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 160 universities and college across China
training majors of the environment. Many institutions of
higher learning are offering optional courses on environmental
protection.

ROME, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of the Italian city of
Pisa today criticized a TV commercial showing the city's world
famous leaning tower collapsing after being hit by a car.
</P>

"The TV ad was in extremely bad taste," Piero Floriani
said. "This is really serious, exploiting a real problem for
commercial purposes."
</P>
<P>
The tower, built between 1174 and 1350, started leaning while
still under construction for ill-designed foundation, with its top
center being five meters apart from the perpendicular central line
today.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the mayor, the Opera della Primaziale, a building
organization responsible for the tower's renovation, said it would
file a suit against Ras Insurance, an automobile insurance company.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Saving the Leaning Tower also criticized the
commercial today, saying "Joking around at a time of such
difficulty for the tower is really detrimental."

NANCHANG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Science and technology are
playing a larger role in China's agriculture, as the country tries
to increase its grain production by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
The role of science and technology accounted for 39 percent
last year in contributing to agricultural development. Many

<P>
Jiangxi Province in mid-east China has called for contribution

agriculture this year. And Shandong, also in the east, has
guaranteed strong financial support for development of
agricultural science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Provinces of southern China have done their best to spread the
use of sparse-planting techniques for dry farmland, and sixty
percent of the grain production increase in east China's Fujian
Province has been attributed to the practice.
</P>
<P>
More than 260,000 ha of farmland in Zhejiang Province have been
planted using dry farmland techniques and tossing rice shoots.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi has added 260,000 ha of farmland on which cross-bred

NANCHANG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- To increase farmers' awareness,
governments have taken practical measures to spread the use of
agro-techniques to remote rural areas. The technologies were
introduced to farmers through television, pamphlets, or training
classes sponsored by local government organizations.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Daxin, a farmer in Jiangxi's Zhoujiadun village, used to
suffer as his farmland produced less and less grain and his
orchard, little fruit.
</P>
<P>
But he got help from a provincial correspondence school, and
had a good harvest after applying what he had learned to
farming. His relatives and villagers soon rushed to follow his
example.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu Province has set up awards for successful applications
of research result and spreading the use of agro-techniques,
mainly to technicians at the grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
Some provinces have increased input in agronomy and
technology. Shandong has allocated millions of US dollars for
improved varieties of crops like wheat, corn, and cotton, and
Anhui Province has worked out regulations on funding and
technician allocation.
</P>
<P>
Government efforts at various levels to revitalize agriculture
through the use of science and education have paid off, as it is
making continued contributions to the development of China's

JAKARTA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
ordered Merpati Nusantara Airlines to ground its remaining fleet
of British-made advanced turbo prop (ATP) aircraft after one of
the planes crashed Saturday in South Sumatra, killing 15 people
and injuring 31 others.
</P>
<P>
Merpati spokesman Tondo Widodo said here Sunday night that
divestment of the remaining four aircraft would wait pending the

aircraft carried 52 passengers, including a crew of five and two
children and two babies.

Merpati, a subsidiary of national flag carrier Garuda
Indonesia, began flying the 68-seat ATP plane on short-distance
routes in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The black box of the ill-fated aircraft, which had been found

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province in southeast
China has been successful in implementing the country's Forest
Law, with its afforestation rate ranking highest in China.
</P>
<P>
A just-ended 12-day inspection tour of the province's forests,
led by Vice-Chairman Buhe of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress, the country's top legislature, found
Fujian has worked steadily to enforce the law since it went into
effect on January 1, 1985.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the top legislature has organized such
an inspection. Other tour teams were sent to Jiangxi and Yunnan
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Fujian included in its overall Forestry Law enforcement plan
legal education for the public on forestry, local regulations on
protection of forests, crackdowns by local protection teams and an
improved supervisory system.
</P>
<P>
But the inspection group also found that there is still much to
be done in terms of forestry tax collection, over-cutting of woods
and forest mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
To date, Fujian's afforestation rate has reached 57.3 percent,
ranking first in the country, and forestry has become its pillar
industry.
</P>
<P>
China's afforestation rate is 13.92 percent.

<HEADLINE> Televised Network Takes Medicare to Patients' Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A televised network will enable
Chinese patients living in remote areas to share the country's
best medical counselling and diagnosis service without leaving
their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide communication network will provide long-distance
counselling and treatment on illness for patients throughout China
as it goes into operation next month, according to a report in
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Several types of personal health cards are to be launched
through banks in May, which record detailed health data of card
holders and serve as a reference for the accurate and quick
diagnosis and treatment of health problems, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The card, a laser information carrier with the same size as a
credit card, can save character and image information and can also
be used to settle payments.
</P>
<P>
Apart from long-distance medical counselling and diagnosis
given by the country's best doctors, the network will hold
nationwide television conferences and carry out professional
training and international exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
The network, called "Golden Health Medical Network", will
initially cover 20 hospitals in 15 cities in May, and expand to 80
medical units by the end of this year. By the end of the year
2000, it will include a total of 500.
</P>
<P>
The final goal is to link up with all hospitals above the
county level as well as some of the township hospitals, the report
quoted Liu Yinghua, who is working with the Ministry of Health to
establish the network, as saying.
</P>
<P>
There are currently more than 60,000 hospitals in the country,
while 80 percent of highly skilled doctors and specialized medical
equipment are concentrated in hospitals in large cities.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of the rural population do not have access to
immediate treatment for their illnesses, especially many difficult
cases.
</P>
<P>
Many of them travel to big city hospitals to have their
illnesses diagnosed and cured, which is however time-consuming and
expensive, often requiring additional expenses for transportation
and accommodations.

<HEADLINE> China to Dominate Table Tennis Worlds, But to What Extent? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The top Chinese table tennis
official says he will be happy if Chinese win half of the gold
medals in the World Championships here, but many think behind his
low-profile guess is a bigger ambition.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yinsheng, president of the Chinese Table Tennis
Association, told reporters early this month that he had his eyes
on three or four titles in the Manchester Worlds, repeating the
same prediction he did days before last championships in Tianjin,
where Chinese cashed in on home-court advantage to sweep all
seven titles.
</P>
<P>
With a rising number of rivals and the fact they are playing
away from home, Chinese players will find it impossible to repeat
the clean-sweep feat, which they first did in the 1981
championships.
</P>
<P>
Led by men's world No.1 Kong Linghui and women's top player
Deng Yaping, the Chinese team remains the strongest among the
world. Five titles should be a reasonable guess for Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The Swaythling Cup for the men's team title is expected to be
decided between China and Sweden, who had met for six times in
the latest seven finals and pulled even with each winning three.
</P>
<P>
China will field Kong, Olympic champion Liu Guoliang and
chopper-attacker Ding Song and veterans Wang Tao and Ma Wenge to
the team competitions, the same five who won the trophy in the
last Worlds.
</P>
<P>
Sweden is to send a team led by 1992 Olympic champion Jan-Ove
Waldner, Jorgen Persson and Peter Karlsson, the trio who lost the
finals 3-2 in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The trophy will very likely go to the team with a smarter
lineup. Waldner has beaten Kong in all four clashes but never
had advantage of Liu while Karlsson is wary of Ding, who caught
the Swede nonplussed by his chop-and-attack play in the Tianjin
championships.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to field Liu instead of Kong to checkmate
Waldner if the world best two teams meet in the final. Ding, who
had beaten Persson in last championships, and Wang Tao, who plays
an aggressive close-to-table game, are likely choices.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women team is a hot favorite for the Corbillion
Cup. Possible challengers are Japan, Chinese Taipei and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The men's singles title will be the most difficult to
predict. Chinese Kong, Liu and Wang, Waldner, European top
player Vladmir Samsonov, France's 1993 world champion
Jean-Philippe Gatien, former world No. 1 Jean-Michael Saive and
Olympic quarter-finalist Petr Korpel of Czech Republic all stands
a chance to win the conveted title.
</P>
<P>
"I won't be surprised if anyone of the world top 20 wins the
St. Bride Vase," said Chinese coach Cai Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
Deng Yaping, who has won 15 world championships and World Cup
titles and four Olympic gold medals, is an odds-on favorite in
the women's singles event. Her major rivals will be Koyama Chire
of Japan and Chinese Taipei's Chen Jing.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Deng and the 20-year-old Kong Linghui will
also have a crack at the mixed doubles title, an event usually
ignored by Europeans.
</P>
<P>
Deng is also heavily tipped to take the doubles event. Since
she has combined with fast-attacker Yang Ying, the duo has never
lost a match in international competitions.
</P>
<P>
Those who have a chance to win the men's doubles event are
Chinese combinations Yan Sen/Wang Liqin and Olympic champions
Kong Linghui/Liu Guoliang, and a duo of German Jorg Rosskopf and
Samsonov.
</P>
<P>
Rosskopf and Samsonov are the runners-up in last championships
whose winners Wang Tao and Liu Lin has split up with Wang pairing
up with teanager Ma Lin.
</P>
<P>
Yan and Wang jumped to fame last September as they won the
Grand Prix Finals which attracted a strong field including
Olympic and world champions.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Volume to Reach 310-Billion-Dollar goal in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua)-- A senior Chinese trade official is
urging calmness, despite the prediction that China will achieve
this year's targeted 310 billion US dollars in foreign trade
volume, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics indicate that during the first quarter this
year, China's foreign trade stood at 64.29 billion US dollars, up
11.6 percent from a year ago, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew 25.7 percent to 35.5 billion US dollars, creating
a trade surplus of 6.71 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The first quarter's growth in exports was based upon the
figures of the same period in 1996 when China's foreign trade
suffered a downturn," said Liu Shanzai, vice-minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first quarter's export volume only accounts for
a small share of the year's total.
</P>
<P>
Difficulties such as money-strains on State foreign trade firms
still exist.
</P>
<P>
"It is still an arduous task to fulfil the year's 155 billion
US dollars export target," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He called on domestic manufacturers to attach special
importance to improving economic efficiency while trying to sign
more export contracts at the 81st Chinese Export Commodities
Fair which runs through April 30.
</P>
<P>
The deals concluded in the first four days indicate that China
has enough goods to sell abroad as a result of the country's sound
economics performance, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
An export-oriented economy has become a "dragon head" of the
country's economy, but State-owned firms of foreign trade need to
shake off heavy burdens and gear themselves to the market economy,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Establishing joint projects should be another good
opportunity." Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that more than 270,000 overseas firms have
invested in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 21 (Xinhua)-- Northwest China's Gansu Province
is expected to accelerate the building of five nonferrous metal
production bases along the ancient "Silk Road".
</P>
<P>
The province is rich in nonferrous metals. The reserves of
nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium, and iridium rank first in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Gansu has invested 11.37 billion yuan to build a complete
system for nonferrous metal production covering prospecting,
exploiting, dressing, smelting, and processing. Currently, it is
capable of smelting 591,000 tons of nonferrous metals a year.
</P>
<P>
The province has the country's largest rare earth production
base at Jingyuan, an aluminum-smelting base at Lanzhou, and a
nickel and cobalt production base at Jinchuan.
</P>
<P>
Gansu Province has exported a dozen kinds of nonferrous metals
including nickel, cobalt, and rare earth to Japan, France,
Germany, the Unites States, and Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Gansu has risen from the last but two place to the fourth place
in the nation in terms of production scale of nonferrous metals,
which has become its pillar industry.

<HEADLINE> WTO Team Formed to Settle Thai-U.S. Shrimp Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and the United States
have agreed on the members of a team formed by the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to settle their dispute over shrimp trade.
</P>
<P>
The team consisting of three experts respectively from Britain,
Germany and Brazil was appointed early this month to review a U.S.
ban on shrimp imports from Thailand, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imposed a ban on shrimp imports from Thailand last
year, claiming Thailand could not provide sufficient protection on
sea turtles. But it lifted the ban in November, saying that it was
satisfied with the improvement made by Thailand through installing
turtle excluder devices on trawlers.
</P>
<P>
Despite the U.S. lifting of the ban, Thailand insisted in
filing a complaint with the WTO, saying it wanted a clear
explanation from the U.S. behind the motive.
</P>
<P>
Krirk-krai, Thailand ambassador to the WTO, said recently that
according to the agreements under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT), member states could not ban imports of products
by applying non-tariff measures.
</P>
<P>
Import bans are allowed only for reasons based on the quality
of the products, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ban had nothing to do with product quality, he added.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (35-36) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (35-36)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: What are principal officials in the Hong Kong SAR?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Apart from the Chief Executive, principal officials in
the government of Hong Kong SAR include the Secretaries and Deputy
Secretaries of Departments, Directors of Buries, Commissioner
Against Corruption, Director of Audit, Commissioner of Police,
Director of Immigration and Commissioner of Customs and
Excise. Such posts can only be held by Chinese citizens among
permanent residents of the region with no right of abode in any
foreign country.
</P>
<P>
Question: Why should Hong Kong's political system continue to
be executive-led after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: One of the most striking features of the executive-led
political system is that executive organs perform primary
governmental functions, with the legislature playing the role of
supervision and power balancing. Many factors have contributed to
the success of Hong Kong, and the executive-led political system
is one of the most important.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is not a country but an international economic
metropolis. This requires that the local government makes prompt
decisions and executes them promptly. And this calls for an
executive-led political system. If it wants to continue its status
as one of the world's economic centres after 1997, Hong Kong
should continue to have an executive-led political system. That is
why the future Hong Kong political system as stipulated in the
Basic Law is of an executive-led type.

in a 1997 memorandum prepared for the board's governing body by
executive director Elmer Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the proposed tax will be slapped on
four general categories including electronics, chemicals,
automotive and machinery parts and components.
</P>
<P>
The memo did not mention specific products that would be
affected, but sources from the Board of Investments said the
products probably include tires, television sets, stereo
components, video projectors and video cassette players.
</P>
<P>
Local makers of these products have been vigorously lobbying
for government protection against competing foreign brands, the
board's proposal is an offshoot of these lobbying efforts, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposed import tax is expected to come under fire
from the Philippines' trading partners because it violates the
World Trade Organization's rules prohibiting member countries from
imposing a discriminatory tax on imports.

<HEADLINE> New Zealanders Support Ban of Vicious Dogs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Most New Zealanders favor
banning pit bull terriers, a kind of vicious dogs which have
caused a number of incidents of serious attack of people in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 750 people conducted recently shows that only 19
percent opposes a ban, while 75 percent of those polled favor
banning the dog, the local paper The Dominion reported today.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party MP Jim Sutton, who issued the survey results
Sunday, said action should be taken before these "dangerous
animals" cause any more injuries or death.
</P>
<P>
The call for a ban of the dog came after a man in Te Puke on
North Island was mauled to death earlier this month by a dog
reported to have pit bull bloodlines. The tragedy sparked off a
debate in New Zealand whether this kind of dangerous dog should be
allowed in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, New Zealand's first Pet Exposition held in the South
Island city of Christchurch at the weekend banned pit bulls.

<HEADLINE> Broad Prospects for Sino-Russian Economic, Trade Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- People in Moscow often go to the
hundreds of shopping stalls owned by Chinese in the Izmailovo
market to buy good-quality clothing, toys and electrical
appliances at low prices.
</P>
<P>
In Russia's border cities, China-made commodities are
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
And in China's border cities, commodities imported from Russia,
such as machinery, electrical equipment, metals and fertilizers,
are shipped to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Frequent commercial exchanges and several scheduled flights a
week between the two countries... all suggest a prosperous future
for Sino-Russian economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade relations between the two countries have
developed quickly in recent years, with the bilateral trade
turnover hitting a record high of 7.68 billion U.S. dollars in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Despite a slip in bilateral trade in 1994 as a result of
changes in their respective demands, the two sides managed to
bring the turnover to 5.46 billion dollars in 1995, and 6.85
billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Russia has now become the eighth largest trading partner of
China, and China, Russia's third largest trading partner,
excluding Russia's trading partners within the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
In a recent survey by the Russian International Sociological
Research Center, 52 percent of respondents said Russia should give
priority to developing economic and trade ties with China.
</P>
<P>
And 87 percent of the entrepreneurs in the survey regarded
China as a potential partner for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries' economies and bilateral trade strongly
complement each other," Economic and Commercial Minister-Counselor
Geng Xuncai, of the Chinese Embassy in Russia, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
China's exports to Russia are mainly food, daily necessities,
and light industrial and textile products. The major imports from
Russia are power equipment, transport machinery, metals and
chemical products, according to Geng.
</P>
<P>
He said China had build several thermal power stations by using
Russia-made complete kits of equipment, which had greatly
contributed to the power supply in China.
</P>
<P>
However, several problems remain to be solved. One was China's
big deficit in trade. Last year, China had a trade deficit of 3.5
billion dollars with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese counselor pointed out that China and Russia had
much potential in expanding economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
For example, the two sides could raise the trade volume by
developing trade in technology, expanding the scope of economic
and technological cooperation, and improving the structure of
their exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two sides could also increase their
investment in each other and cooperate in "trans-century"
projects. Russia invested 22 million U.S. dollars in China in
1995, while China utilizes 30-40 billion dollars in foreign
capital each year.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China invested 40 million dollars in Russia
in 1995, while Russia attracts several billion dollars in foreign
investment a year.
</P>
<P>
The two could cooperate in projects such as laying the
Irkutsk-China-South Korea gas pipelines, in the construction of
China's Three-Gorges Project, and in laying oil pipelines and
erecting electricity transmission lines from Russia's East and
West Siberias to Northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The two sides could also set up a China trade center in Moscow,
and open shops there for Chinese commodities to show quality
products produced in China to the Russian people, the Chinese
counselor said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two countries could achieve the target of
raising bilateral trade to 20 billion dollars by the year 2000, a
strategic objective proposed by leaders of China and Russia.

Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>

return to the "old regime of favoritism, warlordism, inefficiency
and corruption," saying the country must consolidate its gains and
move forward to greater prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Negotiators of the rebel National Democratic Front are all

</P>
<P>
The Business Daily:

<P>
-- To avoid facing the same economic woes currently encountered
by Thailand, the Philippines must prevent its current account
deficit from reaching 8 percent of its gross domestic product,
impose restrictions on the banking sector's exposure to the robust
real estate industry and diversify its exports.

<HEADLINE> ADB: Asia's Megacity Problems Avertible With Proper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Asia's megacities -- areas with a
population over 10 million -- will expand from nine to 20 by the
year 2025, but megacity problems, such as rise in congestion,
pollution and crimes, can be averted with proper management, the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) said today.
</P>
<P>
"The continuing migration from rural to urban areas in Asia
will expand the number of megacities from nine to 20 by the year
2025," the bank said in its "Annual Report 1996," which was
released here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, over the past 30 years, Asia's urban
population has nearly tripled from 400 million to 1.1 billion and
there has been a corresponding increase in the level of
urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Today, Asia has nine megacities -- Beijing, Bombay, Calcutta,
Jakarta, Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai, Tianjin and Tokyo, but soon four
more will be added -- Bangkok, Dhaka, Karachi and Manila, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based bank said that while the megacities are often
plagued by environmental deterioration, inadequate housing,
traffic jams and social alienation, they are also important to a
country's economic development and can provide residents with a
satisfying quality of life.
</P>
<P>
"Asia's megacities can also offer efficient business conditions
and a better standard of services than in rural areas," it said.
</P>
<P>
Though the megacities have negative features, the chilling
prospect of a serious deterioration in quality of life could be
averted, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the gaps between demand and supply in Asia's
megacities are management related.
</P>
<P>
The bank suggested that the government should shift its role as
a service provider to a facilitator of services provided by
others.
</P>
<P>
It also called for moves toward decentralization and
strengthening of local government and the provision of services
such as water supply and public transportation through
public-private partnership.
</P>
<P>
The bank estimated that to provide services at levels
sufficient to sustain productivity in megacities, 20 billion to 40
billion U.S. dollars will be needed annually over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Transport and communications, energy and water supply and
sanitation will form the largest capital investment segments, the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
But it is difficult to predict what will happen if there are
shortfalls in the financing of megacity growth and management, the
bank added.
