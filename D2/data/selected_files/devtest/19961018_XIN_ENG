<HEADLINE> China-Algeria Presidents Talks (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
The visiting president said Algeria and China have kept in close
consultation with each other in the area of international politics
and achieved satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
Algeria will, as always, support China's reunification process,
and its upcoming renewed exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
and Macao, Zeroual added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that during the 38 years since the two countries
established diplomatic relations, China and Algeria have always
supported and trusted each other, despite turbulence in the world
and changes in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have cooperated well in political, economic and other
fields, and shared common ground in a variety of international
affairs," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the great efforts and contributions of the Algerian
government and people in regard to the resumption of China's
legitimate seat in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people will always treasure this
invaluable support," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the Algerian government's stand of adhering to
the 'one China' principle and of refusing to have official contact
with Taiwan," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Zeroual said China has always supported the just cause to
restore the legitimate rights of Palestine, the unity of the Arab
world and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating all these, Zeroual expressed the conviction that
mutual support between the Arab world and China is an important
factor for guaranteeing the success of the Arab people's endeavors.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that China and the Arab countries have
long-cherished relations that are friendly and cooperative.
</P>
<P>
"As a friend of the Arab countries, China has always supported
and appreciated the efforts of the Arab world in realizing and
restoring unity," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Business Upbeat on IMF Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's business community
today welcomed as positive the decision by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to support the second stage of market
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders said an agreement with the IMF was crucial to
the success of the Zimbabwe program for economic and social
transformation (Zimprest), as the new program to be launched next
year would be called.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, which last September withheld crucial
balance-of-payments aid worth over about 100 million U.S. Dollars
due to serious fiscal imbalances, early this month agreed in
principle to provide funding for Zimprest.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce Danny
Meyer hailed the IMF agreement as a major boost to government
efforts to further liberalize the economy, with particular focus
on employment creation and alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
managing director of stock market analysts Dataworld Savvas
Kyriakides said for the first time the government is expected to
accelerate the reform process, which would be strictly monitored
by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's watershed industrial index today hit an all-time
high of over 7,260 points on the back of news that the country
had received support from the IMF for second stage of market
reforms.

Jiang hailed the success of the Arab countries' Cairo Summit in
June as an important step toward enhancing coordination and unity
among them.
</P>
<P>
China "sincerely hopes the Arab countries make even more
achievements in restoring unity, enhancing coordination and
improving cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the world is moving faster toward multi-polarization,
the improved unity and cooperation among the Arab countries, which
are an important force in the international political arena, will
surely have a positive impact on peace, stability and development
in the region, and in the world as a whole," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
After their talks, the two presidents attended the signing
ceremony of six documents, including one which concerns the
encouragement and protection of reciprocal investments, made by
the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Jiang presided over a welcoming ceremony in
honor of the Algerian president, who arrived here earlier today on
a five-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
Zeroual, who is here as Jiang's guest, is the first Algerian
president to visit China in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying him on the trip are five ministers as well as other
senior Algerian officials.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Needs Quick Institutional Reforms, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe needs to move fast on
institutional reforms and on finding new sources of tax revenue
to stimulate development in the country, Chief Secretary to the
President and Cabinet Charles Utete said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day business retreat for heads of the
government ministries, Utete said such reforms would remove
impediments to investment and growth.
</P>
<P>
Besides public expenditure control measures taken by the
government, there was also need to create a sound financial base
for economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of this need, he said, the government must pay
attention to adressing major structural and other problems of the
national economy that impeded investment and growth during the
first five years of the economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance should assist in revenue generation
through tracking the performance of parastatals to ensure the
government receive adequate returns, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the tracking of parastatals' performance would
also enable the government to influence critical investment and
other financial decisions of these bodies.
</P>
<P>
''We also need to identify new sources of tax revenue while
naturally remaining alert to the potential negative social and
economic effects of any such new revenue measures,'' he said,
adding that an urgent review of tariffs and fees charged by the
government on various services was needed. enditem

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Down Sharply in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Housing starts in the U.S.
fell by 6 percent in September, the lowest level of 1996, U.S.
Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that it was the fresh evidence that the U.S.
economy is easing from its sizzling pace in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department said that construction of new
homes and apartments totaled 1.44 million at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate in September, down from 1.53 million in August which
was the highest since March 1994.
</P>
<P>
The September's housing starts is the lowest since they hit a
1.43 million rate last December and the decline was the steepest
since a 9 percent plunge in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the single-family starts, about 80 percent
of new residential construction, plunged by 8.9 percent to a 1.12
million annual rate, the largest decrease since a 12 percent drop
in January 1995. They were up by 7.1 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Construction of apartment and condominiums, often volatile but
not as sensitive to interest-rate changes, rose 6.4 percent to a
316,000 rate after falling 7.2 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
However, for the first nine months of this year, the housing
starts in U.S. were still 10.7 percent above those of the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, housing starts in the Northeast rose by 1.4
percent. But they fell by 13.3 percent in the West, 10.4 percent
in the Midwest and 0.9 percent in the South.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commerce department report also showed applications for
building permits--often a barometer of future activity--dropped
2.9 percent to a 1.38 million rate, the second straight decline.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that new home construction is beginning to level
off in the face of higher financing costs.
</P>
<P>
In September, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.23
percent, up from 8 percent in August and 7.03 percent last
January.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Home Builders reported Wednesday
its Housing Market Index fell in October for a fifth straight
month. All three index components fell: current sales, traffic by
prospective buyers and sales expectations over the next six
months.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Passes First Law to Supervise City Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Municipal People's Congress
Standing Committee unanimously passed legislation today ordering
the city government to report to the committee before it makes
decisions on major issues.
</P>
<P>
The new local law is aimed at standardizing and regulating the
system of reporting key issues to the committee prior to final
decision, according to some committee members. It is expected to
make the government's political activities more visible, and its
decision-making process more democratic and scientific.
</P>
<P>
Some members complained at today's session, saying that in the
past, the city government had reported many important issues to
the committee only after decisions had been made.
</P>
<P>
They called the practice abnormal.
</P>
<P>
The law, titled "Regulations on Reporting Major Issues to
Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee by Municipal
Government," is the first of its kind ever made by the committee.
</P>
<P>
The law was formed on the basis of China's Constitution and Law
on Local Organizations, which grants local people's congress
standing committees at the county level and above the right to
discuss and decide important local issues.
</P>
<P>
Such issues include alterations of the partial or entire layout
of the city's general plan, changes in the city's annual
development plans and key reform programs on economic and social
sectors, key projects excluded in annual development programs, the
formation of sistership with foreign cities, and other issues of
public concern.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Out of HK Marlboro Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia's fourth-ranked
Yevgeny Kafelnikov became the first seeded player to be out of the
competition with his straight-set loss of his last Red Group match
at the Marlboro Championships at the Victoria Park Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, winner of the French Open earlier this year, was
upset by Australian Patrick Rafter on the opening day of the
six-day event.
</P>
<P>
The Russian seemed totally shaken as he lost 7-5, 6-3 to
American Michael Joyce in his second and final group outing, thus
crashing out of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
As Rafter had already qualified for the semi-finals as the
group's winner with two straight wins, Joyce came out the runnerup
with one win and one loss.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov finished third and last with two defeats.
</P>
<P>
In the Blue Group, Richly Reneberg of the United States scored
a win in his first group match, defeating Denmark's Kenneth
Carlsen with two identical scores of 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Carlsen has already lost to American Vincent Spadea in an
earlier match.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Reneberg takes on Spadea, Thomas Muster of Austria
meets Jonas Bjorkmann of Sweden and American Pete Sampras plays
Byron Black of Zimbabwe.
</P>

The winners of the round-robin group matches enter the
semi-finals slated for Saturday and the final is set for

<HEADLINE> Long March Proves Absolute Party Rule Over Army, Jiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today that the success of the Long March proves that
adherence to the Party's absolute leadership over the army is the
foundation of China's military force and the heart and soul of its
tradition.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also the General Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chairman of
the Central Military Commission, was speaking to a group of
ex-soldiers of the Chinese Worker's and Peasant's Red Army at an
event to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the victorious end of
the Long March, a decisive military move by the Red Army between
1935-36.
</P>
<P>
The army as a whole should bear the adherence principle in mind
and obey the direction of the Party Central Committee and the
Central Military Commission, Jiang said, adding that the army must
be forever loyal to the Party, socialism, the motherland and the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 ex-Red Army soldiers were invited to the function,
representing over 3,000 Red Army troops throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Also attending were vice-chairmen of Central Military
Commission Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Wannian and Chi Haotian.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech, Jiang thanked everyone who participated
in the Long March and cherished memories of late revolutionaries,
including Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi and Zhu De, as well
as revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the Long
March, and other military groups that helped the Red Army in the
march.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised the march as a grand action of the CPC and the
Red Army and a brilliant chapter in Chinese history and the
military history of the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Red Army was forced to start the strategic
and difficult march as a result of "leftist" adventurist's
mistakes when it failed to defeat the fifth siege made by the
Kuomintang reactionary group, which was gathering its military
forces to attack the Red Army while withdrawing from invading
Japanese troops.

<HEADLINE> Somali Official Pledges to continue Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A Somali official said today
the factional leaders in Somalia "pledge themselves to continue
dialogue in pursuit of a solution to the Somali problem".
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here this afternoon, "foreign
minister" of the self-styled government (of Hussein Aidid) Jama
Mohamed Ghalib pointed out, "the initiative or efforts by the
east African region is in the best position to help solve the
Somali problem and have the best chance to success."
</P>
<P>
Referring to some distorted media reports, the official said
the statement released by the Kenyan Government "is the sole
authentic information and outcome" of the peace talks held here
during the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Somali factional leaders reached a unilateral peace agreement
during a breakthrough in the peace talks initiated by Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The leaders attending the Nairobi talks have ordered their own
factions to effect an immediate truce, free movement in the
divided country and removal of the roadblocks in the Somali
capital of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, President Moi appealed to the Somali leaders
to consider that for the last six years Somalia has had no
internationally recognized government and that the Somali people
have suffered enormously from the civil war and chaos in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to a local press report today, Hussein Aideed, the
faction leader in charge of southern Somalia, and his counterpart
Ali Mahdi have communicated to their aides in the country to
implement the peace pact without delay.
</P>
<P>
They also said that they "have a political commitment to
ensure for a permanent solution to their internal problems".
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the presence of the Somali factional
leaders in Kenya alone signified their intent and seriousness in
seeking peace.

<HEADLINE> Long March Proves Absolute Party Rule Over Army, Jiang (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang recalled that the Red Army, by holding the patriotic
banner high and with unconquerable revolutionary will and fearless
heroic spirit, had fought bravely, overcome rare hardships,
defeated attacks by more than one million enemy troops, frustrated
the attempt of Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang forces to eliminate
the Communist Party and the Red Army, and realized the joining of
the major Red Army forces in the Shaanxi-Gansu areas in west China.
</P>
<P>
The victory of the Long March proves that the CPC is a great
and glorious party, and the people's army, led by the Party, is a
brave, fearless and invincible armed force, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Long March stands as a monument in Chinese
history, and will live forever with rivers and mountains and shine
forever with the Sun and the Moon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang quoted Mao Zedong as saying, "Who made the Long March
victorious? The Communist Party. Without the Communist Party, the
Long March would have been unimaginable."
</P>
<P>
It was in the critical Long March period that the Party held
the Zunyi Meeting, during which Mao Zedong was made the Leader of
the Red Army and the Party Central Committee, signaling that the
Party had become mature, he noted.
</P>
<P>
And it was because of the correct leadership of the Party
Central Committee, with Mao Zedong at the core, that the Party was
able to independently solve the major problems which surfaced in
the Chinese Revolution and ultimately rescue the movement.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang called on the army to learn from and
inherit the Red Army's sincere and selfless spirit of
revolutionary solidarity, and ceaselessly consolidate the unity in
the army, and between the army, the government and the people.
</P>
<P>
He described the Long March Spirit as a great driving force
that has inspired the Chinese communists and the Chinese people to
be indomitable and hard-working.
</P>
<P>
"We want to take the Long March Spirit as an important
spiritual source for promoting socialist ethical and cultural
progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
General Liu Huaqing also spoke at the meeting, describing the
victory of the Long March as a glorious success for the CPC, the
Chinese people and the people's army under the leadership of the
CPC.
</P>
<P>
Liu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, pledged to safeguard the
authority of the Party's third-generation leading group with Jiang
Zemin at the core, and to keep in concert with the Party Central
Committee ideologically, politically and practically.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia, Greece Agree to Promote Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia and Greece today
signed a protocol on cooperation between their foreign ministries
which will encourage regular exchanges of views.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovic and his Greek counterpart Theodoros Pangalos.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos arrived here Wednesday afternoon on a two-day official
visit.
</P>
<P>
"We have exchanged views on the need for a full and speedy
normalization of relations and restoration of cooperation between
Yugoslavia and the European Union," Milutinovic told reporters
after meeting Pangalos.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to say that we enjoy full support from Greece in
this endeavor and the two sides have identical or close views and
positions on all concerned issues," the Yugoslav minister said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Bosnian situation, Milutinovic said the two
parties had agreed that the successful holding of elections in
Bosnia and the positive results of the recent Paris agreement
between Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Alija
Izetbegovic, chairman of the Bosnian Presidency, had created
conditions for the consolidation of peace, stabilization and
democratic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic and Izetbegovic signed an agreement in Paris early
this month to formally normalize relations between the two
countries, a major step toward peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We have emphasized the foremost responsibility of the elected
leaders in Bosnia for a continued implementation of the Dayton
agreement, with the support and engagement, yet without tutorship,
of the international community," said Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
Concerning bilateral cooperation, the Yugoslav minister said
both parties had agreed to initiate talks soon on the conclusion
of appropriate economic agreements, aimed at creating even more
favorable conditions for long-term cooperation and for
encouragement of Greek investments in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos told reporters that Yugoslavia was making a positive
contribution to the consolidation of peace and cooperation in the
region and his country supported Yugoslavia's efforts to return to
the international community.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the discriminations against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia are not justified," Pangalos stressed.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia still remains outside the United Nations and many
key international financial organizations after the former
Yugoslavia disintegrated in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said Greece would raise the issue of Yugoslavia's
equal treatment as the other states of the former Yugoslavia at
the meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on October 28.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Reaps 8.7 Million Tons of Cereal Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Agriculture
Minister Teketel Forsido said Ethiopia has obtained a cereal
output record of 8.7 million tons in 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency today, the minister
made the remark at a gathering marking the World Food Day on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
''This (the output) is unprecedented in the economic history
of the country,'' Teketel said.
</P>
<P>
He said food security could be attained in the forseable
future with the continued commitment of the government and the
society as well as foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, a recent study indicated that more
than 50 percent of Ethiopia's population is categorised as food
insecure and unable to cover the 500 GM per day per person food
requirement.
</P>
<P>
''Hunger is still rampant in a large segment of the african
population,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said malnutrition is responsible for more than half of the
four million deaths of African children under five every year,
adding that an estimated 150 million people are at risk of
disorders particularly from iodine deficiency.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia had a bumper harvest in 1995/96 and attained food
self-sufficiency for the first time in its history. enditem

<HEADLINE> Germany Declines to Comment on Lebed's Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The German Foreign Ministry today
declined to comment on Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decision
to sack his national security adviser, Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
"We do not comment on (other country's) government reshuffles,"
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Markus Ederer.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has built a close relationship
with Yeltsin over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin today removed Lebed from his post as the chief of the
Russian National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal was announced by Yeltsin in a nationwide
televised address earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he could no longer bear the situation,
referring to the verbal duel between Lebed and Interior Minister
Anatoly Kulikov over the fall of Chechnya's capital Grozny to
Chechen separatists in August.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov had accused Lebed of planning "a creeping coup", the
president press service said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, 46, was the driving force behind Yeltsin's presidential
election in June. The ex-army general garnered 14.71 percent of
the votes to rank third behind Yeltsin and Communist party leader
Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
In the runoff elections held in early July, Lebed turned to
support Yeltsin in return for his appointment as the presidential
security chief and head of the national security council.
</P>
<P>
Born into a Cossack family, Lebed began his military career in
1973 and rose swiftly in the ranks. He took Yeltsin's side and
defended the White House in Moscow in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Designs African Draft Biosafety Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia announced today
that it has designed a draft biosafety protocol on a continental
level in a bid to prevent the importation of biotechnology to
Africa and preserve the existing biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
Opening a consultation meeting on a draft biosafety protocol
here, Dr. Tewelde Birhan Gebreigziabher, General Manager of the
Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority said Ethiopia
designed the draft protocol on behalf of African countries to
implement the formulation of international biosafety protocol
with a view to protecting the biodiversity of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Much as biotechnology benefitted the developed world, it has a
negative impact on environmental and socio-economic safety of
developing countries like Ethiopia which are original homes to
biodiversity, Tewelde said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is a general consensus that protocols and
directives should be designed on the handling, exchange and use
of biodiversity in consideration of their negative impacts,
especially on the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Tewelde, the draft biosafety protocol is prepared
by professionals from his authority, science and technology
commission, the Institute of Biodiversity as well as Biology
Department of the Addis Ababa University.
</P>
<P>
Professionals from various African countries will meet here
after a week to discuss and ammend the draft so that it could be
taken as the stand of Africa for furure international
negotiations. enditem

State Robert Pelletreau is expected to pay a visit to Turkey
Friday or Saturday on the latest developments in northern Iraq,
the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Pelletreau and Iraqi Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) leader Massoud Barzani or his

</P>
<P>
Various sources in Washington said that Pelletreau had got

Talabani when he held telephone talks with the two Iraqi
Kurdish leaders.
</P>

Turkey's Deputy Chairman of the conservative True Path Party,
Hasan Ekinci, said here today that Iraqi Ambassador to Ankara
Rafi El-Tikriti had asked Turkey to make pressure on Barzani and
Talabani to establish dialogue with the Iraqi government in a
bid to solve the differences between the KDP and the PUK.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has continuously kept contacts with the two parties to
exchange views on the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>

<HEADLINE> French Public Employees Stage Strike against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of public
employees of France today staged a one-day nation-wide strike to
protest the austerity economic and social plans of the government
of Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
But unlike the strike of public transportation workers last
year, today's strike, jointly called by several trade unions, did
not bring chaos to the public life in the capital and most
provincial cities.
</P>
<P>
One in three great speed bullet trains (TJV) ran normal this
morning across the country, according to the management of the
National Railway Company of France (SNCF), while the unions said
that participation rate of strike by SNCF staff was 40-45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only 18 percent of the workers of public transportation sector
in Paris -- including the metropolitan subway trains and buses
--joined the strike, according to the Regie Autonomes des
Transports Parisiens (RATP).
</P>
<P>
Although the air control staff of Air France Europe was on
strike today, one in four domestic air flights was maintained by
the company, while all long distance international flights of Air
France went on as normal, according to Air France.
</P>
<P>
The Euro-star international railway lines also went on as
normal today, said SNCF.
</P>
<P>
Only in Strasbourg and Rennes did the public transportation
break down, with the tramways and trains there all paralyzed by
the strike.
</P>
<P>
Many public schools were closed today as teachers participated
the strike at a very high rate -- between 65 percent and 50
percent -- to protest the government plan of massive lay-offs in
public schools, said the Federation de L'Education Nationale.
</P>
<P>
About 34-35 percent of post and telecommunication workers
participated in the strike today, while 38 percent of the staff of
the Bank of France stopped working today, according to the unions.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations participated by tens of thousands of people were
held in Paris and several major cities, with demonstrators calling
for the defense of public employment, raise of salaries and
canceling of the 1997 austerity budget which plans to lay off
about 6,000 public employees.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac today called on the ruling rightwing
majority to maintain solidarity with the government to help
overcome the present social crisis, partially caused by the
austerity plan aimed at joining the European Monetary Union in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister and the Mayor of Lyon Raymond Barre today
encouraged Prime Minister Juppe to "hold on" and " go even
further" in his social and economic reform programs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the secretary general of the Confederation General
du Travail Louis Viannet today warned the government of a social
movement "even stronger than in 1995" if the government does not
make compromises in its social and economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The Force Ouvriere also said today that if the government does
not answer the demand of public employees, "the mobilization will
continue."
</P>
<P>
The national secretary of the French Communist Party Robert Hue
also expressed "his total solidarity" with public employees.
</P>
<P>
In another development, several unions of private doctors also
launched a strike today, but most of public hospitals functioned
normal, as the participation rate by the staff of public hospitals
was 14-25 percent in different areas.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Service said that the participation rate
of today's strike is 32.35 percent, against 57 percent in the
nationwide strike on October 10, 1995.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Parliament Denounces Killing of Greek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' 56-member House of
Representatives today strongly denounced the killing of an
unarmed Greek Cypriot Sunday and observed a one-minute silence
in memory of the 58-year-old victim Petros Kakoulli.
</P>
<P>
Kakoulli, a retired fireman, was said to stray a few meters
into the Turkish-controlled northern area, near the British base
area of Dhekilia, in the island's south-eastern part, while
collecting snails with his son-in-law Panikos Hadjiathanasiou.
</P>
<P>
Turkish soldiers opened fire against Kakoulli although he had
raised his hands up, according to eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the weekly plenary session of the House of
Representatives today, House President Spyros Kyprianou said that
this act increases the responsibility of all those who want to
contribute decisively to a just and viable solution to the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He added, "I make it clear to every direction that such
brutal murders do not discourage our people in their struggle to
secure their rights but, on the contrary, they strengthen their
determination, with patience and insistence, to carry on this
struggle."
</P>
<P>
Kakoulli was the fourth Greek Cypriot to have been killed in
the last four months. The first three killings took place in the
U.N.-controlled buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The 180-kilometer-long buffer zone across the island, which
separates the island into two parts, is patrolled by a
1,200-strong United Nations Peace-Keeping Force.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
take control of the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akber said
that officials of northern Cyprus were carrying out an
investigation into the death of the Greek Cypriot.
</P>
<P>
He added, "It is obvious that the provocative attitudes of the
Greek Cypriot side on the island were effective in the saddening
incident."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Sweden Sign Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Sweden
today signed an aid agreement in which the Swedish government
pledged to provide 821 million Swedish Kroner (about 114 million
US Dollars) for development projects in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Cape Town by visiting Swedish
Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen and South Africa's Deputy
Finance Minister Gill Marcus, said a source reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Hjelm-Wallen arrived in South Africa on Wednesday for an
official three-day visit. He said the Swedish government had for
many years supported South Africa's liberation struggle against
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 million US Dollars had been provided to the people
engaged in the struggle, and not even the Swedish public had been
informed about this, she said.
</P>
<P>
Hjelm-Wallen said she hoped the South African government and
people consider her visit as a confirmation of the very good
bilateral ties between the two countries, adding, "We are happy
for the new South Africa and we are happy about what we had in
common during the struggle."
</P>
<P>
The investigation into the assassination of Swedish Prime
Minister Olaf Palme had also been mentioned during the talks, and
South African authorities were giving Swedish investigators their
full cooperation, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Early reports claimed that South Africa was allegedly involved
in the assassination of Palme in 1986.
</P>
<P>
However, Hjelm-Wallen declined to elaborate on the issue,
saying the matter was being dealt with by the police.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also issued a joint statement committing
themselves to ridding the world of weapons of mass destruction
and stemming the proliferation of conventional weapons, added the
source.

<HEADLINE> War Prisoners Released in Somaliland of Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 17 (Xinhua)-- Seventyseven prisoners of war
were released early this week by Somalia's Garhajis clan which is
fighting against Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal, the self-styled
President of the breakaway "Republic of Somaliland".
</P>
<P>
The release of the prisoners followed an agreement signed by
the Garhajis clan and the Habar Jelo clan supporting Egal last
week in Ber Village near Buro in northern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Garhajis clan, Muhumad Ow-Ahmed, called
Egal to take the same initiative and release the prisoners he is
holding in Hargeisa City.
</P>
<P>
Ow-Ahmed told reporters today that they will release more
prisoners if Egal responds accordingly.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Side Accepts UN Proposal on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has accepted a U.N. Peace-Keeping Force (UNFICYP)
proposal for an indirect military dialogue between the island's
armed forces National Guard and the Turkish army.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides revealed this here
today at his daily press briefing when asked to comment on a
UNFICYP statement issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The UNFICYP in its statement called for the extension of the
1989 unmanning agreement following the recent killings of unarmed
Greek Cypriots at or near the U.N.-controlled buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The statement also stressed the need for arrangements which
ensure that such tragic incidents do not recur.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said that the government has expressed its
readiness for such a dialogue. However, the Turkish side has not
yet answered to the UNFICYP proposal, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the issue was discussed during the
meetings between President Clerides and visiting British
representative for Cyprus Sir David Hannay.
</P>
<P>
The proposed indirect military dialogue would deal with
issues such as an extension of the unmanning agreement, which was
reached by the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides in 1989, as well
as the prohibition of loaded weapons along the cease-fire lines
and the 180-kilometer U.N. buffer zone across the island.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. proposal came after the failure to realize an earlier
proposal made by U.S. permanent representative to the
U.N. Madeleine Albright during her visit to Cyprus last July.
</P>
<P>
Albright had proposed a direct military dialogue between the
commanders of the National Guard and the Turkish forces in the
presence of UNFICYP Commander. However, the proposal was not
realized due to the insistence of the Turkish side on the
participation of the Commander of the Turkish Cypriot forces.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey militarily
intervened following an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained more than 30,000 troops in the northern
part of this Eastern Mediterranean island since 1974.

<HEADLINE> Cairo Economic Conference to Attract 2,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The third Middle East and North
Africa economic conference, which is to convene here on November
12-14, is expected to attract 2,500 businessmen from about 1,200
companies despite the many difficulties the Mideast peace process
is facing.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which was originally an economic summit, is
intended to add "a business dimension" into the peace process by
presenting a showcase of the Middle East economy and promote
cross-border business cooperation, Gregory Blatt, a
representative of the World Economic Forum (WEF), told reporters
during a press conference held here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government has invited high-level officials from
87 countries and heads of 47 regional and international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18 countries have reportedly confirmed their
participation at a ministerial meeting and more than 600
international companies said they will come to the conference.
</P>
<P>
So far, Canada, the U.S., Japan, Britain, Germany, South Korea
and central and eastern European countries have shown utmost
support, according to Blatt.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Secretary of
Trade Micky Cantor will head a large business delegation to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Blatt said Egypt also invited African countries, which were
not represented in the previous Middle East and North Africa
economic conferences, in an attempt to strengthen their
involvement in the regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The objective is for "participants to forge real business
partnerships at the conference," he said, noting that the quality
and level of business participation was consistent with that of
last year's summit in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official said the Israeli representation could
be "no more, no less," just as when the conference was initiated
in Casablanca in October 1994 and convened in Amman in 1995.
About 50 Israeli companies attended the Amman economic conference.
</P>
<P>
But he did not confirm whether they will come or not in
November, regarding the bleak prospects for any immediate
breakthrough in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian negotiations held
in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Egypt proposed to postpone the conference until next
autumn because of "changes in the political climate" since the
hardline Likud party's victory in the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
But it changed its proposal when it found the conference's
positive results would outweigh its negative aspects, according
to Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Ahmed Abu el-Kheir.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 economic conference, which will last three days, will
focus on developing infrastructure, attracting international
capital for investment projects in the region and encouraging
industrial and commercial development, said Abu el-Kheir
Wednesday, who is also the general coordinator for the conference.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo conference aims to promote a regional development
process integrating the countries of the Middle East and North
Africa into an economic community, in parallel with the Mideast
peace process under way.
</P>
<P>
It is an initiative of the WEF, an international membership
organization, which groups 1,000 important global corporations.

<HEADLINE> Perry Call on Russian Lawmakers to Ratify START-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry called on Russian lawmakers here today to ratify the START-2
treaty as soon as possible, trying to dispel Moscow's concern over
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) eastward
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the State Duma, the lower house of Russian
parliament, Perry said: "The United States does not regard Russia
as a threat to itself. We must work together."
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. defense chief in the Duma, some Russian
lawmakers expressed serious concern over NATO's eastward
enlargement plans and efforts.
</P>
<P>
In response, Perry sought to dispel the lawmakers' doubts and
called on them to ratify the START-2 strategic arms reduction
treaty, as had been done by the U.S. Congress. He stressed that a
decision to this effect would reduce the risk of nuclear disaster
and bring the two great powers still closer together along the
road of friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the staff and students of the Military Academy
of the Russian General Staff on the same day, Perry said Russia
remains a major nuclear power with global strategic interests, and
it must play a role in NATO.
</P>
<P>
The NATO wants Russia to be full-fledged partner in ensuring
European security, he added.
</P>
<P>
As concerns NATO expansion towards the East, the Pentagon chief
stressed that "NATO is open to new democracies wishing to join
it." The process would enlarge the circle of security in Europe
and will not threaten Russia's security.
</P>
<P>
Asked about prospects for Russia to become a member of the
NATO, Perry said "NATO is open to democratic countries of Europe
and Russia is one of these countries."
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the need for making changes to the Agreement
on Conventional Forces in Europe following the geopolitical and
geostrategic changes that have occurred in Europe since the time
of its signing.
</P>
<P>
Perry expressed confidence that as soon as the START-2 treaty
was ratified by the Russian lawmakers, its implementation will
precede parallel to the drawing up of a START-3 agreement on
further cuts in the national nuclear potentials of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Following the addresses, the U.S. defense chief also met with
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The Russian premier
told Perry that many people in Russia see the ratification of the
START-2 treaty as linked up to the extension of the NATO eastern
borders.
</P>
<P>
Perry held talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Rodionov
on Wednesday soon after his arrival in Moscow for an official
visit.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today vowed to continue the government's fight
against poverty.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement to mark the United Nations'
International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, Mandela said
although South Africa was said to be a middle-income country,
many people are still lived in very poor conditions.

short-term measures such as providing food and medical reliefs to
the poor people and long-term measures such as improving the
infrastructure.

"For millions of people, change has begun in ways that make a
real impact on their daily lives," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the President appealed to all works of life in the

<HEADLINE> Lebed Says He Will Run for Presidency in Next Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Dismissed Russian national
security chief Alexander Lebed said tonight that he would continue
his political activity and run in the next presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, who was speaking at a news conference two hours after he
was removed from his posts of Security Council Secretary and the
president's national security assistant by president Boris
Yeltsin, blamed presidential chief of Staff Anatoly Chubais for
his ouster.
</P>
<P>
"I shall prepare for possible future presidential elections,"
Lebed stated.
</P>
<P>
He ran the third, only after Yeltsin and Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov, in winning votes during the presidential
elections held in Russia last Summer. His support played a big
role in Yeltsin's victory over Zyuganov in the elections. For
exchange, Yeltsin named Lebed as national security chief and
indicated he may become his successor.
</P>
<P>
The former paratroop general said he would first sleep well
after the dismissal and would then "begin streamlining the
political structure."
</P>
<P>
He said his ouster was organized by Chubais because "I was in
his way."
</P>
<P>
He said he had not been invited to the meeting between Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the so-called "power ministers"
earlier today where accusations of Interior Minister Anatoly
Kulikov against him were discussed.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov, speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, accused
Lebed of planning a military coup to seize power.
</P>
<P>
Lebed told reporters that he had difficulties in getting to
today's meeting and was allowed in only after he had personally
contacted Chernomyrdin. However, the meeting lasted for only five
minutes after he came.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he requested a personal meeting with Yeltsin
after that meeting. However, there was no reply, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lebed said he did not regret having to vacate the office as the
Security Council secretary and the President's national security
adviser, but admitted that he felt sorry about the post of the
president's special envoy in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was confident that "the pivot of war in
Chechnya has been broken" and that "a bloody orgy" would not be
allowed to resume again.
</P>
<P>
Along with this, Lebed said his dismissal from the Chechen
affairs would "affect the overall situation in the republic
negatively," because 75 percent of the population of Chechnya have
trust in him personally.
</P>
<P>
During his news conference Lebed repeatedly said that he would
do everything in his power not to allow war in Chechnya to
continue and to direct relations between Russia and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization "into a civilized channel."
</P>
<P>
Explaining his decision to dismiss Lebed in a TV address to the
nation this evening, Yeltsin said the former general had committed
a number of "inadmissible errors to the detriment of Russia."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this dismissal, Chernomyrdin said there was
nothing unexpected. "It was clear that something untoward was
happening in the government of the country: it is not proper for
one team to carry out work in different directions."

ATHENS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek police in the northern
Greek town of Serres said today that they had snared the "big
fish" in a flourishing cross-border trade in young woman,
following the arrest of a Bulgarian man near a Greek-Bulgarian
border post.
</P>
<P>
Stotsef Iliev, 24, is believed to be the mastermind behind a
ring importing young women from the Balkan and former Soviet Union
states.
</P>
<P>
"We have been chasing the young Bulgarian for two years,"
Serres police chief Constantine Sotiriou said. "We were aware
that Iliev was importing young foreign women into Greece and
'selling' them for between 1,000 and 2,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sotiriou said Greek and Bulgarian police cooperated to set a
trap for Iliev near the Promahonas border post.
</P>
<P>
Also arrested were Iliev's Greek accomplice Vassilis Ioannidis,
56, and three young Bulgarian women.
</P>
<P>
Greek police authorities said Iliev had brought more than 150
young women into Greece in the past two years, assisted by an
accomplice identified only as "Valentino".
</P>
<P>
The women, some of them as young as 17 and without any travel
papers, were destined for work as hostesses in nightclubs in
Athens, Salonika and other major urban centers.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
who is seeking a second term, and Republican nominee Bob Dole both
searched for votes in Southern California after Wednesday's final
debate.
</P>
<P>
Dole today criticized Clinton and Clinton defended his
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Dole accused Clinton of a "pattern of California neglect" by
first ignoring and then delaying federal money to states,
including California, "for the cost of incarcerating illegal
immigrants," according to an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
Clinton released a new ad featuring former Reagan spokesman
James Brady praising the president for signing a bill requiring
background checks for handgun purchases. "When I hear people
question the president's character, I say look what he's done,"
said Brady, who was wounded during an assassination attempt on
President Reagan in 1981.
</P>
<P>
At a rally in the Republican bastion of Orange County, Clinton
said,"There has never been a partnership between the national
government and the people of any state like the one we have forged
over the last four years."
</P>
<P>
"We need not say bad things about our opponents," he said in
Santa Ana, Calif. "We just have different views."
</P>
<P>
Dole campaigned today in Riverside, Calif., an area which often
votes Republican, pledging an "all-out" battle for California's 54
electoral votes. Dole told reporters that internal polls suggested
it was an "eight-point race."
</P>
<P>
In later appearances, Dole was expected to call for stronger
action against illegal immigration and stress support for a
California referendum to end state affirmative action programs.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Welcomes Visit by UN Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
voiced welcome to the forthcoming visit to Khartoum by a United
Nations envoy to work out a report about Sudan's collaboration in
implementing a U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to newsmen today, the Sudanese Undersecretary
for Foreign Affairs Ali Nemeiri said that Sudan welcomed the
visit by Lakhdar Ibrahimi, personal envoy of U.N. Secretary
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that he was drafting a detailed report on the
steps taken by Sudan with regard to the U.N. Security Council
resolution 1070.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 1070 was issued on August 16 to give Sudan 90 days
to hand over the three suspects involved in the assassination
attempt against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June last
year, or lose air links.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese official anticipated that the facts and data to
be submitted to Ibrahimi would have positive impact on the issue.
</P>

<HEADLINE> France Stresses Support of Lebanon's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 17 (Xinhua) -- France stressed today its
support of Lebanon's reconstruction, which was launched by Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri some four years ago, hoping that "the
reconstruction process will not stop" under whatever
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Lafon, French ambassador to Lebanon, held today a
meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz in the
latter's office.
</P>
<P>
Lafon announced that the 90-minute meeting with the Lebanese
foreign minister focused on a visit of French President Jacques
Chirac to Lebanon scheduled for October 24.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's visit to Beirut comes in the framework of his Middle
East tour, which also includes Syria, Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas, Jordan and Egypt, the French diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The French president "wants to demonstrate his special care
over Lebanon especially in this stage, and hopes that Lebanon
will not become a victim of the shocks taking place in the
region," the French envoy noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the French president will arrive in Beirut from
Amman and will spend some 20 hours in the Lebanese capital before
leaving for Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Lafon underlined his country's support of "a continuity of
Lebanon's reconstruction process after 17 years of fightings," a
reference to Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the reconstruction process in Lebanon does not
stop no matter what the situation in the region is, especially
since Lebanon has suffered so much from the military
confrontations which have caused big pains in its economy," the
French diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, France is standing on Lebanon's side in
carrying on the reconstruction process, and this is the clear and
definite position of France's diplomacy," he added.
</P>
<P>
"President Chirac's second visit to Lebanon in six months
should come within this framework," the French ambassador
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers noted that Chirac's visit to Lebanon
coincides with consultations among Lebanese leading politicians
for the formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
The billionaire-turned Prime Minister Hariri and his
government resigned Tuesday to make way for a new cabinet in
compliance with the constitution because the four-year-mandate of
the last parliament expired on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, who has the constitutional
right to name the prime minister, is expected to start
consultations on the new government's formation when the next
parliament opens on October 22.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Hrawi asked the government of Hariri, a Moslem
Sunni, to continue its official function in a "caretaker
capacity" until the new government is born.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, the mastermind of Lebanon's ambitious reconstruction
scheme, won a seat in the 128-seat parliament in the general
elections in August and September and is heading one of the
biggest blocs in the house.
</P>
<P>
The victory has made Hariri the most favored candidate for the
premiership.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's constitution says the president must be a Maronite
catholic, the house speaker a Moslem Shiite and the prime
minister a Moslem Sunni.

<HEADLINE> Kenya To Pay Ugandan Power at Current Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will pay electricity
imported from Uganda at the current market price, Kenyan
president Daniel arap Moi said here today.
</P>
<P>
And Kenya will pay for power received during day time, but not
for that received later than six in the evening, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya did not need to import electricity at night, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
President Moi made the remarks to thousands of people at his
Harambee House office here.
</P>
<P>
On October 14, Ugandan President Yoweri Museweni said at a
press conference in Kampala that his government would raise the
price of electricity sold to neighbouring Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed during the British colonial rule,
no provision is made for a review of Uganda's electricity price
until the year of 2004.
</P>
<P>
But it is the fact that Kenya has been buying Uganda's
electricity at a price of two U.S. Cents while the latter
produces a unit of electricity at the cost of six U.S. Cents.
</P>
<P>
So, the Ugandan President called for a renegotiation of the
deal by the two governments to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The two governments are reportedly holding talks on the issue
of price-raising for Kenya's 30 megawatts import of electricity.

capacity of each dam varies from 190,000 to 500,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>

<P>
BELGRADE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Serb and Croat members of
the three-men Bosnian presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik and Kresimir
Zubak, held talks in the Serb capital of Pale today on how to
overcome the crisis in constituting the joint bodies in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"What is encouraging is that all the three members of the
presidency have the desire to surmount the crisis and make the
joint bodies function," the Tanjug news agency quoted Krajisnik as
saying after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik stressed that, for the joint bodies to be
constituted, it was necessary to create prerequisites based on the
equality of both entities and all the three ethnic groups, the
Serb, Croat and Muslim, in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural session of the tripartite Bosnian Presidency and
the House of Representatives of the Bosnian Parliament was held on
October 5 in Sarajevo. But the Serb representatives boycotted the
conference due to "security reasons," thus causing a crisis in the
joint institutions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the international community, the Serb
leadership has recently expressed its readiness to attend the next
session of the joint parliament which could be convened next
month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zubak told reporters in Pale that fair prospects
existed to overcome the crisis in constituting the joint bodies.
</P>
<P>
He said that before his talks with Krajisnik, he had exchanged
information with the president of the collective presidency, the
Muslim Alija Izetbegovic.
</P>
<P>
"We have brought the position closer together, and the joint
bodies could be expected to be constituted soon," Zubak said.

<HEADLINE> Irish Minister to Visit Russia Over Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Irish Agriculture Minister Ivan
Yates is planning a visit to Moscow to overturn Russia's ban on
beef exports from three Irish counties because of concern over BSE
or the mad cow disease, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
In an agreement signed with Russia Tuesday, the Irish
government agreed to stop exporting beef products from the Irish
counties of Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan to Russia from November 1
as Russia, Ireland's biggest single beef export market, had
threatened a complete ban on Irish beef products.
</P>
<P>
Yates told the Irish parliament earlier today, "The decision
was taken with the greatest reluctance. However, the stark choice
we were facing was the closure of the Russian market to all Irish
beef or the exclusion of three counties on a temporary basis."
</P>
<P>
The agreement has provoked widespread fury among Irish farmers,
who said it would damage international confidence in Irish beef
and encourage other countries to introduce similar selective bans.
</P>
<P>
Irish Farmers Association President John Donnelly said today
that immediate political action was needed in a bid to restore
international confidence in Irish beef.
</P>
<P>
"Government policy on beef is now in tatters and the concession
that Minister Yates made to the Russians does untold damage," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ireland has said its beef is safe to eat and the government has
strict policies to deal with the mad cow disease.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Negotiations Resume in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian and Israeli
delegations resumed talks in the Egyptian resort of Taba this
evening with the participation of U.S. Middle East peace
coordinator Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
There have been conflicting statements from the two sides
about the outcome of their previous rounds of talks. Israeli
officials expressed optimism that agreement with the Palestinians
was near, while the Palestinian side made pessimistic statements.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said today that the
Palestinian side is willing to forge ahead in the negotiations
until the agreement signed with Israel on September 28, 1995 is
put into effect.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Palestinians were to expand its
self-rule in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation is not negotiating a new agreement
or introducing amendments, instead they are negotiating mechanism
to implement the signed accord, Erekat was quoted by Egypt's news
agency MENA as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If no agreement is reached, the peace process would
collapse," he said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said the Palestinians do not wish to enter a circle of
violence and counter-violence, adding that they are determined to
give all possible chances for the negotiations to succeed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli chief negotiator Dan Shamron said that the
ongoing talks are very important and the two sides are keen on
reaching solutions to some of the 34 outstanding issues
concerning the implementation of the accord on expanding
Palestinian self-rule, which is also called the Oslo 2 Agreement.
</P>
<P>
In statements carried by MENA, the Israeli negotiator
expressed optimism over the possibility of reaching a solution to
the issue of Hebron, the last West Bank town still under the
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinian side did not request discussion
of all the 34 issues at the talks.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing negotiations center only on the redeployment of
the Israeli forces in Hebron, he said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators met in Taba Wednesday for three hours in an
overnight session. Talks resumed just before noon today and was
adjourned this afternoon before the new session of talks began
this evening.

MOSCOW, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma, or lower
house of the parliament, today approved a resolution calling for
ensuring a constitutional order and security in Russia following
the dismissal of national security chief Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, which was unanimously approved by the 339

concern over "the dangerous character of the latest developments
in the country" in the wake of a power struggle in the Kremlin.

in the Kremlin on Thursday, accusing him of making serious
mistakes "unacceptable for Russia".

Denouncing any attempt to resolve problems of state power by
non-constitutional means, the Duma deputies recommended Yeltsin to
ensure the fulfillment by the government of its constitutional
duties connected with the management of the country.
</P>
<P>
They urged Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to take
comprehensive measures to stabilize political and public life in
the country and ensure the strict implementation of the
constitution by all ministries and departments.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also demanded that Prosecutor-General Yuri
Skuratov urgently give a legal evaluation of the actions of top
Kremlin officials that may entail a threat to national security or
destabilize Russia's statehood.
</P>
<P>
They also proposed that Yeltsin discuss "pressing problems"
regarding constitutional law and order, control and security in
the country with parliament leaders in the near future.

<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Construction of an integrated
services digital network, or ISDN, a key technology project for
the information superhighway in Guangdong, Beijing and Shanghai,
is being stepped up.
</P>
<P>
A broad-band experimental network consisting of servers,
asychronous transfer mode (ATM), and customer terminals in south
China's Guangdong Province is under construction and will be
completed at the end of 1997, and narrow-band ISDN for business
will be in operation by then in several major Chinese cities and
southeastern coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
At the 18th conference of the Asian ISDN Council today, Zhou
Huan, director of science and technology at the Ministry of Post
and Telecommunications, said that China has built 113,000
kilometers of trunk lines of optical fibre cable, and 300,000
kilometers, if provincial and local networks are included.
</P>
<P>
China has built nearly 60,000 kilometers of digital microwave
lines and 20 satellite earth stations, providing a solid
foundation for ISDN technology.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said he estimates that the penetration rate of ISDN will
reach 1.5 percent by the year 2000 with 100,000 to 130,000
channels.
</P>
<P>
The Asian ISDN Council, a regional technological organization
established in 1988, has 79 member organizations in eight
countries such as China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Republic
of Korea, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> HK Land Fund Achieves Good Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The operation of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government Land Fund was
normal and good results were achieved during the 1995-96 fiscal
year, the trustees of the Land Fund announced at a press briefing
here today.
</P>
<P>
Chen Rongchun, Chinese senior representative to the
Sino-British Land Commission, said that by March 31, 1996, the net
assets of the Land Fund had amounted to 111.2 billion HK dollars
(14.26 billion U.S. dollars). The figure represents an increase of
26.28 billion HK dollars (3.37 billion U.S. dollars) or 31 percent
over the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that on March 31 this year, the accumulated land
premium income received from the British Hong Kong government over
the past 10 years was 85.7 billion HK dollars (10.98 billion U.S.
dollars), while the accumulated investment surplus was 25.5
billion HK dollars (3.27 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The trustees reiterated that the primary objectives of the
investments undertaken by the Land Fund are to ensure the
preservation of capital and avoid causing an adverse effect on the
stability of Hong Kong's monetary system and, subject to these
objectives, to maximize the overall investment returns.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that according to the Declaration of Trust of the
Land Fund, after 1997 all the assets of the Land Fund will be
transferred to the future SAR government.
</P>
<P>
Following the press briefing was a reception to mark the 10th
anniversary of the founding of the Land Fund.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the reception, Zhou Nan, director of the Xinhua
News Agency Hong Kong Branch, attributed the fund's success to
careful management by the trustees on the authorization of the
central government and the joint efforts of all members of the
Investment Committee and the Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The Land Fund has not only maintained safely but also increased
the value of its assets beyond the predicted target by
diversifying investments, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"You have lived up to the expectations of the central
government and the trust of Hong Kong compatriots by doing a good
job for Hong Kong residents and the future SAR government," Zhou
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in the past 10 years, the trustees have
devoted all their efforts to the careful management and operations
of the Land Fund, from which they have never taken even a single
cent as pay. The trustees' salaries and the cost of the fund's
operations both come from the central government.
</P>
<P>
"This has fully demonstrated that the Chinese government does
not seek any self-interest on the question of Hong Kong. Instead,
it has taken into account whole-heartedly the interests of Hong
Kong residents and safeguarded sincerely the economic rights and
interests of the future SAR government," he stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Unseeded Tamarine Tanasugarn of
Thailand shattered top seed Linda Wild's title-defending hope
while Chen Li became the first Chinese to enter the Nokia Open
quarter-finals Friday by crashing second seed Yayuk Basuki.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Tanasugarn, coached by her father, upset
American world No. 32 Wild 6-2, 6-2 to gain a semi-finals berth.
</P>
<P>
"I greatly appreciate the match," said Tanasugarn, who broke
Wild five times in the one hour 17 minutes match.
</P>
<P>
"I can return her serve though she served high and tough and
that's important. I just want to play my best every match."
</P>
<P>
Said Wild: "It's her day today."
</P>
<P>
Chen Li, the world No. 213, broke Basuki three times each set
to take a overwhelming 6-2, 6-2 win.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Chen controlled the match with her baseline
play which forced the Indonesian world No. 32 Basuki into errors.
</P>
<P>
"She can't return my serve well because I'm left-handed," Chen
said. "But I return hers well."
</P>
<P>
Chen defeated Basuki in their only other meet eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Chen plays well today. But it's my worst match in these days,"
Basuki said.
</P>
<P>
In other matches, third seed Sandrine Testud of France
outplayed Japanese sixth seed Mana Endo, 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, in one

<HEADLINE> 2 SLA Men Killed in S. Lebanon in Roadside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Two South Lebanese Army
(SLA) soldiers were killed and two others badly wounded today in
the blast of a roadside bomb planted by Hezbollah guerrillas in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded early this morning when a patrol squad of
the Israeli client SLA passed the road in the central section of
Israel's self-claimed "security zone." In the Lebanese capital
of Beirut, Hezbollah, or the Party of God, claimed
responsibility for planting the bomb.
</P>
<P>
The wounded soldiers were rushed to Israel for treatment,
and Israeli and the SLA retaliated with artillery shelling on
Hezbollah targets. There were no reports of damage and
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Fighting also broke out in the security zone Wednesday with
two separate long-range mortar attacks on SLA positions by
Hezbollah, but no casualty or damage was reported.
</P>
<P>
The long-range attacks by Hezbollah have become an almost
dayly occurrence in the past few weeks, Israeli sources
 said.
</P>
<P>
The five-nation monitoring committee grouping the United
States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel on the cease-fire
established after Israel's Operation Grapes of Wrath in April
convened in Nagoura of south Lebanon Wednesday to discuss
Lebanon's complaint over Israel's shelling of civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Israel shelled houses in Safedal-Battikh village,
wounding 12 civilians, four of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened during an exchange of fire with
Hezbollah gunmen, after the latter fired mortars at Israeli
soldiers in Barasheet region in the western sector of the
security strip.
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the Israeli Army chief of staff, however,
concluded that Israel was cleared of responsibility over the
shelling, because its soldiers "acted correctly and with
restraint."
</P>
<P>
The report said Israeli soldiers first fired warning shots
after the attacks by Hezbollah gunmen operating in populated
areas. They only retaliated with artillery shelling half an hour
later as Hezbollah forces ignored the warning and continued
their mortar attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
said here today that he believes Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual's current visit will further promote Sino-Algerian
friendly cooperation in various areas.
</P>
<P>
During their talks this afternoon, Zhu extended his warm
welcome to Zeroual, who is visiting China for the first time. He
also conveyed the regards of Premier Li Peng, who is currently not
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, there has been a traditional friendship
between the peoples of China and Algeria. And since the two sides
forged diplomatic relations 38 years ago, bilateral relations have
enjoyed a smooth development, with successful cooperations in many
fields.
</P>
<P>
The two countries share general consensus on major
international issues, always supporting each other, Zhu noted,
adding that the Chinese government appreciates the Algerian
government's policy of supporting "one China."
</P>
<P>
The vice premier said that successful and effective
cooperations have occurred between China and Algeria in trade and
economic spheres for a long time, which promise great potential
for bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said China wishes to work with Algeria to put the agreements
reached between them into practice, and to seek new channels for
cooperation in order to promote broader exchanges among
enterprises of both countries, which would lead to a new level of
mutually-beneficial cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Zeroual said one of the main purposes of his current China
visit is to develop an all-round trade and economic relationship
with China, and that Algeria has closely watched China's economic
reform and its achievements in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rapid economic development in China
illustrates the great potential in its economy, which has laid a
good foundation for bilateral cooperation in trade and economic
areas.
</P>
<P>
Zeroual noted the Algerian and Chinese economies are
complementary in some ways, and the two countries also have
something in common in the realm of economic reforms. Algeria
wishes to draw experiences from China and to continue exchanges
with China, he said, stressing that he was optimistic with the
prospects for trade and economic exchanges between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Zeroual, the first Algerian President to visit China in 14
years, arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a five-day state visit,
as the guest of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.

<HEADLINE> Cerebral Hemorrhages Costing China A Lot, Experts Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- China has more than five
million people suffering from cerebral hemorrhages caused by
hypertension, and the number is growing at a rate of 1.5 million
per year.
</P>
<P>
Some one million people die of the disease every year,
according to a recent report of
Shanghai's "Wen Hui Bao", and the cost to China in terms
of health care and lost labor, could be more than ten billion yuan
(about 1.2 billion US dollars) annually, the daily added.
</P>
<P>
The number of hypertension patients has reached 100 million,
across the country. Cerebro vascular and cardiovascular diseases
became the biggest killers, particularly among urban residents,
after the 1960s, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Only a few people know whether their blood pressure figures
are normal," said Prof. Yao Jingli, "and most hypertension
patients can't get correct treatment."
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's most populous city, incidence of
hypertension increased by 84.18 percent over the past 32 years,
the paper quoted Prof. Yao, who is in charge of cerebrovascular
disease control in Shanghai, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the high incidence to people's lifestyle, which
includes eating too much salt, smoking, and the increased pressure
of a busy life.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian, Israeli Negotiators Make Conflicting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators made conflicting statements about the outcome of their
talks held overnight Thursday in the Israeli Red Sea resort town
of Eilat.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Israeli side said all issues pertaining to
the redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron
had been solved except for a buffer zone, Israel's right to
chase suspects and civil affairs, Egypt's news agency MENA
reported.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian negotiating team denied that tangible
progress had been achieved in the talks, which moved from the
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba to neighboring Eilat late Thursday
night and lasted over three hours until 2:00 a.m.local time
(00:00 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Asfour, Palestinian coordinator of the negotiations, was
quoted by the MENA as saying that differences within the Israeli team
had led the talks to a "deadlock."
</P>
<P>
"We went to Eilat but Israeli differences prevented us even
from sitting with them in Eilat," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The MENA said that the Palestinians had requested that in case an
agreement was reached over the issue of Hebron, a date should be
set for starting the final-status negotiations. But the Israelis
had failed to respond to this, the Egyptian agency added.
</P>
<P>
It also quoted an unnamed Israeli source as saying that both the
Israelis and Palestinians wanted to reach a solution as they did
not want the situation to explode.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which have centered on Israel's withdrawal from
Hebron, the last West Bank town still under the Israeli
occupation, resumed this morning in Taba with the participation of
U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross.

NEW YORK, October 17 (Xinhua) -- FIFA postponed a World Cup

<HEADLINE> Hypnotism Experiment on Obesity Gets Good Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Hypnotism has become a
successful experiment to rid extra fat in obese men and women in
Kuwait, a specialist said here today.
</P>
<P>
Kazen Abul, a social worker in close contact with the
experiment in the country, told Kuwait News Agency that
"hypnotherapy of obesity has made an unprecedented success in
Kuwait. The number of people coming to clinics for this
particular treatment is on the rise."
</P>
<P>
He said up to 700 obese people were satisfied with the
results of hypnotherapy.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has a large percentage of obesity cases among its
700,000 citizens, especially women, because of less activities
and unrational food structure.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has started this medical experiment on obesity cases
recently. So far it is the third Arab country that has been using
this method after Egypt and Lebanon which have been applying the
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Abul said there was no side effects arising from this method,
adding that even international-recognized psychiatrics applies
this therapy in many cases like anxiety and depression.
</P>
<P>
Hypnotism has become the most successful treatment of people
suffering from psychological illness like fear, anxiety, and it
has been used on people suffering from obesity and even on drug
addicts, he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of sessions patients need in hypnotism treatment
depends on how complex the case is, and easier cases take only
several weeks to get satisfied curative results, according to
the specialist.

<HEADLINE> Lebed Successor May Be Named Next Week: Russian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin today said a new national security chief may be named
next week to replace Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news service quoted Chernomyrdin as saying
President Boris Yeltsin was already considering candidates for the
post and could name a successor "perhaps next week".
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin dismissed the ex-army general from the head of the
national security council to subdue a squabbling between Lebed and
Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov on the fall of Chechnya's
capital city Grozny in August.
</P>
<P>
Lebed later negotiated the Khasavyurt peace accord which was
signed on August 31, bringing an end to the 21 months of fighting
which killed some 100,000 people in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov blamed Lebed's part in the negotiation process as "high
treason" while Lebed refuted that the interior minister and four
other senior officials were responsible for the fall of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The Russian prime minister said the national security council
will continue its "strategic leadership" of the Russian policy on
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Interfax also said that Lebed may still serve as Russia's envoy
to Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Hot Topic For Ordinary Shanghai Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 18 (Xinhua)-- Families in Shanghai are
speaking the language of the city's financial world.
</P>
<P>
They are becoming familiar with such financial terms as
exchange rates, closing prices and stock trading in the country's
top industrial and financial center.
</P>
<P>
Though families still see bank deposits as the main means of
safe investment, some wiser citizens do not want to put all their
savings and earnings into one place.
</P>
<P>
This was especially so after the central bank twice decreased
interest rates this year. Families feel the need to seek new
investment avenues to reap more returns from their savings and
investments.
</P>
<P>
Families now favor negotiable securities in Shanghai, and with
the optimistic economic situation of China, the stock market is a
hive of business activity, reflecting the improving economic
climate in China.
</P>
<P>
Many citizens also invest their spare money on the stock
market. Raised share prices have stimulated citizen's enthusiasm
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The growing trend has meant that working families have had to
learn expressions and terms usually restricted to people working
in the world of high finance.
</P>
<P>
Treasury bills, with their low risk and stable income, have
drawn investment money, becoming a new investment trend in the
city among ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
With the increase of families' income, and the popularization
of cash-dispensing machines, various credit cards are being used
by ordinary families. Some families keep their own financial
records to maintain a watchful eye on financial trends, and to
gather useful materials.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A scientific advisory body of
the World Health Organization (WHO) today called for the creation
of an international network on health research.
</P>
<P>
The Global Advisory Committee on Health Research (ACHR), the
principal scientific panel for health research matters under the
WHO, made the appeal at the end of its two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The committee said that a health network of institutions and
individuals is necessary in mobilizing technological know-hows and
financial resources much needed to solve global health problems.
</P>
<P>
Such networking is a priority in its preparation for a global
health research agenda for the next century.
</P>
<P>
In a final statement issued after the meeting, the ACHR said
the world is facing unprecedented public health problems, which
will increase greatly within the next quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
Some diseases that have been defeated before are re-emerging
while others have developed resistance to antibiotic drugs and can
no longer be effectively treated, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Previously-unknown diseases continue to emerge. The incidence
of lifestyle-related diseases -- the major source of morbidity and
mortality in developed countries -- is on the rise in developing
countries as well, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Complaints About Advertising on Rise in Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Outdoor posters in Ireland
provoked the greatest number of complaints about advertising in
the past year.
</P>
<P>
Many women said their fear of violence in urban areas was
increased by some advertising posters at bus stops.
</P>
<P>
The Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland (ASAI) said in
a report that what might be acceptable in a fashion magazine "may
evoke entirely different reactions when displayed prominently for
a number of weeks on posters or at bus shelters."
</P>
<P>
The ASAI said it had received 522 complaints in the past 12
months -- a 25-percent increase on the previous year. Outdoor
advertising generated 39 percent of the total complaints while
print media triggered 30 percent. Radio and television accounted
for 14.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ASAI report said while the complaints about advertising
taste and decency attract the greatest media attention, the
advertisements which most frequently generate consumer complaints
are those which mislead or confuse.
</P>
<P>
It also said the increasing use of Internet, a computer
network, as an advertising medium was engaging regulatory bodies
throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
The report said if Internet is to be taken for a credible
advertising medium there will be a need for an effective
regulatory system to ensure advertisements are legal, decent,
honest and truthful as required for other media.
</P>
<P>
However, the nature of the network is such that no single
authority is in a position to establish or enforce specific
standards.
</P>
<P>
"A proliferation of national legislation is unlikely to offer a
solution to this problem," said the ASAI report. "The matter is
being studied by the various interests involved."

their language development, increases fatigue and is a major
factor in maternal deaths.
</P>
<P>
A survey in 1993 showed that 29.4 percent of children and 24.9
percent of mothers in Nigeria suffered from iron deficiency.
</P>
<P>
The program has picked up 500 communities in its pilot
projects. Starting from December, iron and acid tablets will be
distributed to pregnant mothers for IDA control, Fall said.
</P>
<P>
Another intervention strategy the UNICEF is going to take is
food fortification, using flour and wheat, he added.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF has been cooperating with Nigerian government on the
control of iodine deficiency disorders and Vitamin A disorders in the
last three years. Fall said the efforts have been very successful.

<HEADLINE> Thailand May Scrap Tapioca Export Quotas to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry has
offered to lift the quotas on exports of tapioca if local
factories and exporters agree to pay farmers a minimum price for
cassava, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thai Caretaker Commerce Minister Chucheep Harnsawat on Thursday
asked manufacturers to guarantee prices of cassava with 30 percent
starch content at 1.01 baht (4.04 US cents) per kilogram, saying
that he can immediately issue a free-trade policy if they agree
with this condition.
</P>
<P>
The proposal signals that the stock-checking system that has
been used to curb tapioca exports to the European Union for over a
decade might end.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Thailand limited its tapioca exports to the
EU to 21 million tons in four years, with a maximum of 5.5 million
tons in any single year, but local production has been lower to
the quota over the past two years and exporters have been
demanding free trade on the product.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Thailand exported 3.07 million tons of cassava
pellets to the EU, while in the first nine months of this year,
the export volume totaled 2.29 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Production of fresh cassava roots has been forecast at 17.29
million tons, of which 10.12 million tons will be used to produce
4.5 million tons of cassava pellets.
</P>
<P>
Facing higher costs, manufacturers and exporters argued that
the price of fresh cassava roots should be fixed at 0.80-0.85 baht
(3.2-3.4 US cents) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Praprut Trongmetheerat, president of the Northeastern Tapioca
Producers Association, said that eliminating the quota allocation
policy based on past performance will help exporters reduce
storage costs and encourage competition among them.

<HEADLINE> Cease-Fire Monitors Refer Discord to Member States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 18 (Xinhua) -- After failing to reach a
verdict, a multinational cease-fire monitoring committee probing
Lebanon's complaint against Israel has decided to refer their
discord to foreign ministers of the committee's member countries,
Lebanese sources said this morning.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the United States, France, Syria, Lebanon
and Israel, who make up of the committee, ended their fourth
meeting in four days in a southern Lebanese border town at
midnight, the sources in the Lebanese delegation said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in the U.N. peace-keeping forces base in
Nagoura to look into a complaint filed by Lebanon against the
Jewish state over a bombardment by the Israeli occupation forces
at a Lebanese village last Friday, in which 13 civilians were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The five-nation committee, which was set up in line with a
cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon and Israel on
April 26, held its first meeting last Monday to study the
Lebanese complaint.
</P>
<P>
It sent a fact-finding team at Lebanon's request Tuesday to
inspect the village of Safad AL-Batikh targeted by Israeli
artillery in last Friday's violence, to verify the accusation
that Israel used internationally-banned cluster bombs in the
strike.
</P>
<P>
It was the first fact-finding team dispatched by the
committee since its establishment in accordance with the
cease-fire understanding, which put an end to a 17-day Israeli
blitz in south Lebanon in April.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting held from Tuesday to Thursday, the committee
failed to reach a verdict on who was responsible for the
bloodshed due to the "obstacles set by the Israeli delegates,"
the Lebanese sources said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
They said that Lebanon insisted on condemnation of the
Israeli artillery attack on Safad Al-Batikh.
</P>
<P>
Israel said the attack was in response to a rocket  attack by
guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, at
Israel's buffer zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The delegates of the five states agreed to refer the issue to
their foreign ministers according to the committee's statutes,
which says a decision has to be made in 72 hours after a
Lebanese or Israeli complaint is lodged, or it should be referred
to foreign ministers of the committee's member countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the April cease-fire understanding, Israeli and
Hezbollah are committed to ensuring that under no circumstances
will civilians be the target of attacks or will civilian
areas be the launching ground for attacks.
</P>
<P>
But it allows Hezbollah to attack Israeli troops in south
Lebanon and allows Israel "the right of self-defense."
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by guerrillas and air strikes and
bombardments by Israeli occupation forces constitute a
daily scene on the last active battle front of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 850-square kilometer "security zone" in
south Lebanon in 1985 to prevent border-crossing attacks and
trained a 2,500-strong South Lebanon Army militia to patrol
the buffer strip.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace
coordinator Dennis Ross, who is mediating in the ongoing
Palestinian-Israeli talks, met with the chief negotiators from
both sides this morning in an effort to narrow their differences.
</P>
<P>
Ross held talks with Saeb Erekat, head of the Palestinian
delegation, and Dan Shamron, who leads the Israeli team, in
Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba, where the negotiations were to
resume today following discussions Wednesday and Thursday,
according to Egypt's news agency MENA.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations moved to the neighboring Israeli Red Sea
resort of Eilat late Thursday night and lasted until 2:00 a.m.
(00:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
MENA reported late Thursday that Ross had brought a "framework
agreement" to Eilat.
</P>
<P>
But the agency said today that the talks were adjourned early
this morning because of differences within the Israeli negotiating
team. MENA did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations had centered on a redeployment of Israeli
troops in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian officials suggested Thursday that any deal
have to resolve other issues too, including Israel's
withdrawal from rural areas of the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers Stage Sit-in In Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 150 Jewish settlers,
including men, women and children, are currently holding a
sit-in in front of the Israeli Civil Administration in Hebron in
protest against a seemingly imminent army redeployment, according
to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The rally is organized by the militant "Green Women" group
headed by Nadia Mattar from Efrat Settlement.
</P>
<P>
Mattar argued that such a redeployment will create great
danger to Israelis. "Leaving Hebron means leaving Jerusalem, and
thus means the destruction of all Jews."
</P>
<P>
"If we have to fight for the future of Jews, we have to fight
for Hebron first in order to protect Jerusalem," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities is maintaining an intensive military
presence to protect the settlers, and the street of the Civil
Administration has been cordoned off.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators are chanting slogans, reading the Torah and
waving Israeli flags.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Jewish settlers from Kiryat Arba, a major
settlement outside Hebron, attempted to erect a barbed-wire fence
 around a piece of land adjoining the settlement. Palestinian
residents protested against the move in the land which they
claimed belongs to them. The Israeli Civil Administration stopped
the settlers' action.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, seven women groups from the settlements of Hebron
and Kiryat Arba turned down a request by the Knesset Committee on
the Status of Women. The committee is chaired by Labor MK Yael
Dayan, who said Thursday that to the best of her knowledge this
was the first time such a request by a Knesset committee had been
rejected.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Dayan, the women settlers said they were "too
busy and concerned with efforts to protect our lives and the
lives of our children due to the threat that it will be decided
to carry out the Peres-Arafat agreement to withdraw from Hebron,
which is likely to cause a disaster."
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlers from Hebron and settlements nearby believe
that they were staunch Netanyahu supporters during the May 29
elections and, therefore, the rightwing government should do
nothing harmful to them.
</P>
<P>
Some 450 Jewish settlers among 200,000 Palestinians inhabit
in Hebron, the last West Bank town still under the Israeli
occupation.

<P>
LAGOS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has been granted a 256
million dollar loan by the World Bank to rehabilitate major water
projects in all its 36 states, the "Nigerian Tribune" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Water Resources and Rural Development, Alhaji
Aliyu Yelwa said yesterday in Ilorin, capital of the Kwara State
in western Nigeria, that the loan is to help solve the nation's
perennial water shortage and the problem of water-borne diseases.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed Nigeria's water problem to popluation
explosion and poor maintenance of existing water works.
</P>
<P>
Most of Nigeria's water works were built 30 years ago when the
population was minimal. With the sudden growth of population, they
could no longer meet the needs of the people, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Largest Stone Implements Making Site Found in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 18 (Xinhua) -- An ancient site in Inner
Mongolia has been confirmed as the world's largest 'factory' where
cavemen made their tools of stone.
</P>
<P>
The site where stone implements were crafted is in Dayao
village, in the outskirts of Hohhot, capital of Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The site is some 1.7 million square meters in area, and
experts believe that thousands of finished and semi-finished stone
implements were made there in five periods dating from 500,000
years ago to 4,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
It means they were produced in the first and second periods of
palaeolithic age, late period of palaeolithic age, mesolithic age
and neolithic age.
</P>
<P>
Excavation work first started at the site in 1976, after being
jointly launched by Inner Mongolia Museum, Inner Mongolia cultural
relics excavation team, and the archaeology department of Beijing
University.
</P>
<P>
The implements include stone hammers, cores, flakes, scrapers,
pointed implements, and stone chopping tools.
</P>
<P>
Of the stone implements, 70 pieces were made in the early
period of paleolithic age, and another 400 were made in late
paleolithic age. The paleolithic age lasted from 500,000 years ago
to 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The generally accepted time in the world for human beings
starting to make their own stone implements has been put at several
thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Inner Mongolia site was listed in 1988 as one of China's
major historical relics sites to enjoy state-level protection.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Envoy in Liberian for Assessment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi is in Liberia as special envoy of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) to assess the situation in the
war-torn country since ceasefire was signed last August.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi, accompanied by the Guinean foreign minister and the
U.S. special envoy to Liberia, is on the mission as violations of
the peace accord signed by Liberia's warring factions are causing
concern to ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
The regional organization is worried about the killing of
innocent people, mainly women and children, according to Ikimi.
</P>
<P>
A cold-blood massacre by unidentified Liberian militia at the
end of last month claimed about 20 civilian lives in western
Liberia, with many others wounded. The incident has since been
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to note that the various faction leaders and
their followers are yet to completely live up to their
commitments to the peace process that will lead to the return of
normalcy in Liberia," said a statement issued by the west African
peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, which reached here today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting on Thursday in Monrovia, capital of Liberia,
ECOMOG Commander Major-general Victor Malu briefed Ikimi and his
entourage on the state of the Liberian peace process.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued after the briefing said ECOMOG has since
late last August succeeded in ridding Monrovia of arms brought
into the city by the various factions during the April 6
fighting.
</P>
<P>
The arms were recovered through a "cordon and search"
operation conducted every night in different parts of Monrovia by
ECOMOG, and the exercise has yielded excellent result with
strategic areas in the city "searched with impressive results",
it said.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, a general from Nigeria, the force has
intensified confidence patrols into the Liberian hinterland as a
prelude to full deployment of troops and to facilitate
humanitarian assistance to the suffering civilian population in
the interior.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi said the result of his visit would form the basis of the
report to the committee of nine meeting scheduled for early next
month in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Appropriate recommendations will be made to the ECOWAS
Chairman, Nigerian head of state General Sani Abacha, about any
person or group found guilty of the violations, the statement
said.

rights (IPR) has been praised by international IPR circles and
owners of the trade marks, Ou said.
</P>
<P>
The trade mark law implementation organization system has
taken shape in China, with more than 7,000 law implementation
personnel at provincial, prefecture and county levels.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Promises to Advance Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has promised settlement leaders to advance
plans for Jewish settlement expansion in the Palestinian self-rule
territories.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the promise during a meeting with the settlement
 leaders Thursday night. He agreed to specific development
projects in the settlements, including both populating existing
houses kept empty by the previous Labor government, and building
new ones at several sites.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Netanyahu and the settlement leaders was
held after the settlers' council decided a day earlier to hold
large-scale street demonstrations to protest against the
government's inaction on settlement expansion..
</P>
<P>
Nissan Slomiansky, senior member of the Council of Jewish
Communities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, said the council
would put its anti-government protest plans announced earlier
this week on hold because of the commitment given by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"We explained the situation to the prime minister, and he gave
us his word that things would be done. Now, we have to wait and
see if he sticks to what he said," he said.
</P>
<P>
Slomiansky, who spearheaded large right-wing demonstrations
against the Labor government, stressed that "things would start
moving soon." During the May elections in which Netanyahu
defeated Labor's former premier Shimon Peres, most settlers
voted for Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government lifted in August the freeze on
Jewish settlement expansions, and approved several plans to
build thousands of new houses in Jewish settlements in the
territories. The moves aroused strong protests both from the
Palestinians and international community.
</P>
<P>
However, the pace of carrying out the plans was apparently
slowed down by the government under increasing pressure both from
home and outside, leading to the anger of the settlers who decided
to take to the street again.
</P>
<P>
Despite Netanyahu's promises on settlement expansion, the
settlers and several right-wing groups will likely to go ahead
with these protests in order to maiantain pressure. A large
demonstration was planned in Jerusalem at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Kiryat Araba near the volatile town of Hebron,
Jewish settlers and Palestinians nearly clashed Thursday after a
group of radical Jews tried to build a barbed-wire fence around an
undeveloped tract of land which the Palestinians claimed belonged
to them.
</P>
<P>
The clash was prevented only after Israeli soldiers rushed to
the scene to keep the two sides apart and stop building the
fence.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel: Enlarging EU Conforms to Globalization of World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Expanding the European Union (EU)
was responding to the globalization of the world economy, said
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium on international issues in the Baltic
city Luebeck, northern Germany, Kinkel stressed that the EU should
not develop into a "super power Europe" but a union with both
common character and diversity.
</P>
<P>
The minister arrived here to meet U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who was here on a four-day visit to
Germany, and attend the symposium on eastern European issues.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel emphasized that there would be no peace and stability in
Europe without realizing European integration, and in the process,
single currency was the core.
</P>
<P>
Germany has historic connections and responsibilities with the
countries in eastern and central Europe, he said on the relations
between his and those countries.
</P>
<P>
"So we think we can act as their defender on the course of the
European integration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kinkel noted that Russia would play a more and more
important role in the world economy. Therefore, he said, it
shouldn't be excluded.
</P>
<P>
Germany favored the idea that Russia should be admitted to
participate in the regular Group-7 Summit. It should be changed to
Group-8 Summit, Kinkel said.

<P>
BEIRUT, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese president Elias Hrawi
is expected to pay a short visit to Damascus later today to meet
with his Syrian counterpart Hafez Assad, sources from the Beirut
Presidential Palace said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two presidents will discuss "domestic
files in Lebanon," especially the formation of a new government
following the automatic end of the current government's mandate
Tuesday with the close of the last parliament, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also deal with the situations in the region, in
light of the latest violence in the West Bank and the hardline
positions of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's
government on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
the Syrian-Lebanese summit, which comes at the request of the
Lebanese president, is to be held 48 hours after a meeting in
Damascus between Assad and Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi has asked the government of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
to execute official function until the formation of a new
government.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's government resigned Tuesday in compliance with the
constitution since the four-year term of the current parliament
expired on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The billionaire prime minister is currently visiting
Washington. He held a meeting with U.S. Secretary of state Warren
Christopher Thursday and will have a meeting with President Bill
Clinton Friday.
</P>
<P>
Consultations on choosing a new Lebanese prime minister will
begin after the next parliament elects a new speaker on October
22.
</P>
<P>
Reliable official sources said that Hrawi, who has the
constitutional right to name the prime minister, will hear the
views of each of the 128 parliamentary deputies and will name
the majority choice to head the new government.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, a Sunni Moslem, and Berri, a Shiite Moslem, scored
victories in the Lebanese general elections in August and
September.
</P>
<P>
Both of them won seats in the parliament and became heads
of the two biggest blocs in the unicameral house.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide AIDS Monitoring Network For China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- China plans to establish a
nationwide monitoring network to check the spread of the deadly
AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 to 400 HIV and AIDS monitoring centers are expected to
be set up between now and the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
An advanced national HIV/AIDS laboratory will also be founded
as a spearhead of the country's fight against the disease,
according to an ongoing National Conference on HIV/AIDS Prevention
and Control, being held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Health officials and experts have pledged to take immediate
steps to curb the spread of HIV and AIDS in China after recent
warnings to the country's 1.2-billion-people of the threat posed
by the virus.
</P>
<P>
China reported 4,305 HIV infection cases by the end of August,
including 131 cases of full-blown AIDS. Some experts have
estimated that the actual number of HIV-positive people in the
country may be anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The experts warned that China could see its number of HIV cases
spinning out of control if prompt, preventive measures are not
taken immediately.
</P>
<P>
China has established more than 400 screening clinics and 23
test laboratories in all 30 provinces and autonomous regions since
the first HIV cases was found in the country in 1985, according to
the conference.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three regional prevention and treatment centers for
HIV and sexually transmitted diseases have been established in the
provinces of Guangdong, Yunnan and Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has 42 monitoring points in cities in 23
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, said a survey
report released by the Department of Disease Control at the
Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
From last year, the monitoring points conducted twice a year
tests among four high-risk target groups, people attending sex
disease clinics, hidden prostitutes, drug addicts and
long-distance truck drivers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Although only four people out of the 22,792 tested were found
infected by the HIV virus, the report indicated that the risk of
the wide spread of HIV/AIDS among those people would be high.
</P>
<P>
Experts advised that more monitoring points should be set up in
China's vast rural areas and smaller and medium-sized cities,
which are thought to be more vulnerable to an HIV/AIDS epidemic.

<HEADLINE> Golmud, Rising Petrochemical Base in West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- China plans to invest 15.5
billion yuan (1.8 billion U.S. dollars) building a number of
petrochemical projects in the city of Golmud in northwest China's
Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
The projects are scheduled for construction during the Ninth
Five-Year-Plan period (1996-2000), and include the second-phase
potash fertilizer plant with a designed annual production capacity
of 800,000 tons, the building of a polyvinyl chloride plant with a
designed production capacity of 120,000 tons a year, and a urea
plant with a yearly production capacity of 180,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Qadam Basin, Golmud is rich in mineral
resources, with some 30 kinds of proven mineral reserves. The
Qarhan Salt Lake has the largest area of potassium and magnesium
ores in China, with more than 60 billion tons of the soluble salt.
</P>
<P>
Sebei Natural Gas Field in the city has a proven reserve of 50
billion cubic meters of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade the central government has invested money to
build a number of important projects, including the Qinghai Potash
Fertilizer Plant, the Golmud Refinery with an annual production
capacity of one million tons, and the installation of a 435 km oil
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Local government has also pumped money into building chromium
iron, sulfur acid and potash fertilizer projects, starting
large-scale exploration in the region.
</P>
<P>
The installation of a 189 km gas pipeline from Sebei Natural
Gas Field to Golmud was completed in August, with an annual
capacity for transporting 800 million cu m of gas.
</P>
<P>
Another power station, which has a generating capacity of
16,000 kw and will be fuelled by natural gas, has been competed.
</P>
<P>
As a base for chemical industry, based on rich salt resources
and petrochemical industry, the city has also experienced fast
growth in its basic facilities, especially in transport, energy,
posts and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, the city will invest 20 million yuan
to enlarge its urban telephone exchange handling capacity to
20,000 lines, link local cellular phones to a nationwide automatic
switch network, and provide international direct dialling service,
said Acting Mayor Zhang Xu.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the city has attracted consortiums from
the United States, Canada and Israel, in addition to a large
number of Chinese investors from Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong and
Guangdong provinces.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign investors have expressed their intentions of
participating in the exploration of oil and petroleum, and salt
lake chemical industry, and some have already defined projects for
cooperative development.

<HEADLINE> Indian Ministry Pessimistic About Achieving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- India's Industry Ministry is
believed to be pessimistic about achieving a double digit
industrial growth this year, the Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is of the view that it would be "very difficult"
to attain a 10-percent industrial growth rate during the fiscal
year of 1996-97, contrary to its earlier expectation, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, India's industrial growth rate in 1995-96 was 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
The United Front government had said in its common minimum
program that it expected to maintain a 12-percent industrial
growth rate during this financial year.
</P>
<P>
Industry Ministry officials have pointed out that the prospect
of attaining a double digit industrial growth rate is dim because
of the recent sustained slowdown in industrial production,
according to the newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
Economists attribute the slowdown to a slow government decision
making which has led to inventory pile-up of industrial products
and high credit interest rates which have aggravated the financial
situation of the industry.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that although the forthcoming credit policy
may bring down interest rates, it will take effect only after a
period of two to three months, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there will not be enough time during 1996-97 to pull
up the overall industrial growth rate, they said.

MANILA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Senior Officials
Meeting (SOM) of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum began here today with delegates from 18 members ready to
draw up their final recommendations on the Manila Action Plan for
APEC (MAPA '96).
</P>
<P>
"I likened the principal crop we expect to harvest from this
SOM to the first positives of the Manila Action Plan for APEC. At
this SOM, we shall come out with final prints for our ministers
and the public at large," said Federico Macaranas, chairman of the
meeting.

<P>
The Manila Action Plan is the road map for the implementation
of the APEC vision of a dynamic Asia-Pacific region where free and
open trade and investment will reign by the year 2010 for
developed economies and 2020 for developing economies.
</P>
<P>
It is also an integration and summarization of member
economies' individual and collective action plans in trade and
investment liberalization and facilitation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that APEC economies will benefit "at varying pace and
degree" from the trade and investment liberalization because of
the diverse levels of development, Macaranas said the SOM is also
expected to come up with an APEC Declaration on economic and
development cooperation within the member economies.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Appoints Overseer for Israel's Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu Thursday night appointed Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav to
oversee the affairs of the Jewish state's 850,000 Arab citizens,
according to a report of Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The appointment came against the backdrop of mounting tensions
between Jews and Arabs in Israel since the rise to power of
the rightwing Likud party. The appointment is expected to be
approved at the weekly cabinet meeting this morning.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, municipal services in the 53 Arab local councils
came to a halt to protest over their financial plight.
</P>
<P>
Council leaders said the 24-hour strike was only the
opening shot in their campaign to press the government to
honor its commitments to bail them out.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called by the Forum of Arab Council Heads,
after repeated requests for government assistance failed to
produce results.
</P>
<P>
The council leaders are also angry about a Housing Ministry
proposal to expand the Jewish population of the Galilee because
of forecasts that Arabs will outnumber Jews there within 20
years.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Suleiman, spokesman for the forum, said: "We hope
that any development will not be at the expense of our
land and development."
</P>
<P>
"The issue of the housing Ministry report is important, but
even more pressing at the moment is the question of the plight of
the municipalities," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Many councils are bankrupt and cannot provide municipal
services. Many have been unable to pay the salaries of
employees for several months," he said. "The strike, which was
supported by all councils, is only a warning, and the forum
will meet again next week to decide on further action, unless
there is a meeting beforehand with the prime minister."
</P>
<P>
The council heads have called for an urgent meeting with
Netanyahu and Interior Minister Eli Suissa, without receiving a
reply so far.
</P>
<P>
The opposition expressed their disapproval of the appointment.
Labor Party Secretary-General Nisssim Zvilli said the appointment
is a step backwards that would create a dangerous separation
between Arabs and Jews. The Hadash party accused Netanyahu of
reestablishing military control of the Arab citizens.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that Netanyahu is displeased about
the fact that most of the Arabs voted for Shimon Peres
during the May 29 elections.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Warns Against Harassing Debtors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe on Thursday warned Zimbabwe's financial institutions
against putting their debtors under unnecessary pressure,
especially in these times of high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's interest rates are presently peaked at an average
30 percent, a position blamed on the government's heavy borrowing
from the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "the banks should be sensitive that the interest
rates are high and they should allow people to pay over a longer
period of time."
</P>
<P>
Some whites were given grace periods while blacks were denied
the privilege and were instead chased around, sometimes having
their property attached, Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
"They (whites) were oppressors yesterday, they are still
oppressors today of the liberated people. Where is our freedom if
institutions meant to assist our people are destroying them," he
argued.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said cabinet ministers should ensure their departments were
people oriented.

TOKYO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's trade surplus dropped
41.6 percent in the six months from April to September, compared
with the same period a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said
today.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Further Opens Service Sector to Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Beijing officials attending the
Chinese Export Commodities Fair in Guangzhou City said Beijing is
expecting bigger capital inflows to its service sector, urban
construction and high-tech industries, "China Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Realizing there is no way of shutting down or relocating large
heavy industrial polluters, city officials have chosen instead to
make them more environmentally friendly and reduce their role in
the city's economy, the Beijing-based English newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is emerging as a new economic pillar, and strong brain
power makes Beijing a place for high-tech development matched by
few other locations in China, said Lu Yucheng, vice-mayor of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, more than two million foreigners toured Beijing
last year, generating total income of 2.1 billion US dollars. The
number of foreign tourists is expected to rise six to eight
percent this year, Lu predicted.
</P>
<P>
That money, combined with the cash 40 million Chinese tourists
spent last year, accounted for 20 percent of Beijing's gross
national product in 1995, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"We have great potential to further develop our tourism
industry. About 100,000 more foreign tourists will bring us an
additional 100 million US dollars, and it is quite easy to image
this number being exceeded several times over," Lu was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The brain power concentrated in Beijing is formidable, with 70
universities and colleges and over 400 state-level research
institutes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yi Xiqun, assistant mayor of Beijing, said 32 out of the
world's top 60 multinational companies in the areas of
telecommunications, electronics and computers have invested in
technology-intensive projects in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 6,000 foreign business representatives,
embassies and consulates have made Beijing a melting pot that is
most likely to make investors feel at home.
</P>
<P>
Among the world's top 500 manufacturing and service trade
companies, 275 have invested in Beijing, ladling out 4.6 billion
US dollars to 360 projects as of last month.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's real estate market is China's top performer in that
sector, and interested foreign developers will have more
opportunities as the city plans to offer them a batch of urban
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Part of the plan is to upgrade the city's information,
exhibition, international conference and commerce centers, Lu
said, adding that renovation of the Beijing Museum is planned.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's urban construction, including the building of
highways connecting the city proper with suburban counties, subway
lines and power plants, is also slated for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
For centuries Beijing has been weak in foreign trade. Beijing's
foreign trade turnover ranked 12th in China, although its economic
strength is second only to that of Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> ADB Inspection Policy Goes into Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The board of directors of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) has appointed a roster of independent
experts from the bank's member countries to review aspects of
projects under ADB's inspection policy.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the ADB said that the roster
includes experts in economics, engineering, environmental
management, law, public administration and social analysis.
</P>
<P>
"With the appointment of the roster, the inspection policy is
now effective," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that its inspection policy will give local groups
in the bank's member countries a grievance procedure to follow if
they believe they are being seriously harmed because the bank has
not followed its operational policies and procedures in connection
with a project.
</P>
<P>
The ADB's inspection policy applies to the bank's public sector
loans and technical assistance grants and could be extended to its
private sector operations in two years, it said.

<HEADLINE> North China to Build More Highways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A new high-grade highway is to
be built between Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi
Province, and Gujiao City, the country's largest base for coking
production.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed in the provincial capital of
Taiyuan, between the Taiyuan Rongtong Credit Cooperative, the
Gujiao City Government and a Hong Kong trading corporation, the
three partners will invest 100 million yuan (12 million
U.S. dollars) in the project.
</P>
<P>
The existing highway from Gujiao to Taiyuan was built to lower
technical standards, and is now often operating under excessive
load, seriously restricting the economic development of the city.
</P>
<P>
The new highway will be almost 60 kilometers in length, and
will be linked to the existing Taiyuan-Ningwu Highway.
</P>
<P>
Local officials believe that the building of the new highway
will not only alleviate road transport pressures around Gujiao,
but create favorable conditions for the relatively poor areas in
western Shanxi to become well-to-do.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks Break Down over Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks ended early this morning without reaching any agreement
because of the dispute over Israeli troop redeployment from
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Israel's Red Sea resort of Eilat, where the
negotiators convened the talks, said that Palestinian negotiators
walked out of the meeting angrily after three hours of talks,
blaming Israel for the breakdown. The talks will resume at 9
a.m. this morning.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian negotiators complained that the internal dispute
between politicians and military officials among the Israeli
delegation was the cause for the breakdown.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Hasan Asfour said he was
doubtful if an agreement could be achieved. But U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross, who was directly involved in the talks,
said the gap had been narrowed although there remained some
areas of disagreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Israeli spokesman to the talks denied that a
crisis took place concerning the talks, which he said had made
significant progress. He also expressed optimism about reaching
agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ross met with Arafat in Gaza Strip Thursday, and said he
was trying to find a solution to the dispute over Hebron.
"I feel both sides are honestly trying to find a solution.
I am not pessimistic. I am realistic," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher held telephone
conversations Thursday separately with Arafat, Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Ross. He promised that the
U.S. would continue supporting the two sides in their effort to
reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
In the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, negotiators from the
two sides conducted talks from Wednesday night until early
Thursday morning. The Palestinians introduced the idea of a
package deal to include Hebron and other issues. Israel rejected
the idea, but agreed to discuss everything together except
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have not yet fully accepted that, saying the
Hebron redeployment, the Gaza airport, release of Palestinian
prisoners, and safe passages between the West Bank and Gaza were
matters that should have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat called them
"self-implementing mechanisms."
</P>
<P>
"That's what we offered. Serious engagement in producing
results on the ground will be only through a protocol implementing
the agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should redeploy its troops
from 80 percent of Hebron while retaining security control
over the remaining area where 450 Jewish settlers live. But
the PA will have most control over the civilian matters in
the town.
</P>
<P>
Israel indicated that it would make some concessions on
civilian control in the town while demanding greater security
rights. However, the Palestinian side said Israel's security
demand was baseless, as it has been granted control over
one-fifth of the town, even though Jews make up less than
one percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Palestinians would likely make some
concessions on Hebron if Israel is willing to reach a package
deal.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Meets U.N. Special Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. special envoy to Angola
Alioune Blondin Beye yesterday briefed Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe on the situation in the war-ravaged country, saying
there is now a sense of urgency on both parties to the stalled
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Beye delivered a message from U.N. Secretary-general Boutros
Boutros-Ghali to Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Beye said progress was hampered by mistrust
between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
"We have to understand that the situation in Angola is a very
long conflict of over 20 years and everything must be done to
move ahead and remove the wall of mistrust that has developed
between the two parties," Beye said.
</P>
<P>
Beye said he had felt obliged to report to Mugabe on the U.N.
Security Council meeting in New York last week as he (Mugabe) was
Chairman of the Organization of African Unity Ad-hoc Committee on
Angola and Chairman of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) organ on politics, defence and security.
</P>
<P>
He said he had also discussed with Mugabe the meetings he held
this week with Angola's former rebel UNITA movement leader Jonas
Savimbi and Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
The international community is becoming impatient with Angola,
with the United Nations saying the 7,000 U.N. peacekeeping
contingent currently in the country should be withdrawn by the
end of February next year.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has given UNITA a deadline of
November 20 to fulfill its part of the peace process; or else
sanctions would be applied.
</P>
<P>
"Savimbi understands alearly that this peace process has cost
very dearly to the international community and is aware of the
sactions that will be imposed on him," said Beye.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Fights Public Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's cigarette-puffers
have been kept away from public places since the city's first
regulations on smoking took effect on May 15.
</P>
<P>
In the capital's over 77,000 public places, as counted by the
Beijing Patriotic Health Committee, only 366 cases in violation of
the regulations have been discovered and fined during the past
five months, "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that Beijing residents' awareness of smoke
control has greatly improved since the implementation of the
regulations, said Zhang Xizeng, vice-director of the Beijing
Patriotic Health Committee which in charge of enforcing the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the regulations, many units, such as the
Ministry of Communications and the Tongrentang Pharmaceutical
Factory, have been designated smoke-free areas.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Medical University has announced it will not enroll
students who smoke.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-May, more and more people have been consulting
doctors for advice on how to stop smoking, and cigarette sales in
the city have fallen by 23 percent compared with the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the success of this campaign against public smoking
was largely due to the principle stipulated in the regulations,
"clarifying the boundaries of public places, requiring units to be
responsible for their areas, and strengthening supervision and
guidance for smokers."
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, newspapers, television and radio
programs in the capital have publicized the regulations and the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Over 3 million posters and other printed materials have been
put up across the city, in addition to 220,000 signs banning
smoking.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, hundreds of consultative and publicity stations have
been set up on special occasions to disseminate knowledge.
</P>
<P>
And 1,238 law enforcers and supervisors as well as nearly
80,000 inspectors, empowered to impose fines and award
certificates, have been recruited in the anti-smoke campaign,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Article on China's Sovereignty over Diaoyu Islands (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nevertheless, till September 11 this year, a spokesman for the
US government still alleged that the United States neither
recognizes nor supports any nation's claim to the sovereignty of
the Diaoyu Islands.
</P>
<P>
The so-called view taken by the Japanese government that the
Diaoyu Islands is Japan's "inherent territory" because Japan
"occupied the islands first" cannot be backed by any historical
facts or law. In fact, the Diaoyu Islands was illegally taken from
China by the Japanese empire then.
</P>
<P>
Any treaty or agreement between the United States and Japan has
no legal binding as to the determination of the sovereignty of the
Diaoyu Islands, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that the disputes between China and Japan
over the territorial sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands should
have been dealt with through candid, sober-minded and pragmatic
consultations between the two governments. But with the connivance
of the Japanese government, some Japanese climbed onto and posted
on the islands various signs to demonstrate Japan's actual control
of the islands and to repeatedly provoke China.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that some Japanese officials have
described the Diaoyu Islands of China as Japan's "private land,"
and have said that the government cannot interfere in the
activities of the right wing groups.
</P>
<P>
To China, the article adds, the non-interference in such
activities is equivalent to signal of continued green light to the
right-wing groups to cause trouble on the islands. It also implies
that they want to force upon the Chinese government the view that
the islands is "land for private use" under Japanese
sovereignty. This, of course, will be unacceptable to China, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
The article says that China and Japan will mutually benefit
from the peaceful settlement of the issue and, otherwise, both
sides will be hurt.
</P>
<P>
It calls on people with insight of both countries to respect
history and law, and to wield sincerity and wisdom so that the
issue will cease to be the distablizing factor that may possibly
exacerbate the Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
The issue should be resolved peacefully and creatively, the
article says.

<P>
KIEV, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's economy recovered
slightly in 1996, creating favorable conditions for further
improvement in 1997, Ukrainian Minister for the Economy
Vasily Gureyev said today.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in the first nine months this year dropped to 34.8
percent compared with 181.7 percent in the same period last
year, Gureyev said at a regular meeting of the Supreme Soviet
(Ukraine's Parliament).
</P>
<P>
Gureyev predicted a further fall to around 20 percent next
year,
</P>
<P>
Exports increased 22.5 percent, faster than the 16.7 percent
rise in imports.
</P>
<P>
While Ukraine's gross national product (GDP) fell 9.5 percent
between January and August this year, an improvement on the 12.4
percent fall in the same period of 1995. But the minister forecast
a slight increase in GDP for next year of 1.7 percent to 62.7
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rate of decrease in industrial output also slowed, reaching
4.3 percent during the first three quarters of 1996, compared with a
decrease of 13.3 percent in the same period of 1995.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Article on China's Sovereignty over Diaoyu Islands (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Today's "People's Daily" has
published an article, signed by Zhong Yan conerning China's
sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands, which says that the ownership
of the islands has long been established beyond any doubt.
</P>
<P>
The Diaoyu Islands has been Chinese territory since ancient
times, the article says.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to clarify the sovereignty of Diaoyu Islands from
the perspectives of history and international law, the article
notes that historical records of the islands can be found in books
from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
Diaoyu Islands, and its adjacent islands are located about 92
nautical miles northeast of Taiwan and some 73 nautical miles from
Japan's Ryukyu Islands.
</P>
<P>
China found the islands first, and named them long before
Japan's 1871 annexation of the independent Ryukyu state, with
which China had had more than 500 years of friendly contacts, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
It noted that emperors from the Ming Dynasty had sent envoys to
the Ryukyu state.
</P>
<P>
In a book written by Chen Kan, it states that the 11th special
envoy was sent in 1534 by a Ming emperor to Ryukyu.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, on a sea map compiled in 1562 by Zhejiang Provincial
Commander Hu Zongxian of the Ming Dynasty, Diaoyu Islands could be
found among the islands along the coast of Luoyuan County and
Ningde County of Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
During the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), it was already commonly
known among Chinese sailors that China and Ryukyu were divided by
a trough to the south of Diaoyu Island. Troughs are usually used
as the boundary between two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, the Qing Dynasty's second envoy to
Ryukyu, Shi Wangji, said in one of his works that during his trip
to Ryukyu in 1683, he was showed the trough.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, similar evidence was found in another book written
by Zhou Huang in 1756.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Article on China's Sovereignty over Diaoyu Islands (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
According to a book by Special Envoy Xu Baoguang in the Qing
dynasty (1644-1911), the route he followed in 1719 from Fuzhou of
Fujian Province to Ryukyu was along the north side of the islands
of Huaping, Pengjia and Diaoyu, reaching Gumishan Island via
Chiwei Island.
</P>
<P>
All these documents show that both the courts of the Ming and
Qing dynasties designated the Diaoyu Islands as Chinese territory,
the article says.
</P>
<P>
It is not only the position of the Chinese government but that
of some noted Japanese historians that the Diaoyu Islands has been
Chinese territory since the Ming Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Well-known Japanese historian Kiyoshi Inoue said in his book,
"Historic Analysis of Diaoyu Island," published in 1972, that
Diaoyu Islands "was not an unclaimed land before Japan touched upon
it." After years of consulting historical records, he stated that
the Diaoyu Islands is China's territory.
</P>
<P>
The scholar said in the book that "in Japan and Ryukyu before
1868 there was virtually no document which carried any record of
the Diaoyu Islands, other than Chinese documents."
</P>
<P>
According to the article, the first written material which
recorded Diaoyu Island in Japan was seen in 1785 and was also
based on the book by Chinese Envoy Xu Baoguang.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the most authoritative historic book of the
government of Ryukyu state in 1650 recognized the statement of
Chinese envoy Chen Kan of the Ming Dynasty that the Chiwei island
and islands to its west did not belong to Ryukyu, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article added that this point of view represented the
position of the rulers of Ryukyu at that time.
</P>
<P>
The article quotes a former director of the Japan Association
for the Promotion of International Trade as saying that, from the
linguistic perspective, such names as "Diaoyudao" (Diaoyu Island),
and "Chiweiyu" (Chiwei Island) are of Chinese origin.
</P>
<P>
The article refutes a Japanese argument that even some
Chinese-published maps use the Japanese name for Diaoyu Islands.
</P>
<P>
The inconsistency of usage marks the semi-colonial nature of
modern Chinese history, rather than proving Japan's sovereignty
over the islands, the article said.

<P>
According to Japanese historical records, it was in 1884 that
Japan first discovered the Diaoyu Islands after gobbling up Ryukyu
state and renaming it the "prefecture of Okinawa", some 500 years
later than the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The article said that in late November 1894, Japanese intruding
troops occupied Lushun Port in northeast China's Liaoning Province
and blockaded the navy of the Qing Dynasty in Weihaiwei, Shandong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Sure of its victory over the Qing dynasty court, the Japanese
Meiji government attempted to force China to take the secession of
Taiwan as a term for making peace. It secretly occupied the Diaoyu
Islands without notifying the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
On January 14, 1895, the Japanese government adopted a cabinet
resolution to place the Diaoyu Islands under the jurisdiction of
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Treaty of Shimonoseki signed by China and
Japan on April 17 of the same year, China was forced to cede
Taiwan and its surrounding islands to Japan. Japan ruled Taiwan as
long as for 50 years until its defeat and surrender in World War
II. And Diaoyu and other islands surrounding Taiwan, too, were
occupied by Japan for a long period of time.

<TEXT>
<P>
The article says that after the US military occupation, Article
Three of the No. 667 order by the United Nations Supreme Command,
issued on January 29, 1946, clearly defines the domain of Japan's
territory, that is, the four main Japanese islands (Hokkaido,
Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu) and Tsushima Island, along with Ryukyu
Islands south of N latitude 30 degrees, which did not include the
Diaoyu Islands at all.
</P>
<P>
It was not until the emergence of the Cold War that the United
States government issued a decree on December 25, 1953, declaring
that it was necessary to redefine the geographical boundary of
Ryukyu islands, and redesignating the territories administered by
the US government and the Ryukyu government to include islands,
isles and territorial sea in the domain of N latitude 24 degrees
and E longitude 122 degrees.
</P>
<P>
This means that the United States illegally occupied Diaoyu
Islands, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan signed an agreement on June 17,
1971, to return the Okinawa Islands to Japan, declaring the domain
of Japan's territory was exactly the same as the US decree made in
1953. In this way, Diaoyu Islands was included into Japan's
Okinawa prefecture, the article points out.
</P>
<P>
Precisely in view of this agreement, the Japanese government
held that the Diaoyu Islands was part of the Okinawa prefecture,
and put the islands and the surrounding sea within the "air
defense distinguishing rim" of its Self-Defense Forces. The
US-Japan agreement touched off a movement of the overseas Chinese
on a worldwide scale in the 1970s, including those in the United
States, to rise to defend the Diaoyu Islands, the article says.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Needs to Strengthen Delivery Capability: GA President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The President of the
United Nations General Assembly said on Thursday that the
U.N. needs to become more responsive to the outside world and
strengthen its ability to deliver on its decisions.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Razali Ismail, said that
the main challenge facing the world body today was its inability
to turn deliberations or decisions into real action.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his one-year term as president he would do
as much as he could to reverse the U.N.'s negative image.
</P>
<P>
Razali, who has been Malaysia's permanent representative at the
U.N. since 1988, said the six main committees under the General
Assembly needed to set out their priorities clearly.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the United Nations should put the critical
issues, especially poverty and social injustice, at the top of the
list.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed that the U.N. act as the main agent in the
world's efforts to achieve macro-coordination in development.
Through its analytical work, the U.N. can exert strong influence
over institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the
World Trade Organization, he added.
</P>
<P>
Razali is well known at the U.N. as an outspoken
diplomat. Since taking over the presidency of the General Assembly
on September 17, he has been trying to cut down on unnecessary
meetings and insisting on punctuality.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, he strongly criticized the United States for
withholding its assessed contributions to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that power politics is still at work even though
the Cold War is over, citing as an example the U.S.'s refusal to
pay its U.N. dues while exerting pressure for reform.
</P>
<P>
"We must not allow any country to continue blackmailing the
United Nations, pushing for reform on the basis of not paying the
money," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the United States for its "double standards"
on human rights and overseas assistance.
</P>
<P>
On China's role in the developing world, he acknowledged that
China has done much to help developing countries since its seat
at the U.N. was restored 25 years ago. He hoped China will play a
more important role in the U.N. in the future.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Was Lebed Ousted as Security Chief? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin fired
his security chief and national security advisor, Alexander Lebed,
Thursday, in an attempt to end a months-long power struggle in the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
"I can no longer tolerate this situation and I am forced to
relieve General Lebed of his position as secretary of the Security
Council," Yeltsin said in a nationwide televised program.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was referring to the verbal duel between Lebed and
Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov over the fall of Chechnya's
capital Grozny to Chechen separatists in August. He deliberately
ignored talk of a coup.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Yeltsin accused Lebed of committing a series of
"unacceptable" mistakes and carrying out "a number of moves to
which he did not agree to with the president," despite the fact
that he (Yeltsin) had previously told the security chief "to learn
to work with other state authorities."
</P>
<P>
The dismissal came just a day after Kulikov charged Lebed with
plotting to form a 50,000-strong army and to take power by
"mutiny." Yeltsin reportedly ordered Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Kulikov to provide him urgently with detailed
information about the alleged formation of the special forces.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov also claimed that Lebed entered into "a direct
collusion with (Chechen) separatists" in a bid to gain political
mileage for the next presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Lebed immediately denied these accusations.
</P>
<P>
At a celebration Monday to mark the 850th anniversary of the
establishment of Tula, a town near Moscow, Lebed called on the
residents to support Alexandr Korzhakov, former director of the
presidential security service, to fill the seat in the State Duma
(lower house of parliament) which he gave up when taking his
Kremlin job in June.
</P>
<P>
Korzhakov, who had worked with Yeltsin for 11 years, had in
hand lots of confidential information about senior leaders, which,
if released, might topple certain serving leaders, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of an alliance between Lebed and Korzhakov
couldn't help but arouse the alertness and opposition of the
president and his aides, they said.
</P>
<P>
Lebed has been drawn into an bitter power struggle with other
Kremlin officials since September 5 when Yeltsin said he was
preparing to undergo heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
Lebed claimed that he was the best candidate for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
"The poor health of the president has delayed the settlement of
many problems," he said. He even went so far as to say "the
president should hand over his power since he is ill." It was in
sharp contrast with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the
director of the presidential office, Anatoly Chubais, who had been
much more cautious over their words and deeds.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, 46, was the driving force behind Yeltsin's presidential
election in June. The ex-army general garnered 14.71 percent of
the votes to rank third behind Yeltsin and Communist party leader
Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
In the runoff elections held in early July, Lebed turned to
support Yeltsin in return for his appointment as the presidential
security chief and head of the national security council.
</P>
<P>
Analysts described the alliance as "expedient" and said it was
lacking a solid political foundation.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, however, blamed his firing on Chubais, who has taken
over many of Yeltsin's administrative duties in the president's
absence. "I was very much in his way," he said, accusing Chubais
of harboring presidential ambitions of his own.
</P>
<P>
The sacking of Lebed, however, will not end the power struggle
in the Kremlin. And the popular Lebed was unbowed, hinting that he
would start campaigning soon to replace the "elderly and ill"
Yeltsin, 65, if he had to step down due to problems.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force Tests New Bomb for B-2s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States Air Force
has successfully tested a bomb that could enable its fleet of B-2
Stealth bombers to attack targets anywhere in the world, at any
time and under any weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Associated Press reported today that the weapon, code-named
GATS/GAM, comprises a standard 2,000-pound bomb equipped with a
global positioning system receiver and a satellite-based locating
device.
</P>
<P>
The unit was linked electronically with the B-2's sophisticated
radar, which pinpointed ground targets and fed the data to the
bomb, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The combination allowed the weapon to accurately hit targets
such as bridges, command bunkers, and missiles in zero visibility,
the Air Force was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Infrared, electro-optical or laser-guided bombs of the type
used in the Gulf War are rendered ineffective by cloud, rain, snow
or smoke, which their sensors and laser beams cannot penetrate,
but which radar penetrates.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force said the GATS/GAM would do the same job as a
cruise missile such as those fired in recent months against Iraqi
targets.
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of GATS/GAM was that it allowed B-2 bombers
to attack from high altitudes, largely reducing the danger from
surface anti-aircraft missiles.

<HEADLINE> Russia Capable of Joining NATO: Perry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry said today he was confident Russia is capable of joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Military Academy of the General Staff
of the Russian army, Perry, who arrived here Wednesday for a
working visit, described NATO membership as requiring two
factors -- capability and will.
</P>
<P>
Russia's capability is already in place, but it has yet to
express its willingness to join the trans-Atlantic alliance, Perry
noted. Moscow has in the past been deeply suspicious and hostile
to NATO's planned expansion eastward to take in countries of the
former Soviet Union-led Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Perry proposed strengthening links between Russia
and NATO. In view of Russia's superpower status, Russia should
play a "leading role" in NATO's Partnership for Peace Program, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He backed Russia's proposals for revising the 1990 Conventional
Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty, adding the proposals have received
support from all defense ministers of NATO member countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Russian Duma (lower house of parliament) earlier
today, Perry urged the house to ratify the START-2 treaty which
would slash U.S. and Russian nuclear warheads to 3,000-3,500 on
each side by 2003 from current levels of more than 6,000 each.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed in 1992 and has been ratified by the
U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
Perry also told the Duma that the United States was willing to
start talks immediately on a START-3 nuclear reduction treaty
after START-2 was ratified.

<HEADLINE> Japan Trade Surplus Dives Over 41 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's trade surplus plunged
more than 41 percent to 2.90 trillion yen (25.8 billion
U.S. dollars) in the past six months against the same period a
year earlier, according to the Finance Minister today.
</P>
<P>
The unadjusted customs-clear surplus in the first half of the
fiscal year, is still on a shrinking trend, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan's trade surplus with the United States in the
six-month period from April to September fell 24.2 percent from
the previous year to 1.56 trillion yen (13.9 billion dollars)
while it had a trade deficit of 1.13 trillion yen (10 billion
dollars) with China.
</P>

The surplus has been steadily shrinking as imports continue
to grow more strongly than exports. Japan has traditionally
been regarded as having an export-oriented economy.

Healthy growth in imports, which rose 25 percent in the

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Croatians Requires Autonomous Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The only way to ensure the
survival of Croatians within Bosnia's Muslim-Croat Federation is
to set up autonomous regions, Bozo Raic, president of the ruling
Croatian Democratic Union party said today.
</P>
<P>
The party, known as the HDZ, appealed for the setting up of
15 Croatian autonomous regions before local elections in areas
predominantly occupied by Bosnian Muslims, Raic said in an
interview with the Croatia Radio.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim side of the federation has rejected the proposal.
But Raic said that if such autonomous regions were not set up,
Croatians would be swallowed up and then it would be pointless to
discuss issues relating to the federation and reunion.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's International Reserves Reach Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's international reserves
have reached a record of 1.8 billion U.S. dollars, an Ecuadoran
official said.
</P>
<P>
Local press quoted monetary board president Alvaro Noboa as
saying today that "the country has not had this amount of dollars
in the Central Bank reserve since it became a republic (160 years
ago)."
</P>
<P>
The size of the reserves is a sign of Ecuador's economic
stability which has encouraged both Ecuadorans and foreigners to
invest in the country and thus brought dollars into the economy,
said Noboa.
</P>
<P>
He said this had led to an excess of liquidity in the economy
which had led to a fall in interest rates over the last two months
of some 30 points.
</P>
<P>
Private banks have more funds, and many lines of credit
available from the national financial corporation and the state
have not been used by businesses and manufacturing sectors.

<HEADLINE> Austria Says Lebed's Sacking Russia's Own Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Austria said today that the
dismissal of national security chief Aleksandr Lebed by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday was Russia's internal affair.
</P>
<P>
Florian Krenkel, spokesman for Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel, told reporters that it was the president's decision to
sack his top security adviser, and thus it was totally Russia's
own business.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his decision to remove Lebed from the security
council, Yeltsin said he could no longer bear the situation,
referring to verbal duel between Lebed and Interior Minister
Anatoly Kulikov over the fall of Grozny, the Chechen capital, to
separatists in August.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel said since Russia was of special weight to the
security of the whole of Europe, any development of Russia's
situation should be watched closely.
</P>
<P>
He said the Austria's foreign minister would begin his Russian
tour on November 3. He was expected to hold talks with his Russian
counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov.

CARACAS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela has asked Colombia to

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Denmark supports a continued
peace-keeping mission in Bosnia under the auspices of the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE),
Danish Foreign Minister Niels Petersen said here today.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE should strengthen its efforts to help build a peaceful
post-war Bosnia, said Peterson, who is expected to be the OSCE's
rotating chairman next year, at a meeting of the organization's
Vienna-based Permanent Council.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Dayton peace accord which ended the war
in Bosnia in December 1995, the OSCE was assigned the tasks of
supervising post-war Bosnian elections, drafting arms-control
agreements for the former Yugoslavia and monitoring the observance
of human rights in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Peterson said that among the main tasks for 1997, the priority
will be to work out a new security system in Europe for the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the establishment of an emergency fund
within the OSCE to help the organization react rapidly to future
crises.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Plans to Raze "Absolute Poverty" by 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is determined to see
"absolute poverty" eradicated by the end of the country's seventh
Five-Year Development Plan in 2004, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
At a national symposium commemorating the International Poverty
Eradication Day Thursday, State Minister of National Development
Planning Ginandjar Kartasasmita promised that there would be no
more people living in absolute poverty by the target date.
</P>
<P>
"By 2004, we hope to have alleviated absolute poverty, but not
relative poverty, because the latter can never be totally
mitigated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian experts define people living in absolute poverty as
those who earn less than 600 rupiah (0.25 US dollar) per day in
rural areas and 900 rupiah (0.38 US dollar) in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Indonesia has succeeded in
reducing the number of the poor from 70 million in 1970 to 25.9
million in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said that some 2.8 million Indonesian families, or
12.5 million people, have been helped by the anti-poverty program
launched by the government in April 1994.

All the seven were charged with murder and attempted murder.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Lebed's Sacking Russia's Internal Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
refused to comment on Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decision
to dismiss his security adviser Aleksandr Lebed, saying it was
Russia's internal matter.
</P>
<P>
However, the White House hinted that the move is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Michael McCurry told a news briefing that
the U.S. was not in a position to comment on the Russian event.
</P>
<P>
But, McCurry said, there was a constitution for the Russian
Federation. "It appears that President Yeltsin was within his
constitutional prerogatives to make personnel changes within his
inner cabinet."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin announced his decision Thursday in a nationwide
televised appearance. He said he was compelled to "free General
Lebed from the post he occupied in the security council."
</P>
<P>
The president said he could no longer bear the situation,
referring to the power struggle between Lebed and Interior Minister
Anatoly Kulikov.
</P>
<P>
For the U.S., McCurry noted, the key was stability and
continuity, and these had been advanced in U.S. conversations
with the Russians. "We've seen good evidence today that there's no
change in that situation."
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the U.S. State Department, Nicholas Burns' also
told a news briefing today that the incident was "the business of
the Russian people and of the Russian government."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously President Yeltsin, who's fully in charge in Russia,
has made the decision that he thinks is best for himself, for the
Russian government and for the Russian nation."
</P>
<P>
Burns said U.S.-Russian relations were stable and promised that
Washington would continue to have a "priority relationship" with
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He said "U.S.-Russian relations will remain stable, admittedly
in a time of some political turmoil in Russian, considering the
event this morning."
</P>
<P>
Burns expressed hope that the peace treaty signed between Lebed
and Chechen rebel leaders would be honored.
</P>
<P>
The peace treaty was one of the positive developments in the
last couple of months. The U.S. hoped there would be no return to
the bloodletting and horrific violence, Burns said.

MANAGUA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 1,000 Nicaraguan
families have been hit by hurricane Lilly which lashed the country
over the last two days, the Nicaraguan authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
However, so far, no deaths have been reported as a result of
the heavy rains which destroyed houses and roads, said Joaquin
Oviedo, head of the Department of Natural Disasters in the Social
Action Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The worst flooded areas were the Pacific coast departments of
Rivas in southern Nicaragua and Chinandega in the north.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists said that tropical storm Lilly, which became a
hurricane when it left the Central American isthmus, was advancing
through the Caribbean Sea toward Cuba.

<P>
CARACAS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Vice Foreign
Minister Milos Alcalay and his Colombian counterpart, Clemencia
Forero, met here today to review their cooperative policies.
</P>
<P>
They described the policies of their adjoining countries as
tactful, efficient and dynamic.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said the roading infrastructure, health,
educational and environmental cooperation had made progress since
the "binational" conference between the foreign, defense and
justice ministers was held in August in the Colombian city of
Cucuta.
</P>
<P>
Miss Forero said the two countries felt satisfied with their
coordination, and their ability to face problems and the challenge
of opportunities for their common benefit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the U.S. Helms-Burton Law which tries to
intensify the economic blockade against Cuba, and other regional
measures, the Colombian vice minister said: "I believe there is a
growing consciousness in the continent that these measures and
sanctions not only affect involved countries, but also the destiny
of the continent and of the hemispheric alliance."

<HEADLINE> UN Pledges to Help Eliminate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today
called for the world attention to poverty issues and pledged to
mobilize greater efforts of the international community to reduce
the number of the poor.
</P>
<P>
To mark the the International Day to Eradicate Poverty today,
France offered to the United Nations an exact replica of a
Parisian stone in honor of the victims of extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
People attending the unveiling ceremony at the U.N. plaza saw
the stone engraved with these words: "Whenever men and women are
condemned to live in extreme poverty, human rights are violated.
To come together to ensure that these rights be respected is our
solemn duty."
</P>
<P>
According to statistics offered by the United Nations, 1.5
billion people still live in desperately poor condition, and the
number is increasing by approximately 25 million a year.
</P>
<P>
Whereas the income ratio between the richest 20 percent and the
poorest 20 percent of the world's population was 30 to 1 in 1960,
it had more than doubled entering the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
October 17, the World Day for the Eradication of Poverty, will
be observed in different ways, in many countries, including
Thailand, the Philippines, Guatemala, Kenya, Benin, Poland,
Hungary, Russia, France and Portugal. People all over, poor and
rich, will come together to reaffirm their refusal to accept
extreme poverty, according to U.N. sources.
</P>
<P>
A group of kids, with some coming from very poor communities in
Boston, also showed up at the ceremony. They brought a basket of
stones they collected to show their hard-as-stone belief -- that
poverty is wrong and is not inevitable. They will help lift the
world out of poverty, hunger and violence.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly has dedicated 1997-2006 as the Decade
for the Eradication of Poverty, noting that poverty eradication is
fundamental to reinforcing peace and achieving sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
James Gustave Speth, administrator of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), told the press at the noon briefing
that half billion people actually live worse than they did 15
years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen,
Denmark, in March 1995, more than 180 countries acknowledged their
worsening problem of global poverty and pledged to take action to
combat it.
</P>
<P>
Speth spoke highly of the follow-up efforts made by developing
countries, especially in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, rich countries have not shown their "sufficient
generosity" in relieving poverty, he said, adding that "we should
bring official assistance back to track."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the World Day to Eradicate Poverty is not to
be celebrated. It is to be eliminated eventually, he added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Outstanding assessed
contributions to the United Nations stood at 2.5 billion dollars
as of 15 October, a U.N. spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Of the latest figure, 707 million dollars were for the regular
budget and 1.76 billion dollars were for peacekeeping operations.
An additional 20.4 million dollars were owed for the International
Tribunals, according to Ahmad Fawzi, deputy spokesman for the
secretary general.
</P>
<P>
The arrears of the United States amounted to 1.4 billion
dollars, ranking first among the major contributors.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been plagued by a financial crisis for
years. Some member states have failed to pay their dues on time
for budgetary technicalities or simple poverty, and some have
withheld payments to impose political pressure on the
organization, according to the U.N. Department of Public
Information.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges World to Adapt to Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today called on the international community
to be prepared for the transformation of economies and societies
throughout the whole world community.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Malente Symposium XI in Lubeck, Germany,
Boutros-Ghali said that this is a time of transition in every part
of the world, and in every aspect of human society.
</P>
<P>
While the economic aspect of transition is the most visible,
the transition involves social, political, security, humanitarian
and cultural aspects, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past years of the transition, the United Nations came
across two major challenges: mobilizing the international
community in the interest of a peaceful transition such as making
and keeping peace in the former Yugoslavia and Georgia; and
providing a platform for dialogue to help elaborate shared values,
enhance common understanding and promote practical cooperation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
While the majority of countries are undergoing a transition to
the market, the conditions in which this transition takes place
differ according to different historical specificities, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is further complicated by the fact that the goal
posts have shifted. The market economy of the nineties is not the
market economy of the fifties or sixties," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking today at an increasingly globalized economy,
especially in the areas of financial flows, production decisions,
information networks and trading areas. So all countries are in
transition to a globalizing economy. This is a challenge for all
-- and for economies seeking to change the way resources are
allocated, it is an added complication," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, societies in transition have to bear the strains of
transition from one political system to another, from one economic
system to another, and from a local or regional system to a global
economy. A further complication is that these different
transitions each proceed at a different pace, and with different
constraints, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the historical mission of the United Nations, at the
close of the 20th century, to bring this new system into
existence, to reinforce its positive features, and to strengthen
the new participants in this system," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The times call for an unprecedented degree of international
cooperation: a new multilateralism, which has many aspects calling
for a greater role of the United Nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that countries with economies in transition are not
only the countries of Eastern Europe or Central Asia. In Africa,
in Latin America, and in Asia, countries are undertaking
tremendous efforts to transform their economies, and adjust to the
new realities of the globalizing world economy.
</P>
<P>
The major role and tasks for the United Nations are as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- ending the conflicts left pending by the end of the Cold
War;
</P>
<P>
-- supporting the domestic political transition to a
multi-party system;
</P>
<P>
-- helping the countries with economies in transition to deal
with specific problems such as resettlement of refugees and
displaced persons;
</P>
<P>
-- assisting them to become an integral part of the
international system; and
</P>
<P>
-- helping these countries create an environment more favorable
to investors, and reform their economic systems.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for Real Political Actions to Combat Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- President of the U.N.
General Assembly Razali Ismail today called on the international
community to take real political actions to combat poverty instead
of making hollow declarations and holding commemorations.
</P>
<P>
In a message to commemorate the International Day for the
Eradication of Poverty, Razali said that the tentacles of poverty
widen to ensnare a greater number of people each year, despite
repeated pledges by governments to fight the scourge, and despite
the expansion of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations Charter enshrines the ideals of social
justice and equity for all nations, and for all peoples. We are
still struggling to meet those lofty goals," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. process to eradicate poverty, he said, a peaceful
and sustainable future will only be possible if the human person
is placed at the center of the development process, and only if
the structural causes of poverty, unemployment, social
disintegration and environmental degradation are addressed.
</P>
<P>
As the framework of international development and official
development assistance (ODA) have given way to globalization,
free-market forces and private sector-led economic growth, he
noted, development and poverty are complex problems requiring
integrated solutions.
</P>
<P>
"If a reinvigorated United Nations is to retain a central and
determining role in poverty alleviation and the coordination of
development policy, the United Nations must be able to redress the
negative effects of debt and structural adjustment policies as an
urgent priority," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since poverty generates social dislocation, encourages mass
movements of people across borders, increases the risks of
disaffection and civil strife, and undermines the basic rights of
people, social development and the eradication of poverty can only
be achieved when all human rights -- civil, political, economic,
social and cultural -- are recognized and fulfilled as
prerequisites for equitable and sustainable development, he said.
</P>
<P>
He strongly criticized those countries that pledge to meet ODA
commitments and transfer the technology, but do not in fact honor
those promises.
</P>
<P>
He urged member states of the U.N. to take the following
actions:
</P>
<P>
-- governments should cut military expenditure and increase
spending on health care and education instead;
</P>
<P>
-- there should be immediate cancellation of bilateral,
multilateral and commercial debt of developing countries without
imposing conditionalities that hurt the poor and the vulnerable;
</P>
<P>
-- the Bretton Woods institutions should be made transparent
and decisions taken there should be coordinated with those taken
at the U.N.;
</P>
<P>
-- rich countries must recognize their special responsibilities
in alleviating poverty; and
</P>
<P>
-- governments should attach importance to public policy that
regulates against the excesses of the market place and the private
sector.

<HEADLINE> KDP Demands Cease-fire Before Talks With Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) demanded today that there should be guarantees for
cease-fire before it could enter into peace negotiations with its
feuding Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).
</P>
<P>
Sami Abdurrahman, head of the KDP delegation which has come to
Washington seeking peace formulas in northern Iraq, told reporters
before he met with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert
Pelletreau for peace talks that negotiations with the PUK must be
protected from violation of cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
"We want guarantee talks are talks" and not a smokescreen for
masking military intentions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdurrahman also defended the KDP's alliance with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein who sent troops in August into northern
Iraq, a Kurdish enclave designated by the U.S. and its allies
after the Gulf War in 1991, to help the KDP defeat its rival PUK.
</P>
<P>
He said the alliance with Saddam Hussein was necessary to
"balance" military help the PUK was receiving from Iran in
preparation for a surprise offensive.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department announced Wednesday that Washington
had won assurances from both leaders of the PUK and the KDP, and
Pelletreau would go to the Middle East to meet the two rival
leaders, the KDP's Massoud Barzani and the PUK's Jalal Talabani,
for consultations on peace.
</P>
<P>
The whole brokering plan was arranged Wednesday when Pelletreau
held telephone conversations with Barzani and Talabani, urging
them to stop fighting so that Saddam Hussein could not take any
advantages from it.
</P>
<P>
Now that the KDP fell short of endorsing a new American plan
for brokering peace with its rival PUK, the U.S mediations
encountered some obstacle.

<HEADLINE> French Communist Party Backs National Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Members of the National Committee
of the French Communist Party (PCF) today unanimously expressed
their support to PCF National Secretary Robert Hue and former PCF
First Secretary Georges Marchais over a judicial inquiry launched
by a Paris court last week.
</P>
<P>
The members of the National Committee, who met today at the PCF
headquarters to discuss the text for the 29th PCF Congress due to
be held on December 17-21, expressed "the deepest indignation"
over the judicial inquiry and their "total solidarity" with Hue
and Marchais.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Investigative Court announced earlier this week that it
had made an inquiry over possible "hiding of influence peddling"
in a financial affair between a research institute, which is close
to the PCF, and the Compagnie Generale des Eaux in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Hue said that it was strange that the accusation coincided with
the winning by a PCF candidate in the first round of a legislative
by-election in Gardanne, department of Bouches-du-Rhone, on October
13.
</P>
<P>
PCF candidate Roger Mei will face a candidate of the far-right
National Front (FN) party in a run-off on October 20 for a seat in
the National Assembly left over by Bernard Tapie, former deputy of
Bouches-du-Rhone, who was stripped of his parliamentarian seat over
corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
"Who can make us believe that they are not doing so for the
National Front?" asked Hue. "We ask just a little: Where does the
money of the FN come from?"
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, for the first time in the history of the PCF, the
draft text for the next party congress presented today by the PCF
leadership gave space to some opinions held by the PCF members who
differed with the leadership over some policies.
</P>
<P>
The draft text is focused on whether the PCF should join a
leftwing government led by the Socialist Party (PS) if the leftists
win the 1998 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Hue said that "the leftist forces are more and more situated in
a unitary, alternative dynamic," and hinted the likelihood of a
leftist coalition with the PS, on the condition that "the policy
which will be applied entirely differs from that of the right."
</P>
<P>
But the text said that "the obstacles bumped remain very
serious, and discords persist with the PS over the choice to be made
when facing up to the domination of money for all."
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Monde said that the PCF also for the first time
failed to mention a re-opening of debate over the rejection of the
Maastricht Treaty as a precondition for rallying with the PS.

<HEADLINE> Greece Favors Yugoslav Reintegration Into World Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Greece is ready to make
efforts in helping Yugoslavia to return quickly to the
international community, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos, who arrived here Wednesday on a two-day official
visit, said his country would ask the European Union to apply to
Yugoslavia the same visa regime it applies to the other states in
the region, said an announcement issued by the Yugoslav
Information Secretariat after Pangalos' talks with Yugoslav Prime
Minister Radoje Kondic.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis would soon
pay an official visit to Yugoslavia to further promote cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said the issues discussed at the talks covered
the development and promotion of Yugoslav-Greek relations and the
situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kontic regarded Pangalos' visit as part of the continuous and
intensive political dialogue and cooperation between the two
countries, it added.
</P>
<P>
Kontic and Pangalos agreed that the development of economic
cooperation between the two countries was going on smoothly.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, trade between Yugoslavia and Greece is
expected to be valued at about 250 million U.S. dollars, or
approximately as much as before the United Nations imposed
comprehensive sanctions on Belgrade in May 1992.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Child Soldiers Back to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Ten out of 2612 child soldiers,
aged under 18, from Angola's former rebel UNITA movement put down
their arms on Wednesday, looking forward to be back to school as
the war-torn country drew close to peace.
</P>
<P>
Posters like "We Want Peace, Not War" were everywhere to be
seen in the major stadium of the capital Luanda where 5,000
disarmed soldiers from the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) danced and sang to see off the
children.
</P>
<P>
The child soldiers, aged from 13 to 17 but already having
three to four years of military services, got dismissal passes
from officers of the government forces at the farewell ceremony
which marked the end of the abnormal military experiences for the
children.
</P>
<P>
Every child received about 200 U.S. Dollars from the United
Nations donation as the dismissal fee to help cover their living
expenses during the coming year.
</P>
<P>
The smiling children also got necessary food, daily
necessities and stationery as well promises from the government
to help them acquire access to schooling.
</P>
<P>
"These are lucky children who have survived the war," said an
officer from the government forces, adding the 20-year-old war
has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of children.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the UNITA child soldiers are expected to be
disbanded in the weeks to come, according to government
officials.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Launches Book on AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vie-President George
Saitoti today urged the mass media to play a leading role in
informing people of the ills of AIDS and its impact on the
economy and population.
</P>
<P>
In launching a book titled "AIDS in Kenya: Socio-Economic
Impact and Policy Implications", Saitoti warned that if the
spread of the HIV/AIDS is not stemmed in Kenya, the country could
expect to see the drop of life expectancy and infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
He noted that AIDS-related deaths had risen from 20,000 in
1990 to 86,000 so far this year, and a cumulative total of more
than one million people are expected to die from the epidemic by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti pointed out that the spread of the disease could lead
to a 15 percent drop of the Gross Domestic Product by year 2000,
compared to 2 to 4 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
A National AIDS Committee and an AIDS Program Secretariat have
been created by the Kenyan government in a bid to control the
spread of the killer disease.
