W. ALLEN WALLIS, 85, ECONOMIST, UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT

<P>
   W. Allen Wallis, an economist who became president of the
University of Rochester and held a variety of government posts in
Washington, died on Monday at Strong Memorial Hospital in
Rochester. He was 85 and lived in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke he suffered while visiting Rochester,
said Helene Snihur of the University of Rochester office of public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Wallis was the university's president and chief executive from
1962 to 1970 and its chancellor and chief executive from 1970 to
1975, Ms. Snihur said.
</P>
<P>
   A former president, Robert Sproull, said that in those 13 years,
``Allen Wallis was the principal architect of the University of
Rochester as we see it today.''
</P>
<P>
   The university, which opened in 1850, is known for the Memorial
Art Gallery, the Eastman School of Music, its schools of dentistry
and medicine and its library, which is especially strong in the
fields of medicine, history and music.
</P>
<P>
   It has 4,400 full-time undergraduates, 2,650 full-time graduate
students and 1,010 faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   While he was president, Wallis began a fund-raising campaign
that raised $46.7 million, nearly $10 million more than its
original goal, from 1965 to 1968. From 1968 to 1978, the
university's extensive expansions and improvements of its physical
plant included remodeling the Eastman School and expanding the
library and the Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   From 1962 to 1975, the university's annual budget rose to $200
million from $33 million, its faculty grew by 37 percent, its
number of graduate students doubled and its number of
undergraduates increased by 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   From 1975 until he retired from the university in 1982, Wallis
was its chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Before going to Rochester, Wallis, who was a statistician as
well as an economist, was dean of the University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business from 1956 to 1962.
</P>
<P>
   As an economist, Wallis was known for his firm faith in minimal
government intervention and in free markets. His writings included
the 1976 book ``An Overgoverned Society,'' a collection of his
speeches and essays, in which he argued that government regulations
and rules were fettering individual liberties as well as the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   He served in the administrations of four Republican presidents _
Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan _
although he said in 1959, ``I'm not actually a Republican.''
Instead, he said, he was an ``independent'' or even ``apolitical.''
He also served as a consultant to numerous governmental and
business groups.
</P>
<P>
   From 1959 to 1961 he was special assistant to Eisenhower, and
concurrently he collaborated with Vice President Nixon on the
report of the Cabinet Committee on Price Stability for Economic
Growth. In the 1970s, Wallis served in the Nixon and Ford
administrations as chairman of the President's Commission on
Federal Statistics and of the Advisory Council on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   From 1982 to 1989 he was under secretary of state for economic
affairs, mostly during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   George Shultz, a secretary of state in the Reagan years, said
Wallis was ``our truth teller.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Wallis' work as under secretary involved international
summit meetings. ``I relied on him,'' Shultz said. ``His
contributions to our work were immense.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallis was born in Philadelphia, received his bachelor's degree
in 1932 from the University of Minnesota and did graduate work
there, at the University of Chicago and at Columbia University. He
taught at Yale, Columbia and Stanford, and worked in World War II
for the U.S. Office of Scientific Research before joining the
University of Chicago business school faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Wallis was chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting
in 1977 and 1978.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 59 years, the former Anne Armstrong, died in 1994.
He is survived by two daughters, Nancy Wallis Ingling of Gambier,
Ohio, and Virginia Wallis Cates of Wagon Mound, N.M., and three
grandchildren.

FORMER BILLS PLAYER DAVIS TEACHING LESSONS LEARNED AS HIGH SCHOOL
COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Kenneth Davis is the first to admit that he could well
be doing other things than taking on a relatively monumental task
as head coach at Bishop Dunne _ a small, Catholic-church affiliated
high school in South Oak Cliff that hasn't had a winning football
season this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Financially secure after nine NFL seasons with the Green Bay
Packers and Buffalo Bills, the former TCU All-America running back
(1984) hasn't returned to the game he loves seeking glory or
support for his wife and two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get rich coaching high school football,'' Davis said
with a laugh. ``If I needed money, I'd be down there at I-35 and
Laureland turning bolts with my brothers at the shop \RDozen Davis
Automotive\S.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all, I wanted to get back close to the game. I could
be scouting for an NFL team right now, but I'm tired of living out
of a suitcase, and I want to be with my family. I'm enjoying what
I'm doing. And most of all, I have a lot of love and compassion for
my kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program hasn't had a winning season in almost 10 years,
so I've got a long road to go down. But I like the odds I'm up
against.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 36, retired from the NFL in 1994. During the next three
years, he said he ``mostly slept and rested my body.'' But he also
found time to fulfill a pledge to his mother. On May 11, 1996, he
walked across a stage and received his diploma from TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an emotional time for me,'' Davis said. ``It was the
first time since the incident at TCU that I had walked around the
campus. I actually had tears in my eyes because of so many of the
things that had transpired there. Now, I see all these young kids
with so much in front of them ...''
</P>
<P>
   The incident. As much as Kenneth Davis will be remembered as the
first Horned Frogs All-American since Bob Lilly (1959) and the
driving force in the 1984 Bluebonnet Bowl season (8-4), so too is
he linked with the scandal that broke in September 1985. He was a
central figure in the exposure of numerous NCAA violations that
included an alumni-sponsored slush fund that dealt weekly payments
to players and resulted in loss of scholarships, television money
and three years of probation.
</P>
<P>
   Davis left school the night the scandal broke, after one game of
his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I eventually made peace with myself over it,'' Davis said.
``But I don't think it will ever go away. I sit back and think I
had a chance to win the Heisman Trophy _ I had the heart and the
ability _ and know I can never go back and do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   As a generation has passed, the memory of that time lives on
only in the minds of those who were aware.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know anything about that,'' Dunne quarterback Myron
Hawthorne said, ``until coach Davis told us about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than hide the skeleton in his closet, Davis has used the
incident in his lesson plan for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to let kids know that we're not all perfect,'' Davis
said. ``We've all made mistakes, had faults in our lives. I try to
convey to them that it's all right to make mistakes; you just try
to limit them. And you can have your ups and downs and still be
successful in life. I've had my ups and downs and I want to share
them with my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is in only his second year of coaching. He spent last
season as offensive coordinator at a private academy in his wife's
hometown, Alexandria, La. When Dunne officials decided to make a
coaching change, Dunne alumni with TCU connections pushed the idea
of interviewing Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for new energy, and Kenneth was the perfect
fit,'' Dunne athletic director Stephen Guerrero said.
</P>
<P>
   The team has won only once in five games this season. But
Guerrero said Davis' fledgling tenure has already shown results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenneth is very energetic, very smart and he knows his
stuff,'' Guerrero said. ``I've already noticed that the kids play
with fundamentals that were previously lacking. They have really
taken to him, but he's very much the disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we've had a lot of \Rparents of perspective students\S who
have called or come by to visit just because Kenneth is the coach.
We've also begun to tap into some local businesses who will sponsor
scholarships for kids who can maintain a 3.0 grade-point average
and are also excellent on the field. We stress the scholar-athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word is getting around that Kenneth is here and it's helping
the school. He's a big supporter of the entire program.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis dreams of building a championship program. Though he and
other teachers and administrators operate on one-year contracts,
Guerrero says Dunne is committed to doing everything it can to keep
Davis long enough for him to accomplish that goal. But Kenneth has
other missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can instill in my kids just one trickle of
information that can help them move on in life,'' he said. ``The
self-discipline they need not only on the football field, but in
life. To have respect for people, for the game and for their
bodies. And that there are more good things in life than bad.''
Kenneth Davis profile A former all-state running back from Temple,
Davis gained 1,611 yards in 1984 at TCU to break Jim Swink's
29-year-old school record for rushing yards in a season. He led the
nation with an average of 7.64 yards per carry and was third
nationally with 146.5 yards per game and with 17 touchdowns. He had
seven runs of more than 50 yards and finished fifth in the Heisman
Trophy balloting. He played in four Super Bowls with the Buffalo
Bills.

AT IMPASSE, NBA CANCELS FIRST TWO WEEKS OF THE SEASON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to reword lede graf)   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The National Basketball Association, embroiled in a
labor dispute with its players, Tuesday canceled the first two
weeks of the 1998-99 season. It is the first time in the league's
51-year history that it will lose regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced the
cancellation after nearly three and a half hours of meetings
concluded at a Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to cancel 99 games between Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came
after the players association proposed the implementation of a tax
system instead of a hard salary cap, a proposal the owners said
they would respond to by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried our best today to try to do what was possible to
salvage the season,'' said Alonzo Mourning, the Miami Heat center.
``Unfortunately, it didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   After 35,001 games without a blemish, the NBA now joins the
National Hockey League, the National Football League and Major
League Baseball in having lost games to a labor dispute. Taking
into account that a three- to four-week period would be needed for
training camp and free-agent signings before the season starts, the
league said it would decide in two weeks whether to make further
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sad and disappointed,'' said the NBA commissioner,
David Stern. ``I consider it to be a collective failure, but I
honestly don't know what else we could have done. I do things that
I like to think are in the best interests of the game. And I
believe this is.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after what both sides agreed were the most
substantive talks since the owners imposed a lockout on the player
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen players, including union president Patrick Ewing and
vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and
Ty Corbin, attended the meeting along with Stern, Granik and five
members of the ownership committee _ Madison Square Garden
president Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin of Washington,
Gordon Gund of Cleveland, Les Alexander of Houston and Jerry
Colangelo of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The talks featured what the players association implied were a
bevy concessions made to the owners that they felt would
accommodate the league's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back
toward the owners.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involves the distribution of approximately $2
billion in league-wide income. The main sticking point has been the
owners' insistence on a salary cap without exceptions, the
implementation of which they believe would bring player salaries'
in line with revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   While the players did not discuss the elimination of the Larry
Bird exception _ a clause that allows a player to secure any amount
of money he wants in re-signing with his current team _ they did
address the exception in their taxation proposal. The main points
were as follows:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 50 percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above $18
million, a clause that would affect only a few players who
exercised their Bird rights. For example, if a player made $20
million, the team would be forced to put $1 million into a fund
that would most likely be distributed to low-revenue teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be provisions made for some players,'' said
Jeffrey Kessler, the chief outside counsel for the union. ``We
don't want to do anything that would encourage Chicago from getting
Michael Jordan back. And I think the league feels the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is similar to the luxury tax proposed by the union
in 1995 during negotiations, but it would not be nearly as liberal.
</P>
<P>
   _ A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league pays
out more than 63 percent of revenues in salary. Whatever figure
over that number reduces the salary cap the next year. If the
figure was $29 million over the salary cap, then the 29 teams would
work with a salary cap $1 million less than the previous season.
But the players would have an assurance that the salary cap would
go up at least $2 million before the credit goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also, if the 63-percent threshold is met, a reduction of
annual 20 percent raises would take effect for multi-year
contracts. Players would either get raises of 10 percent or the
rate of growth in league revenues. The union said this clearly
addresses the league's desire to bring salaries in line with
revenues. Since the owners re-opened the current agreement because
57.1 percent of revenue was going toward salaries, the 63-percent
figure would probably have to come down substantially for the
owners to agree to such a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teams would get a right of first refusal on free agents after
the fourth year for incoming rookies, meaning a player would be
contractually obligated to the same team for the first four years
of his deal. Currently, the rookie scale is three years and
includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his Bird rights
after two seasons _ a clause Kevin Garnett parlayed into an
astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, the players agreed to make marijuana a banned
substance. Details of testing have not been negotiated and no
specific discussions took place regarding testing for
performance-enhancing drugs, a provision the owners included in
their last proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the concessions, the players want an increase in
the minimum salary _ currently $272,500 _ and creation of an
average salary exception. This would allow every team above the
salary cap being able to sign one free agent per year for the
average salary _ currently $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're buoyed by the fact for the first time they've decided to
submit a counterproposal,'' the union's executive director, Billy
Hunter, said. ``I don't know if I'm more optimistic, but I can
earnestly say we can look our ballplayers in the eye and say we
made a valiant effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the players would finally be tested financially with
the cancellation of games, Hunter added: ``It's not about us
blinking. We want to reach an agreement. We're tired of the
rhetoric, we're tired of the game-playing. Our position all along
has been we don't want to accept a bad deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik said refunds to fans would be made at end of the calendar
month and that the first refund would include monies for canceled
preseason games. He estimated the losses into the ``hundreds of
millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have serious concern whether a tax system can
address the kind of needs we have economically,'' he added. ``But
there's some possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Stern, ``We owe it to the fans to go back and look at the
notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve the result we
wanted. It doesn't look promising, but we're going to spend the
next two days to see if we can give a favorable response.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the decision to cancel games was not surprising, it did
represent a major shift in prior labor stalemates. Both sides
reluctantly hammered out a deal in 1995 before the start of
training camp with the sole notion of not missing games and
preserving the NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, they could not come
to such an accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think these our the last games we have to
cancel,'' Granik said. ``But unless this or something else works,
or there's some dramatic breakthrough, I think that is certainly
not all of the season that's in jeopardy.''

KENNETH JERNIGAN, 71, ADVOCATE FOR THE BLIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Tenn., Iowa, Mich., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth Jernigan, who was a forceful advocate for the blind in
gaining access to jobs and to public places during his longtime
leadership of the National Federation of the Blind, died Oct. 12 at
his home in Baltimore. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, said Barbara Pierce, director of
public education for the federation and editor of its Braille
Monitor magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The current president of the federation, Marc Maurer, said
Jernigan ``has reshaped thinking about the blind in this country
and his writings have been translated into 100 languages.''
</P>
<P>
   Jernigan, who was blind at birth, started volunteering for the
federation, based in Baltimore, in 1951 and was president of the
organization from 1968 to 1986. During his unpaid tenure, the
federation, which was founded in 1940 by Jacobus tenBroek, became
one of the nation's most influential advocacy organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Jernigan was in the vanguard of a successful effort in the 1980s
to persuade the State Department to revise its policy excluding
unsighted people from the diplomatic service. He was also
instrumental in litigation that sought to stop what the federation
regarded as discriminatory practices among airlines in the
accommodation of the blind, one of which was that the airlines did
not want them sitting in rows near emergency exits.
</P>
<P>
   Jernigan appeared before a Senate subcommittee in 1989 and
showed a video demonstrating that sighted and blind people could
make an orderly evacuation of aircraft with equal ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem of blindness is not the loss of eyesight,''
he said in 1992. ``The real problem is the misunderstanding and
lack of information which exist. If a blind person has proper
training and opportunity, blindness can be reduced to the level of
a physical nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he made it clear that he took exception to
various statements he heard about blindness, which included the
suggestion that true Christians never lost their sight and that
blind people were not equal to sighted people because of their
``inability to see atoms.'' He called such statements ``gibbering
insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he loathed expressions of pity for the blind, who, he
maintained, did not want pity and were quite capable of taking care
of themselves and competing with sighted people in the job market.
</P>
<P>
   Among his accomplishments was the creation of the Newsline for
the Blind Network, in which the daily reports of The New York
Times, The Washington Post and other major American newspapers are
scanned and recited by a computer voice over telephone lines
available to blind people all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Jernigan also created the International Braille and Technology
Center in Baltimore, which researches and promotes technology to
aid the blind and maintains a job information bank for the blind
that can be accessed by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of his work in creating the Newsline for the
Blind Network, Jernigan received the Winston Gordon Award for
Technological Advancement in the Field of Blindness and Visual
Impairment this year from the Canadian National Institute for the
Blind. Among his many other awards was a citation from the American
Library Association in 1967 that praised him for his efforts in
making the contents of libraries available to the blind.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Jernigan was born in Detroit on Nov. 13, 1926. When he
was quite young, his parents, Jesse and Novella Inez Trail
Jernigan, moved near Beech Grove, Tenn., where they were farmers.
Their son was educated at the Tennessee School for the Blind in
Nashville. After high school, he ran a furniture store in Beech
Grove for a time, but then went on to college, earning his
bachelor's degree from Tennessee Technological University in
Cookeville, where he majored in social sciences.
</P>
<P>
   He originally wanted to be a lawyer, but his college counselor
told him that without sight, he should seek a more realistic goal.
In that era, many blind people were shunted off into such jobs as
piano tuning or teaching the blind. He decided to become a teacher
and got his master's degree in English from Peabody College in
Nashville in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   There he became active in the Tennessee chapter of the National
Federation of the Blind. He then went to California and taught at
the California Training Center for the Blind in Oakland from 1953
to 1958. In 1958, he became director of the Iowa Commission for the
Blind, which he reorganized and strengthened. He remained in that
post until 1978, running the federation as a volunteer at the same
time. Then he moved on to Baltimore and became the paid executive
director of the American Action Fund for Blind Children and Adults,
a sister organization of the National Federation of the Blind. He
held that post from 1978 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   His other activities included work for the National Advisory
Committee on Services for the Blind and Visually Handicapped;
special consultant to the executive director of the White House
Conference on the Handicapped, and consultant to the Smithsonian
Institution, advising on museum programs for blind visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement, he continued to write essays and booklets, many
of them of an inspirational nature, that were widely distributed to
sightless people all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Among Jernigan's survivors are his wife, the former Mary Ellen
Osborn, who assisted him in his work for the federation; a daughter
from a previous marriage, Marie Antoinette Jernigan Cobb of
Baltimore, and three grandchildren.

   WASHINGTON _ Congressional leaders revived legislation Tuesday
that would nearly double the number of employment visas available
for skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which is sought by high-technology industries,
appeared dead on Friday night, but budget negotiators agreed
Tuesday to include it in the omnibus spending bill that Congress is
trying to finish this week so it can adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big victory for the economy, which is being fueled
in large part by our high-tech industries,'' said the author of the
legislation, Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich. ``The legislation
strikes the right balance in safeguarding America's competitive
edge and protecting U.S. jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The final proposal represents a hard-fought compromise with the
White House, which had opposed Abraham's original measure because
of concerns that it lacked proper protections for American workers.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley companies have pushed hard for the visa
legislation, contending that they cannot find enough skilled
Americans to fill crucial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The industry won another victory Tuesday with the passage of the
Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act, which is intended to
protect technology and other start-up companies from lawsuits in
state courts over stock price fluctuations. The compromise measure,
now endorsed by both houses of Congress, imposes a single national
standard for such suits.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation to increase the number of so-called H1-B work
visas, a result of months of wrangling with the White House,
appeared to have been killed on Friday night after Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, questioned the validity of the high-technology industries'
claims of worker shortages and blocked a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   The final version increases from 65,000 to 115,000 the number of
H1-B visas available in each of the next two years and sets the
number at 107,500 in the third year.
</P>
<P>
   It requires that if 15 percent or more of a company's work force
consists of employees on H1-B visas, it must attest that they have
not replaced American workers.
</P>
<P>
   Companies hiring H1-B workers with master's degrees or higher or
at salaries of $60,000 or more would be exempt from that
requirement. There are also special exemptions for small businesses
and start-up companies.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also authorizes the Labor Department to
investigate suspected abuses of the program and imposes a $500
filing fee on visa applications and renewals. The more than $75
million raised by these fees would be used for training and
scholarship programs for U.S. citizens.

 &HT;    These Yanks aren't as good as their hype
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ These aren't the '27 Yankees. These aren't even the
'96 Yankees. These are nothing more than the lucky owners of a
pretty record during the regular season that doesn't mean much in
October.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees barely managed a second trip to the World Series
in three years Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium with a 9-5 victory
against a team without a No. 1 starter, with barely a No. 2 starter
and with a manager who makes stranger moves in the postseason than
the old Bobby Cox.
</P>
<P>
   So did Hargrove really start Richie Sexson over David Justice
Sunday on a hunch? And why did Hargrove order his hottest hitter in
Omar Vizquel Tuesday to attempt a sacrifice bunt with two strikes
in the first?
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel struck out.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, these Yankees can be had by the Braves, by the Padres,
by anybody who doesn't believe the hype. These Yankees carried a
.198 batting average into this decisive Game 6 of the American
League Championship Series. Even so, they were rolling to their
35th pennant after one of their rare offensive explosions during
the playoffs gave them a 6-0 lead through five innings, but then
came the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   After the Indians scored five runs that included a grand slam,
they changed the focus of the Yankees' howling faithful. They
definitely were howling. They were howling over the Yankees in
general (both with delight and disgust) and over David Justice in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   As for Justice, it's one thing for this former Braves slugger to
tell the truth about the sitting dead at Atlanta sporting events.
It's another for him to use his honest tongue to trigger World War
III inside the Yankee Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Yankees' David Wells fired the first shots when he
didn't have to. Among the prerequisites for being a pro athlete is
having the ability to become deaf on the road. Nobody apparently
told Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Since pitching the Yankees to a 3-2 lead in the series Sunday in
Cleveland, Wells still fumes while ranking Indians fans with the
scum of Lake Erie. That's because some of those Indians fans spent
Game 5 yelling ugly things about Wells' deceased mother.
</P>
<P>
   Justice acknowledged that those Indians fans were out of line,
but he also mentioned that they definitely learned how not to act
from their New York counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard everything about my mother, about my history,
too,'' Justice said. ``We all know, everybody knows, how rough they
can be. They can't get any rougher, unless they show up with
Uzis.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say Justice's ears are still ringing from the jeers
he received whenever his No. 23 came into view. A group of fans
even dropped pictures featuring an Uzi over the edge of the upper
deck whenever a Yankee pitcher struck out an Indian batter.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the Yankee Nation were battling the enemy in ways
foreign to their ancestors. During the 1978 World Series, the
Dodgers were pelted by batteries. Three years ago, Mariners manager
Lou Piniella pulled his team off the field during a Division Series
game, because of objects thrown its way. Once, the Indians' Mel
Hall had a frozen chicken tossed at him.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they mainly threw words _ at the Indians and at the
Yankees.

GOP MAY CONSOLIDATE IMPEACHMENT COUNTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are
considering folding most of the 15 counts outlined as impeachable
offenses against President Clinton into two broader accusations:
lying under oath and obstruction of justice, a Republican official
said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a year-end deadline imposed by the committee chairman,
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., members of the committee's staff have been
meeting to try to make the investigation into Clinton's conduct
with Monica Lewinsky more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings Tuesday, the staff talked about consolidating many
of the charges to increase the likelihood of reaching a conclusion
on some of the facts, said a Republican official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. For example, Republicans said that a charge
of conspiracy _ accusing Clinton of knowingly permitting Ms.
Lewinsky to lie about their affair when she filed a false affidavit
in the Paula Jones case _ would involve a lengthy fact-finding
mission on the committee's part and would delay movement on other
charges.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the Republicans' investigative counsel, David
Schippers, outlined 15 possible impeachable offenses _ including a
new charge of conspiracy _ to the committee. He dropped a few of
the 11 counts, including abuse of power, that independent counsel
Kenneth Starr had proposed in his referral to Congress. Schippers
was out of town Tuesday night and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Bob Barr of Georgia and Charles Canady of Florida, both
Republicans, have endorsed a scaling back on the charges so that
congressmen can concentrate on the most important counts. ``I think
we should focus it on the two or three most serious charges,'' Barr
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, in an interview with The Washington Post in its early
editions on Wednesday, said he was considering consolidating or
dropping some of the charges. But the Post also indicated that Hyde
softened his remarks later in the day, and told the Post that he
had made no decision to drop any charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican official said committee members want to limit the
inquiry mainly to the Lewinsky scandal. It is still possible that
later this year Starr would send to Congress other matters,
possibly sexual harassment accusations made against the president
by a former White House volunteer, Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members also continued to push ahead Tuesday with
Republican plans to seek agreement with the White House for
stipulating some of the factual background outlined in the Starr
report. If an agreement is reached, the committee would not have to
duplicate investigative efforts or call the same witnesses, but
would be able to use that evidence as part of its inquiry. The
Republican official said he hoped that Clinton would compromise and
acknowledge making misleading statements under oath.
</P>
<P>
   In Starr's referral to Congress, the president was accused of
lying under oath in his deposition given last January in the Paula
Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit and of lying to the grand jury on
Aug. 17. In both instances, Clinton said he had not had ``sexual
relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several weeks, committee staff will be mapping out
a strategy for conducting the inquiry. Hyde has said he hopes to
begin holding hearings in mid-November, after the elections.

BACKFIELD A WORK IN PROGRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's tailback situation remains jumbled, as
injuries and fumbles continue to affect the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Chad Morton (sore back) ran some light plays Tuesday,
his first practice in pads since the Florida State game more than
two weeks ago but hardly looked ready to play a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's far better, but I can't get too excited just yet,'' USC
coach Paul Hackett said. ``I'm not willing to say yet that Chad is
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton seemed unsure if he would be able to play Saturday
against Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the percentage I'm at, but I'm really looking
forward (to playing),'' Morton said. ``I'm healing up and it's
looking pretty good. The turf will be pretty hard so I'd probably
get hurt if I land on it. I can't do anything about it but tighten
up and play on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, coaches decided that freshman Frank Strong will
receive considerably fewer carries this week, thanks to his
penchant for fumbling. Strong, who strained his knee Tuesday, has
fumbled three times in the past three games.
</P>
<P>
   With Morton ailing and Strong's stock falling, that leaves
Petros Papadakis as the starter, but Hackett said that junior
Jabari Jackson would also get a chance to play against Washington
State. Jackson ran some plays with the first team Tuesday, although
he has only had three carries this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett praised Papadakis, who gained 118 yards against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy took a step to make up for Chad and that makes a
difference,'' Hackett said. ``That means we have a semblance of a
running game even without Chad.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Parker repents: Wide receiver Larry Parker said he had
trouble sleeping and nearly made himself sick thinking about the
personal-foul penalty he received against Cal, which negated a
58-yard touchdown run by Papadakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the stupidest thing I've done in my whole
life,'' Parker said. ``I can't believe I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   USC led 31-18 at the time but fumbled two plays later and Cal
scored 14 straight points to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said he hit Cal's Nate Geldermann from behind, about
25-30 yards behind Papadakis, in retaliation for a hit Geldermann
made on a kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bonehead play,'' Parker said. ``Clearly, after
watching the tape, I hit him from behind. Honestly, I really
thought I was in front, but I wasn't at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Papadakis, who was deprived of a touchdown, said he was not
upset at Parker over the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Larry. He apologized to me a couple times,''
Papadakis said. ``Stuff like that happens. It was no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Captains picked: The players elected four captains for the
remainder of the season: linebacker Chris Claiborne, kicker Adam
Abrams, wide receiver Billy Miller and Morton.
</P>
<P>
   __ Welch still out: Right tackle Matt Welch, who did not play
against Cal after being bothered by shoulder and neck injuries, did
not practice. He is considered questionable for this week.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Mark Cusano (sore thigh, ankle) also missed practice
but is expected to play.

MIAMI HERALD TO CLOSE SUNDAY MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct spelling of name in 7th and 8th grafs from Blecher
to Brecher)  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the most painful of a series of recent belt-tightening moves,
The Miami Herald's top editors said Tuesday that the newspaper's
Sunday feature magazine, Tropic, would close before year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's executive editor, Douglas Clifton, said the move
would save at least $2 million annually, more than half of which
would be used to beef up the sports and business pages.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the newspaper, which has used its
geographical base to become a showplace for news from the Caribbean
region, closed its international edition, which was distributed to
population centers in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Herald,
which is owned by Knight Ridder Inc., has also shut down bureaus in
Israel and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Tropic, which had been among the most high-profile members of
the dwindling club of Sunday magazines, is where the humor
columnist Dave Barry rose to prominence. (His column will still be
published in the Sunday newspaper.) Over its 30-year history, the
magazine has published work that won three Pulitzer Prizes.
</P>
<P>
   But like many Sunday magazines, which began to lose their
lucrative color advertising to special pre-printed advertising
sections, Tropic had long been a money-loser, Clifton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here in 1985,'' said Tom Shroder, executive editor
of Tropic, ``I was told, `You're taking a job at a place that might
not be here six months from now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Elinor Brecher, a feature writer who just finished a four-month
stint at Tropic, said the decision had had a more profound impact
on the newsroom than other cuts. When a foreign bureau is
eliminated, she said, ``there are always wire services.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much closer to home,'' Ms. Brecher said.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton said Tuesday that the five-member staff would have new
jobs in other departments of the newspaper. Shroder has been hired
as the Style section editor at The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to do the long stories that we habitually run
in the Sunday paper,'' Clifton said Tuesday in a telephone
interview. ``Now we'll just have a different venue for them.''

BRAVES: HOLD THE DEATH NOTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The concept of any baseball team coming back from a 0-3 deficit
in a seven-game series is logically absurd. It's never happened
before.
</P>
<P>
   But no player had ever hit 70 home runs in a season before 1998,
either. No rookie had ever struck out 20 batters in a game, no
Yankee had pitched a perfect game in 42 years, and both the Cubs
and the Red Sox played postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   So anything could happen in the two games remaining in the
National League Championship Series, especially with the Braves
involved. Asked before the playoffs to name the team most capable
of overcoming an 0-3 start, the Braves or Yankees would have been
the first choice of most people.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres still play in Atlanta tonight with a 3-2 edge in
games, but Bruce Bochy's decisions in Game 5 have given the Braves
a huge psychological advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Kevin Brown into the game was an attempt to drop the
hammer on the Braves right there. If it works, manager Bochy is a
genius and the Padres enter the collective mythology of postseason
play.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't. Brown looked unhittable and unbeatable prior to
his relief effort Monday, but Michael Tucker's home run makes Brown
suddenly mortal. If the Braves get to a Game 7 by winning tonight,
they will not look at Brown as an immovable object. ...
</P>
<P>
   Bochy deserves credit for managing as aggressively as he has
this postseason. The fact that he got the Padres to a 3-0 lead
without their 50-homer bat in the lineup, Greg Vaughn, has been
widely overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Moreso than the Brown decision, Bochy will likely be vexed
longer by Tucker's previous at-bat. The Braves' number 8 hitter
came to the plate with two out and a runner on second in the top of
the sixth. Rather than have Andy Ashby walk Tucker and take his
chances with pitcher John Smoltz, Bochy pitched to Tucker, who
singled to tie the game at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   If Tucker is walked, Bobby Cox has to decide whether to leave
Smoltz in the game. If Tucker is walked and Ashby gets Smoltz, the
Padres take a 2-1 lead into the bottom of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that happened after the Tucker non-decision impacted
the game the score of the game, how Cox uses his bullpen, whether
Ashby starts the seventh inning, whether Bochy feels the need to go
to Brown, and who the Braves send to the plate in ensuing innings.
...
</P>
<P>
   The Fox heirarchy was not pleased at all by the embarrassing
turn of events involving Felipe Alou.
</P>
<P>
   New Dodgers' General Manager Kevin Malone obviously believed
Alou was the right fit and that he could deliver him. The Foxies
have no problem with that decision, but they wish he had been a
little less public about things.
</P>
<P>
   Having Jim Leyland and Felipe Alou so publicly stiff the team is
a bit embarrassing for the owners, who are still hearing snickers
about the Mike Piazza trade. ...
</P>
<P>
   Malone has clearly reduced the speed of the search. He
apparently will take some time in assessing the remaining
candidates, and he's fleshed the list out from where it was Sunday,
when Davey Johnson and Kevin Kennedy were the only two names.
</P>
<P>
   A quick form chart on some of the candidates:
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kennedy, 3-1: The one-time Dodger minor league manager was
fired twice, but his players in Boston and Texas respected him.
Working the NLCS for ESPN Radio, Kennedy aggressively threw his cap
into the ring during Monday's pregame show, saying he would love
the opportunity to manage the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who lives in L.A., managed Dodgers like Eric Karros and
Raul Mondesi in the minors before moving on. Biggest detriment: He
and Tommy Lasorda are not compadres. Kennedy and Angels' manager
Terry Collins both felt Lasorda helped stall their careers because
he feared they were after his job.
</P>
<P>
   Davey Johnson, 9-2: The former Reds, Mets and Orioles manager
took each team to the postseason, and he won a World Series with
the Mets. But he was fired by each team because of a strained
relationship with management. Malone was the assistant G.M. in
Baltimore when Johnson was manager.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will also cost the Dodgers $6 million if they hire him.
Johnson and Bobby Bonilla did not get along in Baltimore, and it's
hard to see them co-existing here. If the Dodgers couldn't find
some sucker to trade for Bonilla and his $6 million pact, they'd
have to eat it.
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Baker, 10-1: Johnnie B. would be a great choice. But he's
been a Giant now for six years, and he's enjoyed beating his former
team. Baker's one-for-all-for-one managing style would take a hit,
too, if he tried to get out of his Giants contract (he has two
years left) to manage the Dodgers. Baker said in September that he
had no desire to manage anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Garner, 12-1: A lot of baseball people felt Garner, who
ended his career as a Dodger reserve, would be a great manager in
the N.L., because of his philosophy on handling pitchers and
playing long ball. But in their first year in the N.L., the Brewers
were a disappointment. He got a vote of confidence from management
this season, never a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine, 15-1: Valentine was the hot name when Lasorda
was the G.M. His hiring (he has a year left on the Mets contract)
would cause Malone PR problems. But if the list gets short enough,
who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Davey Lopes, 30-1: If Malone gets to the point where he doesn't
want a Johnson or can't get a Baker, he might reconsider his desire
for an experienced major league manager and go with Lopes. It's a
longshot at best.
</P>
<P>
   The field, 50-1: This would include Larry Bowa, Ray Knight, Doug
Radar, Phil Regan, Cito Gaston and Rene Lachemann, all one-time
managers who are now coaches, sportscasters or unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   If Malone gets this far into the list, Fox can go ahead and tear
down Dodger Stadium, because no one in Los Angeles will care
anymore.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: MILAN AIRPORT SHIFT; AIR-SAFETY SPENDING; FREQUENT
FLIER
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION WARNING: The following story is also being

(bl) 
 By JANET PIORKO

<TEXT>
<P>
   Travelers flying into Milan from other European cities after
Oct. 25 may want to double-check their destination before they
leave. According to a compromise worked out last week by the
European Commission and the Italian government, most major European
airlines are scheduled to move about two-thirds of their flights on
that date from Linate Airport, which is only five miles from the
center of the city, to Malpensa International Airport, which is 33
miles out.
</P>
<P>
   Malpensa, where a new terminal is set to open later this month,
is already used by U.S. carriers flying from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Though minor points in the compromise were still being worked
out Tuesday, according to Sarah Lambert, a spokeswoman for Neil
Kinnock, European Transport Commissioner, major issues have been
settled. The airlines involved, including British Airways,
Scandinavian Airlines System, Air France, Lufthansa and Alitalia,
are expected to use both airports until road and rail improvements
to Malpensa are completed in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government had originally decreed that all flights
would move to Malpensa except those on routes with more than 2
million passengers a year, Ms. Lambert said, an exception that
applied, notably, to Alitalia's shuttle between Milan and Rome. The
European airlines complained to the European Commission that the
plan was discriminatory: ``Why should Alitalia be able to feed its
hub in Rome when the rest of the European carriers cannot feed
their hubs from Milan?'' said Hans Ollongren, director of European
public affairs in Brussels for SAS.
</P>
<P>
   There is no direct rail link yet to the new airport, and roads
are inadequate, he said. A three-lane highway serving both the
airport and other regional traffic has no emergency lane, and ``if
there is an accident it is quite complicated,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   While not ruling out the possibility that SAS would contest the
commission's compromise in an Italian court because of the
difficulty of moving operations on such short notice, Ollongren
said his airline was generally going ahead with plans for the
switch.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines can decide which flights will go to which airport.
A minimum of 18 flights a week at Linate is guaranteed to the
various carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is not part of the European Union, Swissair faces the
prospect of moving all its Milan flights to Malpensa; the carrier
will ``pursue the necessary legal actions,'' according to Jackie
Pash, a spokeswoman. ``In particular, we are preparing an appeal to
the administrative court in Rome,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, passengers traveling to Malpensa should also check
their cash when they land. The taxi to the city runs at least $80.
</P>
<P>
   Spending for Safety
</P>
<P>
   Korean Air, having been ordered by the Korean government to cut
its domestic service by 20 percent for six months while safety
inspections are carried out, said it would spend more than $110
million to improve safety equipment and procedures. The airline has
been involved in a series of minor accidents since one of its
Boeing 747s crashed on a hillside in Guam last year, killing 228
people. The airline subsequently faulted the crew's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any airline that has been flying globally for almost 30 years
hits some rough spots along the way,'' said Penny Pfaelzer, a
spokeswoman for the carrier. ``These past 14 months have been
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic alert and collision avoidance systems have been
installed in the airline's fleet. Safety specialists are being
recruited to provide additional training to captains, first
officers and flight engineers. All new aircraft will be equipped
with enhanced ground proximity warning systems, which give pilots
earlier and more detailed warning about local terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Oct. 25, the carrier will have to cut 138 flights on 10
domestic routes a week for six months. There is no cutback in
service from the United States; in fact, the airline is adding
flights some routes, as it usually does this time of year, Ms.
Pfaelzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent-Flier Upgrades
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines has introduced a new automated upgrade system
for top-tier members of its AAdvantage frequent-flier programs.
Members in four categories _ Executive Platinum, Platinum, Gold and
AAirpass _ can request an upgrade when they make a reservation.
</P>
<P>
   American's Sabre computer reservation system will process the
request at the time a member becomes eligible _ for example, 24
hours before departure for a Gold member. The member is notified if
the upgrade is confirmed, by the option he or she has selected _
fax, phone, e-mail or pager. If the upgrade cannot be confirmed,
Sabre will keep trying to process the request up to two hours
before departure; if there is still no confirmation, passengers can
find out when they check in at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   The system eliminates the need for customers to call to confirm
an upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa-New York Service
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada will start nonstop service between La Guardia Airport
in New York and Ottawa on Oct. 26, with three daily flights on
weekdays. The carrier already flies between Newark International
Airport and Ottawa, but will cut the frequency on that route from
four weekday flights to three on Nov. 2. Weekend schedules vary. &QL;

BUSINESS TRAVEL: MILAN AIRPORT SHIFT; AIR-SAFETY SPENDING; FREQUENT
FLIER

   (DUPLICATION WARNING: The following story is also being

<TEXT>
<P>
   Travelers flying into Milan from other European cities after
Oct. 25 may want to double-check their destination before they
leave. According to a compromise worked out last week by the
European Commission and the Italian government, most major European
airlines are scheduled to move about two-thirds of their flights on
that date from Linate Airport, which is only five miles from the
center of the city, to Malpensa International Airport, which is 33
miles out.
</P>
<P>
   Malpensa, where a new terminal is set to open later this month,
is already used by U.S. carriers flying from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Though minor points in the compromise were still being worked
out Tuesday, according to Sarah Lambert, a spokeswoman for Neil
Kinnock, European Transport Commissioner, major issues have been
settled. The airlines involved, including British Airways,
Scandinavian Airlines System, Air France, Lufthansa and Alitalia,
are expected to use both airports until road and rail improvements
to Malpensa are completed in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government had originally decreed that all flights
would move to Malpensa except those on routes with more than 2
million passengers a year, Ms. Lambert said, an exception that
applied, notably, to Alitalia's shuttle between Milan and Rome. The
European airlines complained to the European Commission that the
plan was discriminatory: ``Why should Alitalia be able to feed its
hub in Rome when the rest of the European carriers cannot feed
their hubs from Milan?'' said Hans Ollongren, director of European
public affairs in Brussels for SAS.
</P>
<P>
   There is no direct rail link yet to the new airport, and roads
are inadequate, he said. A three-lane highway serving both the
airport and other regional traffic has no emergency lane, and ``if
there is an accident it is quite complicated,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   While not ruling out the possibility that SAS would contest the
commission's compromise in an Italian court because of the
difficulty of moving operations on such short notice, Ollongren
said his airline was generally going ahead with plans for the
switch.

ROBERT GILL, 87, COLLECTOR OF AMERICAN ANTIQUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Lee Gill, a longtime member of the New York
Stock Exchange and a prominent collector of American antiques, died
Sept. 24 at his home in Manhattan. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Gill was born in South Orange, N.J., in 1911 and attended
Choate. He joined Shields &AMP; Co. in 1932, and in the late 1940s
formed a company with three other members of the stock exchange,
but for most of his career he worked independently.
</P>
<P>
   Gill's interest in Americana began at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, where he was a regular visitor to the American collection from
the time it opened, in 1927, until his death. In the late 1930s he
began collecting first-edition books and Currier &AMP; Ives prints. He
also made regular visits to the Upper East Side gallery of Israel
Sack, a dealer in Americana and American antiques, becoming part of
what was then the small world of serious collectors of American
antiques, with members including Henry Ford, Henry Francis du Pont
and Ima Hogg.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942 Gill bought his first antique, a lowboy once owned by
John Hancock. Over the next few decades he formed an exceptional
collection, primarily 17th- and 18th-century Boston, Federal and
Newport furniture. He was known for his eye and the striking
arrangement of the collection in his apartment. In the late 1980s,
Gill also began collecting Chinese porcelain.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the U.S. government bought two pieces from his
collection, a small painting of the White House under construction
and a late Federal card table, which are still displayed in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Gill endowed a research fellow scholarship at the
Henry Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Gill's first wife, Caroline Townsend Chapman Gill, died in 1984.
He is survived by his wife, Melanie; a son from his first marriage,
Peter Gill of Bronxville, a stepson, Jack Chapman of Fort Pierce,
Fla.; two sisters, Barbara Betts of West Hampton Beach, N.Y., and
Mary Roby of Rochester, and five grandchildren.

BATTLE WITH BOTTLE LEADS TO REHAB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Gascoigne's long spiral downward hit bottom last weekend,
when a drinking binge in Ireland -- the latest in a lifetime of
drinking binges -- left him with no choice but to enter an alcohol
rehab program.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he'll emerge sober or not is a matter of great
speculation in Britain, where the controversial star has towered
over soccer since emerging as the greatest talent of his generation
in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Merson and Tony Adams, who have won battles with the
bottle, have long tried to steer Gascoigne toward getting help for
his problem, but for too long he's denied he's had one. Now, after
three drunken days in Dublin and with prodding from current club
Middlesbrough, he's out to beat his addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gazza has got a problem, and it's been building up for quite a
few years,'' said Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, a former
England teammate of Gascoigne's. ``We're going to try to help the
lad. We're not like other people saying they want to help him
because they've done nothing but try to destroy him. ... There's no
help coming from the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a tough year for the 31-year-old Gazza. First, he was
booted off England's squad prior to the World Cup because of poor
fitness (going ``berserk'' when he was cut, according to England
coach Glenn Hoddle's post-Cup tell-all book). Then, his wife of two
years, Sheryl, announced she was divorcing him, citing
``unreasonable behavior.'' Then, his friend David Cheek was found
dead after a night of drinking with Gascoigne and his best friend,
Jimmy ``Five Bellies'' Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   All of it has been fodder for Britain's tabloids. ``We saw what
happened to Princess Di, and people said things were going to
happen within the media to combat things like that happening
again,'' Robson said. ``But since Princess Di passed away, Gazza
has taken over, and he's in the paper every single day. It can be
absolutely anything. It's just nonsense, and all it's done is build
up tension, put pressure on the lad all the time, and that's got to
him. He's been starting to feel real stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jacobs, an addiction counselor who helped Adams in his
battle with alcoholism, says he fears Gascoigne will ``end up in
the gutter, in prison, or he will die'' unless he succeeds in this
latest battle. ``At the back of my mind, I have this horrific fear
that one of these days I'm going to pick up the paper and read that
Paul Gascoigne has committed suicide. If he doesn't change, I am
certain he will never celebrate his 40th birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun, one of the tabloids that have covered Gazza from every
angle, threw its support to him and announced it would ``hate him
to slip back into old habits.'' In that spirit, it promised a case
of Newcastle Brown ale -- chosen because Gascoigne is from
Newcastle -- to the first reader that spots him in a pub.''
</P>
<P>
   WHERE'S JORGE?
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Campos' return to Los Angeles comes four days late, but
he'll be at the Coliseum tonight to lead Pumas UNAM against Mexican
rival Guadalajara in the semifinals of the Coliseum Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Campos should have been in a Chicago Fire uniform on Saturday
night at the Rose Bowl, but an unprecedented -- and worrisome --
maneuver by Major League Soccer enabled him to leave early to join
his Mexican club. Campos, who starred for the Galaxy in MLS's first
two season, returned to Mexico on the eve of the playoffs because
a) Zach Thornton had won the Fire's starting goalkeeper job, and b)
Pumas needed him.
</P>
<P>
   Campos asked MLS brass for permission to go, and they granted
it. It sets a precedent that begs the question: How seriously
should MLS be taken if it allows its top stars to skip the most
important part of the season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that in the unique kind of relationship that we have
with the Mexican League, where we might get an accommodation like
that in the future, it was just one of those things that happen,''
said MLS commissioner Doug Logan. Said deputy commissioner Sunil
Gulati: ``If he was the starting goalkeeper or was going to be the
starting goalkeeper, it would be a non-issue. Jorge's commitment
was to be here and he certainly would have stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   So, because he's not a starter, that commitment wanes? It
doesn't make much sense, but the Fire isn't complaining. Thornton
led the league in goals-against average and saves, and although
Campos is supposed to return to the league next spring, it's likely
he'll end up in San Jose, where Alan Rothenberg is now running
things.
</P>
<P>
   But tonight he'll be in L.A. Pumas-Guadalajara goes off at 9
p.m., with Argentina's Gimnasia y Esgrima facing Guatemala's
Comunicaciones at 7.
</P>
<P>
   CORNER KICKS
</P>
<P>
   --Major League Soccer unveiled the finalists for its year-end
awards, and there weren't many surprises. The Galaxy has three
people up for honors, with Coach Octavio Zambrano -- one of three
Coach of the Year nominees announced Tuesday -- joining MVP
contender Cobi Jones and Defender of the Year candidate Robin
Fraser. Chicago's Bob Bradley and D.C. United's Bruce Arena join
Zambrano on the coaches list. Also announced Tuesday were the
Rookie of the Year finalists, with -- no surprise -- D.C.'s Ben
Olsen, Chicago's Josh Wolff and Columbus' Andy Williams the
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   --Finalists for MLS's Goal of the Year Award are Brian McBride,
Damian Alvarez and Jaime Moreno, and it's up to fans to determine
the winner. Voting is taking place at MLS's website,
www.mlsnet.com; my pick is Columbus' McBride, for an acrobatic
half-volley against Chicago, in part because he should have won in
'96.
</P>
<P>
   --David Regis, the French defender who played left back for the
United States at the World Cup, received a five-game European ban
as penalty for a red card he earned in FC Metz's UEFA Cup
first-round, second-leg match with Red Star Belgrade. Metz was
eliminated by Red Star, so Regis will serve his suspension the next
time his club qualifies for European play.

BRUIN A NEW IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Let's play a word association game. Take the words
UCLA and national championship and what do you think of?
</P>
<P>
   Basketball, naturally - it's hard to miss the banners at Pauley
Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps volleyball or soccer. Or even softball or water polo.
</P>
<P>
   All those teams have won NCAA titles in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Football?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Bruins did win a national title in 1954, but they've
rarely been in sniffing distance since. Just go to the Rose Bowl
every few years, beat USC more often than not and the natives are
happy.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that when newly hired football coach Bob Toledo
addressed his team for the first time in January, 1996, the
audience couldn't help but click their tongues and roll their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we all sat in that first team meeting and he started
talking about a national championship, we all kind of snickered at
him,'' said Kris Farris, a fourth-year junior offensive tackle.
``It wasn't in our mindset then.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here I didn't even think about it. I would
have thought SC would have won two national championships, but I
never thought we'd be in the hunt for it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they are now.
</P>
<P>
   In less than three seasons, Toledo has UCLA working on a
school-record and nation-leading 14-game winning streak and ranked
No.2 in the nation, the highest since it was No.1 for one week in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins (4-0) finish the regular season unbeaten they are
all but assured of playing for the national championship Jan. 4 at
the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   So, just how did they get here from there?
</P>
<P>
   It all starts at the top, where the expectations aren't the only
thing Toledo has reshaped.
</P>
<P>
   He's put a heavy emphasis on mental and physical toughness,
overhauled the coaching staff and proved to be a willing listener
as well as a masterful motivational speaker. He's helped create a
family atmosphere, all the while not compromising in the areas of
discipline or academics.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, hindsight makes it easy to wonder why UCLA ever
bothered offering the job to Northwestern's Gary Barnett or wooing
Colorado's Rick Neuheisel or Glen Mason, then at Kansas, before
turning to Toledo, who had been an offensive coordinator under
Terry Donahue the previous two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob's really exceeded my expectations,'' said UCLA athletic
director Pete Dalis. ``He's been much more than I thought he'd be
when I hired him, but it's like Terry Donahue used to say: Nobody's
born a head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would agree more than Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   He had twice been a head coach before, having two successful
seasons at UC Riverside in the mid-70s, but after three seasons as
USC's secondary coach, he struggled to a 14-30 record at Pacific,
which fired him at the end of his fourth season.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo spent the next six seasons as the offensive coordinator
at Oregon and five years in the same position at Texas A&AMP;M before
he was fired by head coach R.C. Slocum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience, the age and being around more has made me
better,'' said Toledo, who has just four holdovers from Donahue's
staff. ``That's part of being a head coach before - growing up and
learning from different situations you've been put in. It's called
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience has led Toledo to confidently embrace great
expectations, a marked contrast from Donahue, who would publicly
fret about playing Cal State Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great. I think it's exciting,'' Toledo said at
Pac-10 media day when the Bruins were picked to win the conference.
``I'm not sitting up here beating my chest saying we're going to
win the national championship, but I'm saying that yes, we'd like
to compete for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has had little trouble getting that through to his
players. He has made his mark most emphatically as a motivator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great feel for when guys need to be kicked in the
butts and when you've got to loosen the reigns,'' quarterback Cade
McNown said. ``He relates real well to the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo wanted his players to be physical against Arizona last
year, so he paired players up in the locker room before the game
and had them go through hitting drills. The fired-up Bruins led
20-0 in the first quarter and won handily.
</P>
<P>
   He challenged his defense two weeks ago against Washington
State, winning the coin flip and allowing the Cougars to have the
ball first. UCLA came up with three turnovers in the first quarter
and the Bruins won easily.
</P>
<P>
   He brings in speakers during the season, ranging from a Las
Vegas comedian to someone discussing racial reconciliation. He
shows his team a video tape of great comebacks each year to get
across another point: don't ever give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think motivation is overlooked a lot,'' Toledo said. ``A lot
of coaches assume because you've got Xs and Os, that's going to win
the game. Or because you've got better players you're going to win
the game. But they're still young people and they need to be
motivated to play. Somehow you've got to find a way to motivate
them.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Toledo's first orders of business was to change the UCLA
image of The Gutty Little Bruins, who were often perceived as being
as soft as their powder blue uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger, badder Bruins are the product of one of Toledo's
first hires: strength coach KevinYoxall, whose fu-manchu mustache,
clean-shaven head and drill sergeant's voice do nothing to diminish
the suggestion that he means business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no getting around Yox,'' said guard Andy Meyers, a
fifth-year senior. ``I attribute so much of our success to Yox and
all the strength coaches. We wake up in the morning (in the
offseason) and go in there and do the hardest workout I've ever
done and the hardest running I've ever done and then you go out the
next day and it's even harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The weight room, which used to be painted blue and yellow is a
more stark blue and white. Gone are the weight machines, replaced
by free weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be all pretty and nice,'' Meyers said. ``Now, it's
just work.''
</P>
<P>
   Also gone is the infamous Red Army, the legion of players in red
jerseys who, with backward baseball caps, would ride the stationary
bikes that once lined the practice field. Now if a player is too
hurt to practice, he rides a bike inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought UCLA was a finesse team and not very
physical,'' Meyers said. ``Coach Toledo has taken a real blue
collar approach. It's old style football - more of a Nebraska
approach. You hammer it out day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo admits it took him a while to come around to this
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always going to drop back and throw the ball 50 times a
game,'' said Toledo, an accomplished quarterback at San Francisco
State. ``I always believed that you win it by throwing it. I was a
quarterback and I threw a lot of passes. But as you grow and
realize what's really important you realize if you don't run the
football you become one dimensional and I think the other problem
that goes along with that is your defense becomes a little soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be tough on defense and going to have a
tough mentality on offense, you have to run the ball. To do that,
you have to be physical.''
</P>
<P>
   The players have taken this to heart - in some cases, too much
so. Toledo was repeatedly stopping practice in August because it
was too physical.
</P>
<P>
   The old image took a fatal beating Saturday at Arizona, where
the Bruins hadn't won in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   They lined up with two tight ends virtually all night and rushed
for 297 yards in a 52-28 win, prompting Arizona coach Dick Tomey to
say, ``They were tougher than we were. We have to admit that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another area of emphasis for Toledo is the Bruin Family.
</P>
<P>
   He often reminds others that while he's a football coach, he's
coaching people, too.
</P>
<P>
   When receiver Brad Melsby was distraught last season about his
difficult recovery from knee surgery, Toledo allowed him to leave
the team for several months.
</P>
<P>
   He allows married players, like seniors DuVal Hicks and Shawn
Stuart, to live with their spouses instead of the dorms during
two-a-days. And he gives his assistants Thursday nights off so they
can spend time with their families. Toledo, 52, who has three
children with his wife Elaine, has lamented watching too many
colleagues ruin their marriages through neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo also makes a point of putting leadership in the players'
hands, even forcing soft-spoken Larry Atkins, an All-American
safety candidate, to address students at a Friday pep rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have a lot of player meetings where we'd start out,
`We need to do this, we need to do that, we need to play harder,'
'' said Farris. ``After 20 minutes it would turn into the offense
yelling at the defense and the defense yelling at the offense. So
what (the captains) did last year was say, `No more of those.'
We're having one player meeting and that's it. We're going about
this as a team. No finger pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   That atmosphere played no small part in helping UCLA land what
several recruiting services labeled the best freshman class in the
nation this season.
</P>
<P>
   DeShaun Foster, one of the nation's top running back recruits,
was surprised how warmly he was treated by the two upperclassmen,
Jermaine Lewis and Keith Brown, who's job he is after.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thomas, a nationally recruited linebacker from Imperial,
was also pursued by USC, Florida State, Texas and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches here never lied to me,'' Thomas said. ``Notre Dame
didn't seem like they really cared and Coach Toledo was a lot
different than Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like you can always to talk to the coaches when you
need to. It didn't seem like that at the other schools. When you go
away to school, you're away from your family, away from a lot of
your friends. You need some older people that you can look up to.
If I ever had a problem, I'd never be embarrassed or shy to talk to
him. I know I'm always welcome in his room.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, though, has proved more than capable of tough love.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't play nose guard Damon Smith against USC last year
because of his behavior at practice. He has benched cornerback
Marques Anderson for not hustling and he suspended Lewis for his
involvement in a fight, even though Lewis - by all accounts - did
not throw the first punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He demands that the team members adhere to his policies,''
said Dalis. ``He really expects them to behave in a certain manner
and the kids really respond to it because he does what he says he's
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He told somebody (Smith) he wasn't going to play him and he
didn't care if cost us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has shown its appreciation by ripping up Toledo's original
four-year contract. He was recently presented a new one, good
through 2003, for $453,000 per year, nearly doubling the deal he
initially signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going anywhere,'' Toledo said. ``I'd like to stay here
the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalis said the deal was done to ensure that Toledo be at UCLA
for a long time. Which may just lead to a new word association.

TEKELEC STOCK UP 14 PERCENT

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares in telecommunications equipment maker
Tekelec rose more than 14 percent on news that Sprint will buy $4
million to $5 million worth of its switching equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Tekelec shares gained $1.9375, or 14.02 percent Tuesday, to
close at $15.75. More than 1.4 million shares traded hands Tuesday,
or 2.3 times the issue's six-month average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   The boost is a welcome respite for Tekelec investors, who last
week saw their shares hit a 52-week low of $10.625 on general
weakness in the telecom sector. With Tuesday's gain, Tekelec shares
have risen 48.23 percent since Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint deal comes on the heels of a similar purchase by AT&AMP;T
in September for that company's wireless telecom service. Both
deals are seen as a vote of confidence for Tekelec's Eagle line of
switching equipment, which routes and forwards calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of opportunity ahead of them,'' said analyst
Kevin Slocum at SoundView Technology Group in San Francisco. ``This
is another in a series of fairly visible wins, and that's got to
strengthen the confidence of prospective customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tekelec, founded in 1979, was once known primarily for its
diagnostic equipment. If a problem arose on a computer network,
Tekelec's tools could help figure out why data was not being
properly delivered from one point to another.
</P>
<P>
   While it still makes diagnostic products, increasingly the
company has come to rely on sales of its switching equipment used
in data and telecom networks.
</P>
<P>
   All five analysts covering the company have it rated a ``buy''
or ``strong buy.'' Tekelec had 1997 earnings of $29 million on
$125.1 million in sales.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ghosts have hung over Yankee Stadium all season,
David Cone once remarked, as the Yankees pursued their place among
the greatest baseball teams in history. But other ghosts haunted
them, ghosts of a very recent past, until the Yankees won the
American League pennant Tuesday night with a 9-5 victory over the
Cleveland Indians in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who will play in the World Series for the 35th time
and the second time in the last three seasons, exorcised the awful
memory of their 1997 playoff elimination by the Indians, who have
not won a World Series in 50 years. Faced with a 2-1 deficit in
games in this series, the Yankees came back to win Games 4, 5 and
6, saving the Game 2 goat, Chuck Knoblauch, from the eternal
disgrace that befell Fred Merkle and Bill Buckner.
</P>
<P>
   Before a crowd of 57,142 at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night,
Scott Brosius hit a three-run home run, Derek Jeter lashed a
two-run triple and Ramiro Mendoza and Mariano Rivera provided
flawless relief pitching to help win a game in which the Yankees
nearly blew a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the World Series, the Yankees can establish their legacy
once and for all, after winning 114 games in the regular season,
three straight in the Division Series against Texas and four of six
in the ALCS with Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees, in the World Series for the second time in
three seasons, will play host to the winner of the National League
Championship Series, San Diego or Atlanta, in the first two games
of the Series on Saturday and Sunday nights. The Padres lead that
playoff, 3 games to 2, with Game 6 to be played Wednesday afternoon
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells, unbeaten in these playoffs, is likely to pitch Game
1 for the Yankees, who have won a combined 121 games this year in
the regular and post-seasons, a record.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees had lost the league series to Cleveland, the
glossy memory forever stuffed into the mental album of despair
borne by devastated fans would have been the image of Chuck
Knoblauch, the Yankee second baseman, standing at first base in the
12th inning of Game 2 and pointing dramatically to the baseline
while the ball lay untouched behind him and the Indians scored the
run that would decide the game and even the series at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, booed angrily by fans in his turn at bat immediately
following that mental mistake last Wednesday, would never have been
forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees took two of three games in Cleveland over the
weekend and took control of the series as and Knoblauch at least
earned a finite probation for good behavior _ he admitted his
mistake the day after _ and for his good play. Knoblauch reached
base in four of five plate appearances in Game 5 on Sunday and
started a pivotal eighth-inning double play in the Yankees' 5-3
victory.
</P>
<P>
   When Knoblauch was announced before his first plate appearance
Tuesday night, many among the 57,142 rose and cheered, as if to
say, ``You're forgiven, for nine innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch placed the Cleveland starter Charles Nagy on the
defensive in the first inning, fouling off a two-strike pitch, and
then another and another and so on, until Nagy had thrown nine
pitches. Even after Knoblauch grounded out to shortstop, a core of
fans cheered him, understanding that he had chopped away a small
piece of Nagy and given the Yankee hitters to follow a chance to
see what Nagy did or did not have.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter chopped a roller toward third base and hustled out a
single, and with the count 2-2, Jeter broke from first on a
hit-and-run and Paul O'Neill lined a curveball to right for a
single, Jeter moving to third.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams singled home one run and a sacrifice fly by
Chili Davis scored another, and the Yankees had a 2-0 lead right
away _ the fifth time in the six games of this playoff they had
scored in the first inning. Nagy threw 27 pitches in the inning, 18
after Knoblauch's at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi smacked a single one out into the second inning for
New York, and Knoblauch then pulled a fastball into the left-field
corner, where Indians left fielder Brian Giles fielded the carom
perfectly before allowing the ball to pop out of his glove as he
prepared to throw. Girardi scored and Knoblauch had a double, his
first extra-base hit since Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees kept the pressure on Nagy in the third. Williams had
the second of his three hits and then should have been called out
when Cleveland second baseman Enrique Wilson flipped the ball to
second for an apparent forceout on a grounder by Chili Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But Ted Hendry _ the umpire who came under fire from the Yankees
in Game 2 over his decision to not call interference on the play
that Knoblauch botched _ called Williams safe.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Scott Brosius _ who nearly hit a three-run
homer in his first at-bat _ smashed a three-run homer over the
center-field wall. Jeter, as usual, burst from the dugout clapping,
a brigade of teammates following. The Yankees had a 6-0 lead with
David Cone on the mound. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Except that Cone appeared to suffer some sort of a leg injury
covering first base in the third inning, and he imploded in the
fifth, allowing three straight hits (one of which hit Hendry on the
backside, in another moment of ignominy for the umpire) and then a
bases-loaded walk to force home a run. Cone struck out Manny
Ramirez for the second out and the crowd roared. But Jim Thome
blasted a titanic grand slam on Cone's next pitch, silencing Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, the Indians had drawn to within 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   But Cleveland's defense gave away three runs in the bottom of
the sixth, an inning that began with the Gold Glove shortstop Omar
Vizquel botching an easy throw to first. Girardi walked and with
one out, Jeter launched a high drive to right-center. Ramirez
charged back to the wall, looking up and leaping dramatically, only
to be guilty of resembling Knoblauch in Game 2: he ignored the
baseball, which landed behind him at the base of the wall as
Ramirez climbed it.
</P>
<P>
   Two runs scored, and so did Jeter one out later on another
single by Williams.

FOR YANKS, IT WAS INEVITABLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Finally imitating themselves instead of a
weak-hitting team struggling for runs, the Yankees forged ahead to
the World Series on Tuesday night in a game that was filled with
plays that could only be described as inexplicable.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' conquest of the Cleveland Indians in the American
League Championship Series, secured with a 9-5 victory in Game 6 at
Yankee Stadium, was completely understandable. The Yankees won 114
games during the season; the Indians 89. The Yankees outscored
their opponents by 309 runs; the Indians outscored theirs by 71.
</P>
<P>
   But before the teams parted ways for the winter, they tiptoed
through a maze of plays that left many in the crowd of 57,142
scratching their heads when they weren't roaring for the Yankees or
jeering the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hendry, the second base umpire, was involved in two of the
head-scratching plays that turned out to have major impacts on the
game. Hendry was the home plate umpire in Game 2 when he made a
call that had the greatest impact on the outcome of any game in the
series: He ruled no interference on Travis Fryman as he ran inside
the line to first.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the verbal eruption of the Yankees' owner after that
game, not a word was heard Tuesday night from George Steinbrenner
about Hendry's intrusion on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal play of the game came in the third inning. With
Bernie Williams at first, Chili Davis rapped a grounder between
first and second. Enrique Wilson fielded the ball and bounced a
throw to second, where Omar Vizquel appeared to force Williams. But
Hendry ruled that Vizquel came off the base before he caught the
ball, meaning Williams was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Television replays clearly showed that Vizquel's foot remained
on the base as he caught the ball, but that electronic image did
not help the Indians. Charles Nagy retired the next two batters,
meaning the Indians should have been out of the inning. But with
only two out, Scott Brosius was able to bat, and he slugged Nagy's
first pitch over the center field fence for a three-run home run
that doubled the Yankees' lead to 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   On that play at second, Hendry used his hands to make his call.
In the fifth inning, another part of his body came into play.
</P>
<P>
   With Cleveland runners at first and third and no one out,
Vizquel lashed a line drive that was headed for single territory in
right center field. But Hendry was in the ball's path, and it
struck him smack on the rear end.
</P>
<P>
   Hendry thus became the second member of the six-man umpiring
crew to be hit by a ball in this series. In Game 4, Jim McKean,
also umpiring at second base, was in the way of a throw by Sandy
Alomar Jr. when Derek Jeter was trying to steal second. The ball
hit McKean and caromed into right field, enabling Jeter to continue
to third.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rule governing Vizquel's batted ball, Wilson had to
remain at third on what was credited as a single instead of scoring
the Indians' first run. But at least he wound up scoring on an
ensuing bases-loaded walk to David Justice, and later in the
inning, Jim Thome hit a grand slam, slashing the Yankees' lead to
6-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, however, increased their lead with the aid of an
unusual play and another weird one.
</P>
<P>
   When Brosius led off the sixth inning with a grounder to short,
Vizquel fired the ball high past first for an error. The
slick-fielding shortstop had not made an error in his previous 17
league series games _ tying the record _ and in 46 post-season
games.
</P>
<P>
   A walk and an out then set the stage for the weird play. Jeter
started it by crushing a Dave Burba pitch to the right field fence.
Manny Ramirez, one of the most adventuresome outfielders in the
game, raced to the fence and leaped against it, but he did not look
back to see where the ball was. Maybe he thought the ball would
bounce off his head and Kenny Lofton, the trailing center fielder,
could catch it on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The ball, however, missed Ramirez's head, hit the base of the
wall and became a two-run triple. Jeter then scored on a single by
Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses to this baseball version of ``The Twilight Zone''
should have known they were in for a weird one from the very first
play of the game. Lofton bunted along the third base line, and the
ball rolled on the chalk line itself and appeared to be veering
foul. Instead of letting it go foul, Brosius picked up the ball and
threw it wildly past first.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel, the next batter, immediately added to the bizarre
proceedings. He went to bat with 8 hits in his previous 11 at-bats
and 10 hits in 20 at-bats altogether in the series, but he bunted
with two strikes and fouled off the pitch for a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   But he would not be alone in executing that play. Chuck
Knoblauch did the exact same thing in the sixth inning before
Jeter's triple.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar chipped in with yet another bizarre bunt attempt. His
came in the second inning with runners at first and third and one
out. The Indians, losing 2-1 at the time, needed a hit there, not a
bunt. Alomar fouled off the bunt, then struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Of all of the participants who were involved in inexplicable
plays, Alomar might have had the best excuse. He had missed the
previous game and a half with a lower back ailment, had received a
cortisone shot so he could play and walked and bent over like a man
with a bad back.
</P>
<P>
   Now Alomar will have four months to rest his back. The Yankees
don't have any time to rest. But then, they're grateful they don't.

REED FINDS HIS PLACE AS DEFENSIVE LINEMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Cal State Northridge coaching staff asked
Quinton Reed to move from linebacker to nose guard, so he obliged.
Anywhere they want him to play is fine, as long as he gets to play.
</P>
<P>
   He's 33 years old, an eight-year member of the Army who served
eight months in Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   He's not at CSUN for the sole purpose of practicing, so why
wouldn't he move positions to get more playing time?
</P>
<P>
   `I'm loving it, plus we're winning and we might get a
championship, so this is great,'' said Reed, who played two seasons
at Mount San Jacinto College. ``I always wanted to play football
again before I go six feet under.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, seven defensive linemen were hurt, so anything Reed
could do was great.
</P>
<P>
   That depleted unit is coming back, but after Reed's performance
last week, which included a key fourth-down tackle late in the
game, the 6-foot-2, 270-pound junior has a home on the defensive
line. That's where he'll remain as No. 16 CSUN travels to
Sacramento State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he was a little apprehensive early, but he started
knocking people backwards on the line of scrimmage,'' said
first-year CSUN coach Ron Ponciano, who recruited Reed while at San
Jose State. ``He just wasn't used to (taking on a block) and then
making a play. He brings a maturity that only a guy who's been to
war can bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question he was a victim of age discrimination. If
he was 20 or 21, he would be at a big-time Division I school.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Shutting down the run: CSUN's running game has been
unproductive this season, which is just the opposite of what
Sacramento State's Charles Roberts is experiencing. He's outrushing
CSUN by nearly a 3 to 1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   While the Matadors wallow on the bottom of the Big Sky
Conference with 341 rushing yards in five games, Roberts has run
for 1,096 yards. Of course, the Hornets are 2-4 (0-3 Big Sky) while
CSUN is 4-1, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to use this terminology, but if you watch him, he does
remind you of Barry Sanders,'' Ponciano said. ``He can hit the hole
and then make a 90-degree cut in a heartbeat. He's a spectacular
runner. He is special.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, second in Division I-AA, has rushed for more than 220
yards twice in a game and had runs of 69, 67 and 64 yards. CSUN's
defense is fifth in the conference against the run, allowing 185.8
yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   __ OL health: Just when the offensive line was gaining depth and
regaining its health, two offensive linemen missed Tuesday's
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Right guard Tim Shoffeitt sat out after pulling a muscle in his
back while lifting weights. He was replaced by Joe Bergman but said
he expects to play Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Center Julio Alcala remained in San Diego with his mother, who
is in the terminal stages of leukemia. His availability for the
Sacramento State game is not yet known. If he doesn't play, Beau
Cherry will start at center.

WILLIAMS FEELS ESTRANGED IN THE POST-SEASON

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernie Williams has been extremely aloof during the
post-season, so distant that Manager Joe Torre had a private
meeting with him and so distant that General Manager Brian Cashman
and other Yankee officials have been repeatedly quizzed about it.
Torre acknowledged that Williams, who is usually quiet and
introspective, has not been himself. Even Williams basically
conceded it.
</P>
<P>
   Sweating profusely as he stood beside the batting cage Tuesday
night before Game 6 of the American League Championship Series with
the Cleveland Indians at Yankee Stadium, Williams was told by a
reporter about how uncomfortable he seemed lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I'm not here,'' Williams interjected.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed nervously and added: ``I try to be during the games.
After the game, it's another story.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Yankees advanced to the World Series by beating the
Indians, 9-5, they will need their 30-year-old center fielder to be
physically and mentally sharp to have the best chance to cap their
special season.
</P>
<P>
   Williams singled in the game's first run in the first inning
Tuesday night, singled and scored in the second inning, walked to
lead off the fifth and singled home the Yankees' ninth run in the
sixth, before being thrown out stealing. The output represented a
significant improvement after he had mustered five hits, no homers
and three RBIs in his first 28 post-season at bats.
</P>
<P>
   When Torre was asked if he had noticed that Williams had been
uncharacteristically distant, he said, ``Oh yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard,'' the manager said. ``Bernie is OK. There is
nothing going on there.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams did not travel back from Cleveland on the team plane
Sunday night; instead he hustled out of the clubhouse and left
earlier on a commercial flight, with Torre's permission. The
Yankees have held two optional workouts during the ALCS; Williams,
who is considered a team leader, bypassed the one in Cleveland and
was unavailable for the one in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the most polite and affable players on the Yankees,
Williams has almost always been available after games to discuss
his performances, both positive and negative. But he has been
extremely eager to leave the park during the post-season, without
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In the ALCS opener, Williams ripped two hits and drove in two
runs as the Yankees silenced the Indians, 7-2, but he bolted out of
the clubhouse less than 10 minutes after the game in view of more
than 100 reporters. Instead of turning left to leave Yankee
Stadium, as he normally would, Williams turned right and took a
longer way out, not even making eye contact with reporters. Some
Yankee officials were shocked.
</P>
<P>
   There are many players who do not talk to reporters, but that is
out of character for Williams. After Games 4 and 5, Williams spoke
briefly to reporters and departed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie doesn't say a whole lot unless you go in there and try
to dig in,'' Torre said. ``I think he's fighting it a little bit,
and feeling that he's let people down and like he thinks he should
get more hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre realized that Williams was struggling in this post-season,
so he met with him. Neither man would divulge the conversation, but
Williams said: ``Talking to Joe is always helpful. Am I pressing?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Yankees have reached the World Series, Williams has
at least two more weeks as a Yankee before he presumably tests free
agency. When asked if he was concerned about the possibility of his
career with New York coming to a close, Williams said, ``No, I'm
not thinking about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman, who will be among the officials who decide if Williams
should be offered $11 million or $12 million a year, was asked if
he was worried about the post-season performance of a player who is
making $8.25 million and is apparently struggling in more ways than
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it worry me? No,'' Cashman said. ``He won a batting title
with his contract out there. I don't think any of that bothers
him.''
</P>
<P>
   After an intense batting practice on Tuesday night, Williams
essentially admitted that he was not himself, but he also contended
that he was fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is OK with me,'' Williams said. ``So far, so good.
I'm trying to get this done.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a time for loyalty and convention in
baseball. It is called the regular season. When they start hanging
the bunting from the facades, a baseball manager must sometimes be
blatantly expedient.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, known for his loyalty to the troops, stayed with
David Cone for one batter too long Tuesday night. It cost the
Yankees a grand slam by Jim Thome and frightened most Stadium fans
into catatonia, if you can imagine that, but the Yankees held on
for a 9-5 victory over the Cleveland Indians to win the American
League pennant, and everybody found their voices again.
</P>
<P>
   This team won 114 games during the regular season and swept
Texas three straight in the division series, almost awesomely, and
was being measured against the best teams in history _ Murderers'
Row of 1927, the 1961 Yankees of Mantle and Maris and Ford, the Big
Red Machine of Cincinnati in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Yankees can wait for the National League to wrap up its
affairs down in Atlanta, and then they will try to join the great
teams that won from April all the way through October, as long as
there were games to be played.
</P>
<P>
   When the reek of Champagne is purged from the catacombs of
Yankee Stadium in a day or two, Torre will need a pitching rotation
for the World Series. Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban exile who
rescued the Yankees in their darkest hour in Game 4 against the
Indians, seems the obvious third horse right now, which is the only
time frame that matters.
</P>
<P>
   Immediacy was the reason Bruce Bochy went with his ace, Kevin
Brown, when San Diego had a chance to scuttle the Braves in Mission
Bay on Monday night. Brown had been dominating the postseason, an
angular athlete, larger than life, hitting and running and pitching
with a glow to him like some nobleman in an El Greco painting. The
move did not work, but Bochy had the right idea.
</P>
<P>
   Torre was supportive of Bochy's move, noting that Brown was well
rested. The Yankee manager also has an affinity for his veterans,
which is admirable, but has its drawbacks. Last year Cone convinced
the Yankees that he was healthy, and he has regretted his optimism
ever since his arm wore down, and the Yanks lost to the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Torre visited the pitching mound twice in the
fifth inning, once with a trainer when Cone seemed to have a
physical problem, but the pitcher said he was fine. Thome wound up
hitting one into the upper deck, which would have awed David Wells,
who admires the moon shots he delivers, but Cone seemed merely sick
about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees survived the stunning barrage, but now Torre faces
another conflict. Early in the World Series, he will need a third
pitcher, either Hernandez or Andy Pettitte, who has won 55 games in
the past three years but lost his edge late this season.
</P>
<P>
   After the three-game sweep of Texas, Torre said Hernandez had
assumed he would automatically start the first game in the league
series, and that Torre had to explain that Wells and Cone and
Pettitte were still 1-2-3.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this on Monday, Hernandez said in Spanish that he
had not been surprised by the rotation, that ``it doesn't matter if
I'm the 10th pitcher on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Yanks were down, two games to one, Hernandez had not
pitched in 15 days. During his enforced vacation, Hernandez waited
around, enjoying the amenities of a major league clubhouse, all the
tastes and luxuries that were impossible when he was the best
pitcher in an impoverished island fortress.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, they were on the eve of destruction until El Duque _
what? swaggered? sauntered? strolled? _ out to the mound, breaking
the two-game losing streak and guaranteeing the Yankees a return
trip to Yankee Stadium, where nature took its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought us back to life,'' Wells said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the key,'' Chili Davis said Monday. ``Nobody wanted
to be down, 3-1, in Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   El Duque refused to say that it was the biggest game in his
life. There were games against Nicaragua or Australia, Italy or
Mexico, that mattered very much to Fidel Castro and the fans in
Cuba. Last December, Hernandez survived a voyage on the open sea,
and George Steinbrenner spent a chunk of his cable television swag
for the Cuban pitcher who won 12 games and lost 4, with an earned
run average of 3.13.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect for loyalty, El Duque is the one player who
saved this series, and put the Yankees in position to achieve that
superlative season for all seasons.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In terms of background, culture and appearance,
Beatrice Uria-Monzon has what it takes to be an exceptional Carmen.
Though her family roots are partly Spanish, she is French-born and
French-trained. What better mix to play the iconic Spanish Gypsy of
Bizet's great French opera?
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ms. Uria-Monzon, making her Metropolitan Opera debut
in the first ``Carmen'' of the season, is an exceptionally
beautiful woman who gave us a lithe, small-framed and unabashedly
seductive Carmen.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Carmen is also an operatic role for a mezzo-soprano,
and the strictly vocal component of her performance was not
consistently satisfying. She has a dusky, rich voice that can be
quite sizable when she unleashes a climactic high note. Curiously
for a mezzo-soprano, her low range is weak and breathy. At least,
it sounded so on this occasion, which no doubt was one of high
pressure. Some of her phrasing was halting and inelegant.
</P>
<P>
   This was a steamy interpretation and made an impact. But it was
the vocal equivalent of Method acting, where embodying the
character was more important than singing the music, and Bizet's
arching vocal lines often fell flat.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception, this was not a night for memorable singing.
The American tenor Franco Farina was a vocally beefy Don Jose, who
summoned considerable power for angry outbursts and sporadic top
notes, but did not even attempt to ascend to the high B-flat in the
most mellifluous phrase of the lovely aria known as the ``Flower
Song'' the way Bizet requests: pianissimo.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-born baritone Gino Quilico is an attractive actor
with a robust voice, but as the toreador Escamillo he sounded
vocally worn on this occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The exception was the Korean lyric soprano Hei-Kyung Hong, who
brought shimmering clear sound, lovely phrasing and affecting
directness to the role of Micaela.
</P>
<P>
   The conducting of David Robertson was curious: vigorous and
solid in places, tentative and mannered in others. Balances seemed
not quite right, with inner lines for brass instruments often
protruding. And for all Robertson's visible attentiveness to what
was happening onstage, there were noticeable glitches in ensemble
between the singers and orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The production by Franco Zeffirelli, introduced in 1996, remains
a chaotic jumble without one insightful idea in it. The stage
director this time out, David Kneuss, gave more helpful attention
to the individual performances than Zeffirelli did with his cast at
the time, which included Waltraud Meier and Placido Domingo in the
leading roles.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still a production dominated by a menagerie of
animals. So many horses, donkeys and dogs (the latter,
incongruously, on leashes) crisscross the stage, you feel cheated
not to see Escamillo fight a real bull.

`BINLIDS': PEOPLE DETERMINED TO HAVE THEIR SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Binlids'' has a job to do and attempts to get it
done with the fervor and singleness of purpose of a political
campaign. In two somber hours, the play, written and performed by
residents of West Belfast, tells the story of three decades of
bloodshed and anguish in which the conflict in Northern Ireland,
known as the troubles, has engulfed their hardscrabble community.
</P>
<P>
   The production makes no pretense of objectivity. The patchwork
presentation, a series of short vignettes dramatizing the recurring
cycles of terror, slaughter, grief and rebellion that consume the
lives of ordinary people in the Catholic enclave, is unremittingly
one-sided, a manifesto more than a play. The bloodthirsty British
occupiers wear everything but fangs; the local residents, harassed
and beaten, falsely imprisoned and tortured, are portrayed as kind
and true and brave, ``with hearts in them like lions.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to empathize with, even admire, the ill-treated
minority group depicted in ``Binlids,'' and not feel the same about
``Binlids'' itself. The play, which opened Sunday at the Angel
Orensanz Foundation Center on the Lower East Side, has the gritty,
ideological air of street theater; there is rarely a moment when
the speechifying and the sloganeering do not sound as if they were
ground out of genuine pain.
</P>
<P>
   But partly because it is so hard to make out the individuals
behind the speeches and slogans, ``Binlids'' is a wearying
experience. No matter how justified the arguments may be, it's
still just a noisy, primitive commercial, overemphatically making
its pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The production, part of a three-year cultural exchange program
between Belfast and New York, was unsurprisingly a sold-out success
in its Belfast debut last year; it clearly has a function beyond
entertainment. Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the
political branch of the Irish Republican Army, has embraced the
play, and with good reason. He is a character in ``Binlids,''
portrayed as a hero of the conflict and someone whose motives have
been largely misinterpreted by the media.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' supporters and some others with a keen interest in the
region will undoubtedly find the work cathartic; in its sharpest
moments, ``Binlids'' is reminiscent of the workers' call to arms
sounded by Clifford Odets in ``Waiting for Lefty.'' The play's
title is an amalgamation of two words that for the people of West
Belfast connote an instrument of defiance that had the same
function as Paul Revere's famous ride. Residents slam trash can
covers _ ``bin lids'' _ against the pavement to warn of the advance
of British troops into their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The metaphor is well suited. ``Binlids'' is an effort to get a
community's message out. The enemy, it seems, has not only stood
behind the barrel of an automatic rifle, but also has been sitting
in the government public relations offices and the newsrooms where,
the play asserts, opinion makers have been busy slandering the
Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
   To the ``Binlids'' characters, played by 18 actors from Northern
Ireland, amateurs and professionals, the picture the world has been
given of their community has been vilely distorted. In one scene,
condemnatory editorials in British and Irish newspapers, describing
violence-torn West Belfast as barbaric, are read aloud, as the
local women reply in a chorus: ``That's not us . . . , that's not
us . . .'' Their chant supplies the play with a kind of anthem. The
difficulty is that in this defensive posture, ``Binlids'' never
supplies much texture, never clarifies who the ``us'' is.
</P>
<P>
   The director Pam Brighton stages ``Binlids'' as an interactive
event. Scenes are played on five isolated platforms that ring the
theater. Audience members stand in the center, occasionally mixing
with the actors, who pass among them, whispering word of military
atrocities and marching in picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative is cinematic and chronological. The starting point
is the 1971 British campaign of internment _ the policy of
imprisonment without formal charges _ and the play reveals its
impact on everyday people arrested without apparent reason,
tortured and caught in the cross-fire of British troops and Irish
nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Often, though, characters sound more like spokesmen than
victims. In the midst of the carnage, for instance, an angry if
unusually well-informed woman explains to her neighbor: ``Since
August '69, 21 percent of Catholic families living in Belfast have
been moved from their homes. You know, it was the biggest shift of
population since World War II.'' The director might as well have
turned on a megaphone.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire is interspersed with partisan folk songs, prettily
sung a cappella by Terence O'Neill and Rachel Fitzgerald.
Ultimately, though, the music suffers the fate of the rest of this
one-dimensional production: it all hits the same exhausted note.

SHOOTING OF GERMAN TOURIST STUNS COMMUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA AND MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The slaying of a German tourist during a street
holdup near the heart of Santa Monica's entertainment district sent
a wave of outrage across the community Tuesday and rippled the
worst of Los Angeles' image around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Police mounted a citywide manhunt for the gunman, while the
mayor and police chief insisted that the brazen shooting Monday
evening of Horst Featz, 50, was a random act and not directed at
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the safest places to recreate and visit,'' said
Santa Monica Police Chief James Butts. ``But the reality of this
is, this is a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   An impromptu memorial took shape near the shooting scene, on the
manicured lawn at the base of a palm in front of the Loews Santa
Monica Beach Hotel on Appian Way. Bunches of flowers and several
potted plants encircled a card with a simple plea, ``How can we
help?''
</P>
<P>
   Featz, his wife and another German couple were walking back to
town after a stroll on the beach about 9:30 p.m. Three men and a
woman approached the tourists and apparently demanded money, but
Featz and the others couldn't understand because they didn't speak
English.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the assailants then reached into their pockets.
A struggle followed and one of the men pulled out a handgun and
fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the shots were fired, the suspects fled without securing
any property,'' Butts said. ``It was a crime of opportunity. It was
a crime by cowards.''
</P>
<P>
   Featz's wife and the three other tourists were scheduled to
return home on a Tuesday flight, but the Police Department and
German consulate made arrangements for them to stay longer to help
with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman is described as an African-American male in his early
20s, 5 feet 6 inches, with very short hair and dark clothing. An
artist was expected to prepare a composite drawing to aid in the
search.
</P>
<P>
   Featz died in a hospital emergency room a short time after the
shooting. There were no arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Names of the victim's wife and the other couple weren't
released.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying is being viewed by some as an indictment of all of
Los Angeles and would cast a dark shadow on the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shooting has a tremendous impact because America is the
loved _ and hated _ giant of the world,'' said Jacob Parseghian,
owner of Prime Choice Travel in Hollywood. ``And now we're giving a
chance to people who hate us to start advertising and give us a bad
image.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to 40 percent of his business comes from European customers _
and he expects a 15 percent decrease in business due to the
shooting death, Parseghian said.
</P>
<P>
   News of the shooting stunned European tourists walking Tuesday
along the nearby boardwalk or taking in the historic Santa Monica
Pier a block north of the shooting scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me nervous. It makes you wonder whether to come down
to the area,'' said Jim Rosson, whose family was on its second
visit from England to California.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we like California,'' said his wife, Pat. ``I like the
people myself. And we really like the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Germans comprise the city's top international tourist market _
about 11 percent of Santa Monica's 2.3 million tourists a year,
said Koleen Hamblin, spokeswoman for the Santa Monica Convention
and Visitors' bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany and the United Kingdom have been key markets over past
three years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the murder of a foreign tourist is so rare that
officials at the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau could
not recall the last time a similar tragedy occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Two Japanese students were killed after a carjacking in 1994 in
San Pedro, touching off concerns that the killings would curtail
Japanese tourism.
</P>
<P>
   About 23 million tourists visit Los Angeles a year, according to
Los Angeles convention officials. The region is consistently ranked
as one of the top three destinations for domestic and international
tourism, said Michael Collins, executive vice president of the
visitors bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The number of tourists arriving here peaked this decade in 1990
at 24.9 million. That number dipped to 20.9 million in 1992, the
year of the Los Angeles Riots. Since then, the number has been
steadily increasing, but has not achieved the 1990 high.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica Mayor Bob Holbrook, who was about three blocks away
from the scene at the time of the shooting, called the attack
random.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing to indicate they were tourists. They were
just out for a walk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   tourists,'' said a consulate spokeswoman. ``There has never been
a robbery like this. It's the first case and we really hope it's
the exception.''

   NEW YORK _ It's hard not to be jealous. Do these people know how
good they have it?
</P>
<P>
   Social Security-aged Yankee fans basked in the warm glow of Lou
Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio. Baby Boomers remember Whitey, Yogi, and
the Mick winning every autumn. Today's Wall Street lions watched
Thurman, Billy, and Reggie. And now a new generation of New Yorkers
grows up believing the World Series is a baseball birthright.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees won the 1998 American League pennant
Tuesday night, burying the Cleveland Indians, 9-5, to take the AL
Championship Series, four games to two. (We all know the Red Sox
should have been here, anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   And so for the 35th October since buying Babe Ruth from Boston,
the men in pinstripes will represent the American League in the
World Series. Think about that for a moment. Thirty-five World
Series. That is almost half of all the Fall Classics since the
Bambino delivered for the first time in 1921. Yankee Stadium's red,
white, and blue bunting doesn't stay in mothballs very long.
</P>

   ``I don't think our celebration was restrained,'' said Yankees
manager Joe Torre. ``To me, the tensest part is just geting to the
World Series. And to do it against a team like this is especially
satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to bring up a sore subject, but in the period in which the
Yankees have won 35 pennants, your Boston Red Sox have won but
four, losing the World Series in seven games each time.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees don't plan on losing. Whether they meet the Padres
or Braves (which would be a delicious rematch from 1996), they
believe they are destined to win the World Series. They won an
AL-record 114 regular-season games, and their mission won't be
complete until they have 125 wins and rings on their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pretty wild night at the Stadium. Outraged by insults
hurled at David Wells in Cleveland, and by David Justice's
subsequent remark that Yankee fans do everything short of bringing
Uzis to the park, the New York legions came ready to razz the
Tribe. It was feared that you wouldn't be able to find a package of
AA batteries within 3 miles of Yankee Stadium, but most fans
resisted the urge to fire objects at the Indians. It didn't hurt to
see an impressive assemblage of New York's finest _ many in riot
gear _ in and around the park. Andy Sipowicz must have been the
only cop left in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Fans were wild with anticipation when the Yankees took a 6-0
lead in the first three innings. Veteran David Cone knew what to do
with a six-run lead: throw strikes. Unfortunately for Cone, Jim
Thome launched one of the strikes into the third deck (where George
Brett took Rich Gossage in the 1980 ALCS) for a fifth-inning grand
slam that chiseled the lead to 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Cone left after five and gave the ball to Ramiro Mendoza, one of
a seemingly endless supply of capable Yankee hurlers. Pitching
depth and bench strength are what make this team smarter than your
average Berra Yankee champion.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed by Thome's grand slam, the Yankees scored three times in
the bottom of the sixth to make it 9-5. The Indians weren't going
to spoil this Bronx bash. (Did Cleveland actually lead this ssries,
2-1, Friday night?) Yankee fans chanted, ``1948,'' in the eighth
inning. That's the last year in which the Indians won a World
Series. Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza pitched three innings of one-hit ball before turning it
over to Mariano Rivera. Scott Brosius, who hit a three-run homer in
the third, made his second spectacular play of the night on Enrique
Wilson to start the ninth. Then Kenny Lofton fanned and Omar
Vizquel grounded to Rivera to end it.
</P>
<P>
   The riot-gear gang burst onto the field after the final out.
Amazingly, no fan tried to penetrate the thick blue line and the
Yanks celebrated among themselves on the diamond while Sinatra's
``New York, New York,'' blared over the public address system (it
was played nine consecutive times leading into this morning). In
compliance with Stadium tradition, the crowd showered itself with
confetti and full cups of beer.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee players went straight to the clubhouse for their
champagne bath. There were no curtain calls on the field, no
ballplayers taking victory laps on police horses. In New York, they
hold off on the real celebration until the World Series is won.
</P>
<P>
   The Series begins Saturday night. In New York. At Yankee
Stadium. Again.

RAMIREZ: BIG CLOUTS AND PRODIGIOUS BLUNDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Indians' Manny Ramirez has become the answer to
the old Sesame Street brain teaser: one of these things doesn't
belong.
</P>
<P>
   Here is this amazing power hitter _ the other Dominican slugger
_ who has found himself in the company of Mickey Mantle, Reggie
Jackson and Babe Ruth. But unlike those famed hitters just ahead of
him in their post-season knack for the home run, Ramirez isn't
gregarious, loquacious or depicted in black-and-white film reels.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez is the shy player raised in the Washington Heights
section of Manhattan, a hitter recognized in his own neighborhood,
but rarely celebrated on a national scale. This is not only about
personality, though. While he had 45 home runs and 145 rbi this
season, and used the American League Championship Series to reach
fourth on the all-time post-season homer list behind Mantle (18),
Jackson (18) and Ruth (15), Tuesday night's Game 6 explained
exactly why Ramirez has failed to wow everyone.
</P>
<P>
   His glorified bat died at the most inopportune moments for the
Indians, and his defense unraveled under pressure, allowing the
Yankees to soar into the World Series after taking Game 6 on
Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians needed Ramirez's bat to catch up to the Yankees as
they built a 6-0 lead. But with the bases loaded in the fifth,
Ramirez struck out. Then Jim Thome stole the home-run marquee from
Ramirez, Thome's grand slam off David Cone in the fifth inning
pulling the Indians to within a run of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The tight game was lost, though, in large part because of
Ramirez. In the sixth inning with runners on first and second,
Derek Jeter lined a pitch to right-center field. For some unknown
reason, Ramirez made a mad dash for the wall, as if he was about to
leap and bring back a home run into the park. Trouble was, Jeter's
ball hit at the foot of the wall, well below the shoe tops of
Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of catching the ball for an out, Ramirez misjudged the
entire sequence. He was not charged with an error, but his play
enabled the Yankees to take an 8-5 lead on Jeter's triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a peek at the ball and ran right toward the wall,''
Ramirez said. ``I saw the ball. I didn't think it was going out,
but I thought it was going to the wall. I turned and saw it hit. I
was surprised where it landed.''
</P>
<P>
   If ever the Indians needed Ramirez to emerge as a star on the
national stage, it was on Tuesday night as the Indians faced
elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to do what we can,'' Ramirez said after his team
lost Game 5 to the Yankees. ``You have to credit their pitching.
They have been able to keep us out of the flow. We almost got David
Wells, but we came up empty. We have to try and turn it around in
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this series, Ramirez hit well enough _ .333 with two
home runs and four rbi _ but like many of his fellow teammates, he
has been unable to bring home base runners in the tense moments.
</P>
<P>
   If Ramirez needed extra incentive to deliver for his team, all
he had to do was look up in the stands. Unlike the rest of the
Indians, Ramirez was not expected to be in a position to have to
dodge insults and ice at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is in front of his home crowd, so you know he's excited,''
his teammate Omar Vizquel said.
</P>
<P>
   At times in his career, Ramirez has seemed less than enthused.
He has been criticized for his cavalier approach to catching fly
balls. Against Boston in the division series, Ramirez was caught
launching into a premature home run trot. His stroll to first
turned a certain double off the wall into a long single.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday night, his effort had not been an issue in the
ALCS. You could tell just how much Ramirez wanted to come into his
old neighborhood and take center stage at Yankee Stadium. For a
fleeting moment, he did that in Game 1 when he delivered a home run
that ultimately went uncelebrated in the Indians' 7-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 3, Ramirez muscled out another pitch against Andy
Pettitte. But because of Thome _ who hit two homers in that game _
Ramirez's climb among the best home-run hitters in baseball history
went unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this anonymity is because of his reclusive personality.
Part is due to forgettable nights like Tuesday night. &QL;

VETERINARIAN ARRESTED IN ASSISTED SUICIDE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An Upper East Side veterinarian was arrested Tuesday
and charged with helping a friend and former receptionist commit
suicide last year as she lay in the hospital gravely ill with
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The veterinarian, Dr. Marco Zancope, 43, was led away in
handcuffs from the Animal Clinic of New York on First Avenue as
investigators charged him with second-degree manslaughter in the
death of Cara Beigel. Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police
spokesman, said Zancope was accused of injecting Ms. Beigel with a
deadly dose of a barbiturate last year.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said that a group of her family and friends
looked on as Zancope gave Ms. Beigel, 33, the drug through an
intravenous tube at her bedside at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center on Aug. 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beigel was nearing the end of a protracted 13-month battle
with breast cancer, one she was about to lose, family members said.
She was scheduled to enter a hospice for the terminally ill,
according to her father, Phillip Beigel, who said in an interview
Tuesday night that he had not been informed by either the police or
the hospital that Zancope had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Beigel, speaking with a shaken and strained voice from his
Connecticut home, said he did not believe that Zancope acted rashly
or criminally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Cara could have, I think she might have done it herself,''
Beigel said. ``She was not of the mind to hang into the bitter end
because she was in tremendous pain and agony.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `I don't want to carry on like that. It's over, it's
over.''
</P>
<P>
   In another highly publicized case in Manhattan in 1995, a writer
and editor on the Upper West Side served four months in jail for
helping his wife commit suicide. But in that case, family members
of the dead woman assailed her husband's actions, suggesting that
he had coerced her into taking her own life.
</P>
<P>
   Beigel said his daughter had undergone a mastectomy, had spent
months under heavy medication and had decided that if her condition
worsened she wanted to die.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity did not
dispute that account Tuesday night. ``She had articulated that she
wanted this done,'' the investigator said. ``If she had gotten
worse, she wanted someone to end her misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beigel grew up in Rockland and Westchester counties. She
loved animals as a girl and competed in horse shows at Madison
Square Garden, said her father, a retired television producer and
businessman. She attended Wellesley College and studied art
history. But animals remained a passion, he said, and so she took a
job working for Zancope.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy was done on Ms. Beigel's body, but officials said the
toxicology reports did not come back from the lab for five months,
and it was not until last week that the Office of the Medical
Examiner declared Ms. Beigel's death a homicide. It was not clear
what led to the delays.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner, said her
office would have no official comment until the records of the case
could be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted at home, Manhattan District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau said he was not familiar with the case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Beigel's death was reported to the authorities because the
hospital suspected foul play, officials at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a hospital are required by law to report all deaths that
can be attributed to something other than natural causes,'' said
hospital spokeswoman Avice Meehan. ``There were some things in this
case that led hospital officials to refer the death to the Office
of the Medical Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official at the hospital, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Ms. Beigel's death was not imminent. The official
said that a small gathering of friends and family had stood by Ms.
Beigel's bedside that summer morning, and in just a matter of
hours, she was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very ill,'' he said, ``but she was not expected to die
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   When told of the hospital's opinion that she was not expected to
die right away, Beigel said: ``Of course she was expected to die.
They knew it, they told her that. She was terminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were able to track the drug back to Zancope,
because it is a substance commonly used in the treatment of
animals, Pentangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   People who lived in the doctor's building on East 84th Street
expressed surprise at his arrest. Veronica Marocco, 51, a pet
groomer and neighbor, described herself as a friend of 15 years.
``I don't believe he would have done this,'' she said. ``He was
devastated after she died. If he did it, he didn't let on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Much of the national debate over assisted suicide has involved
the role of doctors in prescribing potentially lethal medications
for patients who want to end their lives. But in the 1995 case in
Manhattan, George Delury, a writer and editor, helped his ailing
wife commit suicide in their apartment. He later disclosed in a
book that he suffocated her with plastic bags because he did not
believe the drug she had taken would kill her fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Delury, 64, said he helped his wife, Myrna Lebov, who was
suffering from multiple sclerosis, drink a mix of honey and Elavil,
an antidepressant, but never told prosecutors about suffocating her
because he did not want to be charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Delury case was closely followed by supporters and opponents
of euthanasia, mostly because of Delury's public outspokenness.
</P>
<P>
   He kept a diary of his wife's illness that closely documented
the months leading up to the decision to commit suicide. He also
criticized the statute that outlaws assisted suicide in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Delury was initially charged with second-degree manslaughter. In
a deal with prosecutors, he pleaded guilty to attempted
manslaughter.

CULTURE NOTES: 150 SARGENTS; HEAVY SECURITY FOR `AIDA'; DAVIS ON
ROBESON; AN ARCHITECT NOT FORGOTTEN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The cosmopolitan American artist John Singer Sargent (1856-1925)
is the subject of the major autumn exhibition at the Tate Gallery
in London. Opening Thursday and continuing through Jan. 17, this
show, assembled from public and private collections around the
world and made up of paintings, watercolors, oil studies and
drawings for murals, is described as the first to display the full
variety of the artist's work.
</P>
<P>
   The 150 paintings range from Sargent's daring ``Madame X,''
which caused a scandal at the Paris Salon of 1884, to his late
landscape oils of Venice and Switzerland, his Impressionist works
and his grand society portraits. The exhibition will run at the
National Gallery of Art in Washington from Feb. 21 to May 31 and at
the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston from June 23 to Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wraps
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian authorities are deploying heavy security, including
roadblocks and hundreds of policemen, during weeklong performances
of Verdi's ``Aida'' on the Pyramids plateau outside Cairo. Nearly
3,000 opera devotees from around the world who came to the opening
on Monday were required to identify themselves. Last November, 58
foreign tourists and four Egyptians died in an attack by Islamic
militants in Luxor a month after ``Aida'' was performed there.
</P>
<P>
   Times Remembered
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The actor and author Ossie Davis will discuss his
friendship with Paul Robeson Thursday as part of an observance of
the centennial of Robeson's birth organized by the 160,000-member
Local 1199 of the National Health and Human Services Employees
Union. Davis is speaking at 11 a.m. and again at 12:30 p.m. before
some 1,000 elementary and high school students in the union's
auditorium at 310 W. 43rd St., as a presentation of Bread and
Roses, 1199's cultural arm.
</P>
<P>
   Civic Virtues
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many of his landmark works have vanished. But the
mastery of the architect George Post (1837-1913) still shapes New
York City: the domed Williamsburg Savings Bank, the floor of the
New York Stock Exchange with its 72-foot-high ceiling, the
Gothic-style City College campus and the building now known as the
Brooklyn Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are Post's eight-story Equitable Life Assurance Society,
the first office building to use elevators; his 20-story World
Building, once New York's tallest, and his Cornelius Vanderbilt
Mansion. But Post and his achievements have not been forgotten. The
architect is the subject of an exhibition at the New-York
Historical Society. ``George B. Post: Great American Architect,''
which opened Tuesday, runs through Jan. 10.

CSUN STADIUM SITE WILL FACE OPPOSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The three most important words in building a new
facility are location, location, location.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Cal State Northridge officials. The Big Sky Conference.
Area residents.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN wants to build a football stadium. The Big Sky Conference
has all but mandated it. But where to put the facility so it won't
cause an uproar with area residents is why an appointed site
committee has been meeting weekly during the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   And CSUN insiders say the perfect site for a 12,000- to
15,000-seat stadium might be just 100 yards south of North Campus
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When the 12-person Athletic Facility Site Committee meets
tonight at 6:30 at CSUN's satellite student union, the site near
the current stadium will be introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't please everyone,'' site-committee chairman David
Honda said. ``We'll do the pros and cons of it, like we do all the
sites.''
</P>
<P>
   But area residents have offered staunch opposition. They don't
want a new stadium on CSUN's campus because they believe it would
create extra traffic and too many night events.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors currently play in what is regarded by even their
own coaches as the worst facility in the league, and perhaps
Division I-AA. It holds 7,500 but has poor lighting, inadequate
coaches' boxes and locker rooms, a poor press facility and lacks a
college-type atmosphere, Big Sky commissioner Doug Fullerton has
said in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated cost of building an on-campus stadium is $12-$15
million.
</P>
<P>
   Renovating North Campus Stadium isn't an option because a
multimillion dollar biotech complex is going to be built on that
site. But Honda said there is enough room on the south portion of
the North Campus _ where the dirt hill is located _ to build a
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN athletic director Paul Bubb said a site for the stadium
depends on how important the school views its football program.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the commitment the institution wants to make to
itself?'' said Bubb, a committee member and proponent of an
on-campus stadium. ``What is the message we want to send to our
conference? Do you want to be one of the top programs in the
conference or do you just want to get by?''
</P>
<P>
   The site committee is supposed to present CSUN President Blenda
Wilson with recommendations by Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a judgment about it,'' Wilson said. ``Except for big
Division I universities that have big teams and big crowds and big
records _ those universities can use civic arenas because they can
draw that kind of attention _ I don't know of any Division I-AA
athletic program in the country that would not have its athletic
facilities on campus. And that's partly because athletics create a
sense of community.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the North Campus site, another site being
examined by the committee is on the main campus, just off Zelzah
Avenue and adjacent to the athletic administration building.
</P>
<P>
   The site committee is also studying a $1 million renovation of
Pierce College. But Pierce College athletic director Bob Lyons, who
stands to gain the most if CSUN was to renovate Pierce's stadium,
said CSUN shouldn't wander off campus to play football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think they're better off building it on campus,''
Lyons said. ``It would mean better school spirit. If I was the
athletic director at Cal State Northridge, my first choice would be
on campus. Pierce would be the next logical choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Those opposing the building of a new stadium want CSUN to
renovate a local high school or junior college field, but Fullerton
said that was unacceptable because it didn't meet Big Sky
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Area residents opposed to an on-campus stadium point toward UCLA
and USC as schools that play off campus, though both of those
schools play at the Division I-A level. CSUN plays at the much less
visible Division I-AA level and averages less than 4,500 fans per
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Lindley West Coalition, the Northridge Townhome Estate
Homeowners Association and the La Villa Nueva Homeowners
Association have argued against an on-campus stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Honda said a new stadium on the North Campus could bring flack
from the Lindley group, but the other two associations might
welcome the move. It would also be more difficult for a residential
group to block a new stadium on North Campus because a stadium
already exists there.

POOR KICK COVERAGE HAS PRICE SCRAMBLING FOR SOLUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ First there were breakdowns in blocking fundamentals,
then bad tackling and a simple lack of effort.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State coach Mike Price has a lot to be disappointed
about in his team's 0-3 start in the Pac-10, but nothing disturbs
him more than explaining why his team has failed to adequately
cover punts and kickoffs in the three straight losses to Oregon,
UCLA and Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Against Oregon last week, Duck return specialist Michael
Fletcher returned one punt 61 yards for a touchdown and had another
touchdown called back because of a penalty as the Cougars gave up
158 total return yards in their 51-29 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so disappointed in that with our team,'' Price said
Tuesday when asked about Oregon's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's Fletcher, maybe he's the greatest punt returner in
America,'' Price said, searching for answers. ``But they had a
`safe' punt return on'' and Fletcher still was able to shred the
Cougar punt coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars now plan a different sort of coverage this week for
USC, which leads the Pac-10 in punt return yardage after six games
(23 returns for 346 yards and a 15-yard average).
</P>
<P>
   Price has ordered punter Kareem Anderson and kicker Rian Lindell
to kick every ball away from USC's most explosive returner, junior
R. Jay Soward, who returned a kickoff 95 yards against the Cougars
last year and had a 78-yard kickoff return against WSU as a
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   In USC's 32-31 loss to Cal last Saturday, Soward had an 80-yard
punt return for a touchdown, his second of the year, and he is
averaging a touchdown every six times he touches the ball (25 TDs
on 151 plays).
</P>
<P>
   ``He better not touch the football on a punt or a kickoff,''
Price warned. ``I mean it. I'm serious. We're not punting that ball
to him and we're not kicking that ball to him.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett believes the Trojans' play on special
teams could be the deciding factor in Martin Stadium, where a long
return or two could take the crowd out of the game. But he says
Soward isn't the only Trojan player to be concerned about.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Larry Parker is seventh in the conference in punt returns
(6.1 yards per return), and USC defenders has blocked four punts
and two field goals this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The special teams have been the most consistent part of our
football team,'' Hackett said. ``We have had some really tremendous
play.''
</P>
<P>
   With both teams having difficulty moving the football on
offense, Hackett likes his team's chances of winning the game with
special teams, especially in light of the success Oregon had in
Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the AstroTurf, the hostile crowd and uncertain
weather conditions, ``I think it becomes even more important,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular time, with an offense struggling a little bit,
it really has been a weapon for us. And we have to take a very,
very close look at the things we may or may not be able to do
against Washington State.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cougars elect to punt away from Soward, expect USC to go
for blocks. Anderson had two punts blocked against UCLA and is
still nursing a broken finger ligament from that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern we would have is that they would kick away from R.
Jay, which wouldn't give us a chance to do anything (on the
return),'' Hackett said. ``We'll have to adjust accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Price noted that his team's poor first-half performance against
Oregon was largely set up by blunders in kickoff and punt coverage.
Fletcher's up-the-middle TD return of WSU's second punt made the
score 21-0 with 5:21 still left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field position was lousy, but it was the result of poor
special teams,'' Price said. ``Not getting the kickoffs back, poor
coverage on punts, those are things we haven't had problems with
before. It was kind of disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem appears to start with lack of effort, and Price
seems to take it personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``A punt return where you see a guy maybe not giving 100
percent, you can't say that very often about the Cougs and about
the teams that I've coached in the past,'' Price said.
</P>

LABOR PAINS WRACK NBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NBA's legacy of labor peace is gone and with
it the first two weeks of the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   The longest streak of uninterrupted play in North American
professional sports history ended bitterly Tuesday when labor
strife caused the NBA to cancel regular-season games for the first
time in 51 years _ a span of 35,001 games.
</P>
<P>
   A too-little, too-late bargaining session Tuesday produced a
glimmer of progress but nothing that could avert a decision that
had long appeared inevitable. Ninety-nine contests scheduled from
Nov. 3 to Nov. 16 _ including 14 games each for the Los Angeles
Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers _ were wiped out by the
3{-month-old labor stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We held out as long as we possibly could, hoping for some kind
of a miracle, but it didn't occur,'' commissioner David Stern said
in a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   The man who has presided over two decades of unbridled
prosperity and remarkable labor peace told the Associated Press he
felt ``lousy, disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to put on games for the fans, not to cancel them.
It's terribly disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   More cancellations could be announced in the coming weeks if NBA
owners and players cannot find a mutually agreeable formula for
dividing the league's $2 billion in annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Player representatives tried to address owners' concerns over
exorbitant player contracts with an 11th-hour proposal for a luxury
tax. But NBA officials said the concept needs analysis, and that
the proposal was insufficient to save the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The league announced the cancellations shortly after the 3{-hour
negotiating session in New York ended. ``Needless to say, that was
a very difficult announcement for us to have to make,'' deputy
commissioner Russ Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen players and five owners participated in Tuesday's
talks. No players or owner representatives from the Lakers and
Clippers were in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   NBA owners declared a lockout of players July 1 and the sides
have negotiated only three times since, with little movement. The
league, saying owners need cost certainty, have sought a hard cap
on player salaries. The players' association opposes changes to the
current ``soft'' cap.
</P>
<P>
   The players now propose a ``superstar tax,'' to be imposed on
high-end contracts that fall under the current ``Larry Bird
exception.'' The Bird clause _ which owners want to abolish _
allows teams to pay any amount to re-sign their free agents and has
resulted in contracts such as Kevin Garnett's six-year, $126
million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the players' proposal, Bird contracts that exceed a
certain amount would be taxed and the fees collected would be
redistributed among low-revenue teams. Major League Baseball
adopted a similar concept in lieu of a salary cap following the
1994 players' strike.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the union proposed that contracts exceeding $18
million per year be taxed at a rate of 50 cents for every dollar
over the limit (e.g. a $19 million contract produces a $500,000
tax). The figures are presumed to be negotiable, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention was to put something bold on the table,'' said
Billy Hunter, executive director of the players' association. ``The
message here is that we're trying. What kind of response they make
will determine what kind of progress we can make and whether we can
salvage the rest of the November schedule _ or the rest of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik said a luxury tax ``could be a worthwhile instrument''
but said the league is ``not at all confident a tax will provide
the needed relief for the owners.'' The league hopes to respond to
the proposal by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   All that is certain is the upcoming season, if it is played at
all, is destined to be pockmarked by asterisks. Stern and Granik
indicated that games lost probably will not be made up. Worse, the
remaining schedule probably cannot be rewritten to allow for a
balanced schedule; in other words, teams might not play the same
number of home and away games, division games and games inside and
outside their conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, we really don't have a lot of flexibility. Most
of our arenas are booked most of the time,'' Granik said. ``We're
likely to end up with a season that's not perfectly satisfactory to
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The canceled games represent one-twelfth of the season, equating
to about $85 million in player salaries. Players will miss their
first paychecks Nov. 15.

TYSON TEST RESULTS LACK A CERTAIN BITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Yet another reason has come along to reinforce my
decision not to have become a pro boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a mild aversion to getting hit in the mouth, I hate
it when my five-day mental evaluation by a six-doctor panel from
Massachusetts General Hospital is made public.
</P>
<P>
   Really spoils my morning.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson had his evaluation released Tuesday. Given his
history when he discovers his mornings spoiled (or when anything
else causes him to cock his eyebrow), the expectations were grim.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened:
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the doctors find no compelling emotional,
psychological or neurological reason to deny Tyson a renewal of his
Nevada boxing license, none of the doctors ended up with teethmarks
on their ears. In fact, they kept their own teeth pretty much in
the same shape as when they began the evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to know what was more remarkable: the fact that a prominent
athlete had his head publicly examined, or that the people doing
the examining lived to tell about it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not exactly sure what the point was of the exercise. If it
was to determine Tyson's fitness to box, my question is: What is
the proper measurement?
</P>
<P>
   A minimum IQ? Or a maximum IQ?
</P>
<P>
   And if IQ is not the issue, what standard of comparison do
doctors use when judging whether a subject is psychologically safe
enough to be permitted to thrash someone?
</P>
<P>
   Is Tyson compared to Israeli commandos, bears, Islamic
terrorists, IRS agents or flu viruses?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, wading through the excerpts of the report released
Tuesday, that very disclaimer leaped out:
</P>
<P>
   ``We emphasize,'' the doctors wrote, ``that because of the lack
of an appropriate comparison group, caution must be taken in the
interpretation of these test results.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, since we've never examined anybody like this to
judge fitness for this kind of activity ... who knows?
</P>
<P>
   With due respect to the medical personnel involved, the more
revealing analysis of Tyson was in this month's Playboy. No pun
intended.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sports Illustrated writer Mark Kram talked with Tyson
recently in two long interview sessions in New York where he ranged
from ``brooding silence to manic free association,'' underlined
with a steady drumbeat of rage, according to the writer.
</P>
<P>
   Kram's conclusion: ``Tyson is the darkest figure in sports I've
ever encountered. I left thinking that I have never before met a
32-year-old man so eaten up by rage, so hostile, despondent and
absolutely convinced of his irredeemability.''
</P>
<P>
   The most telling segment of the interview illustrated Tyson's
volatility as well as the frequently contradictory nature that
makes his behavior impossible to anticipate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't interview me like I'm some maniac that might explode at
any minute,'' Tyson said. ``I think you've got the wrong
impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Kram: ``What makes you think we've got the wrong impression?''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson: ``Maybe it's me, because I'm so bitter and defensive.
Maybe it's not you at all. I'm just always ready to attack. Please,
sir, don't take it personally. I'm a very hateful (expletive) right
now, a hateful individual. I'm really (expletive) at the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always trying to be cool, take care of my children, not
kill nobody, not say anything anymore. I always do my best to be
cool. I know I'm going to blow one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Kram: ``Blow in what way?''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson: ``I know I'm going to blow one day. But I'm going to make
sure that when I blow, my kids are fine. There's not much more of
this (expletive) I can take. I'm going to blow one day. I try very
hard. I'm doing a very good job, sir. I'm doing a very good job.
I'm just really angry these days. Really, really angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Kram: ``Do you get any easier to live with as you get older?''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson: ``It gets more intense. I have no one to blame but
myself. Even though many people contribute to it, I have to carry
the weight of the fool alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is all too aware of the apparent inevitability of his
self-destruction, and is convinced the world is against him. Some
of his anger is well-earned, given his wretched upbringing and his
continual exploitation as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point in every functional adult life, victimhood
becomes useless and accountability begins. Tyson knows that and
sometimes sounds ready to accept the consequences of his actions.
But his admitted readiness to attack and the belief that he will
again erupt, perhaps fatally, virtually certifies he is no more in
control now than when he went cannibal on Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely Tyson is going to bite anyone's ear again. But
if he is re-licensed, the weight of the Vegas casinos, a cable
network, his handlers and family and most of boxing will once more
bear down upon the shoulders of a man who is ``really, really
angry'' at nearly all of them.
</P>
<P>
   If the five members of the Nevada State Athletic Commission
re-license Tyson, the good doctors in Massachusetts might want to
open their appointment calendars for five more head exams.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Whether the New York Yankees will be considered among
the greatest teams ever in baseball still remains to be seen, but
after Tuesday night one thing is clear: They're the best in the
American League this year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the sport's most tradition-rich and storied institutions
added another chapter as the Yankees finished off the Cleveland
Indians 9-5 in Game 6 of the AL Championship Series to qualify for
their 35th World Series.
</P>
<P>
   New York won the ALCS four games to two and will attempt to add
a 24th world championship to its collection against either San
Diego or Atlanta. The World Series is scheduled to begin Saturday
at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something we fought hard all year for,'' said David
Wells, who was voted ALCS Most Valuable Player for his two
victories. ``These guys are wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Scuttling the mismatch most expected in the best-of-seven
series, the Indians made the Yankees work for their second trip to
the World Series in three years. That proved little consolation as
an unmerciful crowd of 57,142 began chants of, ``1948! 1948!'' _
the last time the Indians won a World Series _ during the final two
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is probably the tensest part of it,'' Yankees
manager Joe Torre said. ``Getting there (to the World Series) is
such a tough mountain to climb. To do it against a club like the
Cleveland Indians is satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in intermittent drizzle throughout the game, the Yankees
teed off on Cleveland righthander Charles Nagy for six runs in the
first three innings. Then, they held on for dear life as Cleveland
finally found a solution for 20-game winner David Cone with a
five-run fifth inning, four of those coming on one swing of Jim
Thome's bat.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 6-0, Cone, who struck out seven of the first 15 batters he
faced, ran into trouble in the fifth. He allowed three straight
singles, the last one by Omar Vizquel hitting second-base umpire
Ted Hendry to load the bases with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Cone then walked David Justice to bring in a run and, following
a strikeout of Manny Ramirez, surrendered a monstrous 405-foot
grand slam to Thome that landed in the upper deck in right field
and pulled the Indians within 6-5. Thome's six home runs during the
playoffs tied the major-league record held by four players. The
Yankees' Bernie Williams accomplished the feat most recently in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Cone allowed five runs and seven hits in five innings before
being relieved by Ramiro Mendoza to begin the sixth. Cone struck
out eight and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Cone gets it done,'' Torre said. ``It wasn't one of his
stellar performances, but winning is what this game is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza allowed Cleveland just one hit over the next three
innings, and Mariano Rivera closed things out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Any chance Cleveland had of overtaking the Yankees and forcing a
deciding seventh game ended on a costly error by the least likely
of players. Vizquel, a five-time Gold Glove shortstop, cleanly
fielded a grounder by Scott Brosius leading off the New York sixth
but overthrew first to begin a three-run inning for the Yankees.
The error, one of three by Cleveland, snapped Vizquel's string of
46 career postseason games and 237 chances without an error.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't give any extra outs to a big-league team, much less
one with the caliber of talent as the Yankees,'' Cleveland manager
Mike Hargrove said. ``We played with fire all night long and got
burned by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ``I never dreamed of that. I took it (Vizquel's
error) as a sign. If he's not the best in the business, I don't
know who is.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius advanced to second on a wild pitch by reliever Dave
Burba, and two batters later, Derek Jeter cleared the bases with a
two-run triple that bounced off the right-field wall, increasing
the Yankees' lead to 8-5. Williams, who went 3-for-4 with two RBIs,
singled to right field to drive in the final run.
</P>
<P>
   In typical fashion, Cleveland trailed after the first inning.
The Indians were outscored 17-3 during the first inning of this
year's playoffs, but this time it was not the result of a lack of
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Lofton singled to lead off the game, beating out a bunt
down the third-base line. But Cone struck out the next three
batters to end the inning. The Indians had two runners on base in
the second inning, only to watch Cone again escape danger with two
more strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   New York wasted little time jumping on Nagy, scoring twice in
the first inning. Jeter and Paul O'Neill hit consecutive one-out
singles, and Williams followed with an RBI single up the middle.
Chili Davis, who drove in five runs during the last three games of
the series, provided the Yankees' second run with a sacrifice fly
to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi delivered a one-out single in the second inning, and
Chuck Knoblauch, the goat in Game 2 after his fielding gaffe handed
Cleveland a victory, doubled into the left-field corner.
Cleveland's Brian Giles played the bounce perfectly, but as he
positioned to throw, the wet ball slipped from his grasp, allowing
Girardi to score from first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great team we've got,'' Knoblauch said. ``They gave me
a lot of support when I was down. We don't have to worry about that
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees appeared to blow the game open with three more runs
off Nagy in the third. Williams led off with a single, and Davis
reached one batter later when Enrique Wilson's throw to second on a
potential force was ruled to have pulled Vizquel off the bag.
Brosius made the Indians pay for the mistake with a 416-foot,
three-run homer to pad New York's lead to 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy, who had allowed only two earned runs in 14 playoff innings
this year, was tagged for six runs (three earned) and eight hits in
three innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely disappointed that we didn't go on,'' Hargrove
said, ``but we have to recognize the Yankees have a very good
ballclub and they played better than we did.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves bill themselves as ``America's Team,''
and they do have quite a following around the country. But many
opposing players despise the Braves and cite arrogance as the main
reason.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might have sounded arrogant, cocky and maybe even boastful
when the Braves vowed to make the National League Championship
Series interesting despite losing the first three games of the
best-of-seven set to the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   As the saying goes: It ain't bragging if you can do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves continue their quest to become the first team in
major-league history to overcome a three-game postseason deficit
when they host the Padres in Game 6 this afternoon at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it is not the position we wanted to be in, but we
felt we had a chance, and we still do, because of our pitching and
how we're starting to swing the bats,'' said Braves lefthander Tom
Glavine, who will start today's game. ``We felt if anyone can come
back from 0-3, we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres manager Bruce Bochy left the decision with ace Kevin
Brown regarding his team's starting pitcher for today's game.
Brown, who pitched 1 relief innings and took the loss in Game 5,
opted to bypass today's start in favor of Game 7, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Lefthander Sterling Hitchcock, who won Game 3, will start for
the Padres today. If the Braves win, Brown will face Greg Maddux in
Thursday's series finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the driver's seat,'' said Padres left fielder
Greg Vaughn, who has recovered enough from a strained left
quadriceps muscle to be in the starting lineup tonight for the
first time since Game 1. ``The pressure is still on them. We split,
we win.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the Braves like the pressure. Monday's victory
improved their record to 8-4 all-time, including 8-2 this decade,
when facing elimination in the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say that the momentum is ours when we're still
down in the series,'' Braves pitcher John Smoltz said. ``We haven't
tied the series yet, but when you're in a position like they (the
Padres) were in, you want to end it. Anything possible can happen
in a Game 7, and we have been through our share of Game 7s.''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, there will be no Game 7 if the Braves don't win
today at Turner Field, which is expected to be sold out for the
first time this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to wrap it up (in San Diego), and we wanted to
prolong things to get back to Atlanta, and that's what we did,''
Glavine said. ``But they're still one win away from clinching, and
we have to win both games. The Padres are still in a better
position than we are, obviously, because we still have our backs to
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any momentum, it's only because we're obviously
rooting like hell to extend this thing. The Padres wanted to get it
over and go on to the next series. We've been on that side of the
fence. When you're on the verge of getting into the World Series,
there can be a letdown when you don't do it as soon as you'd like.
I just know that they (the Padres) are going to be ready to play,
so I don't know how long this momentum will last.''
</P>
<P>
   The general rule of thumb in baseball is that momentum is only
as good as your next day's starting pitcher. In that case, almost
anyone would give the nod to the Braves today. But it should be
noted that the unheralded Hitchcock has beaten Maddux and Randy
Johnson in his last two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, matching up against the elite pitchers in the game
doesn't make Hitchcock uneasy. As Brown was walking off the field
in Game 5, Hitchcock went to Padres pitching coach Dave Stewart and
asked for the ball in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidence in Hitch, and we still like our chances,''
Padres right fielder Tony Gwynn said. ``I don't think anyone in
this clubhouse feels any pressure _ just the opposite. We're pretty
relaxed. No one is afraid of it (being back in Atlanta). No one
feels any pressure. I think the pressure is still on the Braves.
They can't look past one game. It's been that way for two days now.
If we win, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they don't, the pressure will be on the Padres in a
hurry.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Budget negotiations between the White House and
congressional Republicans and end-of-session shenanigans have left
a half-dozen measures important to Arizona hanging in legislative
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the provisions keeping the state's delegation on
tenterhooks are two immigration measures that just a few days ago
seemed settled: border crossing cards and an entry-exit
documentation program.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators had worked out a deal to delay for 2{ years a
program that would require foreigners to fill out entry and exit
forms at the United States' northern and southern borders, a plan
that had border businesses fretting that it would create long lines
of traffic and interminable delays.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last-minute haggling this week, negotiators decided
the program would be on indefinite hold along the Canadian border,
but only delayed for a year in the south, a situation that
Arizona's congressional delegation says is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Jon Kyl and John McCain and other members of the Arizona
delegation wrote to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott asking that
the original deal be restored.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, along with Rep. Jim Kolbe and other members of the
delegation, is also involved in trying to straighten out the border
crossing-card issue. Congress required the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to change border crossing cards _
identification cards used by frequent border crossers _ to make
them more fraud-resistant. The cards were going to be expensive for
users, and devising them had become controversial, so the INS began
requiring visas issued by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona members heard complaints that obtaining a full visa is
inconvenient for many people crossing the border at Nogales or
other ports of entry because the nearest State Department facility
is miles away, in Hermosillo.
</P>
<P>
   Until the situation is resolved with INS, Kyl and Kolbe are
lobbying for a return to the old crossing-card system.
</P>
<P>
   Most frustrating for Rep. John Shadegg is the hold the Senate
placed on his and Kyl's identity-theft bill, which was passed after
an Arizona couple spent $15,000 and countless hours trying to
restore their good name after a thief destroyed it. A Democratic
senator _ it's unknown who it was _ placed a hold on the popular
measure, which for the first time makes identity theft a crime. The
senator reportedly was attempting to pressure other members to
approve some judges.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had cleared the Senate unanimously and the House by a
voice vote. President Clinton has promised his signature to make it
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an outrage, and I think it's a particular outrage
when they do it to non-controversial, bipartisan legislation
concerning the fastest growing crime in America, which causes its
victims financial ruin and great emotional distress,'' Shadegg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also caught in the legislative crossfire are:
</P>
<P>
   The Tres Rios sewage reclamation project, a demonstration
project to clean effluent through wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   The Wellton-Mohawk water transfer from the federal government to
Wellton.
</P>
<P>
   A measure to prohibit the use of federal funds to drain or study
draining Lake Powell, an idea under review by the Glen Canyon
Institute and approved by the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Jose de Jesus Rivera as U.S. attorney for
Arizona. He is the acting U.S. attorney. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ It is impossible to come back from a 3-0 deficit in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is. Come on. Get real. It can't happen. The Braves
are only deluding themselves. No baseball team has ever done it. No
NBA team, either, for that matter. Some things simply cannot be
done. They run so counter to the laws of probability that to
suggest their feasibility is to risk being presumed daffy.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe Atlanta can defeat San Diego four times in a row,
after losing to San Diego three times in a row, you are also no
doubt capable of thinking it's within the realm of possibility for
a man to bash 70 home runs in a single season and win the homer
championship by only four.
</P>
<P>
   You would probably try to tell us Cal Ripken could remove
himself from the Orioles' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Or dare suggest a rookie pitcher could strike out 20 batters in
a game.
</P>
<P>
   Or envision Greg Maddux earning a save and Kevin Brown suffering
a loss in relief _ on the same night.
</P>
<P>
   You could probably even picture Randy Johnson wearing an Astros
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   You, sir or madam, would be deemed mad.
</P>
<P>
   Have I made my point? In any other year, in any normal season,
the Braves would fall quietly on their tomahawks and, chop, chop,
we could start contemplating the World Series. They would never
have gotten out of San Diego alive, certainly not after trailing
twice entering the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   The din alone in Qualcomm Stadium, where the fans behaved more
like those of the football variety, should have shattered Atlanta's
spirit. But baseball is, if nothing else, the most capricious of
pursuits. Bats come alive on a moment's notice; arms and brains go
dead. The hero-to-goat metamorphosis, and vice versa, can be sudden
and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   The home-field ``advantage,'' as all the ultimately meaningless
Qualcommotion revealed, means less on the diamond than it does on
any other playing surface. Ditto momentum. It's the most overrated
intangible in baseball, which is the least emotion-driven team
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball teams can sometimes be at their very best for a short
period of time,'' Braves general manager John Schuerholz points
out, speaking from experience. ``Ten games, 15 games. Then, all of
a sudden they hit the wall and are no longer doing the things they
are capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   Rewind to 1996. The Braves, trailing 3-1 in the NLCS, up and
destroyed the Cardinals thrice, then whipped the Yankees
back-to-back to start the Series. Cripes, Atlanta scored 48 runs in
five games, yielding but two.
</P>
<P>
   Then nothing. Zip. Zero. Zilch. The Yankees took the world
championship with four victories in a row.
</P>
<P>
   We learned nothing revealing about Atlanta as it embarked, with
no advance warning, on its Mission Valley revival. We already knew,
for example, the Braves could win. They had won 109 times, counting
the Division Series sweep. And we knew, or should have known, they
could hit home runs, because they hit 215 in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   We knew Andres Galarraga was an RBI machine. Statistical
probability told us he was overdue to collect a bunch, and so he
did with a monster grand slam in Game 4, the broom-breaking blow
that likely ensured our return to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   After that shot, you sensed an edginess in the Padres during
Game 5 once they went ahead 4-2. They wanted it over a little too
badly, which is why Brown was turned into an emergency setup man.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, Kevin, don't quit your day job.
</P>
<P>
   But don't go assuming the Padres are now devastated by what
happened to them. Manager Bruce Bochy, in fact, said ``devastated''
was far too strong a word. He is still confident enough to have
concluded that saving Brown for a possible Game 7 is the most
prudent way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Brown could pitch Game 6 today _ his arm is fine, though his
nerves might be a bit frayed _ but he won't. Even if the Padres are
left to come to grips with three defeats in a row, Bochy knows a
fourth isn't inevitable. Going 0-3 didn't throttle Atlanta, did it?
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Sterling Hitchcock gets the nod for San Diego against
Tom Glavine, setting up the strong, and wonderful, possibility of a
winner-take-all showdown between the National League's pre-eminent
righthanders, Brown and Maddux, Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly the crescendo this best of all baseball seasons should
deliver as a prelude to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Brown knocked out the Braves on Florida's behalf last year and
shut them out for the Padres in Game 2. Now, we wonder, can they
gain a full measure of revenge? One Michael Tucker homer, albeit a
big one, does not full atonement make.
</P>
<P>
   Or are the Padres, baseball's fastest-pedaling team at the
outset of the season, capable of finding a way to finish what they
started?
</P>
<P>
   Either is possible. Anything is possible, it seems.

DODGERS' MANAGER SEARCH IS CLASSIFIED ENDEAVOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Help wanted:
</P>
<P>
   Applicants sought for supervisor position in prestigious
midsized company. Experience required. Proven ability preferred.
Bilingualism a plus. A little charisma wouldn't hurt. Competitive
salary. Former holder of job is willing to advise. Contact: Los
Angeles Dodgers. An equal opportunity employer since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   -0- -0-
</P>
<P>
   No, the Dodgers haven't resorted to a want ad, yet.
</P>
<P>
   Their search for a field manager to replace Glenn Hoffman,
``reassigned'' two weeks ago, continues on a don't-call-us,
we'll-call-you basis.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone is making the calls, setting up
interviews. So far, he'll point out, he technically has been turned
down by only one candidate, because he actually has offered the job
to only one candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But how much longer before it turns desperate?
</P>
<P>
   And how much longer before it gets downright embarrassing?
</P>
<P>
   Not long, if the Dodgers try, as it appears they will, to woo
Dusty Baker away from the San Francisco Giants, whom he has no good
reason to leave. In fact, he told the San Francisco Chronicle he's
staying.
</P>
<P>
   Not long, if the Dodgers continue to tease Davey Johnson, the
most obviously qualified (never worse than second in 10 full
seasons as a manager) and most obviously available (he's out of
work) candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Not long, if they end up hiring their fifth choice, former
Boston Red Sox, Texas Rangers and Albuquerque Dukes manager Kevin
Kennedy, and his mixed reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some would say this whole endeavor, made unusually
public by Malone's chatty personality, is already embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   Because Jim Leyland, forecast as the ``next'' Dodgers manager
since April, told them no even before they asked, saying it's not
their team he dislikes, it's their entire city.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Dodgers made their first offer to Felipe Alou, a
63-year-old with not so much as a division title to his credit,
only the distinction of having ``overachieved'' with the penny-ante
Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Because Malone and Dodgers president Bob Graziano flew to the
Dominican Republic to make their pitch to Alou at his winter home,
only to ultimately be turned down after the Expos offered a
contract extension reported to be worth triple the $600,000 a year
he was getting.
</P>
<P>
   How could the Dodgers' manager job be less attractive than the
Montreal Expos'?
</P>
<P>
   We know, Alou is loyal to his longtime club, his wife is from
Montreal, the quality-of-life issues favored Montreal. Also, there
were hints Alou was put off by the prospect of Tom Lasorda looking
over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But next season, he'll be the age at which Walter Alston served
his 23rd and final year as Dodgers manager, so he's nearing the end
of a career in which he has never had a chance to win. Given the
opportunity to join the Dodgers, who would give him
championship-quality players, Alou stayed with the Expos, who will
give him pleasant memories of Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   If it came down to money, how did the Fox Group get outbid by
the henhouse in Montreal?
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't be because Malone and Graziano underestimated the
going rate for top managers. The week before they made their
approximately $1 million-a-year offer to Alou, the Colorado Rockies
committed $2 million a year to sign Leyland.
</P>
<P>
   So is it that they've set an unreasonably low budget for the
most important hire they'll make (this year)?
</P>
<P>
   And you thought the problem with Fox owning the Dodgers was they
would overspend.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been an L.A. sports fan for long, you're not used to
watching the Dodgers rejected, not to mention the upheaval in the
dugouts and locker rooms of local teams in general.
</P>
<P>
   When most of us were kids, Alston was the manager, John Wooden
was the basketball coach, John McKay was the football coach and
that was that. There was a five-year period in the early '60s when
only one of Southern California's major teams changed coaches or
managers, the Rams replacing Bob Waterfield with Harland Svare
during the '62 season.
</P>
<P>
   And now: In the 4{ years since Del Harris was hired by the
Lakers, the L.A.-Anaheim area's 10 major teams have all changed
coaches and managers, including the Angels twice, the Kings twice,
the Mighty Ducks twice, USC football twice, USC basketball twice,
the Clippers twice and the Dodgers three times.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers and Dodgers still have vacancies. Nice company.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Dodgers will get their man. Only two questions
will matter in the end: Who is he, and how much dignity will Malone
and the club have lost in the process?
</P>
<P>
   The only thing more embarrassing than losing out to the Expos
would be begging the Giants for permission to talk to Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing more embarrassing than both of those would be
waiting so long to interview Johnson that the Detroit Tigers snap
him up.
</P>
<P>
   This much seems certain: Nothing will be kept secret, every
meeting, every phone call, every ``no thanks'' on the air and in
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   So why not:

 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The moment of truth for Chuck Knoblauch came in the
bottom of the first inning when his name was announced at Yankee
Stadium for the first time since he neglected to chase down that
memorable loose ball last Wednesday. There were no boos. It was a
very warm ovation. They liked him. They really liked him. Knoblauch
exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch had emphasized before the game that he was concerned
about winning and rumbling into the World Series, not about the
fans. But it surely made Knoblauch feel at home when he realized
that the fans had forgiven him. Victories, more than time, had
healed the malice toward Knoblauch and he could play second base
without earplugs.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees defeated the Indians, 9-5, in Game 6 on Tuesday
night to advance to their second World Series in three years,
Knoblauch was easily the most relieved player on the field. The
awful mistake that he had made in Game 2 would be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had won the pennant, and Knoblauch was celebrating
as much as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have them act like that toward me was tremendous,'' said
Knoblauch, about the response that he received. ``It was a great
feeling, and it really helped me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was wearing a cap that declared the Yankees champions
of the American League in 1998; Champagne dripped off the brim as
he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   He did not look up, but continued to talk about how he had
learned a lot by being vilified after making a mistake that Little
Leaguers are expected not to make. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to face things and take it like a man and answer all the
questions, although they're tough,'' Knoblauch said. ``You see what
you're made of when you have to bounce back from something like
that. That's basically what I learned.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees had lost the ALCS, even some of Knoblauch's
teammates had said that he would be branded as the villain for
failing to pursue the ball that glanced off Travis Fryman's back
while he was running outside the baseline. Knoblauch had argued
with the umpire while the go ahead run scored from first and the
Indians won, 4-1. Now Knoblauch can watch television and read the
newspapers again without getting queasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's huge for him,'' David Cone said. ``That's huge for me.
I let them back into the game, and that would have been a tough one
if they would have come back and beat us. And Knobbie, I'm sure
he's feeling a lot better now.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who had two hits in five at-bats, was working on his
second bottle of Champagne five minutes after reporters were
allowed into the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   He flashed the sort of smile that he had not shown too much
recently and, now that the Yankees are in the World Series,
Knoblauch should expect to be teased often about his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if we go all the way, we'll do that,'' Derek Jeter said.
``I don't know what I'll say, but I'll think of something good.'' &QL;

MANAGERS STEAL NLCS SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The two biggest figures in what has already turned
into an incredible and memorable National League Championship
Series are not named Maddux, Gwynn, Galarraga or Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the key people in this series are Bruce Bochy and
Bobby Cox, the managers of the San Diego Padres and Atlanta Braves,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Their chess match will enter its sixth stage tonight and a
tie-breaking and deciding seventh match seems imminent, at least if
the baseball gods have their way.
</P>
<P>
   For the first three games, Bochy was Bobby Fischer to Cox's
Boris Spassky, dominating with every move and looking like a genius
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, Cox has begun to rally. In each of the past two
games he's made brilliant moves, ones Bochy has not been able to
counter.
</P>
<P>
   Each manager also had made his share of questionable moves.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy bringing in Kevin Brown to relieve in the seventh inning
Monday night seemed as if it would go down as one of the most
memorable and timely playoff moves ever. But allowing Brown to
remain in the game and pitch the eighth after he retired all three
batters he faced the previous inning was asking a little too much,
even from someone who never turns down an opportunity to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tucker's three-run home run off Brown will serve as a
bitter reminder of that point for Bochy. In truth, however, who
would not have stuck with Brown in that situation?
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were only six outs away from elimination, and Brown's
impressive track record against Atlanta (he has suffocated them
three times in the LCS in the past two seasons) surely had the
Braves spooked.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, maybe Bochy should have gone to Donne Wall or Dan
Miceli and then turn things over to nearly impenetrable closer
Trevor Hoffman, the Dennis Eckersley of this era.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving a tired Joey Hamilton in for one too many innings in
Game 4 also cost the Padres, who were leading, 3-2, when Atlanta
scored six runs in the seventh inning for its first win of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   There was also that move to bring in Randy Myers in the same
game. Myers has not looked good for some time, and he wound up
loading the bases before giving way to Miceli, who gave up the big
blow of the inning, the grand slam by Andres Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   But Bochy was pure genius in the first three games, using his
bullpen nearly flawlessly in the 10-inning victory in Game 1. Game
3 may have been Bochy's crowning moment in the series, which also
earned him Player of the Game honors from the FOX television
announcers.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, on the other hand, basically got his hat handed to him in
the first three games. Almost every move he made backfired.
</P>
<P>
   Cox was ready to hear second-guessing over his move to lift Greg
Maddux for a pinch-hitter after five innings in Game 3, the same
game Cox burned his best bat on the bench, Ryan Klesko, by allowing
him to bat with first base open and a runner on second. Klesko, of
course, was intentionally walked.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same inning, Cox used his best pinch-hitters _
Michael Tucker and Greg Colbrunn _ and was left having to leave
Keith Lockhart to bat with the bases loaded and one out in the
eighth inning. Lockhart flied to shallow left, and the inning ended
one batter later when Javier Lopez struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, though, Cox has redeemed himself. Bringing in Maddux,
who had not made a relief appearance in 11 years, for the final
three outs of Monday's game will be talked about for years.
</P>
<P>
   There will be more buttons to be pushed tonight and possibly
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the puppeteers of this series have made mostly
brilliant moves. Each knows his club's strengths and weaknesses and
for the most part has put his players in the best position to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Sit back and soak in the moves during Game 6 tonight. It's all
part of the game within the game, which can be a beautiful thing to
watch when done masterfully. &QL;

A HISTORY OF VICTORY PAYS OFF  
 YOUNGEST CARDS DISPLAY A WINNING STATE OF MIND

<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals center Aaron Graham lost only four games in four
seasons at Nebraska. Guard Chris Dishman, another ex-Cornhusker,
also won two national championships there.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year quarterback Jake Plummer led Arizona State to the
Pac-10 title and Rose Bowl berth two years ago. Rookie safety Pat
Tillman was 20-4 in his last two seasons with the Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Ronald McKinnon won three Division II national
titles at North Alabama. Rookie defensive end Andre Wadsworth lost
only two games at Florida State last season and won the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals veterans say the young players who are used to winning
are a big reason why the team has won three of their past four
games, the franchise's best stretch since November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring in a totally different mentality,'' veteran
fullback Larry Centers said. ``You have to have guys on a team who
won't accept defeat and will do whatever it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials said they didn't make a concerted effort to
bring in only players from winning programs, but they like the
results.
</P>
<P>
   `'I think it has made a big difference,'' McKinnon said. ``I
don't have a taste for losing. It's not part of my vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year (4-12 season) was tough to lose like that. I've
never lost so many games. I won a high school state championship
(in Alabama). I've been winning all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dishman, a fourth-round pick in 1997, lost more games last
season than at any time in his football career. He entered this
season determined to not let it happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never settled for losing,'' he said. ``Coming from a
program where you win all the time, when you do lose, you take it
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a fourth-round pick in '96, said that the young players
who come from winning programs have a better feel for ``what it is
like to win championships, the way you have to practice to attain
greatness, and that's an advantage we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer said in July that at times last year, he was bewildered
by the way players acted after losses.
</P>
<P>
   He has sensed a different attitude this season and thinks the
young players have contributed to the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from a losing team to a winning team at ASU. So, I know
how it feels,'' said Plummer, who was 3-8 as a sophomore at ASU.
``I think it helps to have guys who have a habit of winning. When
things break down, they keep pushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had guys who fight. Now, they believe we can make
big plays and come out with a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals (3-3) are playing with more confidence right now
than any time during Coach Vince Tobin's three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   They are coming off a lopsided victory over the Chicago Bears, a
game in which they forced a team-record eight turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know that it's fun right now, fun when you're playing
good football,'' Wadsworth said. '`Once you get that feeling to
catch on, that taste in your mouth, you want to keep it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sanders, in his fourth season, thinks the front office
deserves credit for its off-season moves, including the trade with
San Diego that resulted in the Cardinals getting Wadsworth, wide
receiver/return specialist Eric Metcalf, backup linebacker Patrick
Sapp and a first-round pick next year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the top three running backs (Adrian Murrell, Mario
Bates and rookie Michael Pittman) are in their first season with
the team, and another rookie, Tillman, is starting at free safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have helped bring excitement around here,'' said
Sanders, who went 11-0 at Auburn in 1993. ``We have vets, great
players, who have been around here a long time and lost. The youth,
their character, has rubbed off on a lot of the guys.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ghosts have hung over Yankee Stadium all season,
David Cone once remarked, as the Yankees pursued their place among
the greatest baseball teams in history. But other ghosts haunted
them, ghosts of the very recent past, until the Yankees won the
American League championship on Tuesday night with a 9-5 victory
over the Cleveland Indians in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   The victory means that the Yankees, starting Saturday night,
will play in the World Series for the 35th time and the second time
in three seasons. It means they have exorcised the awful memory of
their 1997 elimination by the Indians in the first round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a 2-1 deficit in games this series, the Yankees came
back to win Games 4, 5 and 6, saving the Game 2 goat, Chuck
Knoblauch, from the eternal disgrace that befell the likes of Fred
Merkle and Bill Buckner.
</P>
<P>
   Before 57,142 fans at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night, Scott
Brosius hit a three-run home run, Derek Jeter stroked a two-run
triple and Ramiro Mendoza and Mariano Rivera pitched flawless
relief in a game in which the Yankees nearly blew a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the World Series, the Yankees can establish their legacy
once and for all, after winning 114 games in the regular season,
three straight in the division series against Texas and four of six
in the American League Championship Series with Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will play host to the winner of the National League
Championship Series between San Diego and Atlanta in Games 1 and 2
of the World Series on Saturday and Sunday nights. The Padres lead
that playoff, 3 games to 2, with Game 6 to be played on Wednesday
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   When Tuesday night's victory was over, when the players were
damp and covered with the sweet smell of Champagne, Jeter spotted a
head of perfectly coiffed gray hair in the middle of the Yankees'
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold on,'' Jeter yelled out. ``Hold on. Somebody's dry around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, he reached and emptied a bottle of bubbly over
the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, who flinched and
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got him,'' Jeter said, escaping.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the trainers' room, the Yankee players took turns
shouting into a phone, to Darryl Strawberry, their teammate who is
recovering from surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from his colon.
Knoblauch was among those who spoke to him before the game and
after. We're thinking of you, Knoblauch told him, and Strawberry
was probably thinking of Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   The second baseman ignored the baseball in the Game 2 loss to
argue a call as the decisive run scored, and throughout the 48-hour
wave of hysteria that follows each playoff loss in this city,
Knoblauch was a pariah. If the Yankees had lost the series, the
image of Knoblauch standing at the base and pointing dramatically
would have become the glossy memory forever stuffed into the mental
album of despair borne by devastated fans. Knoblauch, booed angrily
by fans in his at-bat immediately following the mistake last
Wednesday, would never have been forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees took two of three games in Cleveland to take
control of the series and Knoblauch had played well, earning him at
least a period of finite probation for good behavior. When
Knoblauch was announced before his first plate appearance on
Tuesday night, many rose and cheered, as if to say, You're
forgiven, for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hair on the back of my neck stood on end, to have them
react to me that way,'' Knoblauch said later.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch placed the Cleveland starter, Charles Nagy, on the
defensive, fouling off a two-strike pitch, and then another and
another and so on, until Nagy had thrown nine pitches; even after
Knoblauch grounded out to shortstop, a core of fans cheered him,
understanding that he had chopped away a small piece of Nagy and
given the Yankee hitters a chance to see what Nagy did or did not
have.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter chopped a roller toward third and hustled out a single,
and with the count 2-2, Jeter broke from first on a hit-and-run and
Paul O'Neill lined a curveball to right for a single, Jeter moving
to third. Bernie Williams singled home one run and a sacrifice fly
by Chili Davis scored another, and the Yankees had a 2-0 lead right
away _ the fifth time in the six games of this playoff they had
scored in the first inning. Nagy threw 27 pitches in the first
inning, 18 after Knoblauch's at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   A double by Knoblauch helped produce another run in the second
inning, and when Brosius launched his three-run homer to
straightaway center field in the third inning _ prefaced by Umpire
Ted Hendry's blown call that aided the Yankees _ New York led, 6-0.
David Cone on the mound, no problem.
</P>
<P>
   Cone imploded in the fifth, however. ``I just lost it,'' he
would say later. He allowed three straight hits (one of which hit
Hendry on the backside, in another moment of ignominy for the
umpire) and then a bases-loaded walk to force home a run. Cone
struck out Manny Ramirez for the second out and the crowd roared.
But Jim Thome blasted a titanic grand slam on Cone's next pitch,
his fourth homer of the series, silencing Yankee Stadium. Just like
that, the Indians had drawn to within a run, at 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   But Cleveland's defense gave away three runs in the bottom of
the sixth, an inning that began with the Gold Glove shortstop Omar
Vizquel botching an easy throw to first. Girardi walked, and with
one out Jeter launched a high drive to right-center. Ramirez
charged back to the wall, looking up and leaping dramatically, only
to be guilty of the same infraction as Knoblauch in Game 2: he
ignored the baseball, which landed at the base of the wall, at the
side of Ramirez. Two runs scored, and Jeter would, as well, on
another single from Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza pitched three scoreless innings in relief of Cone,
before Rivera closed out Cleveland in the ninth. When Rivera picked
up Vizquel's grounder in the ninth and threw to first for the
game's final out, the Yankees rushed from the dugout for the
requisite hugs and head slaps and handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   But they seemed subdued, more relieved than exhilarated. They
kept their Champagne spraying to a minimum, and nobody was dumping
shaving cream or pudding on each other. Cone walked through the
clubhouse carrying the A.L. championship trophy and was stopped by
the voice of his manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice going, buddy,'' Joe Torre said to Cone, reaching out and
hugging him; Torre had tears in his eyes, and as they looked at
each other for an instant, Cone's lower lip quivered. They had
overcome the ghosts of 1997, that had beaten Cone and Torre and all
of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice,'' Cone said, ``to get past Cleveland after losing
to them last year.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wells stood in front of his locker, slowly pulling the
cork from a bottle. ``There's another step to go,'' he said. ``But
there's a time and a place to party.''

NBA OWNERS OVERESTIMATE  GAME'S ALLURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who are rich assume they are smart. Even if they tripped
over their own feet and landed in a wheelbarrow of cash, their
windfall was born of higher intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Or so they begin to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The same principle now applies to the NBA, a league that has
jumped to some dangerous conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   As the first two weeks of the season have been officially wiped
out, here's the truth:
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has overestimated its hold on you. The NBA thinks it's a
vital part of American culture when it was merely flavor of the
month. The NBA believes it will prosper without the golden calf,
that someone will simply step up and replace the impact of Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is in for a rude awakening.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they weren't paying attention, but there is sorry
precedent everywhere. The NHL still hasn't recouped its losses from
the 1994 lockout. Baseball needed the best season in its rich
history to extinguish the lingering brushfires. The NFL tried
replacement players, and it was a complete disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, the NBA always stood on the pedestal of
righteousness. The working model for all leagues. The only one that
never lost a game due to labor strife.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, the perspective became skewed.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is 51 years old. The youngest of the four major
professional leagues. The only league that can't fall back on
tradition when all else fails.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA doesn't market its past because its past is shady, at
best. Grainy film of men taking set shots. Dark arenas with 3,000
people in attendance. Coaches who called newspapers after the game
and begged for publicity. Rampant drug use. Teams going bankrupt.
And just 18 years ago, in Magic Johnson's rookie season, the NBA
Finals were shown on tape delay.
</P>
<P>
   Without the bicoastal rivalry of Magic and Bird, one-upped by
the otherworldly talents of Jordan, the NBA would never have
exploded, never grown into a global entity, never blossomed into a
league where the commissioner makes nearly $7 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   To think it will always be this way is a vision clouded by
money. And to think that Jordan is currently dropping hints that
he'd like to play another season, hints that are going unheeded by
the commissioner and owners, is proof of their newfound arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Take away the Jordan story line from last year's NBA Finals and
the only thing left was bad basketball. Take away Jordan from the
NBA and the only thing left is a league of impostors.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm the commissioner and Jordan says he wants to play another
season, I put both sides in a room until the deal is done. I resume
my spot at the cash register. End of lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, the owners don't want to budge and the commissioner
is in their corner. They want to abolish the Larry Bird exemption,
even though basketball should have a soft cap, a way to keep stars
in one community and avoid the mercenary-go-round plaguing
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   They want to put a ceiling on labor costs when they should
realize, without the players, they have no product.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who you side with, and the odds are you side with no
one, there is little chance of this being resolved quickly. When
the networks pulled the plug on NFL replacement games in 1987, the
strike was settled within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how long this lockout lasts, NBA owners still receive
their television money this season. That's $23 million per team as
part of a $2.6 billion deal with NBC and TNT, although revenue from
games not played must be paid back at the end of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. Put it on their tab.
</P>
<P>
   So much for incentive, and so much for the league that always
avoided these quagmires.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are willing to risk everything. Willing to push
greed-sickened fans over the edge. Willing to watch Jordan walk
away from basketball for the same reason he did baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Willing to believe your tolerance has no boundaries. And that's
the most dangerous conclusion of all. &QL;

KLASSEN TO MISS REST OF FALL LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diamondbacks infielder Danny Klassen has a shoulder injury that
will cause him to miss the rest of the Arizona Fall League season.
But he is expected to be ready by the start of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Klassen, who probably will compete with Tony Batista for the
starting shortstop job, suffered a slightly torn labrum in his left
(non-throwing) shoulder on Sunday. The labrum is a type of
cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   Playing for the Scottsdale Scorpions in Peoria against Sun
Cities, Klassen jammed his shoulder diving back to first base on a
routine pickoff play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take the conservative, which is to say the
non-surgical approach, and rehab it,'' General Manager Joe
Garagiola Jr. said. ``(Team physician Dr. David) Zeman feels he
will return in the spring and be as good as new. If it was his
throwing shoulder, we would have more concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Klassen was scheduled to return home to Florida today and begin
his rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Danny, he will follow that religiously,'' Garagiola
said. ``We're all very confident we will get a complete, healthy
player in Tucson next spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola said the Diamondbacks are working on coming up with a
replacement for Klassen on the Scorpions.
</P>
<P>
   Klassen hit .194 in 108 at-bats for the Diamondbacks after being
called up from Triple-A Tucson in midseason. He missed several
weeks after he was sent back Tucson and suffered a fracture in his
left shoulder. This injury, however, is unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny was really looking forward to having a successful Fall
League, based on the time he missed in Tucson,'' said Tommy Jones,
the Diamondbacks' director of minor league operations. ``But he'll
get to start from scratch in the spring. The people in this
organization are very aware of what his capabilities are.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two other Diamondbacks prospects are unsure where
they will play this winter. Outfielders Rob Ryan and Mike Stoner,
who were with Tucson last season, were set to play for La Romana of
the Dominican Republic winter league. But Hurricane Georges
virtually wiped out the team's facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The pair might be re-assigned to one of the four remaining
Dominican teams (San Pedro de Macoris also had to cancel its
season), or, more likely, one of the other Latin American winter
leagues. &QL;

THE UNHERALDED BROSIUS BECOMES HIS TEAM'S NOT SO SECRET WEAPON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the New York Yankees obtained third baseman
Scott Brosius from the Oakland Athletics in a trade for Kenny
Rogers and cash late last year, many Yankee fans didn't know who he
was.
</P>
<P>
   They know now.
</P>
<P>
   With a three-run homer off Charles Nagy in the third inning for
a 6-0 Yankee lead on Tuesday night, Brosius produced what proved to
be the decisive run in the Yankees' 9-5 victory that won the
American League pennant in the sixth game of their championship
series with the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a first-pitch fastball,'' Brosius was saying now
in the Yankee clubhouse. ``The ball just jumped off my bat.''
</P>
<P>
   All around him, the Yankees were shaking Champagne bottles, then
pointing them at their teammates and spraying them with fizz.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you think about doing from the time you're a
little kid,'' said Brosius, who like his teammates was wearing an
``American League champions'' white T-shirt along with his
pinstriped uniform pants. ``I'm just excited to be a part of this
whole thing, and then to contribute makes it extra special.''
</P>
<P>
   For the ALCS, Brosius batted .300 (6 for 20) with 6 runs batted
in. Including the division series sweep of the Texas Rangers, his
overall post-season average is .333 (10 for 30) with 9 runs batted
in, the most of any Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we made the deal for Brosius, we didn't know what to
expect; we hadn't seen that much of him,'' said Joe Torre, the
Yankee manager. ``We never dreamed how well he played defensively
until we saw him every day.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, Brosius made a sparkling play to throw out
Sandy Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't get Alomar,'' Torre said, ``who knows how that
inning goes. Then he went to second on the short wild pitch in the
bottom of the inning. Those are things you can't teach. He's been
an integral part of this club.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth inning, Brosius dove across the third-base line,
snatched Enrique Wilson's leadoff grounder and threw him out _
typical of the almost flawless defense he has provided at third
base throughout the regular season. Batting eighth or ninth, he
drove in a total of 98 runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will open the World Series on Saturday night at
Yankee Stadium against the National League winner, either San Diego
or Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more step to go,'' Brosius said, alluding to the Series.
``After the season we had, to go through two steps like we did, now
we have to get through the final step.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Yankees now were relieved to have won the pennant
after the relative ease of their record 114 victories during the
season, Brosius shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense of relief at all,'' he said. ``There's just
joy at winning the pennant.''

SCHOENFELD: COYOTES HAVEN'T GIVEN UP ON ISBISTER  
 IMMEDIATE ROLE REMAINS CLOUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coyotes fans were asking a ton of questions after the team's
dreadful opening night loss to the Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   Where was the offense? Where was the defense? What's wrong with
the power play? Who should skate with who?
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, and where was Brad Isbister?
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld asked himself that same question
over and over again during the preseason, when the talented young
left wing virtually disappeared. They weren't ready to put his
picture on a milk carton, but after recording only two assists in
seven games, Isbister was definitely missing.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the 6-foot-4, 227-pounder was missing from Sunday
night's lineup. He was benched; a healthy scratch. The same thing
might happen Thursday when the Coyotes host the Colorado Avalanche,
a team they haven't beaten since moving to Phoenix three seasons
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about Izzy before, about our expectations and our
aspirations, but he just didn't have a good preseason,'' Schoenfeld
said. ``He sort of played himself off the initial roster for Game
1. But it doesn't mean he won't be in for Game 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is certain at this point. The 21-year-old Isbister might
break out in a big way or he could stay stuck in a slump. He might
stay in Phoenix. He could be sent to the team's affiliate in
Springfield, Mass. He might play. He could continue to sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty disappointed the other night, of course,'' he
said. ``You never want to sit out a game. It was a coach's decision
and there's nothing I could do about it. But I'll get my chance to
show that I belong and that I want to stay in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   He had plenty of chances to score during the preseason. At one
point, his 13 shots on goal were tied for the team lead. But his
point production ranked the same as the number he wears on his
sweater (16).
</P>
<P>
   That isn't close to being good enough, according to Schoenfeld
and General Manager Bobby Smith, each of whom have gone on record
as saying they expect Isbister to be a future, 30- to 35-goal
scorer in the NHL. He has all the tools, from his size to his speed
to his shot. They weren't banking on it happening this season, but
they felt safe in suggesting he'd vastly improve on the nine goals
and 17 points he posted in 66 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Especially by pairing him with veterans such as Jeremy Roenick,
Rick Tocchet and Cliff Ronning in the preseason. And by carving his
name into the second power-play unit, a role he was given at the
very start of camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we try to force young guys into a role that they
aren't ready to handle yet, and that may have been the case with
Brad,'' Schoenfeld said. ``Last year, we played him on a line with
JR and Toc for a large portion of the year. This year, we didn't
know if Keith (Tkachuk) was going to be here, and before we got
Greg Adams, that left side was pretty vacant. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't hurry the maturing process. You're 17 until
you're 18, and you can't be 18 any damn quicker, no matter how much
you want. Look how long it took a guy like (Ottawa's Alexei)
Yashin. It happens on nature's time. It doesn't happen on your
wish. With Brad, it might be a situation where we have to be a
little bit more patient.''
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-round draft pick in 1995 after scoring 45 goals and 89
points for Portland in the Western Hockey League, Isbister probably
won't get much, if any, ice time with the club's top two forward
lines. Tkachuk and Adams have those spots nailed down at left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld said he could put Isbister on the third line, which
at times, will be more of a checking line. But by doing that, does
Isbister lose his effectiveness as a point scorer? Maybe. Dropping
him to the fourth line, where he's been practicing lately, doesn't
increase his offense, either. But that's probably where he'll play.
If he plays at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not better than Tkachuk, he's not better than (Dallas)
Drake, he's not better than Adams, at this point in his career,''
Schoenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   What about moving him to right wing? Isbister has a right-handed
shot and that's the position he played the most in juniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not better than Tocchet. He's not better than (Shane)
Doan. He's not better than (Bob) Corkum, who we had over there on
Sunday,'' Schoenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean that the door is closed. He's young.
This is his second year. This is Doaner's what, third or fourth
year? Look, Izzy is a strong, devoted, hard-working kid, but it
doesn't happen because you want it to.''
</P>
<P>
   But nobody's giving up on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's important to this team and he's important to this
organization,'' Tkachuk said. ``He's a big, strong kid who can make
things happen and we're counting on him to get back into the lineup
and get the job done.'' &QL;

HEART, CHARACTER WIN CO-MVP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vicki and Big Sal got engaged during a pitching
change, for crying out loud. Who did you expect to win?
</P>
<P>
   You don't ask when 57,142 fans run through five choruses of
Sinatra's ``New York, New York'' and hit every high note.
</P>
<P>
   You don't ask when Scott Brosius hits a three-run homer and
looks like Graig Nettles from some long-ago Dodgers nightmare,
taking away extra-base hits at third base and a whole lot of
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   And you don't ask with Darryl Strawberry owning this town from a
hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees are champions of the American League. They
were at their best, just when their worst looked like it was
rounding third and heading for home.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's 9-5, pennant-clinching victory over the Cleveland
Indians was their record 121st of the season and to win it, they
drew on each and every one of those elements.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone lasted just five innings and gave up a grand slam to
Jim Thome that nearly gobbled up a 6-0 Yankees lead. But he got the
next two outs and turned it over to the bullpen. Cleveland was
never heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say about David Cone was that he won,'' weary
manager Joe Torre said. ``You give him a little bit more rope
because of his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of like his team.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees clearly were baseball's best all season, never
challenged during the regular season or the first round of the
playoffs. There were heroes like Bernie Williams, who won the
American League batting title, and Derek Jeter, who played
shortstop as it has never been played in this team's storied past.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the heart and character of the team Torre brought
together that was the true MVP. It's an ingredient the Dodgers had
in mind when they tried to hire Felipe Alou and thought about Dusty
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was about the team. It sounds easy. It isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was such a great year in baseball with all the excitement
and the home run records,'' Cone said. ``But this is a team game
and we won this pennant as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody played a part, even the crowd. Especially the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a week ago, their second baseman, Chuck Knoblauch, was
nearly booed off the field here after a colossal lapse in judgment
cost the Yankees a victory and apparently their immortality.
</P>
<P>
   When they lost Game 3 and trailed 2-1 in the series, baseball
Armageddon didn't seem far behind. That's the way it is in New
York. But the Yankees took the next three and now await the winner
of Atlanta-San Diego to see who they play in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the country hates this city, but there isn't much
bad you can say about its ballteam.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's game started out in cold and rain, but winter seemed a
long way off.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch grounded out to open the bottom of the first, but his
presence clearly set the tone. He walked to the plate amid cheers.
The fans hadn't forgotten, but business is business.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was spotted a 6-0 lead after Brosius crushed a 416-foot
homer to dead center. Cone caught a break earlier in the inning
when Indians second baseman Enrique Wilson pulled Omar Vizquel off
second base trying to complete a force play. The Indians argued
that Vizquel was on the bag and replays were inconclusive. This
much is fact. If Cleveland makes that play, Brosius never comes to
bat.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of night. Vizquel, who came in without an error
in 46 consecutive postseason games, finally made one. And Brosius
came up with two incredible fielding plays. The first came in the
sixth, an inning after the Indians jumped back in the game. Sandy
Alomar Jr. hit a hot smash over the third-base bag. Brosius, traded
last winter from exile in Oakland, dived to his right. Alomar is a
slow runner, but no need to break the mood. Brosius jumped to his
feet and threw him out.
</P>
<P>
   It happened again in the ninth. Mariano Rivera was in to close
it out, but Wilson hit a sure double down the third-base line.
Brosius backhanded the ball and threw out Wilson by a step.
</P>
<P>
   ``All year he made big plays and had big hits,'' said Williams,
who opened the Yankees scoring with a first-inning RBI single.
``And he has been doing most of it from the ninth spot in the
order.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rivera got the final out, players mobbed the field. Later,
Torre was asked if he thought the celebration was subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, but this was the hard part,'' he said. ``Not to take
anything away from the World Series, but that is kind of a reward.
Getting here is so tough.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the World Series, the only championship that will do for
this team. Do they want Atlanta or San Diego? It's a tough question
you can only ask in a tough town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the Padres to win,'' said ALCS MVP David Wells, a San
Diego native, who defeated Cleveland in games 1 and 5. ``I guess
I'll have to beat up a few people to get more tickets.''

THE SWAGGER APPEARS DULL FOR ALOMAR AND THE INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sandy Alomar's body language told the story of how
this playoff brush with the New York Yankees unfolded so
differently for the Cleveland Indians this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the team's classy savior sprang freely into the air,
raised his arms and trotted on clouds as he lifted a game-tying
home run against the Yankees in the division series. The Yankees,
just four outs from a series victory, never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, the swivel in Alomar's hips was stiff and
slow. And the pain was almost unbearable as he played on in the
Indians' 9-5 loss to the Yankees in Game 6 of the American League
Championship Series at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After the team quietly filed through the hallway, Alomar stood
in a corner of the room with his back wrapped in ice. He was a
still figure in a Cleveland clubhouse where players ate their
post-game meal of chicken and rice in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar was a symbol of how differently this year played itself
out for the Indians. There would be no celebration, no advancement
to the World Series. That kind of party went on down the corridor
and behind the door of the Yankee clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I'm proud of this team,'' said Alomar, whose
season was wracked with injury, leaving him far less potent than
last year. ``We only had a remote chance of beating Boston in the
division series, much less challenging the Yankees. We battled. We
did our best.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar did whatever he could to play in Game 6 after missing
Game 5 with stiffness in his back, which has two bulging disks. He
spent all day Monday in Cleveland with doctors, who gave him a shot
to block the pain in his lower back. But the relief was not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hardly swing or get out of my crouch,'' said Alomar,
who wanted to be behind the plate for the starter Charles Nagy to
depend on. ``I did the best that I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar gave it a go. He tried to bunt in vain during one at-bat
and had to literally throw his bat at a third strike in another.
But in trying, Alomar was a reminder of an Indians team that
battled the Yankees to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Indians were down, 6-0, Jim Thome blasted a grand
slam and tightened the tension in this series once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice to have pulled it off,'' Thome said.
``It's like I say, though, the Yankees are such a good team that
even when we were up, 2-1, in this series, we knew they had the
depth and talent to run off three games in a row. There's no
complaining or head-hanging going on with us. It just didn't work
out for us like it did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year seemed forever ago to Alomar. It has been a long time
since he has known the freedom of movement he had as he lifted his
team against the Yankees in 1997. This time, the scene was far
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were banged up, but we gave it all we had,'' Alomar said.
``I tried to get fixed up because it was important to me to try to
play no matter what I had to go through. It was a tough situation.
But I wanted to be there for my team. I was willing to do anything
to play.'' &QL;

A NAME TO REMEMBER  
 OLYMPIAN WITTY HAS CHANCE TO MAKE HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 WITTY-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The assistant principal at Frank Borman Middle School in Phoenix
has enough to deal with shuttling groups of 500 students in and out
of two assemblies and preserving general order.
</P>
<P>
   He can be excused for an introduction that doesn't capture the
magnitude of one of the Olympic guests.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Chris Witty is insulted.
</P>
<P>
   The unassuming speedskater/cyclist, America's only two-time
medalist at the Nagano Winter Olympics, knows in this U.S. Olympic
Committee Champions of Life context that her story is no more
important than those with whom she shares the stage.
</P>
<P>
   So the seventh- and eighth-graders marvel at Margaret Ambrosia,
80, whose chance to dive at the Olympics in 1940 was taken away by
World War II. And at Paralympian Corbin Beu of Phoenix, whose
wheelchair and persuasive speaking easily grab their attention.
</P>
<P>
   But of the autographs collected on lined notebook paper and even
orange-juice boxes, Witty's is the one to cherish. She has a chance
in 2000 to become the second Olympian ever to medal in the Summer
and Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Think how valuable an Eddie Eagan autograph would be today.
</P>
<P>
   It was Eagan, literally living by the code of his dime-novel
hero Frank Merriwell, who rose from poverty in Denver to an
education at Yale, Harvard Law School and Oxford. And to an Olympic
gold medal in boxing in 1920 and 12 years later an Olympic gold in
bobsled, three weeks after taking up the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of the big picture and the small picture,'' Witty
said of vying for the rarified air of Eagan and seven other U.S.
Summer/Winter Olympians. ``As an athlete, we don't really look at
the big picture all the time. Only once in a while do you look back
and say, `Wow, this is really something big we're doing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``My goals are more looking at each sport and what I need to do
and not necessarily looking at `Can I be the first (woman) to do
this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who think the 23-year-old should not try. She
won a silver medal in the 1,000-meter, her world-record event, and
a bronze in the 1,500 at Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are all for it,'' she said. ``Some say why don't you do
that after Salt Lake (2002 Winter Olympics)? Forget about Sydney
(in 2000), do Athens (in 2004). That's something I might consider
if this (speedskating) season and the following season are not up
to par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been so close (to a skating gold), I can't chance that.
You only have so many opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Cycling, though, has similar allure, and Witty's best event, the
500-meter time trial, was added to the women's Olympic program for
the first time in Sydney. She was fourth, .065 seconds out of a
medal, at the World Cycling Championships in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did take until later in the summer for me to really start
performing up to par,'' said Witty, a 1996 Olympic cycling
alternate. ``Actually I was very happy with the season. I think
it's more feasible (to medal in both sports). The thing I have to
balance out is how can I do that? At what point do I need to take a
break and at what point do I need to train really hard?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bit behind in speedskating, but I have to look at
the reality of it. I can't medal at every World Cup right now if I
want to do both. I have to just focus on the World Championships
(in February and March).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to do because when you're actually at the
races, you're thinking `I want to win.' I have to realize I can't
do that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Connie Paraskevin-Young, who joined Witty in Phoenix for the
U.S. Olympic Congress that concluded Tuesday, agrees with that
approach. She is a speedskating/cycling Olympian who won a
match-sprint bronze medal at the Seoul Summer Games in 1988, and
she worked with Witty leading up to this year's cycling nationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never took a break in between the two,'' Paraskevin-Young
said. ``The day after the World Championships in cycling, I'd start
my running. The cyclists thought I was nuts, but I loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``An athlete in Chris' position, if she's seriously trying to do
both sports, can't take that month break in between. She's got to
be an athlete 12 months out of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Witty, in fact, took a month holiday after Nagano, although she
continued traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``With two peaks each year, you can rest your body so you can
perform well,'' she said. ``It's mentally how I get through.'' &QL;

YANKEES DEEP-SIX INDIANS FOR AL PENNANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is the divine right of kings, the inalienable
rights of Jefferson, and the assumed rights of the New York
Yankees, whose sense of entitlement to the World Series knows no
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night was no exception as the Yankees achieved passage
to the World Series for the 35th time in their history with a 9-5
win over the Cleveland Indians that clinched the American League
Championship Series, four games to two.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is the tensest part, getting there,'' said Yankees
manager Joe Torre, whose sunken eyes filled with tears as he hugged
his wife, Alice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win the World Series, we'll celebrate, it'll be
magnificent, but getting there is the tensest part. This is very
satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' advancement to this World Series seemed inevitable
through a record-setting regular season in which the only real
danger they faced came when a 500-pound steel joint fell in Yankee
Stadium back in April, forcing the postponement of two games.
</P>
<P>
   And when they scored six runs in the first three innings
Tuesday, the last three coming on a home run off Indians starter
Charles Nagy by third baseman Scott Brosius, it seemed time to
break out the champagne that has been on ice since Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   But there would be one last throat-clutching moment of tension
for the Yankees. The Indians, who came within two outs of winning
the World Series last year, mounted a fifth-inning comeback with
five runs off starter David Cone, with the redoubtable Jim Thome
hitting a grand slam into the third deck, his record fourth home
run in the ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   What Cone had intended to be his defining moment instead
threatened to become a last-second reprieve for the Indians, who
drew within 6-5. Suddenly, the Yankees were more concerned with
simple survival than manifest destiny.
</P>
<P>
   But a throwing error by usually impeccable shortstop Omar
Vizquel opened the way to three more Yankee runs in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That error turned the whole perspective of the game,'' said
Vizquel, who lobbed the ball over the head of Thome at first,
allowing Brosius to reach on a routine bouncer to short. ``Error on
the leadoff guy, a walk after that. We paid for that error.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius advanced to second on a wild pitch, and Indians reliever
Dave Burba walked Joe Girardi on a full count.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch fouled off a third-strike bunt attempt for one
out, but Derek Jeter then hit a drive that confounded right fielder
Manny Ramirez, who turned his back to the plate and leaped onto the
wall like a rock climber _ while the ball landed at the base of the
fence. Two runs scored on what was ruled a triple, and one out
later, Bernie Williams made it 9-5 with a single, his third hit of
the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a knife stuck in your heart,'' Vizquel said of Jeter's
hit. ``Your whole body just goes stone cold. And when Bernie
Williams gets another base hit, that's even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Burba had entered in the fourth inning in relief of Nagy, who
was taken deep by Brosius after another controversial call by
umpire Ted Hendry, who was at the vortex of the Game 2 firestorm
surrounding Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   Hendry drew Knoblauch's ire _ and brain lock _ when he declined
to find Travis Fryman guilty of interference after his bunt in the
12th inning of Game 2. On Tuesday night he ruled that Enrique
Wilson's throw had pulled Vizquel off the bag on an attempted force
of Williams, who had singled to open the third.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's throw to second was slow and to the left-field side of
the bag, but replays showed that Vizquel, stretching like a first
baseman, was anchored to the bag long enough to record the out.
</P>
<P>
   That play would take on enormous significance. Nagy retired the
next two batters, Tino Martinez (strikeout) and Rickey Ledee (fly
ball), but instead of having the inning over, he had to face
Brosius, who homered to center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was clearly out,'' Indians general manager John Hart said
calmly. ``It was a bad call. It cost us three runs. That's the game
of baseball. Little things can cost you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Thome put the Indians back in the game. Cone had
struck out seven in the first four innings, but three straight
singles, the last striking Hendry in the backside, loaded the bases
with no outs in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Cone walked David Justice to force in Cleveland's first run,
which prompted a visit from Torre and assistant trainer Steve
Donohue. Cone remained in the game, striking out Ramirez for the
first out, but Thome sent Cone's next pitch on a majestic arc into
the upper deck, drawing the Indians within a run.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Yankees exploited the error by Vizquel, who had
been flawless afield in 46 consecutive postseason games and had
made just five errors in 720 total chances during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the ground ball,'' said Burba, ``and as soon as he
fielded it, I said to myself, `One out _ let's get the next guy.'
Then the ball sailed over Thome's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get the monkey off Omar's back. I probably feel
worse than he did. I didn't pick him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel sat on top of his chair in front of his cubicle in the
mummified losers' quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Was he shocked when he made the error?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in shock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Yankees are in the World Series. Winners of a
league-record 114 games during the regular season, they have
anniversaries galore to observe in their pursuit of history.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five years in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years of George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after Bucky Dent's screen shot.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after they won their last World Series, helped
immeasurably by a home run by Jim Leyritz, who may be on the other
side this go-round if the San Diego Padres can hold off the Atlanta
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did we mention that it has been 80 years since the Red
Sox won their last World Series, then sold Babe Ruth?

BAKER NOT INTERESTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) (UPDATE RE DAVEY
JOHNSON)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One day after the Los Angeles Dodgers appeared ready
to ask the San Francisco Giants for permissiong to talk to Dusty
Baker about their vacant manager's position, Baker said there is no
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't bother calling, I have no interest in managing the
Dodgers,'' Baker told the San Francisco Chronicle on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was unlikely the Giants were going to grant permission even
if Baker hadn't responded to reports of the Dodgers' interest.
</P>
<P>
   Giants general manager Brian Sabean said Tuesday at the club's
organizational meetings. ``(Baker) is under contract, that's all I
can say,'' alluding to the two-year extension that kicks in this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Baker led the Giants to a wild-card playoff game against the
Chicago Cubs this past season after winning the National League
West in 1997. He will earn $700,000 this coming season. At the time
Baker signed the extension, the Giants said they wanted him to be
with the club in 2000 when they open their new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is under contract, the Dodgers have to receive
permission to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone has set up an
interview Saturday with Davey Johnson, who also is being considered
for the manager's job in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   After rushing to hire Felipe Alou, who stayed with Montreal,
Malone said he will be more patient in the next round of
discussions. He hopes to have a manager in place by his own
organizational meetings, Oct. 28-Nov. 1 in Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Tigers' payroll is not expected to climb above $30
million next season, Johnson clearly is hoping the Dodgers act
soon. They are expected to have a $75 million payroll in 1999.

CONGRESS REVIVES SKILLED WORKER VISAS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS FREEDBERG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After suffering a near-fatal setback last week, a
measure sought by Silicon Valley firms allowing them to hire
additional temporary foreign workers has been revived. It will be
included in a huge spending bill being negotiated by the White
House and Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a complete breakdown in budget negotiations, the
bill is expected to be approved by Congress and signed by President
Clinton within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big victory for the economy, which is being fueled
in large part by our high-tech industries,'' said Sen. Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich., the chief sponsor of the bill, which also
received the strong backing of California Sens. Dianne Feinstein
and Barbara Boxer. ``The legislation strikes the right balance in
safeguarding America's competitive edge and protecting U.S. jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also welcomed the measure's inclusion but
cautioned that nothing is final until the budget talks conclude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House, Spencer Abraham, Sen. Boxer and others have
all been pressing hard for this to be included in the bill, and
while nothing's over 'til it's over, the prospects for its
inclusion are looking quite good,'' said Gene Sperling, chairman of
the White House National Economic Council.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which has already been overwhelmingly approved by the
House, would increase the number of visas issued to temporary
workers from 65,000 to 115,000 for each of the next two years, and
set it at 107,500 for one year after that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had earlier agreed to increasing the number of skilled
worker visas but insisted on including several other provisions,
including requiring employers to pay $500 for each foreign worker
they hire. The fee would go into a fund to retrain American
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who is closely allied with
labor organizations, blocked passage of the bill by placing a
``hold'' on the bill, a common parliamentary procedure. Harkin said
he does not believe there is a sufficient shortage of skilled
American workers to justify importing extra foreign workers to fill
computer-related jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Because the legislative session is expected to end this week,
there would have been no time to use normal parliamentary practices
to overrule Harkin, and high-tech industry representatives feared
the bill would die altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But Abraham, along with high-tech lobbyists, went around Harkin
and persuaded Republican leaders to include the bill in the Omnibus
Appropriations Bill, a measure that includes financing for most
federal programs.

STANFORD PROF WINS NOBEL FOR BREAKTHROUGH QUANTUM THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL and BILL WORKMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University won
the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for a groundbreaking explanation
of a bizarre sideways dance performed by ensembles of electrons
trapped in a two-dimensional space.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two other physicists, Horst L. Stormer of Columbia University
and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton University, shared in the prize for
earlier experiments that set the stage for Laughlin's work.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences also awarded Nobels in
chemistry Tuesday to scientists at U.S. universities for pioneering
work in quantum theory.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Kohn at the University of California at Santa Barbara and
John Pople of Northwestern University in Chicago, both prominent in
the field of computational chemistry, were recognized for
developing new tools to predict the behavior of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Each Nobel comes with a cash award of $978,000, shared by the
winners in each category. It is the fourth year in a row that a
Stanford physicist has won the honor.
</P>
<P>
   Laughlin learned of the award from his 13-year-old son, Todd,
who fielded the call from Sweden on a Mickey Mouse phone in his
room.
</P>
<P>
   A Nobel favorite for years, Laughlin joked that he had begun to
feel ``kind of like being the only kid on the block who doesn't
have one'' after working among such past Stanford laureates as
Steven Chu, Douglas Osheroff and Martin Perl.
</P>
<P>
   Laughlin, 47, was honored for startling insights published in
1983 while he was a staff scientist at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, and which developed from work he did at the old Bell
Labs.
</P>
<P>
   His theories followed the experimental findings of Tsui and
Stormer, which had set the physics world abuzz by establishing a
so-called fractional quantum Hall effect _ where groups of
electrons act as if they are quarks, or fractions of a single
electron.
</P>
<P>
   The work has since become a keystone of a new field of quantum
physics, distantly related to a classic discovery in 1879 named for
physics pioneer Edwin Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of implausible explanations,'' recalled
Laughlin's longtime colleague, Livermore physicist Stephen Libby,
``and then Bob came out with this gorgeous and obviously brilliant
explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   In almost any introductory physics class, students learn that
electrons moving along a strip of metal will deflect sideways if
subjected to a magnetic charge operating perpendicular to the
strip. This sideways move puts more electrons on one side than the
other, creating a charge.
</P>
<P>
   The stronger the magnetic field, the higher the charge. The
physicist Klaus von Klitzing, who won the Nobel in 1985, applied
the principles of quantum physics to show that under special
conditions of two-dimensional space, the same particles would move
in a stair step fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, each ``jump'' was equivalent to a single electron's
``unit charge.'' The Tsui-Stormer experiments that won the shared
Nobel took that a step further, showing that under colder
temperatures and higher-powered magnetic fields, the electrons
could move in steps within the steps.
</P>
<P>
   Because there was no actual splitting of any electrons into even
smaller particles, no theoretician could explain it until Laughlin
came along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredibly puzzling. It was a totally puzzling
result,'' said Richard Fortner, head of the physics lab at
Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   The theory took quantum mechanics to new plateaus, unleashing a
bizarre new vocabulary that is still puzzling enough to anyone
unfamiliar with such concepts as ``composite bosons'' and
``magnetic flux.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical utility of such fundamental discoveries is yet to
be made clear, either, although experts insist that such advances
as super-efficient computers and power-generation are coming.
</P>
<P>
   Laughlin, a self-taught composer and pianist who frequently
takes friends and family hiking near his cabin in the Sierra,
seemed perturbed by repeated questions as to the usefulness of his
work.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues noted that Laughlin has long maintained a fierce
advocacy for basic research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to make technology tomorrow, although I could
be wrong about that,'' Laughlin said Tuesday. ``Our business is
finding what is truth and distinguishing what is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   He decried those who might abandon support of the kind of
theoretical research that he and his Nobel colleagues have been
encouraged to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, for one, am very pessimistic about the chances for even one
generation younger than I to have the opportunity to be where I am
today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chemists who were honored Tuesday won for work considered
more clearly linked to product payoffs, such as making the process
of drug discovery less reliant on painstaking experiments to find
out how certain molecules behave.
</P>
<P>
   Work by Pople, in particular, laid a foundation for the modern
pharmaceutical industry, said Peter Kollman, a professor at the
University of California at San Francisco's School of Pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably 2,000 people who do this now in industry
and at universities, and they all rely on the work that he did,''
Kollman said.

STARS' BELFOUR MASTERS HAWKS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The statistics don't show it, but Ed Belfour continued
his mastery of his old team last night.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars goalie had only 13 saves, but that was enough to give
him a 3-1 victory and keep him undefeated in four tries against the
Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely is a challenge,'' he said. ``I played there 10
years. I definitely enjoy competing against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory pushes the Stars to 2-0 this season and was a
``playoff caliber'' test, coach Ken Hitchcock said. The Stars
outshot the Blackhawks, 31-14, and at times tilted the rink so
heavily that the Stars' end of the ice was in pristine condition.
Only Chicago goalie Jeff Hackett's performance kept his team in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the goalies were the two best players on the ice,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Stars had plenty of contributions that forced
Hackett into his dazzling performance: Mike Modano had a gritty
rebound goal off a Brett Hull shot and was a frustrating penalty
killer, as well. He added three takeaways and had a 15-11 night in
the faceoff circle. Pat Verbeek had his second goal in two games
and never backed down when the game got physical. In fact, he set
up his own power-play goal by forcing Blackhawks defenseman
Christian LaFlamme into the penalty that gave the Stars the man
advantage. Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk were bruising in
their protection of Belfour, dishing out 12 hits (Hatcher had
seven) and shutting down a good performance by Blackhawks center
Doug Gilmour.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on. Defenseman Darryl Sydor had two assists. Jamie
Langenbrunner and Dave Reid were again strong in combination with
Verbeek. Defenseman Craig Ludwig dished out five hits in only 12:21
of ice time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams played extremely hard. And if you didn't play hard,
you were exposed pretty simply,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Stars' only real mistake of the game came when
center Guy Carbonneau fumbled a puck behind his own net midway
through the first period. Gilmour, who joined the Blackhawks as a
free agent in the off-season, scooped it up and fed linemate Chad
Kilger for an easy shot from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   That put the Stars behind, 1-0, at the 12:53 mark. But a team
that was 7-14-3 last season when allowing an opponent to score the
first goal, bounced back and took control.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek scored walking into the slot after a pass from
Langenbrunner to tie the score at the 18:17 mark of the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Modano gave the Stars the lead, scoring only 44 seconds
into the second period. Brett Hull, who has 10 shots and two
assists in his first two games with the Stars, took a pass from
Sydor and circled around the back of the net, drifting out to the
high slot where he found himself alone. Hull whipped a
cannonball-shot at Hackett and the Blackhawks goalie wasn't able to
completely smother it. Modano needed two pokes to finally push in
the game-winner _ his second game-winner in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour had faced only four shsthat time, and the Stars at one
point had outshot the Blackhawks, 20-4. But Belfour, who is 4-0 and
has given up only two goals in four games (0.50 goals against
average) against his former team, came up biggest in the second
period when Chicago had a five-on-three for 52 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The save of the game came when burly Blackhawks winger Eric Daze
was alone in front of Belfour on a mad scramble and rocketed a shot
for the lower left corner 12 minutes into the second period.
Belfour, falling backward, made a toe save, lost his stick and
still was quick enough to recover for another flurry that came
seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie had two great saves on that five-on-three,'' Hitchcock
said. ``That was huge.''
</P>
<P>
   He was just as strong in the third period, holding a 2-1 lead
until the final second when Matvichuk scored from 130 feet into an
empty net.

YANKEES RAISE AMERICAN FLAG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Few remember the 1906 Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Their single-season record of 116 victories became little more
than a notation for baseball's record books after the Chicago White
Sox won the World Series that season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who advanced to their 35th World Series with last
night's 9-5 victory against the Indians in Game 6 of this American
League Championship Series, wish to avoid a similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess anybody is vulnerable,'' said left-hander David Wells,
the series most valuable player for his victories in Games 1 and 5,
``but we're just fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, whose 114 regular-season victories established a
league record, demonstrated that in the game's decisive sixth
inning after the Indians _ who once trailed by six runs _ rallied
within one.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Dave Burba induced what appeared to be a routine
ground ball from third baseman Scott Brosius. But Omar Vizquel _
the game's best-fielding shortstop _ launched an errant throw, and
the Indians' hopes of forcing Game 7 began to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Burba issued a walk to catcher Joe Girardi, and a one-out triple
by shortstop Derek Jeter gave the Yankees an 8-5 lead and ensured
that baseball's winningest team this season would participate in
the Fall Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with fire all night long with three errors, and we
got burned by it,'' said manager Mike Hargrove, whose Indians
allowed five unearned runs in a four-run loss.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed reliever Ramiro Mendoza, whom Yankees manager Joe
Torre summoned from the bullpen in the sixth inning to replace
starter David Cone, never gave the Indians a chance to mount a
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, who retired nine of 10 batters, pitched three scoreless
innings. Yankees closer Mariano Rivera pitched a perfect ninth
inning and terminated this series by inducing a weak ground ball in
front of the mound from Vizquel for the game's final out.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' early 6-0 lead appeared insurmountable with Cone _
one of the major leagues' four 20-game winners this season _ on the
mound and in control as seven strikeouts through four innings would
suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Indians second baseman Enrique Wilson, center fielder Kenny
Lofton and Vizquel loaded the bases, though, with consecutive
fifth-inning singles, and designated hitter David Justice drew a
walk to force across the Indians' first run.
</P>
<P>
   Cone responded with a strikeout of right fielder Manny Ramirez
for the inning's first out, but first baseman Jim Thome returned
the suspense to the series. The left-handed power hitter unleashed
his bat on Cone's first-pitch fastball and deposited it into the
upper deck's right-field seats for a 405-foot grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees built their six-run lead against right-hander
Charles Nagy, who Monday acknowledged the Indians' glaring
weakness. ``I don't think we have a No. 1 guy on our staff,'' Nagy
said of the Indians' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy, who this season went 15-10 with a 5.22 earned-run average,
certainly cannot be classified as a No. 1 starter and demonstrated
such during his three-inning appearance. Brosius drove that point _
not to mention three runs _ home with his third-inning, 416-foot
home run that gave the Yankees a 6-0 lead.

PBR HELPS RODEO BREAK THROUGH TO BIG CITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, legendary professional rodeo champion Jim
Shoulders made a very astute observation out of concern for the
sport's desperate need to attract more fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make it a priority to hold rodeos in places like
Chicago, cities were masses of people live, instead of towns like
the Mineral Wellses and Chickasha, Oklahomas,'' Shoulders said.
</P>
<P>
   Good point. In Mineral Wells, with a 15,000 population, the
annual May rodeo's attendance figure is less than desirable. Cities
such as Chicago and Los Angeles, with populations in the millions,
are markets that must be viewed as the new frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Though I agreed with Shoulders], the question lingered in my
mind: How can a sport such as rodeo reach the masses in
metropolitan areas, especially when the majority of Americans have
no firsthand exposure to agriculture and ranching?
</P>
<P>
   The answer has come in recent years: The Professional Bull
Riders Bud Light Cup Tour. It is rodeo's star running back, banging
into the major urban areas and carrying the message to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, PBR officials announced that the association's World
Finals will move to Las Vegas' Thomas and Mack Center next year,
the beginning of a five-year contract. The championships have been
scheduled at Las Vegas' MGM Grand for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to the 19,000-seat Thomas and Mack Center gives the
growing and crowded PBR finals about 2,000 more seats. The new
contract also promises more hefty prizes. For the past three years,
the purse for The Nashville Network-televised finals has been about
$1 million. Next year, the finals purse is expected to be $1.5
million.

<P>
   The bull-riding tour has become a big belt buckle for rodeo.
With its simple format and the element of danger _ a cowboy
attempts to stay on a bull for eight seconds _ bull riding is a
show that contact-sports fans from every strata of society can
cling to.
</P>
<P>
   When Chris Woodruff of Weatherford produced the PBR Bud Light
Cup Tour show last weekend in Columbus, Ohio, the small, 6,000-seat
venue was filled to the brim each night and fans were turned away.
Granted, the bull riding was held in conjunction with a
high-profile horse show (the American Quarter Horse Association
Congress); nonetheless, it was successful in a city that doesn't
thrive on ranching and agriculture. Organizers are talking about
holding two shows in Columbus next year on back-to-back weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the PBR Cup Tour show filled venues in
unlikely cities such as Landover, Md. (15,000 in attendance in the
Washington suburb) and Tampa, Fla. (16,000). Tampa was among 24
cities on the 1998 PBR Bud Light Cup Tour; some others are St.
Louis, Anaheim, Calif., Worcester, Mass., and Fort Worth, which
last year was billed as the top regular-season show.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the PBR's $5.5 million tour, which includes a stop
March 12-14 in Fort Worth, is expanding to at least 28 stops. Some
new stops include Salt Lake City and Phoenix, which previously held
shows that were produced by a defunct organization called Bull
Riders Only.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Jim Shoulders spoke prophetically when he said that
rodeo must find a way to reach the masses in cities. After all, in
Shoulders' heyday in the 1950s, rodeo's marquee show was staged in
New York's Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three decades, Shoulders sadly watched the sport
settle for rural towns in the heartland. Now that the PBR has taken
the bull by the horns, at least one rodeo event is on its way back
to the big cities.
On the NFR trail When Australia native Scott Johnston finally
acquired a visa last summer that would allow him to compete on the
North American rodeo circuit, the De Leon resident had lots of
catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston began his quest for a National Finals Rodeo berth
during the bustling July 4 weekend. Though he got off to a late
midseason start, Johnston ranks 17th in the saddle-bronc-riding
race, two slots away from the elite top 15. After earning a little
more than $6,000 last weekend, he is almost $13,000 behind
15th-ranked Ty Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Moving into the top 15, the criterion for qualifying for the NFR
when the regular season ends Nov. 8, is an uphill battle Johnston
thinks he can win. ``It can be done still,'' Johnston said of
reaching the NFR in Las Vegas in December. ``I'm confident I can
get there, all with God's help.'' He got there last year for the
first time and won the NFR average in saddle bronc riding.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Johnston, 25, won the saddle-bronc title at the
Heart of Texas State Fair Rodeo in Waco. He also paced the field at
Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association shows in Minot, N.D., and
Industry, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   With four weekends remaining in the regular season, Johnston
said he will travel hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be out here rodeoing if I didn't think I could do
it,'' he said. On fire to win After finishing second in the
goat-tying race last year in the North Texas High School Rodeo
Association, Lacy Averhoff is determined to snare the title in the
1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Boswell High School senior took the lead in the title race
by winning the goat tying at last weekend's Trinity Rodeo in
Saginaw. After five regular-season rodeos, Averhoff leads the race
with 331 points, 50 more than second-place Jennifer Dennis of
Trinity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I'm expecting to win a saddle,'' said Averhoff,
speaking of the trophy saddle that is awarded to the champion.
``Last year, I didn't win the title, even when I was working really
hard for it. And that's the main reason why I want to win it this
year. It's a goal that I haven't yet accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her strong start goat tying, Averhoff has helped
Boswell take the lead in the team race; Boswell leads Mansfield
1,667-1,652, and third-place Northwest has 1,625 points.
</P>
<P>
   Boswell also has benefited from the efforts of Joe Hub Baker,
who leads the boys' rookie title race, and Travis Forehand, who is
in the top 15 in calf roping and team roping.
III. THE BUZZ
Colleges The men's and women's teams from Hill College won titles
last weekend at the Sam Houston State Rodeo, the National
Intercollegiate Rodeo Association's Southern Region season opener.
Other highlights for Hill at the region's first of 10 season
rodeos: Former South Grand Prairie High School standout Jason
Bennett won the men's all-around title; Eastland native Pecos Pogue
paced the field in saddle-bronc riding; and former Sanger standout
Katie Webster won goat tying.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing second at the Vernon Regional Junior College
Rodeo last weekend, Tarleton State's women lead the NIRA's
Southwest Region team title race over Western Texas, 914 to 625.5.
Tarleton's men won the Vernon rodeo's team title and rank second in
the regional team race with 747, 12 points behind West Texas A&AMP;M.
Bull riding Australia native Troy Dunn of Stephenville enters this
weekend's Professional Bull Riders Bud Light Cup Series
regular-season-ending show in Anaheim, Calif., leading the title
race. After finishing sixth overall last weekend in Columbus, Ohio,
Dunn leads Terry Don West of Henryetta, Okla., 7,149 to 6,365
points. The series concludes with the Nov. 6-8 Las Vegas World
Finals. Stock contracting Fans at Saturday's PBR show in Columbus
were wowed by five final-round scores in the 90s. Four of the bulls
that helped provide the unusually high marks were owned by
Louisiana producer James Harper and Claude Kimbelin, who ranches in
Aubrey. The four bulls were Rampage (Dunn scored 95.5), Nitro
(Chris Shivers, 93.5), Gambler (Norman Curry, 92) and Henry (K.J.
Pletcher, 90).
</P>
<P>
   The other animal that bucked a finalist into the 90s was Terry
Williams' Red Wolf, billed as the PBR's top bull last year. In the
final, Columbus winner Donald Owens turned in a 92.5 atop Red Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was in place this weekend, and I'm not just saying
that because I won,'' Owens said. ``The bull riders rode well, the
bulls bucked hard, and there wasn't an empty seat in the house.''
Women's rodeo The Women's National Finals Rodeo is scheduled Oct.
30-Nov. 1 at Cowtown Coliseum in Fort Worth. For information, call

ASSISTANTS SURVIVE IN NFL IF PRIZED PUPILS CAN MAKE THE GRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ So there is no confusion, let me get this out of
the way now: Chan Gailey's staff has been a great match for an
offensive unit that was boring, mistake-prone and generally
ineffective in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is a leading candidate for NFL coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But let's look at the offensive staff that was here before
Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese was criticized here for
being too predictable and for not developing young players. All
Zampese did, of course, was piggy-back on a system that had won two
Super Bowls before he arrived in 1994 and would win another one in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the ``boring'' Zampese up to now? Coordinating a New
England Patriots offense that scored 40 points against a Kansas
City Chiefs defense that was ranked No. 1 in the league before
Sunday. (By the way, the Cowboys have not scored 40 points in a
regular-season game since 1994).
</P>
<P>
   And what about the other Cowboys offensive assistants swept out
of Valley Ranch when Jerry Jones replaced Barry Switzer with
Gailey? Wide-receivers coach Hubbard Alexander? Tight-ends coach
Robert Ford? Running-backs coach Joe Brodsky?
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who could never develop another wide receiver
opposite Michael Irvin, looks pretty good ``coaching'' Randy Moss,
Cris Carter and Jake Reed in Minnesota. Brodsky coaches the leading
rookie rusher in the NFC, Curtis Ennis. Ford is now coaching wide
receivers at Miami, where injuries have limited the Dolphins'
passing production.
</P>
<P>
   But the message remains: There are a few great coaches in this
league. And there are a few bad ones. The rest are only as good or
as bad as the players they employ. What does Michael think?
Speaking of coaching, Irvin's take on Gailey is that he is an
intelligent coach who is confident of his plan, and that the sooner
players realize Gailey's intelligence level, the better off they
will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the direction we're headed, and it's a positive
direction. Everybody is upbeat and comes to work ready to work.
It's good to be back on track with that,'' Irvin said. ``Chan is
totally in control of the whole team. In meetings, he breeds
confidence. All we got to do is listen and do what he says and
we'll be okay.'' Backup success Several former backup Cowboys
quarterbacks led charmed lives last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Wilson (1995-97) threw a 68-yard pass to James Jett with
1:28 to go as the Raiders beat the San Diego Chargers, 7-6. Rodney
Peete (1994) rushed for one touchdown and threw another as the
Eagles beat the Washington Redskins, 17-12. Steve Beuerlein
(1991-1992) completed 18 of his first 19 passes, but the Panthers
lost to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   And we can't leave out the guy who gave the Cowboys a hand in
Super Bowl XXX. On Sunday, he threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to
give the Bengals a 25-20 victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Nice going, Neil O'Donnell. Inside the locker room With three
interceptions and two touchdowns on returns, Deion Sanders is
having his best season in a Cowboys uniform. He is one of the
leading candidates for NFL most valuable player. And he is quickly
becoming one of the most electrifying players in Cowboys history,
joining Bob Hayes, Herschel Walker (pre-1989 trade) and Tony
Dorsett. ``Deion is a phenomenal athlete, like the Michael Jordan
of football or as close as you can get to it,'' Irvin said. ``For
me, he is the greatest athlete I've ever seen.'' Sanders, by the
way, will be up for a new contract after next season, but team
owner Jerry Jones said he is certain that Sanders will remain with
the Cowboys for the rest of his career. ... James Bates, the son of
Cowboys defensive-line coach Jim Bates, didn't make it as a Cowboys
linebacker this summer, but he is doing fine in Hollywood. James
has starred in several Pizza Hut commercials and has a part as a
football player in the upcoming movie ``Water Boy'', starring Adam
Sandler. Later this year, James is expected to be in a
yet-to-be-named movie starring Al Pacino and Dennis Quaid.

<P>
   Yardsticks: How far do the Cowboys have to go?
First-and-10
</P>
<P>
   The best Monday-morning quarterbacking is done by Cowboys
officials who watch film the day after games and chart tackles.
Minutes after the Carolina game, Greg Ellis was credited with five
tackles. But a review of the film showed he had nine. Fred
Strickland (six to 10) and Dexter Coakley (four to eight) also had
better games than what the naked eye showed.
Halftime break
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have outscored their opponents, 84-26, in the second
half. Coach Chan Gailey would like to think that the club's
conditioning has been a big factor. ``We're able to able to come in
the locker room and recover at halftime and go out and play at a
high level,'' he said.
Third quarter of life
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones turned 56 yesterday. Gailey ended
yesterday's news conference joking, ``I need to go get \RJones\S a
card.'' Jones then joked about his ride to work through a
neighborhood yesterday morning. ``The \Rpoliceman\S stopped me. I
said, `You know it's my birthday.' He said, `You shouldn't be
driving at your age.' ''

   1. MISTER MTV : AT 18, THE ROCK CHANNEL IS STILL ``PRETTY COOL''
Being the coolest rock-music channel on television is one thing,
but staying cool year after year, while expanding around the world,
is quite another. In this interview, Tom Freston, the head of MTV,
offers his insights into the world of pop, the tastes of today's
young people, globalization, American cultural dominance and more.
He also tells how he went from selling toilet paper to selling rock
music -- and explains how those teenage icons Beavis &AMP; Butthead
will change, just a bit, when they start speaking Russian. From Der
Spiegel. 1,000 words. Q&AMP;A format. (English translation available.) 
____________________________________________________________________
____ 2. CHEAP THRILLS IN MAINSTREAM CINEMA Pornographic violence
and explicit sex - once the realm of the 'B' movie - elbow their
way into mainstream cinema very regularly today. The idea of the
difficult-to-watch imagery is not merely to shock or entertain, but
to convey a certain hyperrealism in the service of a sweeping
social or political message. By Diane Cardwell. From The New York
Times Magazine. 1,000 words. 3. BRYAN ADAMS, SINGING FOR AN
AUDIENCE OF ONE Brian Adams has recorded 10 albums and sold more
than 55 million records. His name is in the Guinness World Book of
Records (for the longest-standing No. 1 single in British music: 16
weeks for ``Everything I Do, I Do It For You.'') But as he marks
the release of his new album, ``On A Day Like Today,'' he claims to
be indifferent to the reactions of audiences, critics or even
record buyers. At this stage, he says, he writes songs solely to
please himself. In this interview Adams talks about the album, his
new, more upbeat outlook on life, why he usually takes so long to
put together an album and how his globetrotting youth as the son of
a Canadian diplomat - and his early exposure to war and the drug
world - affects his music to this day. By Bonnie Siegler. 1,400
words + photo. 4. THE THIRD COMING OF SHARON STONE Since she
uncrossed her legs and caught everyone's attention in ``Basic
Instinct,'' Sharon Stone has become serious, being nominated for an
Oscar in ``Casino'' (1996,), playing a Death Row inmate in ``Last
Dance'' (1997) and now playing a very realistic mother of a
disabled child in ``The Mighty.'' In this interview Stone talks
about the new film, the impact of her marriage to San Francisco
publisher Phil Bronstein, how she knows what it is to be taunted as
a child and why she recently said no to ``Basic Instinct 2.'' By
Ian Spelling. 1,200 words + photo. 5. FACE VALUE : BACK TO BASICS?
SHARON STONE Artist Vince Lehmkuhl offers an intriguing cartoon of
Sharon Stone in ``The Mighty,'' as her hard-working mother
character opens a door to discover a calendar of her in the1992
film ``Basic Instinct.''

ASHES TO ASHES AT BURNING MAN '98 Participants at the annual
Burning Man Festival, held in a dry lakebed in Nevada, expose their
creative inner selves by shedding Armani suits or Gap jeans and
reinventing themselves in neon glitter body paint, jewels or
feathers. Almost everyone is naked, in one way or another. By
Brooke Comer. From The Hollywood Reporter. 1,800 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
SANDRA BULLOCK PRACTICES 'MAGIC' WITH HER LATEST FILM In
``Practical Magic,'' an engaging romantic comedy with a
supernatural edge, Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman play sisters
who happen to be witches. The magical realism of the story appealed
to Bullock, she says, since her own life is full of things she
can't rationally explain. ``There really is a higher connection. I
believe in karma, I believe in destiny,'' she says. By Joshua
Mooney. BPI. 1,200 words + photo.
________________________________________________________ 8. THE
FAR-RANGING WORLD OF QUEEN LATIFAH Queen Latifah has reinvented
herself numerous times - even her name is her own inspiration - but
now she is in overdrive. The rap star has a hot new album, ``Order
in the Court,'' a new film, ``Living Out Loud,'' and even a book in
the works. In this interview she talks about the film, why she's
devoting her next album to jazz songs, how she dealt with the 1996
near-fatal shooting of a close friend and what she thinks of her
image as a legendary tough cookie. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words +
photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 9.
SAINT STEVEN : A CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE SPIELBERG KIND Steven
Spielberg, master of sharks and dinosaurs, has celebrated a new
triumpth with his latest film. ``Saving Private Ryan'' not only
symbolizes Americans' struggle with their recent history -- and is
the first of several new World War II films now in the making -- it
also reflects the director's own struggle with the shadows of his
personal past. From Der Spiegel. 2,000 words. (English translation

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR OCT. 14 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times and Los Angeles Times lead with details of
Slobodan Milosevic's agreement with NATO concerning Yugoslavia's
Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post goes with Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde's
comment Tuesday _ apparently driven by his desire to finish by the
end of the year _ that he might narrow the impeachment inquiry by
consolidating or dropping some of the 15 potential charges
described last week by his committee's chief investigator.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today leads with a new poll it conducted together with CNN
and Gallup that apparently indicates House incumbents now stand a
better chance of re-election than at any previous time during the
1990s. The paper calls that a ``good sign for Republicans.'' (The
paper waits until the 10th and last paragraph of the story to
reveal that the poll sample was but 1,004 adults.) But a front-page
NYT story says Republican incumbent members of Congress seem to
have instead taken to heart other recent polls suggesting an
emerging anti-Republican backlash inspired by the House's
initiation of an impeachment investigation _ no Republican House
candidate, says the Times, is currently running a commercial
mentioning the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT says the crux of the Kosovo accord is a force of 2,000
on-the-ground international observers and NATO reconnaissance
flights designed to monitor Milosevic's withdrawals of police and
troops. The other key element, reported high by the NYT and the
main thrust of the LAT lead, is Milosevic's commitment Tuesday to
local elections for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   If the detail about the inspectors seems familiar, that's
because Tuesday's USAT and LAT said they'd been agreed to, whereas
Tuesday's NYT said merely that Milosevic appeared ready to accept a
monitoring force.
</P>
<P>
   Both Times suggest that free elections would result in Kosovo's
outright independence. And both papers note that the principal
Albanian separatist group wants nothing less. The NYT quantifies
the situation, noting that in Kosovo, ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs 9 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Both papers observe important loose ends of the emerging deal
that could unravel it. The NYT reports that the American negotiator
Richard Holbrooke did not persuade Milosevic to allow the
international war crimes tribunal to have jurisdiction in the
region, and the LAT passes along the concerns of some analysts that
the Serbs might take some observers hostage, thus boxing out NATO's
ability to deter Milosevic via the threat of air strikes. The LAT
quotes a NSC spokesman's response: The Serbs wouldn't want to
interfere with the observer force because some of is members would
be from their patron-state, Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT illustrates its Kosovo story with a top front picture of
a dead five-week-old baby. Just five or ten years ago, it was
possible for Americans to advance to a pretty ripe age before ever
seeing a dead body. But not anymore _ not if they get a newspaper.
Readers are invited to notice how often nowadays the main
front-page picture of their paper depicts death.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT and USAT front stories about the arrest for spying of a
former Army sergeant who served as a codebreaker, allegedly for
selling (for $60,000) the identity of Soviet sites to be nuked by
the U.S. if the Soviet Union started a nuclear war. The accused spy
had been living in Germany after retiring from the Army in 1991,
but was tricked back to the United States by someone working with
the FBI _ said by USAT to be a retired FBI agent _ posing as a
Russian spymaster.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT notes that this is the latest in a long string of
espionage arrests of mid- and low-level military intelligence
personnel, and the paper suggests these have been facilitated by
U.S. access to Russian intelligence files.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Wyoming anti-gay murder, and President
Clinton's resultant call for beefed-up hate-crime laws, the ink is
flowing about their advisability. George Will, in the LAT, Michael
Kelly in the WP, a NYT op-ed by a law professor and the Post's lead
editorial all question whether such laws further the cause of
tolerance and suggest that they represent a threat to the sanctity
of protected, even if contemptible, personal thought and speech.
The NYT's Frank Rich carries the ball somewhat for the other side,
arguing in his op-ed that Republicans paved the ``road to Laramie''
by demonizing gay people.
</P>
<P>
   Due to technical problems, Tuesday's column erred in saying that
Tuesday's NYT led with Kosovo. It led with the Japanese passage of
a banking rescue and reform bill.
</P>
<P>
   The WSJ ``Tax Report'' states that according to a recent Harvard
study, Connecticut ranked No. 1 in the list of deficit states whose
taxpayers send more money to Washington as taxes than they get back
as spending. Second place was New Jersey, followed by Illinois, New
Hampshire, Nevada and Michigan. New Mexico topped the list of
surplus states, followed by North Dakota, Virginia, West Virginia
and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Today's No-Duh! Headline, from the WP front page: ``Impact of
Market Turmoil Felt Beyond Wall Street.''

WHAT CHURCHILL KNEW 
</HEADLINE>
  By JUDITH SHULEVITZ and KATE GALBRAITH 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conquering troops swagger into towns, round up members of an
undesirable ethnic population, and systematically slaughter them.
The world knows all about it but dithers anyway. Not for years
after they first learn of the pattern of atrocities do they do
anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? We're not talking Kosovo or Bosnia here. We're
talking about the war which taught the Serbs just how much horror
an occupier can get away with.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many unpleasant duties of Holocaust historians
involves rounding out the portrait of Allied indifference to the
genocide of the Jews during World War II. Richard Breitman, a
historian at American University, has just added some new details
to that picture.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Official Secrets: What The Nazis Planned, What
the British and Americans Knew'' (Hill and Wang), he argues that
the British were made fully aware of the Nazi plan to wipe out the
Jews as early as January 1942 _ half a year earlier than previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Breitman's argument, based on recently declassified British
intelligence documents, goes as follows:
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1939, British decoders unscrambled radio signals
from German special police units. Messages intercepted from the
Eastern Front in September 1941 showed that these units were
following behind the army and rounding up vast numbers of Jews in
the Soviet Union. The decoders knew something about Nazi
terminology by then, so they understood that ``special duties'' or
``pacification'' meant something much worse than relocation.
</P>
<P>
   They'd also heard enough to know that it was a campaign planned
before the invasion of the Soviet Union, not some random byproduct
of war. This intelligence rose all the way up to British Foreign
Minister Anthony Eden, who quashed it, and Winston Churchill, who
enfolded it in grandiose speeches about mass execution that didn't
quite explain what was occurring.
</P>
<P>
   What difference would this information have made? The difference
the confirmation of rumor always makes. Had the world known for
certain that the incredible stories coming from the Soviet Union
were true, more Jews could have been warned. Neutral and satellite
states could have been pressured to accept more refugees, years
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the war, the British intelligence reports could have
helped pin the blame on the right people. During the Nuremberg
trials, for instance, prosecutors misclassified the special police
units largely responsible for the slaughter on the Eastern Front as
run-of-the-mill policemen, rather than as the mass murderers they
were.
</P>
<P>
   The future mass murderers of the world surely drew the obvious
moral lesson.

THE LAND OF THE FEE 
</HEADLINE>
  By WALTER SHAPIRO 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a series of late-night dinners with candidates and
campaign operatives _ both Democrats and Republicans _ we have
picked up assorted off-the-record anecdotes about the most taboo
topic in politics.
</P>
<P>
   This dirty secret is not about how candidates raise money, but
how they are forced to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Say you are Morrow E. Pure, running for an open House seat in a
swing district. By begging and pleading for six hours a day on the
telephone for months, you have managed to raise $500,000, the
rock-bottom estimate to conduct a credible congressional race. But
almost half of that money will be funneled right into the pockets
of consultants before you get to air your first 30-second bio spot.
</P>
<P>
   (Here's the script: ``Entrepreneur and father of six, Morrow E.
Pure shares your values--family values--and in Washington will be
on your side fighting for seniors, fighting for families and
fighting for a better future for our kids.'')
</P>
<P>
   Let's follow the money as it disappears:
</P>
<P>
   Right after you win the primary in your district, you fly to
Washington to get sophisticated political advice from your party's
congressional campaign committee. They tell you to immediately
spend $15,000 on a baseline poll in your district.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent and I are both unknowns,'' you protest.
``Shouldn't we wait to poll until the race heats up in
mid-October?'' The political pros, rolling their eyes at your
naivete, explain that the sole purpose of this poll is to impress
the Washington PAC community.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, your $15,000 survey shows that Morrow E. Pure has low name
ID. Unimpressed, the PAC community tells you, ``Take a walk, kid.''
Disappearing money: $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The wise heads at the national campaign committee, worried about
your ability to raise money, direct you to one of the party's
leading fund-raising consultants. With dollar signs dancing in your
brain, you sign a contract promising the consultants 15 percent of
what they raise _ along with $10,000 to purchase lists and, say, a
$6,000 a month retainer.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, during your first conference call with the
fund-raising consultants, they explain that they have run into an
unexpected snag: The word is out in Washington that you can't win
because your own poll shows that you have low name ID.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the firm helps you raise $200,000. Sounds like a
good deal, nonetheless. Not when you subtract the costs: $30,000
for commissions; $20,000 total for lists; $24,000 for the monthly
retainer; $10,000 for a second, inconclusive, poll; and $16,000 for
miscellaneous costs like repeated trips to Washington to get the
brush off from PACs. Disappearing money: $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   But like your pioneer ancestors who settled this district, you
are not deterred by adversity. You take control of your own
financial destiny by importuning everyone you have met in your
life. On your own, you manage to raise another $300,000, all
earmarked for a TV blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. There are $20,000 in production costs for the
TV spots; $12,000 for the media consultant's monthly retainer; and,
$8,000 for a third poll to identify campaign themes (Answer:
Combating low name ID). So another, far more justifiable, $40,000
is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, $260,000 can buy a lot of TV time to show that Morrow E.
Pure is fighting for the future. Except, it's not exactly $260,000.
There is that little item called the ``ad placement fee,'' which
amounts to 15 percent of all TV billings, paid to the media
consultant. (Presidential campaigns often negotiate this ad fee
down to as low as 7 percent.) So wave farewell to another $39,000.
</P>
<P>
   By our reckoning (and we freely admits that many of these
calculations are rough guesses), Morrow E. Pure has been bludgeoned
into paying nearly $200,000 in vigorish to the political rackets.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that most campaign consultants see nothing wrong
with a system that everyone else deplores. As long as the political
handlers are raking off their ample share, who cares if nobody
votes?

GIVING THE INVISIBLE HAND A HAND 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wading through the reams of commentary on the ``global economic
crisis,'' what you're struck by again and again is just how
confused everyone is.
</P>
<P>
   This is a dramatic change in a very short period of time. When
people said that U.S.-style capitalism had triumphed, after all,
what they meant was not merely that U.S.-style capitalism was
spreading across the globe. They also meant that it had triumphed
intellectually, that the truths which underpinned it were
unimpeachable.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's possible to explain almost everything that's happened
in the global economy over the last year as evidence not of the
failure of markets but rather of what happens when markets aren't
able to operate freely. It's possible, but not convincing. The
hedge fund Long Term Capital Management was as unregulated an
entity as could be imagined, and its failure nearly sent the entire
global marketplace into a tailspin. And if Brazil ends up
collapsing in the next few months, it will be because global
investors decided that they couldn't make money there. That's a
collective decision which could precipitate a global slowdown, and
if it happens it will be because the market's responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that, of course, doesn't mean that there are any easy
solutions to what's going on. One can recognize that markets fail
and still not be sure how to keep them from failing and still
believe that there's no real alternative which can deliver the kind
of economic growth enjoyed by Asia and Latin America in the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion that prevails among policymakers today is
precisely a confusion about this subject. Investors aren't acting
the way they're supposed to _ coolly measuring return against risk
_ and policymakers don't know how to make them act appropriately.
(The mere fact that the question of how to restore rationality to
markets is being raised is, of course, a challenge to conventional
neoclassical economic theory, since investors are always supposed
to act rationally.)
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, long-accepted truths about the benefits of
free capital flow and the value of speculation are being seriously
questioned. For the first time since the 1970s, a genuine debate
exists.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of this was the op-ed piece on Long Term Capital in
Monday's Wall Street Journal. The piece was co-authored by Daniel
Fishel, an astute advocate of efficient-market theory, opponent of
all government intervention in the marketplace and a vocal defender
of Michael Milken. Fishel sees the Long Term bailout as an example
of markets taking care of one of their own. The hedge fund's
lenders stepped in to take over the firm, Long Term's investors
bore all the risk, and the Federal Reserve merely played a role in
making the process run more smoothly. Any call for regulation of
hedge funds, Fishel argues, is therefore misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   No surprises there. What's interesting, though, is that Fishel
recognizes that Long Term's creditors may very well have bailed out
the hedge fund because they realized ``the possible broader harms
that might result from (its) hedge fund.'' In other words, instead
of just looking only to their individual interests, Goldman Sachs,
et. al. thought about the ``systemic risk'' of Long Term's failure
and acted accordingly. Fishel hails this as ``all the better and
all the more remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   But what's really remarkable is that Fishel believes it's
necessary or rational for investors to think about the collective
interest in making their individual economic decisions. The whole
point of the invisible hand, after all, is that it's supposed to
turn private vice into public virtue. If everyone just looks after
themselves, things will turn out OK. Here, though, Fishel is saying
that what's ``remarkable'' about the bailout is that Wall Street
looked out for everyone else, and so everything turned out OK.
</P>
<P>
   But if we need someone to look out for everyone else, it should
surely be the government, which we have some measure of control
over, and not a group of investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   It may be, in the end, that we decide that the invisible hand
really is the best way to get out of this. But if we don't decide
that, then we need real regulation, and not an ad hoc reliance on
the momentary benevolence of the powerhouses on Wall Street.

WHOSE GOD IS IT, ANYWAY? 
</HEADLINE>
  By CULLEN MURPHY 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1956 swords-and-sandals epic ``The Ten Commandments'' has
long since turned into a pillar of kitsch, but certain moments in
the movie remain improbably vivid. One is the sneering query put by
the slave master Edward G. Robinson to the humbled Israelite leader
Charlton Heston: ``Where is your God now, Moses?''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the use of a personal pronoun before ``God'' signaled
a clash of civilizations: The outlook of the whole Nilotic world
was being contrasted with that of the whole Chosen People.
Similarly, the our in Martin Luther's stirring anthem ``A Mighty
Fortress Is Our God'' takes for granted the cultural cohesiveness
of the God concept.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the personal pronouns my, his, her, their, and our are
being deployed before ``God'' as never before: Such locutions have
become a pervasive social trope. But it's hard to pin down just
what they now signify. A new polytheism? A divinely sanctioned
solipsism?
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent recent example comes from Bill Clinton's Aug.
17 speech to the nation: ``Now this matter is between me and the
two people I love most _ my wife and our daughter _ and our God.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, of course, broke no new rhetorical ground here. I have
seen references to issues that lie ``between me, my scale, and our
God'' (an article about dieting); ``me, my stylist, and our God''
(an article about hair care); and ``me and the officer with the
radar trap and our God'' (an article about highway speeding). The
attorney Alan Dershowitz has stated that a lawyer should not have a
position about a client's guilt: ``His guilt is a matter for him
and his God.''
</P>
<P>
   The legend on American coins proclaims, ``In God We Trust.'' The
president taking the oath of office has historically spoken the
words ``so help me God.'' But if the evidence of common speech is
any guide, the idea of God has been rapidly devolving from the
generalized to the particular, from the awesomely abstract to the
intensely (even idiosyncratically) personal.
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a tension between these two concepts of
God. I brought the matter up with Jack Miles, whose book, ``God: A
Biography,'' won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction. Miles sets
the situation into historical context: ``What made the fortune, so
to speak, of the God of Israel,'' he observes, ``was that he
combined two functions previously separate: on the one hand, the
function of the Mesopotamian personal God, a kind of guardian angel
whose responsibilities were concentrated on one man or woman but
whose powers were also limited; on the other, the function of the
Canaanite/Mesopotamian high God, El, whose attention to any
individual man or woman was slight or unpredictable but whose
powers were universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this historic synthesis, you got either one or the
other. After it, you had the electrifying possibility that the top
God was also our God and even my personal God. After it, of course,
you also had the whole range of unanswerable questions of the sort
'How could a good God _ and El was an essentially benign, judgelike
figure _ permit X to happen to us, or to me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Is the ``top God''-''my God'' synthesis coming undone? Even as a
great deal of the ``top God'' discussion drifts into remote realms
of cosmology, much of the ``my God'' discussion becomes ever more
individualized.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical Protestantism has especially cherished the notion of
a personal God, and this continues to be reflected in the heartfelt
speech of ordinary people and even of nonbelievers. (Recall the
reaction of Lt. Scheisskopf's wife, in ``Catch 22,'' to Yossarian's
famous tirade against God. Yossarian asks why she is so upset,
since she doesn't believe in God to begin with. She replies, ``But
the God I don't believe in is a good God, a just God, a merciful
God.'')
</P>
<P>
   The personal God of the sincerely born-again Christian bears
little resemblance to a different sort of personalized God, the
customized kind that one acquires as one might a personal trainer,
though the workouts often are not as strenuous. This latter sort of
personalized God may amount at best to a synonym for ``conscience''
or ``serenity.''
</P>
<P>
   The dark analogs of the personalized God are one's personal
demons--which represent the individually customized version of what
used to go by the nontechnical terms Bad Behavior or Guilt or
simply Evil.
</P>
<P>
   Another form the personal God may take involves a fragmentation
of the concept of divinity itself. Thus, writing in The New Yorker
in December 1996, Louis Menand posited the breakdown of traditional
monotheism into ``genetic polytheism,'' in which personal behavior
is attributable to an individualized genetic pantheon. Where once
there was a God of Anger, now there is a gene of aggression. Where
once there was a God of Wine, now there is a gene of alcoholism. In
ancient Greece, Phobos was the God of Fear. Today he is gene
SLC6A4, whose specific Olympian dwelling place is chromosome 17q12.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the God module, which is not so much
polytheistic as polymorphous. According to researchers at the
University of California at San Diego, there is a region of the
temporal lobe the stimulation of which, sometimes manifested in the
form of seizures, can now be correlated with certain intangible
mental experiences. One of the California researchers, Vilayanur S.
Ramachandran, making public his team's findings late last year at
the annual meeting of the Society of Neuroscience, stated, ``We
like to suggest there may be neural circuits in the temporal lobe
that may be part of the machinery of the brain that is involved in
mystical experiences and God.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have christened these neural circuits the ``God
module.'' ``Now this is a matter between me, the two people I love
most ... and our god modules.'' We have not heard these words yet,
the Lord be praised.

 &HT;    Guys think this Nobel's a real gas
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The University of Texas blew a golden
opportunity for a load of big-time free publicity Monday night when
it didn't light the Tower Viagra blue.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Dr. Ferid Murad, a professor and department chairman
at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, was
one of three scientists awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize in physiology
or medicine for their work with nitric oxide.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years ago, Murad discovered the common air pollutant
gas is produced by cells, and is needed to relax muscles and blood
vessels in the human body.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the blue Viagra pills, an extremely popular new
male impotency drug, work by boosting the gas's effects in the
blood vessels of, shall we say, Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   When Murad discovered the muscle relaxation function of nitric
oxide, he wasn't doing research along those lines. He was studying
the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   So though you couldn't make the claim that Murad was
instrumental in inventing the male engine, so to speak, you could
say he was at least inadvertently responsible for getting it
running again after 300,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't UT seize on this opportunity for even more national
recognition by hanging a Viagra banner from the Tower?
</P>
<P>
   The thing I like about this is that here is a case where the
Nobel Prize has been given for something the average guy can
understand. This is not always the case with Nobel Prizes. Often
the prize is given for rather obscure egghead scientific stuff.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1996, two Rice University chemistry professors
won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of fullerenes, or
``buckyballs,'' a molecular form of carbon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most guys don't know what ``molecular form of
carbon'' really means. So when they hear the term ``buckyballs,''
they probably figure it's some kind of disgusting toy you can find
on the shelf at Toys 'R Us, right next to the plastic barf.
</P>
<P>
   Or they think it's a medical condition that may or may not be
covered by your health care provider. ``Buckyballs'' aren't the
only items that have ever won a Nobel Prize that might make the
general public wonder, ``What the heck is that supposed to mean?''
For example, in 1977 Ilya Prigogine of UT-Austin won the Nobel
Prize in chemistry for his contributions to the concept of
non-equilibrium thermodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the average American guy what non-equilibrium means and
he'll tell you it's what happens to you if you suck down the entire
six-pack during the first half.
</P>
<P>
   So it's nice the Nobel Prize is being given this year for
something most guys can comprehend. But there are some other major
finds that have yet to be honored by the Nobel committee that
should be.
</P>
<P>
   How come the Nobel Prize has never been given to the person who
discovered the plastic worm? And how about the trolling motor?
</P>
<P>
   And how come the pop-top creator has never bagged the Nobel?
Remember how difficult life was when guys used to have to go around
asking each other, ``Do you have a can opener?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if guys hadn't spent so much time looking for can
openers, guys might not need to take so much Viagra these days.
</P>
<P>
   But that's another matter for Nobel scientists to look into at a
later date.

 &HT;    A fine book about Texas singers, writers
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ A happy coincidence occurred this week,
when I bought Lyle Lovett's latest CD, ``Step Inside This House,''
and the book fairy brought a review copy of Jay Milner's
``Confessions of a Maddog'' in the mail, both in the same week. I
</P>
<P>
   guess the stars were in the proper alignment, the moon was in
the seventh house and all that. This fine collection of songs, and
Jay's memoirs of hanging around the state's best singers and
writers during the past four decades, fit together like red beans
and rice.
</P>
<P>
   Let's back up. First, Jay's book (University of North Texas
Press, 248 pp.) was long-awaited for those of us who know and
admire him. He's written a book-review column for this newspaper
for going on two decades. His column can be found today in its
usual spot on our book page.
</P>
<P>
   Jay has lived what can only be described as a varied life. He
played on a championship high school football team in West Texas,
got into journalism and eventually ended up as managing editor of
Hodding Carter's Greenville, Miss. Delta-Democrat Times before
heading to the Big Apple to work for the late, lamented New York
Herald-Tribune. He published a novel in the 1960s,
</P>
<P>
   didn't make any money, wrote for Sports Illustrated for a while,
and eventually came back to Texas, where he taught journalism at
SMU and TCU, ran a music magazine, worked for PBS, and hung out
with a fellow group of Maddogs (his term) that included Larry L.
King (the non-CNN Larry who wrote ``Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas); Willie Nelson; Billie Lee Brammer, author of the best book
ever written about Texas politics, ``The Gay Place,''; Jerry
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Walker; Billy Joe Shaver; Bud Shrake, known lately as
collaborator on golf god Harvey Penick's ``Little Red Book'' and
its sequels; and a long line of literary and musical luminaries
from the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Jay is 74 years old now, and though I haven't seen him in a few
years, unless something has changed he still looks a
decade-and-a-half younger. He's a quiet giant of a man, an
observer, a fine writer, and a gentle soul.
</P>
<P>
   Jay never got rich writing, never got anywhere close, unless
he's holding out on me. I don't think he is. His philosophy of book
reviewing is simple: Review only the books you like. If you read
something you don't like, don't waste your time putting it down.
He's broken his rule a few times, but only rarely. He's one of the
best bargains in this paper at $25 a week for a review by someone
who loves books even more than I do.
</P>
<P>
   I read Jay's book in one sitting, as the first cold front of the
season came in last week, thunder rattling the windows and the
coffee turning cold.
</P>
<P>
   On the stereo, Lyle Lovett sang the songs written by many of the
people Jay was writing about: Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt and Steve
Fromholz, to name a few. He sang songs like ``If I Needed You,'' by
Van Zandt, who died last year of a heart attack after a long hard
life. It's a song I would take to the desert island with me, to
sing alone if necessary:
</P>
<P>
   If I needed you
</P>
<P>
   Would you come to me
</P>
<P>
   Would you come to me
</P>
<P>
   And ease my pain
</P>
<P>
   If you needed me
</P>
<P>
   I would come to you
</P>
<P>
   I'd swim the seas
</P>
<P>
   For to ease your pain.
</P>
<P>
   I've spent many hours in smoky bars listening to Fromholz,
Willis Alan Ramsey, Jerry Jeff, and Willie (when I could get a
ticket). I still do, whenever these pickers come around, those who
are left. I'll still buy a ticket and endure the drunken college
kids to hear Lyle, or his A&AMP;M roommate, Robert Earl Keen. Or
Lucinda Williams, Chris Wall, or any number of fine Texas singers
and writers.
</P>
<P>
   Music and fine writing still define my life, still keep the
dragons at bay. And that's why Lyle's versions of these songs of my
collegiate youth struck a chord with me, especially as he sang
Walter Hyatt's classic, ``I'll Come Knocking.''
</P>
<P>
   When you want me
</P>
<P>
   I'll come knockin'
</P>
<P>
   At your door
</P>
<P>
   At your door
</P>
<P>
   One of these days now
</P>
<P>
   You'll be rockin'
</P>
<P>
   You'll be rockin'
</P>
<P>
   In my arms once more.
</P>
<P>
   Man. That's great.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the book. Jay spends the last few chapters talking about
his friendship with Joe Murray, who has the World's Greatest Job as
a columnist for Cox Newspapers, the company that signs my paycheck.
Joe goes where he wants and writes about what he wants, because
he's great at what he does. Joe at times makes me want to give up,
to fly up the white flag and surrender this column-writing gig.
He's the best, in my book.
</P>
<P>
   Jay's closing chapter about how he repaired to Lufkin to lick
his wounds, take care of his mama, and eventually learned how to
become friends and bull-shooters with Joe and his merry band of
good ol' boys, is one of the finest parts of this book.
</P>
<P>
   Buy the book. Buy Lyle's CD to go with it. Brew up a strong pot
of coffee and kick back. Pour a little bourbon in the cup if that's
your inclination.
</P>
<P>
   Then thank God you live in Texas, and go ahead and sing along
with some fine songs.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't get much better than this. Heck, it doesn't need to.

 &HT;    ``The Ordways'' still one of my favorite books
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speaking of ``The Ordways'' by the late William Humphrey, which
we were doing in this space last Sunday, I just finished reading it
again and I was right. It is one of the best novels I've ever read.
</P>
<P>
   It's not Faulkner, as some would say, including Mr. Humprey
himself before he died last year, but it's in the same ballpark
with the sly old grouch from Oxford, Mississippi, which would be
more than enough to please most writers, unless they were so
competitive they saw it all as a contest like boxing, as Hemingway
and Norman Mailer seemed to do at times.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey saw himself as a destroyer of myths, despite being a
Texan and a Southerner, according to a new book called ``William
Humphrey: Destroyer of Myths'' by Bert Almon (U. of North Texas
Press). He resented being categorized by state or region, in point
of fact, as he repeatedly stated and implied in letters and
journals and essays quoted by Almon in his fascinating book, which
can be enjoyed by anyone who is interested in reading whether or
not they are Humphrey fans.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey apparently resented being referred to as either Texan
or Southerner, despite his admiration for William Faulkner, an
admiration alternately spiced with declarations of disdain. But
``The Ordways'' is filled with stories that are as Texan and
Southern as anything written or passed along verbally by J. Frank
Dobie.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult, if not impossible, to tell stories, fact or
fiction, set
</P>
<P>
   realistically in Texas, or the South for that matter, without
including episodes or stories that seem to have sprung from or are
rooted in myth. Humphrey, his repeated dissent notwithstanding,
tells story after story of mythic proportions in ``The Ordways.''
Those stories and episodes are, in fact, what make the book so
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The opening episodes are set in an East Texas cemetery where
families have gathered for the annual grave cleaning ritual,
renewing old acquaintances and family ties. And as the graves are
cleaned, the old timers there pass along family tales. Myths, if
you please, or tales that will become mythic in the retelling over
the decades.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these stories are humorous, and some are tragic. One of
my favorites tells of the high falluting family with a colored
butler who went around the dinner table collecting the cobs of the
roasting ears the guests had eaten. He collected the cobs on a
silver tray. ``Our Uncle Hugh happened to be seated next to the
hostess and by the time the white gloved butler got to him the
silver platter was piled high... noticing him at last Uncle Hugh
</P>
<P>
   inspected his soggy offering and in his back country accent,
said, ``No thank you, just the same, don't believe I'll have
any.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the one about Great-Granduncle Giles who was
extremely absent-minded. (I think I've heard this one in my family
somewhere in the distant past .) Great-granduncle Giles once bought
himself a horse and buggy, the first he had ever owned, to go on a
trip to a town that was a three-day ride away. His business
concluded there, he took the train home. About a week later, he
remembered his horse and buggy and bought a round
</P>
<P>
   trip ticket to go get it.
</P>
<P>
   Another uncle had heard that one man's lifetime wasn't long
enough for him to count to one million. He set out to prove this
wrong and commenced counting. Weeks and months later people would
ask him how it was coming along and he would say, ``Three hundred
and eighty-six thousand, four hundred and twelve..now thirteen,''
or whatever it happened to be at the time. He eventually got
secretive about his totals and just how far he finally got no one
ever knew. ``For though he was vouchsafed twelve years more than
his allotted three score and ten, and did hardly anything else
towards the last, his dying words were, 'Tell them that fellow was
right. It can't be done. I only got up to...' And there he stopped
counting.''
</P>
<P>
   As previously stated, not all the Ordway stories were amusing.
``There was Inez Ordway, my grandfather's second cousin. One of her
babies was eaten alive by a sow. Poor Inez never got over it and
wound up with her mind cracked.''

 &HT;    Still crazy after all these years
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The last time I had seen Amy Ballinger,
she was on stage and waving a cucumber.
</P>
<P>
   That was about 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I paid her a visit on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Amy's 89 years old now and living in a retirement complex in
Lantana.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 92 single women here and six widowers,'' she said.
``There was seven but one of them died last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough odds for Amy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of the widowers are already taken,'' she said. ``But
I've got to start working on a guy who just lost his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   She cackled at her own words. Amy Ballinger, still crazy after
all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Ballinger may just be the oldest living stand-up comedienne,
although for now, she needs a cane to stand up.
</P>
<P>
   Her neighbors at the stately Lakeside Village probably have no
idea just how bawdy the cherubic-faced Ballinger can be.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike me, they hadn't been treated to her nightclub comedy act,
a raunchy set of one-liners delivered in a droll, raspy voice.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Henny Youngman on Viagra. ``No,'' she said. ``I could
never do my act here. They have prayer groups here, and Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a condo once, and they asked for their money back.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Ballinger hasn't been performing at all. She needed
knee surgery in March and hip surgery in August.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be enough to get most people down. But not Amy. She has
spent too many years laughing at herself and others. Within no time
at all, she's telling me Clinton jokes I hadn't heard yet, and
rehearsing some of her old one-liners on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so old, I remember when only clothes came out of the
closet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my age, my back goes out more than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so dumb, I thought Alexander's Ragtime Band was a sanitary
belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy, please! We're in the lobby of a retirement home.
</P>
<P>
   I hear a young woman employee behind a reception desk trying to
laugh quietly. I had come to visit Amy to see her collection of
return address labels. She's got more than a thousand of them.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Amy thinks it's funny.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote me a letter recently and put 34 return address labels
on it, all of them with different designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give a little bit of money to charities and they send me
back address labels,'' she said. ``What am I going to do with all
these address labels? I write about two letters a week, and I'm 89.
</P>
<P>
   ``And besides, I e-mail now.''
</P>
<P>
   We page through her label collection. Heart, lungs, kidneys,
diabetes, Alzheimer's, leukemia, March of Dimes, a couple of
cancers, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans, Mothers
Against Drunk Driving, National Wildlife Federation . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at how nice some of these are,'' she said. ``I wish they
wouldn't waste money by sending me any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy said she tried to send some back, but they still keep
coming.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing Amy, I spoke to Vince Arch, the executive director
of the American Diabetes Association of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a trend with charities,'' he said. ``Statistics show that
if you give somebody something, it has a positive effect in them
continuing to support you.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you give money to a charity, you're likely to get address
labels for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   We figure out some use for Amy's labels.
</P>
<P>
   In between Amy telling me one-liners, we go to the retirement
home library, and she turns her label collection into a cloak and
crown.
</P>
<P>
   The queen of stand-up comedy is sitting down and laughing in her
address dress.
</P>
<P>
   Life is still a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``In August, I'm going to be 90,'' she said. ``And I'm having a
big party. It'll be a show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety,'' she said to herself in amazement. ``That's a hell of
an age to still be on stage.''

Ann Taylor is a name chosen for its marketing value alone. An

 &HT;    Frampton still comes alive in concert
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If there were a test to determine
whether you're a rock has-been, Peter Frampton would pass with
flying colors.
</P>
<P>
   Appeared on an album of children's songs? Check.

</P>
<P>
   Things have changed so much for the 48-year-old rock legend,
whose classic Frampton Comes Alive remains the best-selling live
album of all time, that when he plays Friday at the Coral Sky
Amphitheatre, he'll be opening for Lynyrd Skynyrd, a band that lost
much of its original membership in a 1977 plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton survived the Disco Decade, but not without watching his
glory days pass by. But say this for the once shaggy-haired
guitarist: He's got a sense of humor about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Rubik's Cube thing,'' he says with a laugh, likening
his career trajectory to that of another once mighty '70s
pop-culture icon. ``You're just a flavor-of-the-month.''
</P>
<P>
   Frampton's ``flavor'' was a tuneful, guitar-thick rock that
managed to catch the public's attention before the disco beat took
over. It was also a music meant to be heard live. Back then, it was
one man, one guitar _ and a million screaming fans.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, 17 million fans, if you count all the people who
purchased Frampton Comes Alive. The album continues to sell a
respectable 100,000 copies yearly _ and that figure should increase
with the recent release of a digitally remastered version.
</P>
<P>
   As Frampton tells it, he always knew the album, which yielded
such hits as Show Me the Way, Baby I Love Your Way and Do You Feel
Like We Do?, would sell well. Just not that well. He recalls that
after its release, he took ``a breather'' before hitting the road
to promote it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went away for eight days or something and came back,'' he
says by phone from Evansville, Ind., where the Lynyrd Skynyrd tour
was set to open. ``And suddenly, we didn't just have one date in
Detroit, we had like five sold-out shows. And this was my first
tour as a headliner.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Frampton wasn't a complete rock neophyte. The
British-born musician's career had started in the '60s, when he
joined an English band called the Herd that enjoyed a bit of
teeny-bop fame. Then came a stint with the blues-rock outfit Humble
Pie.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Frampton released four solo albums, setting the
stage for the mass hysteria that would greet Frampton Comes Alive.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton handled the success _ until it started to handle him.
``A lot of money came in quickly, it seemed like it was never going
to stop,'' he says, speaking like the subject of a weepy VH-1
Behind the Music documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The result of Frampton's runaway success? In a word, greed.
``Not my greed,'' he insists, but rather his record company's.
Frampton was cajoled into making another album right away, I'm in
You, which featured the guitarist in a bare-chested pose that
accentuated his sexy, rising star status. Even though it sold more
than three million copies, it was considered a disappointment after
Frampton Comes Alive.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Frampton became the first of rock's boom-or-bust
stars, paving the way for the likes of Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish, who
suffered a similar downward fate after their gazillion-selling
debut, Cracked Rear View.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Alanis Morissette, whose second album (due in
November) will no doubt be measured heavily against her first, the
alt-rock sensation Jagged Little Pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor girl,'' says Frampton with genuine concern. ``I so
empathize with her.''
</P>
<P>
   After I'm in You, Frampton essentially lost his way. First,
there was his disastrous 1978 film debut in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band with the Bee Gees and George Burns. Then came a
series of ill-received albums in the '80s. And finally, just when
Frampton had hopes for jump-starting his career by teaming up with
Humble Pie cofounder Steve Marriott, the musician died in a house
fire in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton takes a, well, meteorological view of his career.
``It's like one of those outdoor thermometers where you've got a
line that pushes it up and down and (says), `This was the high mark
and this was the low mark.'''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a positive side to winding up at the bottom: ''I've
got nothing to lose,'' Frampton says.
</P>
<P>
   And so the rock legend is reinventing himself. Part of the plan
involves a move to Nashville, where Frampton lives with his third
wife and the couple's two kids.
</P>
<P>
   No, Frampton hasn't gone country. But like a lot of one-time
rock stars, he appreciates the fact that the city has ``studios up
the wazoo'' and a wealth of veteran musicians to draw upon for
recordings. ``You can get a classically trained violinist or a
blues guy. Whatever you want, you've got it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Although he still sings his classic rockers in concert, he
recently hooked up with Disney for a Winnie the Pooh album. Next up
is a recording of lullabies. ``This is what I really want to do,''
he insists, adding that he wasn't cool with his children until he
appeared on The Simpsons as _ what else? _ a rock has-been at a
concert called Homerpalooza.
</P>
<P>
   As far as maintaining his chops, Frampton is doing quite well,
thank you. Critics have taken note of his recent performances with
Ringo Starr's band and on VH1's Hard Rock Live show. And when he
was on tour this summer, The Dallas Morning News had this to say:
``The singer-guitarist and his three-man band did a good job of
mixing the golden oldies with a few new tunes _ one groovin'
guitar-rocker was better than most of the new Dave Matthews band
disc.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only change in Frampton's life that isn't part of the
plan is his thinning hair. He'd like his long locks back but
accepts the situation like the good-humored rock dinosaur he is.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens when one of his kids finds an old picture of
him in all his big-haired glory?
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it like this: `Daddy used to be really good looking.'''

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There is no Ann Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Taylor is a name chosen for its marketing value alone. An
All-American name. ``Taylor'' for tailoring.
</P>
<P>
   It beats Mimi Lieberskin or Richard Lieberskin, the names of the
husband-and-wife team that created the company in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Now Patti DeRosa runs the company. Age 45, size 6. She started
in sales. Like other women in the office, DeRosa test-drives new
clothing ideas. Wears them, washes them.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies don't keep an eye on what walks the fashion
runways. Not this one. ``Our customer is very fashion-sensitive,''
DeRosa says. Call it ``updated classic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not going too far out, but she's fashion-appropriate,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   The target customer also is interested in fine wine, gardening
and travel. She likes to keep fit. Odds are, she has a career.
``But she's at the soccer field on the weekends,'' DeRosa says.
</P>
<P>
   The median age of the company's customer is 36.
</P>
<P>
   They try to keep her coming back by changing the color theme in
stores every month. In keeping with the big-name designers, gray is
the hot color for fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   Two items DeRosa says the company always has in stock: A little
black dress and a black suit.
</P>
<P>
   Someone is always shopping for those two.
</P>
<P>
   Company: Ann Taylor
</P>
<P>
   Design philosophy: ``Can a lot of different women be comfortable
in this product? Does it travel well? Can you wear it to dinner and
the office?''
</P>
<P>
   Price range: Cheapest offering, a $20 cotton T-shirt. Most
expensive, a $398 leather jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Sizes: 2 to 16, with a petites division.

 &HT;    7 bid for convention center hotel job
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Seven developers, including several Texas
companies, are vying for the job of building Austin's convention
center hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hodge, director of the Austin Convention Center Department,
said he was pleased with the list of companies, which includes H.L.
Hotels and The Brentwood Group of Austin; The Duddlesten Companies
of Houston; USAA Real Estate Co. of San Antonio; Portman Holdings
of Atlanta; White-Leasure Development Co. of Boise, Idaho, and HBE
Corp. of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The city plans to narrow down the list before requesting more
detailed proposals, Hodge said.
</P>
<P>
   With the city planning to double the size of its convention
center, officials want to make sure there will be enough hotel
rooms to accommodate the added conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   City officials contend they already are losing business because
there aren't blocks of rooms large enough to satisfy meeting
planners.
</P>
<P>
   In August, they began advertising for bids to build an 800-room
hotel and a 1,000-car parking garage near the convention center, at
Cesar Chavez and Red River streets. Sites being discussed for a
hotel include land to the east, west and south of the convention
center.
</P>
<P>
   When the list of developers has been narrowed, Hodge said the
city will be better able to determine the cost of the hotel project
and the need for any financial incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea what those might be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hodge said city officials hope the hotel will be open by the
time the convention center expansion is completed in 2001.

 &HT;    Austin CDC intensifies efforts to assist fledgling businesses
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When ANS Computers Inc. received a $50,000 loan
from Austin Community Development Corp. in February, the shot of
money came at a crucial time and helped the company nab some
important contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The loan came as the South Austin company, which installs
computer networks, was trying to win a $2 million contract with
Unisys Corp. The Austin-based company needed to hire more
experienced professionals to improve its credentials before it bid
for the major contracts _ and the grant money was key.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like the spark we needed,'' says Joe Salinas,
president and co-founder of the company. Last year, the company's
revenues were $750,000. This year, they're expected to hit $3.5
million _ a growth that Salinas says is attributable largely to the
shot-in-the arm from CDC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really because of Austin CDC we were able to make that
leap,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It is companies like ANS that the non-profit Austin CDC is
designed to help.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech entrepreneurs often can get loans from venture capital
companies willing to risk seed money for a stake in a potentially
fast-growing start-up. More established small businesses often can
get traditional loans from banks or even family members.
</P>
<P>
   But minority-owned small businesses and those in traditionally
economically depressed areas often have a tougher time getting
loans _ even though those areas need more employers who can create
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Margo Weisz, executive director of the CDC, says South and East
Austin _ two areas of the city that have a large number of minority
residents and have traditionally been economically disadvantaged _
have about 25 percent fewer businesses per capita than the city
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the CDC got an additional $500,000 from the federal
government as part of an increased emphasis on lending to minority-
and low-income businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the $500,000 in federal funding, the CDC got an
additional $500,000 from NationsBank, Chase Manhattan Bank,
Comerica Bank, Bank One, Wells Fargo Bank and Norwest Bank. The
banks contribute to the CDC and other groups as a way to meet
federal Community Reinvestment Act requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Weisz says the additional funding will let the group double the
amount it can lend to small companies in those areas and others.
The revolving loan fund, she says, will initially help two dozen
small Austin companies and create 300 jobs in economically
distressed areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neat thing about this $1 million is none of it is going to
cover the overhead of the Austin CDC,'' says Pat O'Beirne,
president of Austin CDC and manager of the small business lending
area at Bank One Texas. ``One hundred percent of that will go back
into the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1994 as a partnership between the City of Austin and
10 Austin banks, the CDC is designed to help stimulate business
activity in economically depressed areas of Austin by making loans
to minority- and women-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which receives about $75,000 a year in city support,
focuses on loans to help residents in 59 low-income census tracts
in Austin. The center makes loans from $20,000 to $100,000; its
average loan amount is $38,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ANS Computers, the Austin CDC's money was matched
by a $50,000 line of credit by Bank One.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Joe and Bob Salinas started the company _ which
previously went by the name Advanced Networking Solutions _ after
serving in the military and attempting various business ventures
that had them selling everything from nutritional supplements to
motivational tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the brothers say they expect the company to more than
triple its revenues to $12 million. They also are trying to
purchase a 20,000-square-foot building to relocate early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The company is located on South Congress Avenue, where it
employs 143 people _ about 85 percent of whom are women or
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very, very committed to hiring from the community,''
Weisz says. ``It's not just about them making money. It's about
them hiring and giving kids a chance.''

`MOONSHINE': IN AN IRISH VILLAGE, FAITH, LOVE, DEATH AND THE GIFT
OF GAB 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By WILBORN HAMPTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one can accuse the new crop of Irish playwrights
of shying away from the big issues. Take, for example,
``Moonshine,'' a new play by Jim Nolan at the Irish Arts Center
that is at heart a romantic comedy about death, burial and the
Resurrection, taking place on Easter weekend in a small Irish
village.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan offers a little something for everybody. There is a love
triangle, a lapse of religious faith, a midlife crisis, a death in
the family, just about everything except politics, which is unusual
for contemporary Irish plays. But in over two and a half hours what
it has mostly is a lot of gab, and little of it to any particular
point.
</P>
<P>
   At the center is McKeever, a mortician who is also the director
of the local amateur theater group. As undertaker, McKeever has a
propensity to put his foot in his mouth and has trouble getting the
right body in the right grave. As stage director, his cast for a
forthcoming production of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' stands at
four actors to play the 22 roles and is dwindling fast.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Moonshine'' opens McKeever is paying a professional call on
the Reverend Langton, the local Protestant minister, whose wife is
dying. Langton's church is about to be closed because the
congregation has fled to other parishes, and he finds his religious
convictions have deserted him as well.
</P>
<P>
   Langton's daughter, estranged from her parents since she left
the village five years earlier after an affair with McKeever,
arrives from London for the funeral. McKeever, who has an
unflagging belief in the redemptive power of the theater, sets
about to restore Langton's faith, regain the daughter's love, get
the curtain up on his new production and bury Mrs. Langton in the
village churchyard.
</P>
<P>
   While some individual scenes show promise, possible conflicts
end abruptly, often with a platitude, and the characters are
underdeveloped. The funniest parts are the rehearsals of the
mechanicals for ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' but credit for that
belongs to Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   The staging at the Irish Arts Center even has the feel of a
parish-hall production, and the stolid direction of Don Creedon
does little to flesh out the play. The cast is pretty much left to
its own devices, and there is not much sense of cohesion among
them. Johnnie McConnell is a charmer as McKeever and Elizabeth
Whyte is credible as the prodigal daughter. A. Ryan McGuigan has a
nice turn as the undertaker's simple-minded assistant playing
Bottom.
</P>

`THE NIGHT THEY BURNED WASHINGTON`: GENRE OVERLOAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The proper young British widow has a rocket in her
purse. The handsome, aging patent clerk is in pain because he
showed up for military duty in his dancing shoes. The French
ambassador's wife is lonely and convinced that she's dying. The
secretary of patents is worried about his gadgets. The big, burly
sailor just wants to stay alive. And they all end up together in
the U.S. Patent Office one day in 1814 when British soldiers decide
to burn America's capital.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear from the opening lines that ``The Night They Burned
Washington'' is smartly written (``One doesn't burn a city unless
one is properly provoked''), and early scenes establish that it's
skillfully performed. What makes Mark R. Giesser's play, which
opened last Tuesday at the Theater Row Theater, less than a total
success is a kind of genre overload; its sureness with language is
weakened by the work's constant shifting of tone.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a serious commentary on war? Amanda Crofton (Linda
Ewing) is seeking a patent for a new rocket she has designed, one
more efficient than those the British are using now, but, she
explains, ``it's a weapon of peace.'' Its destruction will be so
great, she explains, that war will become unthinkable. ``Can't you
see,'' she implores, ``that my rocket will end the killing?''
</P>
<P>
   Is this a love story? Certainly Amanda and the clerk, Cassius
Lightner (Peter Reznikoff), are attracted to each other from the
beginning, and Amanda has had a premonition about meeting ``my next
husband'' that day. The two do behave in very un-Regency ways,
however. For one thing, Amanda gives Cassius a foot massage _ and
they've barely met. But a little anachronism can be a good thing,
as long as everybody involved is aware of it, and maybe
``moonlight'' really was used as a verb during the War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue is often funny but the audience isn't sure whether
to laugh. Is it farce when the two women challenge each other to a
duel? Or is it an observation about changing gender roles? At one
point, Dr. Thornton (Avrom Berel) defends the decision of the
British to burn the White House: ``Considering the Madisonian sense
of decor, who could blame them?'' Nice line, but did Noel Coward
come in to do the rewrite?
</P>
<P>
   There are physical stretches of credibility, too. Madeline
Serurier (Marianne Tatum), the ambassador's wife, is found lying in
the street, ill or injured, with not a tendril of her Empire hair
style mussed. She's soon feeling better and beginning to appreciate
the charms of the sailor Charlie Dunn (John Wayne Shafer).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Night They Burned Washington,'' like the makeshift rocket,
seems to have all the right ingredients; they just don't mix in
exactly the right way. With a little reformulation, though, it
might catch fire.

`MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA': RESTORING LUSTER TO A DARK MELODRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Lyric Opera of Chicago, which has been notably
committed to performing contemporary operas, has come to the rescue
of a nearly forgotten work, Martin David Levy's ``Mourning Becomes
Electra.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioned and given its premiere by the Metropolitan Opera in
1967, it was produced two years later in Germany and then
disappeared until the Lyric Opera's current production, which I
attended on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The opera is based on Eugene O'Neill's Gothic trilogy of the
same title, which was based in turn on the Oresteia trilogy of
Aeschylus. O'Neill's long-winded 1931 work transplants the
mythological characters to a small New England coastal town during
the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   King Agamemnon and his tormented family become the Mannons,
headed by the stiff Gen. Ezra Mannon, who has been a distant
husband to his younger wife, Christine (the Clytemnestra
character), and who is feared by his son, Orin (the Orestes
character), but adored by his daughter, Livinia (the Electra
character). With a streamlined libretto by Henry Butler and an
Expressionistic score by Levy, the three-act opera lasts some two
and one-half hours (minus intermissions).
</P>
<P>
   The Met went all out in 1967 for its premiere, with a cast
including Evelyn Lear, Marie Collier and a young baritone named
Sherrill Milnes in the role of Adam, the bastard son of Ezra's
deceased brother. The reception was generally enthusiastic, but
Levy's score got caught up in the battle engulfing contemporary
music at the time between the hard-line atonalists and the
composers who clung to tonality.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, New Jersey-born Levy, who was then just 34, said that
he had felt intimidated back then by the hard-liners. In moments
where he wanted his music to take off and sing, he restrained
himself; when he wrote sumptuous harmonies, he clouded them over
with dissonant clusters. But, with the support of the Lyric Opera,
he has revised the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the revision as a cleaning up, removing the dirty
varnish and restoring the opera to something close to my original
vision of it,'' he said in a recent interview. It would be easy to
question why he did not do this in the first place, but Levy was
not the only composer at the time to fear he would not be taken
seriously unless he force-fed his score a diet of tone rows.
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, the work as now presented still seems
indebted to Strauss (particularly ``Elektra'') and Berg. The score
teems with surging Expressionistic music, and at times goes over
the top, skirting close to 1940s movie melodrama. But the story,
which drips with recrimination, murder, suicide and incest, invites
it.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a rhythmic inventiveness and pulsating drive
to the music that seems a bracingly American aspect of Levy's
Expressionism. And, as someone who knows the ways of the theater,
he can create characters through music. For example, a hymnlike
tune for brass, unnerved by a snare drum riff, is associated with
the patriarch Ezra: it sounded like some ironic retort to the
Valhalla leitmotiv from Wagner's ``Ring.'' And when Christine, who
has been carrying on an affair with Adam, explains to Ezra why
their marriage is a sham, the orchestra drives home her points with
slicing, upwardly sweeping arpeggios.
</P>
<P>
   Levy wanted his score to sing, and now it does, not with tunes,
exactly, but with a quality of continually unfolding line that the
composer describes as his brand of ``florid 20th-century bel
canto.'' If anything, he has not allowed the lines to sing enough,
and there is too much formulaic shooting into the stratosphere of
the soprano range for dramatic effect.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Levy has given us an engrossing musical drama, and the
Lyric Opera has given him a remarkable production, directed by
Liviu Ciulei with a debt to Greek tragedy. The sets, also by
Ciulei, are starkly powerful, especially the Mannon mansion, with
its eerily sloping, cold white marble walls.
</P>
<P>
   The cast was superior, but the dramatic soprano Lauren Flanigan,
in her company debut, must be singled out for her mesmerizing,
poignant and sometimes terrifying portrayal of Christine. Her
gleaming voice soared over the orchestra, which Levy has wisely
reduced from the original 90 to 76 players. The soprano Cynthia
Lawrence was also very strong as Livinia. The robust-voiced,
handsome Welsh baritone Jason Howard as Adam, the tenor Randolph
Locke as Orin and the bass Kevin Langan as Ezra, as well as Alicia
Berneche, Brett Polegato and Raymond Aceto in supporting roles,
were all excellent.
</P>
<P>
   How ``Mourning Becomes Electra'' stacks up against the works of
Strauss, Berg or other giants is to me a boring question. Let
history decide. A fascinating new opera held my interest and
stirred the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   But, if it helps place Levy's achievement, I can say that
``Mourning Becomes Electra'' is a stronger work than ``La
Gioconda'' of Ponchielli, which was performed at the Lyric Opera on
Saturday night in a production owned by the San Francisco Opera.
</P>
<P>
   The title role of the suicidal street singer in Venice during
the time of the Inquisition was a favorite of prima donnas like
Renata Tebaldi and Zinka Milanov, and the 1876 opera is notable for
some famous arias and the ``Dance of the Hours'' ballet. But there
is considerable padding in this four-act work, and it's not
surprising it has lost favor.
</P>
<P>
   What brought it back this time was the interest of the dramatic
soprano Jane Eaglen, who clearly felt that her abundant, plush
voice was ideal for Gioconda. She sang with her customary opulent
tone and lyrical distinction, but not much passion or incisiveness.
The South African tenor Johan Botha brought impressive vocal heft
but insufficient Italianate style to the role of Enzo. The
company's admired longtime artistic director, Bruno Bartoletti, who
is retiring from that position, conducted.
</P>
<P>
   But the work to attend this fall in Chicago is Levy's opera.
Let's hope another company takes it up as well. How about the
company that commissioned it in the first place?

MUSIC DIRECTOR RESIGNS IN FACE OF PLAN TO CANCEL ROYAL OPERA
SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In another blow to the struggling Royal Opera House,
its music director, Bernard Haitink, has handed in his resignation
to protest the opera house's decision to cancel its 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   But 69-year-old Haitink, who has held the job for 11 years, has
not quite left, and it remains unclear whether he will follow
through. ``He has said he will withdraw his resignation only if
some sort of orchestral program can be reinstated next season,''
said a spokeswoman for the opera house. ``Discussions are taking
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Haitink, who made his announcement over the weekend, has written
to Culture Secretary Chris Smith asking him to intervene. Haitink
has not received a reply, but the spokeswoman said that Smith had
said Monday that the plan to shut down the opera house for a year,
a last-ditch money-saving measure, had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   Smith told Reuters that the plan had been agreed upon by the
government, the Arts Council and the opera house board to tackle
the problems caused by financial mismanagement.'' The opera house,
which has teetered on the edge of bankruptcy several times in the
last year, is saddled with a $22 million budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Sunday Times of London, Haitink said
that the closing would have a ``lethal'' effect on the orchestra
and that he would not be able to take responsibility for its
condition afterward. He added he was furious that he had been
informed of the plan to cancel the season by a fax saying, ``Maybe
you will be interested in this.'' He said: ``I was flabbergasted.
Imagine! I was not consulted.''

THIS IS PART TWO.
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Canada has enacted a new law on firearms
possession by its citizens. Can you explain what is involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are numerous provisions in Canada's Bill C-68, The
Firearms Act, which requires all gun owners in Canada to get
licenses and register their guns in a national database. Highlights
of the bill:
</P>
<P>
   All gun owners will need a license to possess or acquire
firearms by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Before a license is issued, safety checks will be done on
applicants. Spouses and common-law partners with whom a new
applicant has lived within the past two years will be notified of
the application. New firearms applicants must pass the Canadian
Firearms Safety Test; those registering firearms already in their
possession will not be required to take a course or pass a test,
nor will their former partners be notified.
</P>
<P>
   All firearms must be registered by 2003. New firearms will be
registered when they are made, or at the point of sale on the day
of sale. Previously registered restricted and prohibited firearms
will have to be reregistered.
</P>
<P>
   By 2001, imported firearms brought into Canada by visitors will
have to be registered at the point of entry into Canada;
previously, shotguns and rifles did not have to be registered at
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With the Dow Jones at over 9000 for a while, I was wondering:
How far would the stock market have to fall to equal the crash of
1929? Would the effect today be the same, or more or less?
</P>
<P>
   A: From its high near 386 in September 1929 to its low near 40
in July 1932, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost almost 90
percent of its value. A similar drop from the July 1998 high of
about 9300 would take the Dow under 1000.
</P>
<P>
   World economies today are more industrialized than in the 1930s
and financial markets are more closely linked, so a similar crash
in 1998 would have considerably more global impact, experts say.
But many economists believe that misguided monetary policies
contributed to the 1929 crash and ensuing depression, and that a
repeat is unlikely given current knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported that Kenneth Starr was appointed independent
counsel by a three-judge panel, made up of David Sentelle, John
Butzner and Joseph Sneed. But another article said Judge Peter Fay
of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta was on the
panel, along with Sentelle and Butzner. Which is correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both, because the makeup of the panel has changed. Sneed was
on the panel that appointed Starr on Aug. 5, 1994. The judges serve
two-year terms, but can be reappointed, said Marilyn Sargent of the
U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit. Sneed's two-year term expired
Oct. 26, 1994, and he was not reappointed. Fay began his term on
that same date.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A statement is being sent around to the effect that Bill
Clinton, speaking in 1974 about President Richard Nixon, said Nixon
should resign and not put the country through an impeachment
because he had lied to the American people. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton's comments were reported in the Arkansas Democrat on
Aug. 6, 1974, and in the Arkansas Gazette two days later. The two
articles can be found in their entirety on the Internet at
www.ardemgaz.com, the Web site for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
(click on ``Clinton's 1974 remarks on Nixon and impeachment'').
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Clinton was campaigning for Congress, trying to
unseat Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, who initially opposed Nixon's
resignation. Hammerschmidt had said, after Nixon admitted he lied
about his role in the Watergate coverup, that he wasn't sure
Nixon's actions legally were impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   As quoted by the Little Rock newspapers, Clinton didn't use the
words ``lie,'' ``lied'' or ``lying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's plain that the president should resign and spare
the country the agony of this impeachment and removal proceeding,''
Clinton was reported as saying. ``I think the country could be
spared a lot of agony and the government could worry about
inflation and a lot of other problems if he'd go on and resign.''
Clinton, a law professor at the University of Arkansas, added that
there was ``no question that an admission of making false
statements to government officials and interfering with the FBI and
the CIA is an impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, by the way, now brushes off questions about
Clinton's 1974 remarks, saying Watergate was much more serious than
the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I noticed that when Yasser Arafat spoke in front of the White
House recently, his bottom lip seemed to be quivering. Does he have
a nervous condition?
</P>
<P>
   A: Arafat's quivering lips first came to public attention last
year after the condition was noticed during an interview on Israeli
television. At the time, the Palestinian leader's aides said it was
due to fatigue. ``Sometimes he gets exhausted because he does not
rest,'' said his spokesman, Marwan Kanafani. That view was seconded
by Ghassan Khatib, a former peace negotiator for the Palestinians,
who said he had seen the quivering lip many times over the years.
``That's Arafat when he's angry and when he's tired,'' Khatib said.
Israeli television reports last year said Arafat was seriously ill,
and other reports from Egypt said he fainted during an Arab summit.
But in the months since then, he has seemed to be his usual self in
public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the educational background of Mike McCurry, who
stepped down as President Clinton's press secretary? And will he be
teaching at some college or university?
</P>
<P>
   A: McCurry received a BA from Princeton University in 1976 and a
MA from Georgetown University in 1985. While his work history in
Washington certainly gives him a wealth of expertise for lecturing
_ among other jobs, press secretary to Sens. Harrison Williams
(D-N.J.), Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio);
press secretary to Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt; and director of
communications for the Democratic National Committee _ McCurry, 43,
hasn't indicated any such desire. At his final White House press
briefing Oct. 1, McCurry said his plans, other than corporate
consulting, were these: ``Play a little golf. Make a little money.
Do a lot of Little League coaching and volunteering in my
schools.'' McCurry often complained that his White House duties
kept him away from his three young children more than he would
like.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Ross Perot has called for a national petition to ask for
President Clinton to resign, but how can people add their names to
it?
</P>
<P>
   A: On the Internet, you can find information at www.perot.org,
the Web site for Perot's Reform Party USA. Complete the survey,
download the petition, sign and mail to: Ross Perot, P.O. Box 9,
Dallas, TX 75221. Or, call 972-450-8800 and request that a petition
be mailed to you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the history of Major League Baseball's Gold Glove
award? Who gives them, and who receives them?
</P>
<P>
   A: In a 1956 spring training survey, Elmer Blasco, the
advertising, public relations and sales manager for Rawlings
Sporting Goods, found that 83 percent of all active Major League
players used Rawlings gloves or mitts. Nothing that Hillerich &AMP;
Bradsby, the Major Leagues' leading baseball bat supplier, awarded
Silver Bats to the leagues' top hitters, Blasco thought that
Rawlings should sponsor a fielding award.
</P>
<P>
   After his idea was accepted by Rawlings' management, Blasco
contacted the Brown Shoe Co. of St. Louis and obtained from it a
hide of gold lame-tanned leather used to make women's formal
slippers. A glove was crafted from this hide, laced and stamped as
a regular fielders glove, and attached to a metal fixture on a
walnut base with an appropriate engraved plate. Thus was born the
Gold Glove Award recognizing ``the importance of superior
individual fielding performance to the advancement of baseball as
America's national game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings' annual Gold Glove Awards began with the 1957 season as
a combined selection for both leagues. Beginning in 1958, separate
teams were picked for each league (nine players in each league, by
position). Teams are selected by managers and coaches _ who cannot
vote for members of their own teams.
</P>
<P>
   These are members of the Rawlings Gold Glove Award Hall of Fame:
third baseman Brooks Robinson, 16 awards (1960-75); pitcher Jim
Kaat, also 16 (1962-77); center fielder Willie Mays, 12 (1957-68);
right fielder Roberto Clemente, 12 (1961-72); and catcher Johnny
Bench, 10 (1968-77).

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that U.S. Rep. Bob Barr once was sued for child
support, but there was no further explanation. What were the
circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   A: It became an issue in 1994 when incumbent Rep. Buddy Darden
used a TV commercial stating that Barr's former wife, Gail, had to
sue Barr for child support and medical bills. Barr countered by
having his former wife publicly decry the ad. She also demanded an
apology from Darden.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1994, Gail Barr, wearing a ``Barr for Congress''
sticker on her lapel, said the bitterness between her and her
former husband was vastly exaggerated in Darden's commercial. But
she didn't deny that, several years earlier, she had sued for more
than $600 in medical bills for the couple's sons. A Cobb County
(Ga.) Superior Court judge in 1989 ordered Barr to pay $126 of that
amount. ``I'm very disappointed with him (Darden) drawing myself
and my sons into his campaign,'' Gail Barr said. ``His campaign is
with Bob Barr, not with myself and my sons . . . Bob's a wonderful
father. He loves his sons very much. You couldn't ask for a better
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Darden, who refused to apologize, was defeated by Barr in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When will this year's holiday stamps be available? What is
the design?
</P>
<P>
   A: Two holiday stamps, one traditional and the other
contemporary, will be issued Oct. 15 and will go on sale nationwide
the next day. The traditional stamp will commemorate the Florentine
Madonna and Child, portraying a 15th century sculpture now at the
National Gallery of Art in Washington. The other stamp will feature
four wreaths.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the Oct. 11 Winston 500 at Talladega, Ala., Dale Earnhardt
and Mark Martin complained about ``restrictor plates.'' What is
that? What is it supposed to do?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a simple metal plate with holes drilled in it. It
reduces the engine's horsepower by reducing the flow of gas and air
from the carburetor to the intake manifold by restricting the
diameter of the carburetor's barrels. The less gas-air mixture that
can get to the manifold, the less horsepower the engine can
produce. Many drivers object to restrictor plates because the
plates force them to run with their throttles wide open all the
time, taking away the option of having power in reserve. With no
extra power and throttle to use, drivers say they can't maneuver
out of dangerous situations.
</P>
<P>
   First used in the early 1960s by Bill France Sr. to slow cars,
restrictor plates returned in 1988, the season following Bobby
Allison's horrendous accident at Talladega in which his car landed
on top of the fence separating the track from the stands. Since
then, qualifying speeds at Talladega and Daytona speedways, where
the plates are required by NASCAR, have been reduced to the low 190
miles per hour, and have been kept there by using increasingly
smaller holes in the plates.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get an Entertainment book with information on
half-price dining and reduced-rate hotel accommodations throughout
the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call Entertainment Publications, 1-800-445-4137.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please refresh my memory. What was former Nixon aide Charles
Colson convicted of, and sent to prison for, after Watergate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Colson and six other people were indicted March 1, 1974, by
the Watergate grand jury for conspiracy to ``commit offenses
against the United States,'' for obstruction of justice, for their
political activities from 1969 to 1972 (which included conspiring
to impede the investigation of the June 1972 break-in at the
Democratic national headquarters at the Washington Watergate
complex) and for lying to investigative officials and agencies
about those activities.
</P>
<P>
   On June 21, 1974, Colson, former White House special counsel,
was sentenced to serve one to three years in minimum-security
prison, and to pay a $5,000 fine, for his confessed effort to
obstruct justice in the trial of ``Pentagon Papers'' defendant
Daniel Ellsberg. Colson had entered a surprise guilty plea before
U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell several weeks earlier, admitting
that he had worked to defame and degrade the credibility and public
image of Ellsberg in the press and with the public. Colson had
previously pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and
obstruction of justice in both the Watergate cover-up case and the
Ellsberg break-in case. In February 1975, after serving seven
months of his sentence, Colson was released from jail.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People for the American Way is starting an ad campaign to
urge Congress to move on to issues affecting Americans such as
education, health care and Social Security. I'd like to support the
organization with a contribution. Do you have the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: People for the American Way, 2000 M St. N.W., Suite 400,
Washington, DC 20036 (1-800-326-7329). Or you can sign up online at
www.pfaw.org, the organization's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a directory available showing the e-mail and regular
mail addresses of all members of Congress?
</P>
<P>
   A: Project Vote Smart publishes a Voter's Self-Defense Manual
with information on thousands of political candidates and elected
officials. A spokeswoman said it may not have all ``snail mail''
addresses for every individual, but it has the Senate and House
addresses and they will suffice, along with the person's name. For
a free copy of the 1998 issue, call the organization's Voter's
Research Hotline, 1-888-868-3762.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported that the car depicted on the back of a
$10 bill is generic. I remember taking a tour of the Treasury
Department years ago and was told by our guide that it's a 1925
Hupmobile. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Treasury Department's Bureau of Engraving and Printing
addresses the subject on its Web site,
www.moneyfactory.com/facts.cfm (click on Symbolism and Trivia). It
says the cars are of no specific make or model, and are a creation
of the designer who prepared the original model that was used later
by engraver Louis S. Schofield when he made the original
hand-engraved die of this vignette.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the District of Columbia have any sodomy laws similar to
those in some states?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sodomy between consenting adults has been legal in the
District of Columbia since 1993, when Congress allowed the local
law barring it to lapse. A repeal law passed by the D.C. Council
and signed by Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly in May 1993 had been subject
to a 60-day review period, during which Congress could have
overturned the measure. But the review period ended without a word
of debate in the House or Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Business articles often mention a ``hedge fund.'' What is
that, and how does it work?
</P>
<P>
   A: A hedge fund allows a group of investors to pool their
capital and hire professional management in much the same way as a
mutual fund, said Myron Greene, publisher of the Mutual Fund Timing
Guide. Hedge funds are organized as limited partnerships and are
available only to ``accredited investors'' _ those whose net worth
is more than $1 million, or who have annual income of more than
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mutual funds, there is little government regulation of
hedge funds, the presumption being that wealthy investors are
sophisticated enough to take care of themselves, Greene said. Many
early hedge funds used an investment technique called ``hedging,''
which involves buying and selling related securities, and futures
contracts simultaneously. In theory, hedging allows an investor to
profit in both up and down markets while limiting risk. These days,
hedge funds pursue a variety of investment strategies, Greene said,
many of which don't involve hedging at all.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference, if there is one, between the Blue
Ridge Mountains and the Great Smoky Mountains? I live in the North
Georgia mountains and am embarrassed not to know.
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't be embarrassed. Both are ranges of the Appalachian
Mountains, a mountain system of eastern North America extending
about 1,600 miles from Newfoundland, New Brunswick and southern
Quebec to central Alabama. The range includes the Allegheny, Blue
Ridge, Great Smoky and Cumberland mountains. The Blue Ridge range
extends from southern Pennsylvania to northern Georgia. The Great
Smoky range extends along the North Carolina-Tennessee border.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm 56 and I wonder if there are more people living who are
younger than I, or more who are older. In other words, exactly what
is the median age in our country?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, the median age in
1998 is 35.2 (meaning half of Americans are older and half are
younger than 35.2.) Census figures are broken down into five-year
age groups. The Census Bureau estimates that the number of people
54 and younger is 213 million; the number 55 and older is 57
million. An estimated 12.5 million Americans are in your age group,
55-59. The bureau based these 1998 estimates on 1990 Census
figures; in 1990, the median age was 32.8.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Rep. Jim Bunning, who spoke so eloquently during the House
impeachment debate, the same Jim Bunning who once pitched for the
New York Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bunning (R-Ky.) was a professional baseball player between
1950 and 1971, but not for the Yankees. During his pro career, he
pitched for the Detroit Tigers, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh
Pirates and Los Angeles Dodgers. Highlights included throwing a
no-hitter for the Tigers in 1958 and a perfect game for the
Phillies in 1964. He retired from baseball with a 224-184 record.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning, 66, served on the Fort Thomas, Ky., City Council
(1977-79) and in the Kentucky state Senate (1979-83). He was an
unsuccessful candidate in the election for Kentucky governor in
1983. In 1986, he was elected to represent Kentucky's 4th
Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   And in August 1996, Bunning was inducted into the National
Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was in Atlantic City recently and I did some jogging along
the boardwalk there. I didn't see any information about how long it
is. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: The boardwalk stretches along the Atlantic Ocean for 4 1/2
miles in Atlantic City. It continues for 2 more miles in Ventnor
City, a community to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since Bill Clinton, as president of the United States, is
commander in chief of the armed forces, why can't he be tried by a
military court for his alleged extramarital activities?
</P>
<P>
   A: This issue was brought up last month at a Washington news
conference, and was answered by Defense Secretary William Cohen.
All those who are in the military serve under the Uniform Code of
Military Justice, which prohibits adultery, Cohen said. But even
though the president is commander in chief, he is a civilian, and
therefore doesn't have to follow military rules prohibiting
adultery.

   BEIJING _ Of all the places and people perplexed by America's
preoccupation with the Clinton sex scandal, China and the Chinese
may be the most.
</P>
<P>
   It was the foremost topic on the mind of the first Chinese
friend we ran into recently upon our return from home leave in the
United States. Zipping through the requisite polite queries as to
vacation and travels, our young friend quickly pounced on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of news about Clinton here. Every day on
television we see reports that the American people are supporting
him,'' said our friend, confirming that the Chinese media's
softball coverage had continued in our absence. A woman in her
mid-20s, she works for the Chinese government and thus wishes not
to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   She ventured that Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr -- though she
didn't know his name -- is ``too aggressive,'' then suggested the
Monica Lewinsky affair is ``too private'' anyway to be aired all
over newspapers and television. Her Chinese friends are shocked and
embarrassed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her questions all trailed to the basic imponderable of how this
can be happening, and how to square Clinton's position as leader of
a great world power with this humiliating public probing into his
most intimate life?
</P>
<P>
   It could not happen in China. And understanding the phenomenon
here requires jumping a cultural and political chasm.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese official media has made only glancing reference to
the Washington charges of perjury and witness tampering, and these
legal issues were lost on our friend. Probably they were lost on
most Chinese who retain much goodwill for the charming American
president they got to know via their own television screens just
this summer -- Clinton savoring their cultural achievements,
debating their president, talking to their university students and
business leaders and new homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   Thus our awkward attempt to explain how the rule of law applies
to everyone in a democracy didn't gain much ground with our friend.
Nor our belabored argument that the American system of checks and
balances works even when it looks out of kilter.
</P>
<P>
   That, we suspect, is partly because China has neither the
equitable rule of law nor any check on the ruling Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   And it is in part because critiques of Clinton, including a
Chinese-language book exploring his peccadilloes, have been
suppressed by a Chinese government that has become one of the
staunchest ``Friends of Bill'' since the presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has gotten almost the same shielding a Chinese leader
might enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, for example, outsiders have known that the late
Chairman Mao Tse-tung fancied lovely young women, who sometimes
were brought to his bedchamber two or three at a time and were
known to distract him from matters of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I heard about this lately, but only orally. I never read
it,'' our friend said, referring carefully to the tell-all book
written by Mao's private physician. The book is banned in China.
</P>
<P>
   This aspect of the Great Helmsman's life has been described in
the most respected foreign history books for years, we noted, and
added that sex often has been an appendage to power throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Our friend paused to think, then expressed her curiosity, ``And
have you read the same about Zhou Enlai?''
</P>
<P>
   We had not read any such commentary about China's long-time
number two Communist revolutionary leader, who since his death in
1976 has become increasingly respected as a force of stability and
sanity. But this educated young woman had to ask foreigners for the
truth about her leaders, knowing there are some things she will not
read or learn from the state-controlled media any time soon in
China. Not only things about sex.
</P>
<P>
   That is something to ponder for Americans who think they are
getting a surfeit of information.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-five years ago, Arab countries around the
Persian Gulf started an oil embargo that shattered Americans'
complacency over the security of their energy supply.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial oil shortage that began on Oct. 18, 1973, led to
six months of agonizing and improvising by government officials and
drivers desperate to find a service station that still had gas.
</P>
<P>
   In the next quarter-century, the federal government spent more
than $90 billion looking for ways to reduce our reliance on foreign
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Today, over-production and faltering demand from developing
countries has created a worldwide glut of oil. Half the oil
consumed in the United States -- or roughly one-fifth of the
nation's total energy supply -- is imported from Mexico, Canada and
other foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans have apparently forgotten about that crisis of
25 years ago,'' said Cecile Warner, who has not. An engineer who
directs the federal Center for Renewable Energy Resources in
Golden, Colo., she designed, built and lives in ``a passive solar
home that uses less than one-third of the energy of a home built to
today's standards.''
</P>
<P>
   New energy efficiencies have cut petroleum use per person. But
expensive efforts to develop clean, non-nuclear alternatives to
fossil fuels have failed to come up with a product cheap enough to
compete with deregulated oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half our oil now is imported, compared to only a
little more than one-third before the embargo, and that figure is
expected to rise to about two-thirds by 2020,'' Warner cautioned.
``Average vehicle miles per gallon are decreasing because of the
popularity of sport -utility vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, today's SUVs and other light trucks average more than 20
miles per gallon -- while the average car or pick-up of 1973 burned
up a gallon every 14 miles.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason why few Americans even noticed the three
price-propping production cutbacks announced in the last 10 months
by the the Arab and non-Arab countries in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's first two cutbacks flopped. The third, announced in June,
might be taking hold. After sliding from $25 a barrel in October
1996 to under $14 in August, the world price for crude oil has
bobbed up to around $16 in the last two months. The two-dollar jump
translates to about a nickel a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Sales from new suppliers dilute any cutback's effects. ``Russia,
the Caspian Sea region, Asia, West Africa and Latin America'' are
the industry's new frontiers, said Michael Cates, chief economist
of the American Petroleum Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond this, our vulnerability to such disruptions has been
significantly reduced by the development of the (federal) Strategic
Petroleum Reserve,'' Cates said. The reserve's storage pits hold
enough crude oil to make up for the loss of all U.S. imports for
about 60 days -- longer in the more likely event that only part of
the imports are blocked. The reserve system worked well in 1990
during and after the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   But the 1973 embargo was another story. The Saudis announced
that if the United States continued supporting Israel militarily,
it wouldn't be allowed to buy Arab oil.
</P>
<P>
   That threat was issued just one day after 11 Arab nations agreed
in Kuwait City to raise the charge for their oil by 17 percent and
prop up the new price by cutting their production by five percent
each month.

   Defying the economic and political threat, the United States
continued to re-supply the Israelis as they drove back the
Soviet-supplied armies of Syria and Egypt, which had invaded Israel
earlier in the month on the solemn Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence in American leaders was sinking that month, as
Vice President Spiro Agnew was forced to resign and President
Richard Nixon ordered the firing of the Watergate special
prosecutor. In addition, an elaborate system of price and wage
controls had failed to prevent heating-oil shortages the previous
winter and disruptions of the gasoline supply that summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall consumers following our delivery trucks and when the
truck arrived at the station, it would be trailing a ready-made
line of cars waiting for gas,'' said Leo Liebowitz, president and
CEO of Getty Oil, an independent oil marketer on Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pumping about 52,000 gallons a month, but as soon as
the embargo hit, I was cut back to 26,000,'' remembered station
owner Larry Beattie of Augusta, Ga. ``I think the oil companies and
the government, both of them, overdid it, and, of course, there was
a little abuse of the situation by some people on the side.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Station closings were most common in Florida, Georgia, the
Carolinas and Tennessee. ``We'd have 70 to 100 dealers who'd spend
their own money to go up to Washington and lobby for relief,'' said
Jack Houston, retired executive director of the Georgia Association
of Petroleum Retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who used to wait until their gas tank was three-quarters
empty began refilling when their tank was three-quarters full.
``Better safe than sorry,'' said Lois Epstein's grandfather, when
she asked why they were lined up to buy gasoline for the second day
in a row. Multiplied by millions of motorists, that precaution
drained oil terminals, tank farms and refineries of surpluses that
could have eased the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, now a senior engineer with the Environmental Defense
Fund, said she worries that oil today is so cheap and plentiful
that careless companies lack economic incentives to fix leaky
equipment that could contaminate water or soil.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   At the embargo's peak, crude oil imports dropped by 17 percent.
The 38-cent average price for gasoline jumped to 54 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, a governor who three years later would be elected
president, asked Georgia's state employes to save electricity by
using the stairs instead of the elevators at work.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans heeded Nixon's pleas to turn down their
home and office thermostats to 68 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines conserved jet fuel by packing more passengers onto
fewer flights. They overbooked so heavily that when consumer
advocate Ralph Nader was bumped, a federal district judge ordered
the airline to pay him $25,100.
</P>
<P>
   The big neon signs in front of motels blinked off. Nixon parked
Air Force One and caught a commercial flight to his home in
California. That year, the lights on the national Christmas tree
erected outside the White House each December were kept turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices stayed up, and Israel reached a truce with Syria and
Egypt. Missions accomplished, the Arabs halted their embargo in
March 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But many older Americans still suspect it was all a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what was going on,'' recalled Lee Ramsnyder, who
operated the Lan-Mar Marina on Georgia's Lake Lanier. ``I remember
hearing there was a secret supply in Louisiana or someplace like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We pumped most of our gas to boaters on weekends, and we kept
running out by Sunday afternoon,'' he said. ``I think maybe a lot
of it was done by the government to pull us out of a little
recession by making people back up a bit on fuel use and dig in.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ramsnyder rebuilds used tour buses, installs luxuries
ranging from stoves and showers to trash compactors, and then sells
the vehicles to entertainers and other travelers who don't care
that they only get about eight miles to the gallon.

   BEIJING _ Oil barons around the world, take heart: China's leap
toward prosperity has caused nearly 1 million families to switch
from bicycles to cars.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the coming of the car culture to China isn't going to
shock the world's oil markets, as did the Arab oil embargo of
1973-74.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Chinese private car phenomenon should gain momentum
in the next few years just when the rest of Asia is soaring back
from its current economic crisis, the combined impact on world oil
prices could be dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The simple mechanism of supply-and-demand could slowly crimp the
world oil market in much the same way as members of OPEC did in the
oil cartel's heyday, when they agreed to cut production quotas --
and then stuck to the rules. Gradually, oil would become less
available and the price would go up.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the number of private cars in China has jumped from
virtually zero five years ago to at least 699,000, according to a
report by the China Automobile Market Survey and Research Society.
China's auto makers are now increasing the production of passenger
sedans by 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2000, there will be at least 1 million privately
owned vehicles in China's cities,'' the research society declared.
``In major municipalities and provincial capitals, the ownership
rate among families will reach five(CQ) percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, since 1996 China has ``trimmed'' the production of
bicycles, the China Light Industry News reported last month. It
attributed the fall-off to ``shrinking market demand'' and
``accelerated development of the automobile industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Though affluence is on the rise in China, the rest of Asia is in
a deep recession. This has flattened Asia's spectacular 5
percent-a-year growth in oil consumption that generally kept world
prices above $24 a barrel throughout the 1980s. When Asia's energy
demand sagged last year, world oil prices slid by this summer to
below $11 a barrel, their lowest level (on an inflation-adjusted
basis) since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, almost every expert believes that Asian oil demand will
start to rebound fairly soon. When that happens, it will probably
spell the end of cheap gasoline around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Writing this March in the American journal ``Foreign Affairs,''
world oil experts Daniel Yergin, Dennis Eklof and Jefferson Edwards
predicted that overall Asian energy consumption ``will again rise
sharply in two or three years'' -- once Japan and its neighbors
solve their internal economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the lowest trough of the Asian economic doldrums,
Asian countries consume about 19 million barrels of oil a day.
That's just over one-fourth of the oil that is used worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Oil fields in Asia produce just 8 million barrels for Asia's
daily needs; the remaining 11 million barrels a day must be
imported. Three-fourths of Asia's imported petroleum comes from the
Persian Gulf, with Saudi Arabia by far the largest supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sum, the prospects for Asia's oil supply look decidedly
grim,'' wrote Yergin, Eklof and Edwards. ``By 2010, (Asian)
productive capacity will have declined 6 percent from its 2005
peak, with new oil field developments unable to compensate for
maturing Indonesian, Malaysian and Australian fields. So regardless
of exploration, Asia is destined to import more than 20 million
barrels of oil per day by 2010, compared with approximately 11
million today.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   China is the newest and fastest-growing customer for Middle East
oil. Until five years ago, China was proud of its status as an
``energy-independent'' oil exporter. But thanks to its own meteoric
economic growth, China now imports 25 percent of its oil, amounting
to 1 million barrels a day. So far, most is for industrial uses and
only a small fraction for private cars.
</P>
<P>
   China derives another 3 million barrels a day of oil from
domestic oil wells while obtaining the balance of its energy from
massive reliance on coal, and hydro-electric and a few nuclear
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of China's imported oil now comes from Saudi Arabia, Iran
and the United Arab Emirates. Determined to diversify its oil
sources beyond the Persian Gulf, China's national petroleum
corporation last year outbid some of the biggest Western oil
companies for the right to help develop some of the choicest
Caspian Sea Basin oil properties in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, China's steep increases in oil imports worries some
Chinese energy experts. Early last year retired scientists Yang
Jike, the former vice president of China's national environmental
protection committee, published a warning that it was better to
rely
</P>
<P>
   on coal than imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   If China allowed its oil imports to increase, ``China will get
entangled in Middle East politics, like the United States,'' Yang
wrote.

   THEN AND NOW: CHANGES SINCE THE 1973 ARAB OIL EMBARGO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Imports, 28 percent of total U.S. oil consumption in 1973,
have risen to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), which supplied 54 percent of the world's crude oil, now
provide 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Inflation-adjusted retail prices have risen 6.5 percent for
gasoline and 7 percent for electricity in those 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inflation-adjusted price paid by refiners for crude oil
has risen by 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inflation-adjusted price of natural gas as it comes out of
the ground has increased by 187 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. consumption of petroleum is up by 13 percent, though the
nation's growing population means that on a per-person basis, it is
down by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Improved exploration and development technology has cut the
cost of finding new oil and gas wells by 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The average car then got 14 miles per gallon, compared to
today's 28.5 miles per gallon for a car and 20.4 miles per gallon
for light trucks -- including minivans, sport utility vehicles and
small pickups.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Today's average car or light truck has 25 percent more
horsepower than its equivalent in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The 31 percent share of homes heated by oil has dropped to 17
percent. The main reason: The 54 percent share of new homes heated
by natural gas has risen to 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Electric utilities, which got 17 percent of their power from
oil before the embargo, get only 2.5 percent from oil today.
Natural gas, then 18 percent of fuel for utilities, fell to 9.5
percent. To make up the difference, coal rose from 46 percent to
nearly 57 percent of utility fuel, and nuclear rose from 4.5
percent to about about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  While U.S. energy consumption has increased by 27 percent
since the embargo, energy use has grown so much faster in other
countries that the U.S. share of the world's energy consumption has
dropped from 31 percent in 1973 to 25 percent today.

   MEXICO CITY _ When the price of crude oil falls, it's happy days
for American consumers and the U.S. economy. But those same price
cuts strike fear in the hearts of Mexicans and Venezuelans, now
critical exporters of oil to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil dominates the economies of Latin America's biggest
producers. And every time prices fall, big cuts in federal spending
and economic crisis are sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The ties that bind the U.S. and its Latin American suppliers
have grown strong since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, part of
a promise by the U.S. to diversify and avoid oil dependence on one
region.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, for example, is expected to supply the U.S. with 13.4
percent of its imported oil in 1998. That's up from 1.2 percent in
1975. In 1985 Mexico's share of U.S. oil imports hit a high of more
than 16 percent, then dropped a bit before rising again this year.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   The growth of mutual dependency between the United States and
Mexico is ironic, given how jealously Mexico guards its national
resources. In Mexico, the day that oil was nationalized in 1938 is
still celebrated as a moment of civic pride, and suggestions that
privatizing the nation's oil industry to make it more efficient
always prompts a flurry of angry denunciations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, not all of Mexico's oil was sold to the United
States,'' said John Lichtbleu, an analyst with Pira Energy Group in
New York. ``There was a time when they didn't want to sell more
than 50 percent of exports to the U.S. because of a fear of
domination. Now 85 to 90 percent of Mexican exported oil goes to
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   While the northward flow helps stabilize the Mexican economy, it
also means demand and price fluctuations have a greater impact on
average Mexicans. About 33 percent of the country's federal revenue
comes from Petroleos de Mexico -- Pemex -- the government's oil
company.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   That's a dependency Mexico has tried hard to shake. A decade
ago, oil money made up 45 percent of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   And oil used to be Mexico's number one export, drawing three out
of every four dollars worth of foreign capital flowing into the
country. Today, as Mexico has built up its manufacturing base, oil
accounts for only 5.4 percent of the foreign revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the economy and the national budget are highly vulnerable
to the ups and downs of international oil prices. Three times this
year Mexican government officials made emergency budget spending
cuts to make up for oil revenue shortfalls. More cuts are expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico will have to operate next year with an austere budget
and somehow depend less on oil revenues,'' said Jonathan Heath, a
Mexico City-based economist. ``That will be tough for a country
like Mexico, where public needs are so great today.''
</P>
<P>
   The bust-and-boom oil price cycles have been even rougher on
Venezuela, who's main crude producer, Petroleos de Venezuela, is
the world's second largest.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela puts out 3 million barrels of crude each day, and
relies on oil to generate 60 percent of its government budget
revenue and 80 percent of its foreign income.
</P>
<P>
   The result: recession and political instability this year as the
price for Venezuelan crude hit a 12-year low; oil revenue is off by
a third; the government has slashed spending by $4 billion; and
bank-loan interest rates have soared to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos has opened the door for protectionist politicians like
Hugo Chavez, a former military leader who headed a failed coup in
1992 against then-president Carlos Andres Perez. Chavez is the
front-runner in the race for presidency, which culminates in a
December vote.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has promised to revisit Venezuela's open-door policy on
outside investments in the nation's oil business -- a move that
could crimp the revenues of dozens of foreign companies that
operate in Venezuela. He's even hinted at cutting back on exports
to rich nations, like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez is really the big unknown and he's got investors
scared,'' said Don Bowles, Latin America director for the Economist
Intelligence Unit, a research firm in London. ``Whether he wins,
and what he decides to do if he does, will shape the country's
economic future and could affect the oil industry.''

   KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ There has never been so much available
oil, which is good news for motorists at gas pumps just about
everywhere -- but here.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices are dropping. So, nervous officials in this oil-rich
sheikhdom might raise the price of gasoline in their own land to
raise money for the government-sponsored lifestyle of free
health-care, full employment and air-conditioned comfort.
</P>
<P>
   High-priced gasoline would be a reversal of fortune for Kuwait.
It's oil reserves make up nearly one-tenth of the world's supply
and gushes up through drill holes to the desert surface without the
pumps needed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks odd and peculiar that, at a time when many countries
are cutting the prices at the gas stations, you're increasing it in
Kuwait,'' said Kuwaiti Oil Minister Saud Nasir Al-Sabah in a recent
interview with Cox News Service. ``That's absurd . . . I don't
think this is something that's acceptable to us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is still good here. Car dealerships are busy every night
and young Kuwaitis can still count on a job in the bloated
government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuwait and its oil-producing neighbors, from wealthy Saudi
Arabia to giant and volatile Iran, are struggling with the
ramifications of low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, the so-called Arab oil embargo shocked
the West. Attempting to keep the U.S. from backing Israel, these
countries threatened to cut oil supplies -- particularly to the
U.S., where frightened Americans rushed to line up their
gas-guzzling automobiles at pumps despite rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   The panic in the West brought a windfall in the Gulf, which
became awash in cash as well as oil. Big countries like Iran and
Iraq could bring their people modern social services, roads and
education. Small countries, like Kuwait, could luxuriate.
</P>
<P>
   It raised the gulf countries' world clout. Arabic became an
official language at the United Nations. The United States started
selling sophisticated military airplanes to the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   But, prompted by the higher prices, new competition in oil
production took off from Mexico to Russia. And, oil importers --
especially the United States -- found ways to conserve.
</P>
<P>
   Today, oil prices are about as low, adjusted for inflation, as
they were before the embargo in 1973. More oil is produced than
ever -- 73 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Persian Gulf oil exporters still sit on 65 percent of
the world's supply, it is losing value. The 11-member OPEC cartel
(including three nations outside the Mideast) will see revenues
drop by a third this year -- down about $40 billion. Since 1980,
the per capita income in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and three other
oil-producing monarchies has dropped by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A continued decline in oil prices could cause hard times here,
leading to radicalism -- or worse, instability -- even among
stalwart American allies like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kuwait has just 1.8 million inhabitants and nearly 10 percent
of the world's oil. But, Kuwaitis are edgy about the soundness of a
system that provides free health-care, subsidized utilities and
charges no income or sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More vulnerable is Saudi Arabia, with about 18 million people.
It is also cutting back benefits -- like the low-income housing
loans for newlyweds -- while trying to calm a restless minority of
have-nots and religious fundamentalists. Unemployment is rising.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More volatile still is Iran. A regional giant with 68 million
people, Iran's government deficit and economic recession could
undercut nascent steps toward detente with the West.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Iraq is another story. Its oil production has been limited by
economic sanctions and industrial disrepair following the Persian
Gulf War. But, should things improve -- and Russia and China have
their way -- its production will kick into gear and add to the oil
glut.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Zalmay Khalilzad, director for Strategic Studies at the Rand
Corp., warns that the United States is still dependent on Persian
Gulf oil supplies. If Americans want low prices, he said, they may
have to be ready to help quell the resulting unrest in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The oil producers tend to make the problem worse. Most have
refused to make tough cuts in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gulf countries, unfortunately, are still dreaming that the
welfare state will last forever,'' said Kuwaiti political scientist
Shamlan al-Essa(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they just try to raise money by pumping and selling
more oil. That lowers the price even more.
</P>
<P>
   Far from controlling the market, OPEC members now are struggling
just to keep their organization together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole situation is very different than it was in the
past,'' Al Sabah said. ``We have to be extremely careful about
mixing oil and politics.''

   MOSCOW _ Think of the world's major oil powers and the first
images likely to come to mind are of Persian Gulf sheikdoms or the
sun-baked Texas plains.
</P>
<P>
   Think vodka and snow, too.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable portion of the world's future oil and natural gas
supplies will come from Russia and other former Soviet republics,
if Western oil companies can get to it.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Soviet Union seven years ago sparked the
last great oil boom of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Oil giants like Exxon, Amoco, Mobil, Shell, Texaco and British
Petroleum are investing billions of dollars across the continent to
tap oil and gas fields from the Siberian tundra of Russia to the
arid Central Asian plains of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be here and ready with this kind money if it
wasn't worth it,'' said Alexander Ordjonikidze of the Sakhalin
Energy Investment Company, a consortium of Shell, Marathon and
several Japanese partners that is set to begin offshore production
next year off Russia's far east coast.
</P>
<P>
   Worthwhile maybe, but it is far from easy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is the world's second largest energy supplier; it
produces more natural gas than any country in the world and is
third behind Saudi Arabia and the United States in quantities of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   But its teetering economy and aging production facilities have
left its status as an oil and gas giant in a sorry state, pumping
about half the levels it did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Western oil companies have touted themselves as the solution to
Russia's problem -- with partnerships to help Russia extract its
oil and get it to market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet frustrated oil companies have run up against a snarl of
bureaucracy, unfavorable tax conditions and changing terms of the
production deals by Russian partners who want a bigger stake. With
Russia's economy now in crisis and its market reformers on the
political outs, conditions are not expected to improve soon.
</P>
<P>
   Flat world oil prices and a threat of global recession have
further eliminated the urgency and eagerness to push ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Caspian Sea on Russia's southern fringe, billions of
dollars in deals are going forward in a region with the largest new
oil finds in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   It is hailed as the next great Middle East, and the Caspian Sea
basin -- including the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and the breakaway Russian republic
Chechnya -- could be just that.
</P>
<P>
   The region combines the lucrative and dangerous elements of oil,
political unrest and geopolitical implications as the United
States, Russia and Iran vie for influence there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cliche about the former Soviet Union is it is a place with
lots of problems and lots of opportunities. The problems may now
look bigger than they did two or three years ago, but the oil is
still here,'' said Stephen O'Sullivan, an oil and gas industry
analyst in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the Caspian prizes is the Tengiz oil field in
Kazakhstan. Tengiz potentially could produce more than 1 million
barrels a day -- more than the current yield of Alaska's Prudhoe
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But how to get the oil from the Caspian basin to market has been
a source of diplomatic frustration and intrigue. Russia, Iran and
the United States have differing alternatives for pipelines to the
West.
</P>
<P>
   In the far east, an estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil and 400
billion cubic meters of natural gas lie under the waters around
Sakhalin Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Sakhalin consortium so far has spent $1 billion and is
prepared to spend ten times that to fully develop its offshore
fields. But it is stalled by the Russian parliament's refusal to
approve legislation on a production-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma, the lower house of parliament, is dominated by
Communists and die-hard nationalist parties suspicious of the West
and reluctant to share Russia's resources with big oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the allure of Russia is fading. Countries in Latin America
and Asia, whose economies also need foreign investment, have begun
to woo the oil companies. Even Saudi Arabia, which nationalized its
oil interests in the 1970s, is making overtures to Western
companies to buy a stake there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Western oil companies take a very long view in
Russia, but they've begun to direct their attentions elsewhere,''
said O'Sullivan. ``They won't leave completely. But they may be
content to allow the oil to stay in the ground another five, 10 or
20 years longer.''

   BEIJING _ Oil barons around the world, take heart: China's leap
toward prosperity has caused nearly 1 million families to switch
from bicycles to cars.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the coming of the car culture to China isn't going to
shock the world's oil markets, as did the Arab oil embargo of
1973-74.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Chinese private car phenomenon should gain momentum
in the next few years just when the rest of Asia is soaring back
from its current economic crisis, the combined impact on world oil
prices could be dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The simple mechanism of supply-and-demand could slowly crimp the
world oil market in much the same way as members of OPEC did in the
oil cartel's heyday, when they agreed to cut production quotas --
and then stuck to the rules. Gradually, oil would become less
available and the price would go up.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the number of private cars in China has jumped from
virtually zero five years ago to at least 699,000, according to a
report by the China Automobile Market Survey and Research Society.
China's auto makers are now increasing the production of passenger
sedans by 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2000, there will be at least 1 million privately
owned vehicles in China's cities,'' the research society declared.
``In major municipalities and provincial capitals, the ownership
rate among families will reach five(CQ) percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, since 1996 China has ``trimmed'' the production of
bicycles, the China Light Industry News reported last month. It
attributed the fall-off to ``shrinking market demand'' and
``accelerated development of the automobile industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Though affluence is on the rise in China, the rest of Asia is in
a deep recession. This has flattened Asia's spectacular 5
percent-a-year growth in oil consumption that generally kept world
prices above $24 a barrel throughout the 1980s. When Asia's energy
demand sagged last year, world oil prices slid by this summer to
below $11 a barrel, their lowest level (on an inflation-adjusted
basis) since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, almost every expert believes that Asian oil demand will
start to rebound fairly soon. When that happens, it will probably
spell the end of cheap gasoline around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Writing this March in the American journal ``Foreign Affairs,''
world oil experts Daniel Yergin, Dennis Eklof and Jefferson Edwards
predicted that overall Asian energy consumption ``will again rise
sharply in two or three years'' -- once Japan and its neighbors
solve their internal economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the lowest trough of the Asian economic doldrums,
Asian countries consume about 19 million barrels of oil a day.
That's just over one-fourth of the oil that is used worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Oil fields in Asia produce just 8 million barrels for Asia's
daily needs; the remaining 11 million barrels a day must be
imported. Three-fourths of Asia's imported petroleum comes from the
Persian Gulf, with Saudi Arabia by far the largest supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sum, the prospects for Asia's oil supply look decidedly
grim,'' wrote Yergin, Eklof and Edwards. ``By 2010, (Asian)
productive capacity will have declined 6 percent from its 2005
peak, with new oil field developments unable to compensate for
maturing Indonesian, Malaysian and Australian fields. So regardless
of exploration, Asia is destined to import more than 20 million
barrels of oil per day by 2010, compared with approximately 11
million today.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   China is the newest and fastest-growing customer for Middle East
oil. Until five years ago, China was proud of its status as an
``energy-independent'' oil exporter. But thanks to its own meteoric
economic growth, China now imports 25 percent of its oil, amounting
to 1 million barrels a day. So far, most is for industrial uses and
only a small fraction for private cars.
</P>
<P>
   China derives another 3 million barrels a day of oil from
domestic oil wells while obtaining the balance of its energy from
massive reliance on coal, and hydro-electric and a few nuclear
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of China's imported oil now comes from Saudi Arabia, Iran
and the United Arab Emirates. Determined to diversify its oil
sources beyond the Persian Gulf, China's national petroleum
corporation last year outbid some of the biggest Western oil
companies for the right to help develop some of the choicest
Caspian Sea Basin oil properties in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, China's steep increases in oil imports worries some
Chinese energy experts. Early last year retired scientists Yang
Jike, the former vice president of China's national environmental
protection committee, published a warning that it was better to
rely
</P>
<P>
   on coal than imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   If China allowed its oil imports to increase, ``China will get
entangled in Middle East politics, like the United States,'' Yang
wrote.

   THEN AND NOW: CHANGES SINCE THE 1973 ARAB OIL EMBARGO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Imports, 28 percent of total U.S. oil consumption in 1973,
have risen to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), which supplied 54 percent of the world's crude oil, now
provide 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Inflation-adjusted retail prices have risen 6.5 percent for
gasoline and 7 percent for electricity in those 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inflation-adjusted price paid by refiners for crude oil
has risen by 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inflation-adjusted price of natural gas as it comes out of
the ground has increased by 187 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. consumption of petroleum is up by 13 percent, though the
nation's growing population means that on a per-person basis, it is
down by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Improved exploration and development technology has cut the
cost of finding new oil and gas wells by 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The average car then got 14 miles per gallon, compared to
today's 28.5 miles per gallon for a car and 20.4 miles per gallon
for light trucks -- including minivans, sport utility vehicles and
small pickups.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Today's average car or light truck has 25 percent more
horsepower than its equivalent in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The 31 percent share of homes heated by oil has dropped to 17
percent. The main reason: The 54 percent share of new homes heated
by natural gas has risen to 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Electric utilities, which got 17 percent of their power from
oil before the embargo, get only 2.5 percent from oil today.
Natural gas, then 18 percent of fuel for utilities, fell to 9.5
percent. To make up the difference, coal rose from 46 percent to
nearly 57 percent of utility fuel, and nuclear rose from 4.5
percent to about about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  While U.S. energy consumption has increased by 27 percent
since the embargo, energy use has grown so much faster in other
countries that the U.S. share of the world's energy consumption has
dropped from 31 percent in 1973 to 25 percent today.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-five years ago, Arab countries around the
Persian Gulf started an oil embargo that shattered Americans'
complacency over the security of their energy supply.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial oil shortage that began on Oct. 18, 1973, led to
six months of agonizing and improvising by government officials and
drivers desperate to find a service station that still had gas.
</P>
<P>
   In the next quarter-century, the federal government spent more
than $90 billion looking for ways to reduce our reliance on foreign
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Today, over-production and faltering demand from developing
countries has created a worldwide glut of oil. Half the oil
consumed in the United States -- or roughly one-fifth of the
nation's total energy supply -- is imported from Mexico, Canada and
other foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans have apparently forgotten about that crisis of
25 years ago,'' said Cecile Warner, who has not. An engineer who
directs the federal Center for Renewable Energy Resources in
Golden, Colo., she designed, built and lives in ``a passive solar
home that uses less than one-third of the energy of a home built to
today's standards.''
</P>
<P>
   New energy efficiencies have cut petroleum use per person. But
expensive efforts to develop clean, non-nuclear alternatives to
fossil fuels have failed to come up with a product cheap enough to
compete with deregulated oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half our oil now is imported, compared to only a
little more than one-third before the embargo, and that figure is
expected to rise to about two-thirds by 2020,'' Warner cautioned.
``Average vehicle miles per gallon are decreasing because of the
popularity of sport -utility vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, today's SUVs and other light trucks average more than 20
miles per gallon -- while the average car or pick-up of 1973 burned
up a gallon every 14 miles.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason why few Americans even noticed the three
price-propping production cutbacks announced in the last 10 months
by the the Arab and non-Arab countries in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's first two cutbacks flopped. The third, announced in June,
might be taking hold. After sliding from $25 a barrel in October
1996 to under $14 in August, the world price for crude oil has
bobbed up to around $16 in the last two months. The two-dollar jump
translates to about a nickel a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Sales from new suppliers dilute any cutback's effects. ``Russia,
the Caspian Sea region, Asia, West Africa and Latin America'' are
the industry's new frontiers, said Michael Cates, chief economist
of the American Petroleum Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond this, our vulnerability to such disruptions has been
significantly reduced by the development of the (federal) Strategic
Petroleum Reserve,'' Cates said. The reserve's storage pits hold
enough crude oil to make up for the loss of all U.S. imports for
about 60 days -- longer in the more likely event that only part of
the imports are blocked. The reserve system worked well in 1990
during and after the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   But the 1973 embargo was another story. The Saudis announced
that if the United States continued supporting Israel militarily,
it wouldn't be allowed to buy Arab oil.
</P>
<P>
   That threat was issued just one day after 11 Arab nations agreed
in Kuwait City to raise the charge for their oil by 17 percent and
prop up the new price by cutting their production by five percent
each month.
</P>
<P>
   Defying the economic and political threat, the United States
continued to re-supply the Israelis as they drove back the
Soviet-supplied armies of Syria and Egypt, which had invaded Israel
earlier in the month on the solemn Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence in American leaders was sinking that month, as
Vice President Spiro Agnew was forced to resign and President
Richard Nixon ordered the firing of the Watergate special
prosecutor. In addition, an elaborate system of price and wage
controls had failed to prevent heating-oil shortages the previous
winter and disruptions of the gasoline supply that summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall consumers following our delivery trucks and when the
truck arrived at the station, it would be trailing a ready-made
line of cars waiting for gas,'' said Leo Liebowitz, president and
CEO of Getty Oil, an independent oil marketer on Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pumping about 52,000 gallons a month, but as soon as
the embargo hit, I was cut back to 26,000,'' remembered station
owner Larry Beattie of Augusta, Ga. ``I think the oil companies and
the government, both of them, overdid it, and, of course, there was
a little abuse of the situation by some people on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Station closings were most common in Florida, Georgia, the
Carolinas and Tennessee. ``We'd have 70 to 100 dealers who'd spend
their own money to go up to Washington and lobby for relief,'' said
Jack Houston, retired executive director of the Georgia Association
of Petroleum Retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who used to wait until their gas tank was three-quarters
empty began refilling when their tank was three-quarters full.
``Better safe than sorry,'' said Lois Epstein's grandfather, when
she asked why they were lined up to buy gasoline for the second day
in a row. Multiplied by millions of motorists, that precaution
drained oil terminals, tank farms and refineries of surpluses that
could have eased the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, now a senior engineer with the Environmental Defense
Fund, said she worries that oil today is so cheap and plentiful
that careless companies lack economic incentives to fix leaky
equipment that could contaminate water or soil.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   At the embargo's peak, crude oil imports dropped by 17 percent.
The 38-cent average price for gasoline jumped to 54 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, a governor who three years later would be elected
president, asked Georgia's state employes to save electricity by
using the stairs instead of the elevators at work.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans heeded Nixon's pleas to turn down their
home and office thermostats to 68 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines conserved jet fuel by packing more passengers onto
fewer flights. They overbooked so heavily that when consumer
advocate Ralph Nader was bumped, a federal district judge ordered
the airline to pay him $25,100.

<P>
   The big neon signs in front of motels blinked off. Nixon parked
Air Force One and caught a commercial flight to his home in
California. That year, the lights on the national Christmas tree
erected outside the White House each December were kept turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices stayed up, and Israel reached a truce with Syria and
Egypt. Missions accomplished, the Arabs halted their embargo in
March 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But many older Americans still suspect it was all a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what was going on,'' recalled Lee Ramsnyder, who
operated the Lan-Mar Marina on Georgia's Lake Lanier. ``I remember
hearing there was a secret supply in Louisiana or someplace like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We pumped most of our gas to boaters on weekends, and we kept
running out by Sunday afternoon,'' he said. ``I think maybe a lot
of it was done by the government to pull us out of a little
recession by making people back up a bit on fuel use and dig in.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ramsnyder rebuilds used tour buses, installs luxuries
ranging from stoves and showers to trash compactors, and then sells
the vehicles to entertainers and other travelers who don't care
that they only get about eight miles to the gallon.

   KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ There has never been so much available
oil, which is good news for motorists at gas pumps just about
everywhere -- but here.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices are dropping. So, nervous officials in this oil-rich
sheikhdom might raise the price of gasoline in their own land to
raise money for the government-sponsored lifestyle of free
health-care, full employment and air-conditioned comfort.
</P>
<P>
   High-priced gasoline would be a reversal of fortune for Kuwait.
It's oil reserves make up nearly one-tenth of the world's supply
and gushes up through drill holes to the desert surface without the
pumps needed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks odd and peculiar that, at a time when many countries
are cutting the prices at the gas stations, you're increasing it in
Kuwait,'' said Kuwaiti Oil Minister Saud Nasir Al-Sabah in a recent
interview with Cox News Service. ``That's absurd . . . I don't
think this is something that's acceptable to us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is still good here. Car dealerships are busy every night
and young Kuwaitis can still count on a job in the bloated
government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuwait and its oil-producing neighbors, from wealthy Saudi
Arabia to giant and volatile Iran, are struggling with the
ramifications of low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, the so-called Arab oil embargo shocked
the West. Attempting to keep the U.S. from backing Israel, these
countries threatened to cut oil supplies -- particularly to the
U.S., where frightened Americans rushed to line up their
gas-guzzling automobiles at pumps despite rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   The panic in the West brought a windfall in the Gulf, which
became awash in cash as well as oil. Big countries like Iran and
Iraq could bring their people modern social services, roads and
education. Small countries, like Kuwait, could luxuriate.
</P>
<P>
   It raised the gulf countries' world clout. Arabic became an
official language at the United Nations. The United States started
selling sophisticated military airplanes to the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   But, prompted by the higher prices, new competition in oil
production took off from Mexico to Russia. And, oil importers --
especially the United States -- found ways to conserve.
</P>
<P>
   Today, oil prices are about as low, adjusted for inflation, as
they were before the embargo in 1973. More oil is produced than
ever -- 73 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Persian Gulf oil exporters still sit on 65 percent of
the world's supply, it is losing value. The 11-member OPEC cartel
(including three nations outside the Mideast) will see revenues
drop by a third this year -- down about $40 billion. Since 1980,
the per capita income in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and three other
oil-producing monarchies has dropped by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A continued decline in oil prices could cause hard times here,
leading to radicalism -- or worse, instability -- even among
stalwart American allies like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kuwait has just 1.8 million inhabitants and nearly 10 percent
of the world's oil. But, Kuwaitis are edgy about the soundness of a
system that provides free health-care, subsidized utilities and
charges no income or sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More vulnerable is Saudi Arabia, with about 18 million people.
It is also cutting back benefits -- like the low-income housing
loans for newlyweds -- while trying to calm a restless minority of
have-nots and religious fundamentalists. Unemployment is rising.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More volatile still is Iran. A regional giant with 68 million
people, Iran's government deficit and economic recession could
undercut nascent steps toward detente with the West.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Iraq is another story. Its oil production has been limited by
economic sanctions and industrial disrepair following the Persian
Gulf War. But, should things improve -- and Russia and China have
their way -- its production will kick into gear and add to the oil
glut.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Zalmay Khalilzad, director for Strategic Studies at the Rand
Corp., warns that the United States is still dependent on Persian
Gulf oil supplies. If Americans want low prices, he said, they may
have to be ready to help quell the resulting unrest in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The oil producers tend to make the problem worse. Most have
refused to make tough cuts in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gulf countries, unfortunately, are still dreaming that the
welfare state will last forever,'' said Kuwaiti political scientist
Shamlan al-Essa(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they just try to raise money by pumping and selling
more oil. That lowers the price even more.
</P>
<P>
   Far from controlling the market, OPEC members now are struggling
just to keep their organization together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole situation is very different than it was in the
past,'' Al Sabah said. ``We have to be extremely careful about
mixing oil and politics.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Think of the world's major oil powers and the first
images likely to come to mind are of Persian Gulf sheikdoms or the
sun-baked Texas plains.
</P>
<P>
   Think vodka and snow, too.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable portion of the world's future oil and natural gas
supplies will come from Russia and other former Soviet republics,
if Western oil companies can get to it.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Soviet Union seven years ago sparked the
last great oil boom of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Oil giants like Exxon, Amoco, Mobil, Shell, Texaco and British
Petroleum are investing billions of dollars across the continent to
tap oil and gas fields from the Siberian tundra of Russia to the
arid Central Asian plains of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be here and ready with this kind money if it
wasn't worth it,'' said Alexander Ordjonikidze of the Sakhalin
Energy Investment Company, a consortium of Shell, Marathon and
several Japanese partners that is set to begin offshore production
next year off Russia's far east coast.
</P>
<P>
   Worthwhile maybe, but it is far from easy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is the world's second largest energy supplier; it
produces more natural gas than any country in the world and is
third behind Saudi Arabia and the United States in quantities of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   But its teetering economy and aging production facilities have
left its status as an oil and gas giant in a sorry state, pumping
about half the levels it did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Western oil companies have touted themselves as the solution to
Russia's problem -- with partnerships to help Russia extract its
oil and get it to market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet frustrated oil companies have run up against a snarl of
bureaucracy, unfavorable tax conditions and changing terms of the
production deals by Russian partners who want a bigger stake. With
Russia's economy now in crisis and its market reformers on the
political outs, conditions are not expected to improve soon.
</P>
<P>
   Flat world oil prices and a threat of global recession have
further eliminated the urgency and eagerness to push ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Caspian Sea on Russia's southern fringe, billions of
dollars in deals are going forward in a region with the largest new
oil finds in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   It is hailed as the next great Middle East, and the Caspian Sea
basin -- including the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and the breakaway Russian republic
Chechnya -- could be just that.
</P>
<P>
   The region combines the lucrative and dangerous elements of oil,
political unrest and geopolitical implications as the United
States, Russia and Iran vie for influence there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cliche about the former Soviet Union is it is a place with
lots of problems and lots of opportunities. The problems may now
look bigger than they did two or three years ago, but the oil is
still here,'' said Stephen O'Sullivan, an oil and gas industry
analyst in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the Caspian prizes is the Tengiz oil field in
Kazakhstan. Tengiz potentially could produce more than 1 million
barrels a day -- more than the current yield of Alaska's Prudhoe
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But how to get the oil from the Caspian basin to market has been
a source of diplomatic frustration and intrigue. Russia, Iran and
the United States have differing alternatives for pipelines to the
West.
</P>
<P>
   In the far east, an estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil and 400
billion cubic meters of natural gas lie under the waters around
Sakhalin Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Sakhalin consortium so far has spent $1 billion and is
prepared to spend ten times that to fully develop its offshore
fields. But it is stalled by the Russian parliament's refusal to
approve legislation on a production-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma, the lower house of parliament, is dominated by
Communists and die-hard nationalist parties suspicious of the West
and reluctant to share Russia's resources with big oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the allure of Russia is fading. Countries in Latin America
and Asia, whose economies also need foreign investment, have begun
to woo the oil companies. Even Saudi Arabia, which nationalized its
oil interests in the 1970s, is making overtures to Western
companies to buy a stake there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Western oil companies take a very long view in
Russia, but they've begun to direct their attentions elsewhere,''
said O'Sullivan. ``They won't leave completely. But they may be
content to allow the oil to stay in the ground another five, 10 or
20 years longer.''

 &HT;    ANDREW YOUNG: ``NO SIGN OF RELIGIOUS REPRESSION'' IN CHINA
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 600 words.
 &HT;    With photos of Young speaking at a Chinese church in the
International folder on the Cox Server.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The Rev. Andrew Young and five other American church
leaders gave China a cautious accolade on Wednesday for allowing
the growth of relatively free worship for 10 million officially
recognized Chinese Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found no sign of religious repression,'' Young said as a
delegation of ministers from the U.S.-based National Council of
Churches of Christ finished its six-day visit. ``Did we find
religious freedom in the U.S. sense? No. But we found no religious
repression nor active persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusations that China is broadly intolerant of religion are
``distorted'' and ignore the ``vital, recognized and unrecognized
public Christian community alive in China,'' added the Rev. Albert
Pennybacker, the council's director for public policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of campaign, if you think that's not tied to the
political campaign of the ultra-rightist people in Congress, then
you're naive about what is at stake here,'' Pennybacker said.
</P>
<P>
   The six delegation members acknowledged that in some instances
Chinese local officials have acted against Christian believers,
especially those in ``charismatic'' religious sects that seem
``eccentric'' by Chinese norms.
</P>
<P>
   Young, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and the
others made no comment on human rights in general, on the
government's treatment of more than 4 million Chinese Catholics, or
on the religious situation in Tibet, which they did not visit.
</P>
<P>
   The group attended both an authorized Protestant church and
unregistered ``house church,'' talked to Protestant pastors and
parishioners in Shanghai, Nanjing and Beijing, and met with
government officials. Their mission, according to a National
Council of Churches news release, was ``to look at the current
status of church-state relations in China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Chinese officials) would not say there are not incidents
that were problematic, clashes between governmental officials and
religious officials,'' Young said in an interview with the Cox News
Service. ``What they insisted is that there is no government policy
to persecute the church.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation met Wednesday with Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, who ranks
number four in China's ruling communist party politburo.
</P>
<P>
   A report on Chinese state television quoted Li as telling the
visitors that although ``the Chinese Communists are atheists,'' the
Chinese government believes that ``religious freedom is a
fundamental right of the people.'' Li was reported as saying that
it was ``groundless'' to believe that ``once religious freedom is
promoted, atheism will be abandoned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans' objective was partly to explain to Chinese
leaders the new Religious Persecution Act passed this month by the
U.S. Congress, which authorizes American diplomatic and economic
sanctions against nations that practice religious persecution. The
bill is now on President Bill Clinton's desk awaiting signature.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers said they believe such sanctions against China
would end up hurting Chinese Christians, who would be viewed as
aligned with a foreign force hostile to China. The National Council
of Churches ultimately endorsed the Senate's version of the
legislation after working to make its sanction-triggering mechanism
less rigid. But Young said he personally believes President Clinton
should veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Atlanta, where I've lived most of my life, I can't say
that there's not a single religious person that's not running afoul
of governmental policy,'' said Young, the president-elect of the
council of churches. ``In fact, we've closed lots of churches and
we've run lots of people off.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese law requires that churches, as with other social
organizations, register with the communist government. The state
also restricts religious education, proselytizing and ties with any
religious entity outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   There are periodic reports of unregistered preachers being
detained, meeting places closed or unauthorized shrines shuttered.
However, both the unregistered groups and the authorized churches
that abide by government rules have seen strong growth in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest state-church clash, the French news agency Agence
France Press reported on Wednesday that a Catholic priest working
for an underground church had been detained for the last two
months. Citing the Connecticut-based Cardinal Kung Foundation,
which monitors Catholic religious affairs in China, the French
agency said that the Rev. Wei Jingkum was taken away by police on
August 15 while celebrating mass in Nansong, 60 miles southwest of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Young and other delegation members said the most important
aspect of China's religious situation is that the number of
believers is rising.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Campbell, general secretary of the National
Council of Churches, said she would tell Americans: ``The church is
alive and well in China. People are praying, people are coming to
know Jesus. Thousands of people are coming into churches. People
are taking communion. Babies are being baptized. And we can be
grateful to God for that.''

   ``ACTOR STANLEY TUCCI IS AN IMPOSTOR!'' From W magazine. One
color slide. ``As soon as somebody says, `Don't do it the way you
want to,' I say, `See you later,''' actor Stanley Tucci explains in
his mellifluous voice that helped make him so creepily convincing
as suspected murderer Richard Cross on television's ``Murder One.''
Cross isn't the only villain on Tucci's resume. The 38-year-old
actor's parts have ranged from various Italian heavies to the
dogcatcher in ``Beethoven,'' Demi More's husband in
``Deconstructing Harry'' and an assassin in ``The Pelican Brief.''
In this interview from W magazine, Tucci talks about his latest two
starring roles _ in the film ``The Impostors,'' a shipboard farce,
and in HBO's ``Winchell,'' in which he portrays the legendary
gossip columnist Walter Winchell.

   ``ACTOR STANLEY TUCCI IS AN IMPOSTOR!'' From W magazine. One
color slide. ``As soon as somebody says, `Don't do it the way you
want to,' I say, `See you later,''' actor Stanley Tucci explains in
his mellifluous voice that helped make him so creepily convincing
as suspected murderer Richard Cross on television's ``Murder One.''
Cross isn't the only villain on Tucci's resume. The 38-year-old
actor's parts have ranged from various Italian heavies to the
dogcatcher in ``Beethoven,'' Demi More's husband in
``Deconstructing Harry'' and an assassin in ``The Pelican Brief.''
In this interview from W magazine, Tucci talks about his latest two
starring roles _ in the film ``The Impostors,'' a shipboard farce,
and in HBO's ``Winchell,'' in which he portrays the legendary
gossip columnist Walter Winchell.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As the evidence has mounted against President Clinton, I
believed that he would resign in shame and in the best interests of
our country. But it is now obvious that Clinton will not
voluntarily resign.
 &HT;    Impeachment proceedings will drag on for months and preoccupy
our nation to the detriment of ourselves and the world.
 &HT;    Our attention should be focused on a global economy that is
crumbling and could melt down and on a number of unstable military
situations, from Korea to India to Pakistan to Kosovo. Aside from
the alarming international scene, domestic problems such as health
care, social security and education must be solved.
 &HT;    Our nation, which has been a source of stability and good
throughout the world, cannot be leaderless at such a crucial time _
and yet we are.
 &HT;    President Gerald Ford's recommendation that Clinton be publicly
rebuked in the well of the House of Representatives is not the
answer. It would only further diminish Clinton's effectiveness at a
time when we need a strong, respected president _ not a man whose
reputation has been totally destroyed by an embarrassing public
rebuke on the House floor.
 &HT;    By now, Clinton has been reduced to attending political
fund-raisers and making endless phone calls to friends seeking
their advice on his pitiful personal crisis.
 &HT;    More than 180 newspapers have called for Clinton to resign. Many
have editorialized that his inexcusable actions in the Oval Office
threaten to seriously erode the integrity of the nation and damage
the standards, morals and ethics of our young people.
 &HT;    History teaches us that for any free society to survive and
thrive it must rest on a strong moral and ethical base. The issue
is not, ``Did he lie under oath?'' The issue is, ``Did he lie?''
And the answer is yes.
 &HT;    Clinton has taught our children to lie. Clinton has taught our
nation that a man does not have to be faithful to his wife and
family and can repeatedly devastate them by his irresponsible
actions. Clinton has taught our students in high school and college
that anything goes in their sexual behavior.
 &HT;    No wonder at least seven Boy Scouts in Utah who won Eagle awards
for observing the oath of honor and duty to God, country and self _
the highest commendation boys age 11 to 17 can earn _ refused their
certificates with Clinton's signature as honorary president of the
Boy Scouts of America.
 &HT;    Our children learn the words of our first president, George
Washington, who said, ``I cannot tell a lie.'' Two hundred years
later we have a president, Bill Clinton, who cannot tell the truth.
 &HT;    Any person who observes Clinton's behavior _ ranging from
intelligent to clever to wildly reckless and juvenile _ can only
conclude that he is emotionally unstable. And he shows a complete
inability to learn from the ill-chosen experiences of his youth,
from promiscuity to ``experimentation'' with drugs to evading the
draft.
 &HT;    Again and again, as a married adult, he has taken advantage of
women _ whether it's Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky
or others whose names are not in the public record. He has earned
their disrespect and destroyed their lives. Any business executive,
high school principal or police chief who repeatedly lied and had
sex with an employee would be fired.
 &HT;    Why should we accept a lower standard from Clinton, who as
president is charged with life-and-death responsibilities?
 &HT;    Any member of the military who lies will be court-martialed,
without regard to whether he was under oath. Any military person
who is involved in sexual harassment or adultery will be
court-martialed.
 &HT;    Clinton, as commander in chief, surely must be held to these
same standards. He has the ability to order our precious sons and
daughters off to war to fight and die. Yet the motivation, wisdom
and rationality of his judgment are highly debatable in matters of
domestic and foreign policy.
 &HT;    Clinton has lied to the people he loves the most and he has
repeatedly devastated them _ his immediate family and closest
colleagues and friends _ and yet the pattern persists. He is
willing to inflict serious long-term damage on the Democratic
Party, our nation and millions of people throughout the world just
to stay in power.
 &HT;    As a young man campaigning for Congress in Arkansas in 1974,
Clinton repeatedly included references to President Richard Nixon's
predicament. ``I think it's plain that (Nixon) should resign and
spare the country the agony of this impeachment and removal
proceeding,'' Clinton said, according to the Arkansas Democrat on
Aug. 6, 1974. ``There's not any point now in (Nixon) putting the
country through an impeachment since he isn't making any pretense
of innocence now,'' Clinton said, according to the Little Rock
Gazette on Aug. 8, 1974.
 &HT;    After making these demands on Nixon, why doesn't Clinton hold
himself to the same standard of accountability and resign?
 &HT;    Clinton doesn't understand duty, honor, country or faith,
courage, service or truth _ and honor beyond all. He certainly does
not understand the Navy's ethic: ``When principle is involved, be
deaf to expediency.''
 &HT;    We cannot take the privileges and freedom we have in this great
nation for granted. We, the people, must be the guardians at the
gate.

EXECUTION RULING ANOTHER BLOW TO THE 9TH CIRCUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE MILETICH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By quickly brushing aside a stay of execution in the case of
Washington state convicted murderer Jeremy Sagastegui, the U.S.
Supreme Court revived its longstanding battle with the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals on the issue of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sagastegui, 27, was put to death by lethal injection at the
Washington State Penitentiary at Walla Walla at 12:43 a.m. Tuesday,
hours after the Supreme Court cleared the way for the execution of
the triple murderer.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court lifted the stay a day after it was granted.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, it sent yet another pointed message that it takes a
dim view of the nation's largest appeals court intervening at the
last minute in what the justices have previously described as the
``sovereign power'' of states to punish death-row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   With its emphatic 7-2 decision Monday night, the Supreme Court
added to the tensions that have existed with the lower court since
1992, when the justices, in an all-night frenzy of bicoastal
dueling, lifted four last-minute stays granted to Robert Harris,
the first person executed in California in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The two courts also have skirmished over a broader range of
legal issues in recent years, leading to an unusually high reversal
rate of 9th Circuit decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the 28-member appeals court has been branded as too
liberal and California-dominated, although that tag doesn't always
neatly fit.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996-97 term, the Supreme Court reversed 28 of 29
cases it accepted from the 9th Circuit, compared with a two-thirds
reversal rate for all cases. In the 1997-98 term, 14 of 17 cases
from the 9th Circuit were reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many think the Supreme Court has been gunning for the 9th
Circuit in recent years,'' said Laurie Levenson, a law professor at
Loyola University in Los Angeles. ``The Supreme Court has stepped
in in an unusual number of cases with the 9th Circuit, including
death-penalty matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in Congress, including Sen. Slade Gorton,
R.-Wash, have repeatedly urged that the circuit be divided.
</P>
<P>
   But a commission appointed by Congress to study the issue fell
short of recommending that course, when it suggested last week that
the circuit, which now covers nine Western states and two Pacific
territories, be split into three geographical divisions, with a
central body to resolve conflicting decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The stay granted in Sagastegui's case marked the first time the
9th Circuit has granted a last-minute reprieve to a death-row
inmate in Washington since the state resumed executions in 1993
after a 30-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   In the two previous executions, Charles Campbell didn't seek a
last-minute stay before his 1994 execution, although the 9th
Circuit was criticized for the time it took examining his initial
appeals, and Westley Allan Dodd eschewed federal appeals before he
was hanged in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The stay in Sagastegui's case was granted by Judges David
Thompson and Stephen Reinhardt in a 2-1 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt, an outspoken liberal and death-penalty foe appointed
by President Carter, attacked the high court four days after the
Harris execution, condemning the justices for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court has made it plain that constitutional principles are
no longer its primary concern,'' Reinhardt said in an address at
the Yale Law School. ``What matters to the overwhelming majority of
this court is not whether an individual was convicted in an
unconstitutional manner or will be executed in an unconstitutional
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   His role in Sagastegui's case almost certainly was noted by the
Supreme Court, which has reversed a large number cases of all types
in which Reinhardt has participated or written the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reinhardt is more liberal than anyone on the Supreme Court,''
said Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University of
Southern California. ``On the other hand, he is a careful and
meticulous judge.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Thompson, an appointee of President Reagan, who wrote
the comprehensive, 34-page opinion that the Supreme Court, without
comment, overturned. A third 9th Circuit judge, Andrew Kleinfeld,
who was appointed by President Bush, dissented in the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thompson is sort of a conservative, moderate Republican,''
Chemerinsky said. ``So you can't just say this is the liberal Judge
Reinhardt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a majority on the current (Supreme) court
that wants to see stays of execution only in extraordinary
instances,'' Chemerinsky added.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit, with headquarters in San Francisco, has
jurisdiction over cases from Montana, California, Arizona, Nevada,
Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and the Northern
Mariana Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panels on the 9th Circuit are randomly chosen by
a computer program, which matches judges so they sit with each
other an equal number of times over a given period. Currently, the
pool consists of 22 judges because of six vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt and Thompson agreed to a last-minute stay in
Sagastegui's case after finding that his mother had raised
substantial questions about her son's mental competency to waive
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys asked the Supreme Court to lift the stay,
arguing Sagastegui's mother had no standing to bring an appeal on
his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The two Supreme Court justices who agreed that a stay was
appropriate were Stephen Breyer and John Paul Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   But their slim minority stance reflected the court's growing
hostility to death-penalty appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the court issued what was widely viewed as a clear
message to the federal appellate courts when it overturned a 9th
Circuit decision and cleared the way for California to execute
Thomas Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   The court rebuked the 9th Circuit for intervening in the case
two days before Thompson was to die in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute reprieve, after 13 years of unsuccessful
appeals, was a ``grave abuse of discretion,'' Justice Anthony
Kennedy said in a 5-4 ruling that he read from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, the state must be allowed to exercise its
sovereign power to punish offenders,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   During oral arguments in the case, Justice Antonin Scalia called
the 9th Circuit's handling of the matter ``unseemly,'' suggesting
that the reprieve was a deliberate attempt to skirt limits placed
on death-penalty appeals by Congress and the high court.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader range of cases, the justices have overturned 9th
Circuit rulings that declared a constitutional right to
doctor-assisted suicide and that upheld local records checks under
the Brady gun law. In the 1996-97 term, the court reversed nine
cases, including two favoring abortion rights, without even holding
a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But the 9th Circuit's liberal label couldn't be automatically
applied in those cases, because nearly half of the overturned
decisions were written by Republican appointees, who make up about
half the court's judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the cutting edge of a lot of cases,'' Chief Judge
Proctor Hug Jr. said at the time. ``If a ruling creates a lot of
heat, that's why we have life tenure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hug has said it would be unwise to break up the circuit, but
Kennedy, who once served on the 9th Circuit, has supported the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say a three-judge panel can represent one-fifth of the
people in the United States puts an undue burden'' on the circuit,
Kennedy said.

MINIMUM-WAGE MEASURE IS ALSO ABOUT VALUES AND BELIEFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington state Initiative 688 would raise the state minimum
wage to $5.70 next year, $6.50 in 2000, then index it. It's a hot
issue, and only partly of economics. It is mostly about values and
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   So let's get the economics out of the way. The statistical
effects of a minimum wage are clear enough. A lot of people get a
small raise and a few people lose their jobs. At the relatively low
levels at which the minimum wage has typically been set, a 10
percent increase will cut teenage employment by about 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest Policy Center at the University of Washington did
the classic study. It looked at the state minimum wage hikes in
1989 and 1990. Back then, the economy was at a peak, wages were
rising and a recession was just around the corner. In other words,
it was much like today.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what resulted. The law raised the wages of 6 percent of
workers in Washington, about 110,000 people. A similar number
enjoyed raises to keep them above those being paid the minimum.
About 0.3 percent of the total work force, 5,400 people in 1989 and
6,300 in 1990, lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Some prices went up. Some profits went down. By 1990, 25 percent
of employers had become fussier in screening job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty was little affected. Low-wage workers are in families at
all income levels. Said the report, ``the proportion of low-wage
households living in poverty continued to be substantially the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   This year Oregon has posted a minimum of $6, the highest in the
nation. No study has been done, but its state economist, Paul
Warner, says the increase has had ``some small negative effect on
employment, and a small positive effect on wages and income.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Seattle area, demand has been pushing wages above the
$5.15 federal minimum. Starting pay at company-owned McDonald's in
Washington ranges from $5.40 to $6.50. Wages are higher in Bellevue
than in Tacoma because ``the demand for labor is higher,'' says
human resources manager Will Lew.
</P>
<P>
   Dick's Drive-Ins just raised its starting pay from $6.75 to $7.
</P>
<P>
   The market, however, tends to raise wages only where economic
conditions demand it. Advocates of the minimum wage want it
universal. They typically argue, ``No one should get less than X.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in fairness,'' says Liz Pierini, president of the
League of Women Voters. ``If you work full-time, you shouldn't live
in poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an argument to base wages on need. It is not a principle
of the market, but of social work.
</P>
<P>
   Need depends on how many mouths one has to feed. Supporters of
I-688 focus on the group with the greatest needs. A $6.50 minimum
puts a single mother with two kids barely above the poverty line,
says John Burbank, executive director of Seattle's Economic
Opportunity Institute. (And what's needed to get mothers off
welfare, Pierini says, is a wage of $8.)
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of I-688 focus their argument on teenagers, the group
with the least needs. ``The minimum wage was never meant to be a
living wage,'' says Russ Goodman of the Washington Restaurant
Association. It's a training wage that allows employers to try out
someone new.
</P>
<P>
   Real life has examples of all of the above. I-688 applies to
teenagers (29 percent of those affected), single parents with kids
(8 percent), part-timers (54 percent), people in families living on
less than $10,000 per year (18 percent) and in families earning
$60,000-plus per year (17 percent). It applies to farm workers, new
immigrants and inmates out of prison. It applies indoors and out,
to an immense variety of work.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will see this issue through his own values and
experience. My first newspaper job was for a wage of zero. I wrote
stories, but was just a kind of volunteer. My employer, a sickly
tabloid called the Daily Commercial News, evaded the minimum wage
law by never hiring me. If they had had to pay it, I would have
been out on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Did I undercut myself? Well, I'm the one to judge that. If I
agree to work for nothing, or ten cents per hour, I may be foolish.
I may undercut someone else's bargaining power. But it is my right,
if my labor belongs to me.
</P>
<P>
   A job is a transaction between me and an employer. The voters
are not a part of it. They don't know my needs, my employer's
needs, or the value of the work I am to do. They are not competent
to set my wages.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what the U.S. Supreme Court decided 75 years ago.
Alas, the court changed its mind during the New Deal, and ever
since, wages in burger joints, movie theaters and tabloid
newspapers have become matters of public policy. But the argument
goes on, and it is never solely about economics.

SEASONING IS KEY TO GOOD BARBECUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Barbecue aficionados will tell you the secret is
in the seasoning, not the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a pre-dinner rubdown, or just a good rub. The end result
is the same.
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of herbs and spices rubbed into beef, pork, poultry
and seafood creates bursts of flavor in the finished product,
whether it's grilled, baked or stir-fried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a good rub is very important. You want spices that
complement the meat,'' said Carolyn Wells, executive director of
the Kansas City Barbecue Society. ``This is something the experts
have been using for years that the rest of the world hasn't heard
of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the new deal for backyard cookers,'' added Wells, whose
society serves as a national clearinghouse and sanctioner of
barbecue cook-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared rubs are available in supermarkets and specialty food
shops. Paul Prudhomme's name appears on some Cajun and Creole
spices, for example.
</P>
<P>
   There is one prepared rub that does more than merely season,
though. It goes by the name Char Crust, and is the only rub I've
found that actually coats the meat, sealing in the juices while
adding a new layer to the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Char Crust comes in five flavors (original hickory grilled,
hickory and molasses, roasted garlic peppercorn, smoky spicy
southwest and roto roast). The roto roast would be better with less
paprika, and anyone concerned about sodium would be wise to proceed
with caution because all five flavors are plenty salty.
</P>
<P>
   The original and roto roast flavors were created in the 1950s
for a Chicago steakhouse, and today are used by a number of
restaurants. The roasted garlic peppercorn and smoke spicy
southwest debuted during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Char Crust, like most store-bought rubs, is probably as easy to
make at home as it is to apply. But precious time is saved by
having the rub sitting in a box in your pantry, waiting to be
applied. A 3.5-ounce box of Char Crust (sells for $3.95 through
Char Crust, 800-311-9884, or through the nationally distributed
catalog Grill &AMP; Gourmet, 800-664-1994) will thoroughly coat a dozen
large split-backed chicken breasts.
</P>
<P>
   I was introduced to Char Crust this summer at the International
Fancy Food Show in New York. The Char Crust booth was a popular
spot, with patrons returning for more than one helping of sliced
pork loin grilled with the hickory and molasses seasoning coating
the meat.
</P>
<P>
   I have experimented with all five flavors in the past few
months, and have found that the best way to use Char Crust is
baking. (I still haven't tried stir-frying with it.)
</P>
<P>
   On a hot grill, the seasoning tends to blacken and become too
crusty. But in the oven, the Char Crust takes effect in a slower
fashion, forming a thin coat that seals in juices.

GUNS REMAIN A TRUMP CARD IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gerry Adams had just flown in from Pittsburgh on
a plane about the size of a Honda Civic. It was late afternoon. He
hadn't slept much, and he hadn't eaten since the day before.
</P>
<P>
   And there he was, sitting in the seat just in front of me
Tuesday in a van roaring into downtown Albany from the airport, and
I was bugging him about guns and bombs. I wanted to know what it
would take for him to agree to a mechanism and a timetable to
dispose of the Irish Republican Army's weapons. It was not a
question he cared for.
</P>
<P>
   I was saying, ``The weapons were not among the details worked
out in the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA,
glared at me through his wire-rimmed glasses. ``No, that's not part
of the agreement,'' he said. ``I negotiated it. I do know what's in
the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, so you negotiated it. But what about the weapons?''
</P>
<P>
   Adams danced for a while, but he finally answered. Look, he
said, the weapons aren't being used now, are they? And you can give
up your weapons on a Thursday and buy new ones on a Friday, so what
does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   The Unionists _ those who support British rule in Northern
Ireland _, he insisted, are just using this business with the
weapons as an excuse to avoid further negotiation. Other items
demand to be addressed _ the question of who'll police Northern
Ireland, and how, and getting all the prisoners out from behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   It was, from all reports, a rare touch of testiness from a
politician famous for his controlled restraint. He has been shot
and imprisoned. His home has been the target of rocket attacks.
Until just the past year or so, he slept in a different safe house
every night.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Adams has been the cool, patient negotiator _ an
ex-bartender with the look and manner of a professor of the
classics, tall and thin and bearded and bespectacled. And, three
centuries-plus after the British conquered Ireland at the Battle of
the Boyne, ready to do whatever it takes to ride history's wave.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Albany once before _ a bit more than three years ago,
before that wave had begun to crest. The U.S. government had let
him in on a 48-hour visa, reluctantly and over British protests
that America was welcoming a terrorist. Here in Albany, Adams was
warmly greeted by politicians who knew that this metro area, the
nation's 52nd in size, was contributing more money to Adams' cause
than anyplace else in the country except New York City and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the deal in April _ the Good Friday Agreement, it's
called. It was arrived at under pressure on the Unionists from
President Clinton and Tony Blair, the British prime minister.
Amazingly, after three-quarters of a century of bloodshed over
anti-Catholic discrimination and the partition of Ireland's six
northern counties, lasting peace might actually be at hand.
</P>
<P>
   And now the dour, thoughtful Adams has been transformed into the
Irish Huey Newton, the fashionable rebel of the 1990s _ just as
Newton and Eldridge Cleaver and their leather-clad Black Panthers
were the radical chic heroes of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood stars crowd around Adams at fund-raisers. Donald Trump
greets him lavishly. And yesterday, Albany politicians were more
gracious to him than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jennings, the mayor of Albany, greeted Adams at the
airport and stuck to him like flypaper all through his visit. Gov.
George Pataki descended from his fortress on the second floor of
the Capitol to greet Adams at the Omni Hotel _ and to remind the
crowd at a $100-a-head Sinn Fein fund-raiser that he had an
Irish-born grandmother named Agnes Lynch, who'd experienced the
anti-Catholic discrimination that Adams has fought against for so
long and with such resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Adams did television interviews and thanked both the ``murr''
and the ``gahv-ner.'' And collected the check, of course. That was
the main purpose of this trip. In Ireland, as in America, it takes
money to run a political organization _ not to mention an army.
And, pound for pound, nobody in this country has raised money for
the cause like the local Sinn Fein fund-raiser, a suburban Albany
insurance man named Paul Murray, who was telling me 15 years ago
that some of it probably went for guns, and that was awful, but it
was necessary, too.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of those guns, Adams hemmed and hawed all through that
ride into town. But he seems likely, eventually, to make a deal
about them _ if, that is, the Unionists will embrace a schedule for
unloading their own weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   After the Good Friday agreement, Adams' opposite number on the
Unionist side, David Trimble, needs a deal to stay in power. Except
for the inconvenience of the relentless IRA murders and bombings,
the Unionists liked things pretty much as they were before Trimble
made that deal to share power with the Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   If Trimble goes, he could be replaced by a foaming loon like the
Rev. Ian K. Paisley, who refers to the pope as ``an impostor and a
blasphemer and a liar.'' And, in his more subdued moments, as ``the
anti-Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   A Paisley would never deal with any man who accepts Catholic
dogma. He would do everything in his power to reduce the Good
Friday agreement to confetti. So Adams will deal, all right, but
he'll squeeze Trimble a bit more before he gives in. Sure, Trimble
has a constituency that needs pleasing, but so does Adams. And, for
Adams and his republicans, the weapons and the willingness to use
them have always been the hole card. Without them, Adams has said
repeatedly, Northern Ireland's Catholics would still be on their
knees.
</P>
<P>
   Also, just as Trimble has his crazies, so does Adams. They must
be placated while the dealing goes on. And each side still feels
the need to rattle their crazies like sabers as they negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, each side's crazies will have to be dealt with, or
there'll be no lasting deal, no peace, no end to the killing, no
united Ireland. Everybody knows that, and the crazies will be
handled _ as gently or as violently as the circumstance requires.
</P>
<P>
   But not now. Not just yet. Not at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, for each side, the crazies and their guns and
their bombs and their blood lust are still too useful.

NATURE'S BEAUTY OFFERS TONIC FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR

   SANTA CRUZ, Calif. _ It's been almost a year since I was
diagnosed with breast cancer. As I glanced at my kitchen calendar
the other morning, already filling up with plans and commitments,
the date jumped out at me. That square seemed larger than any of
the others on the page. The number seemed to pulsate.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, after navigating the holidays, wet weather, surgery
and two months of daily radiation, I was tired. I felt depleted.
Vulnerable. I noticed I felt more comfortable curled up in bed with
a book, or watching television, than visiting with people. I no
longer knew the art of making small talk.
</P>
<P>
   After the rainy season finally ended, my daughter Kira's class
at school began organizing its spring camp at Yosemite National
Park. Husband Michael volunteered to go along. They would be gone a
week. I could spend some time by myself. They could spend some time
away from me. We all would benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievably, I had never been to Yosemite. I was born and grew
up in Northern California, but somehow never made the trip. The
images of the crowds always put me off. Camping has never been one
of my favorite pastimes. But at the end of their week, when they
got home with their stories and their rolls of film, I was envious.
</P>
<P>
   Get us a reservation for a long weekend, Michael said. You'll
love it.
</P>
<P>
   The first available weekend was in five months. I grabbed it.
Put it on the calendar. Went on about my business.
</P>
<P>
   Our Yosemite weekend finally arrived. We packed up the car,
dropped Kira off at friends. Took our dog Moka to the kennel, and
we were off.
</P>
<P>
   This was our first weekend alone since I got sick. We didn't
even turn on the radio. We talked. We gazed out the windows. We
stopped for coffee and scones. It didn't matter to me where we were
going or if we ever got there. It was simply grand to be on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   I watched as the landscape changed from valley to foothills. I
smelled the pines as we climbed in elevation. We wound along the
Merced River. A lone fisherman stood under the shade of an oak,
casting his line. As we entered the park, I was amazed at the fall
colors. The reds and yellows of the dogwoods and birch. The indigo
sky. And rounding a bend, the cool granite of El Capitan.
</P>
<P>
   I was beginning to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, Michael kept telling me. There's more.
</P>
<P>
   We drove through the valley and back out again heading toward
Wawona. A sign on the left read: Glacier Point, 16 miles. We turned
off and drove though the woods. The air was as crisp as fall
apples.
</P>
<P>
   I was unprepared. Nothing anyone could have said would have been
adequate. As we came around the corner, there it was. Half Dome.
</P>
<P>
   We pulled off the road and parked. There was a small clearing
and an outcropping of rocks. Michael and I climbed out onto the
smooth granite ledge. I sat down and leaned back. It was so
beautiful, I had to remind myself to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was shining on the back side of the dome, highlighting
the smooth, round curve. The face of it was in shadow, accentuating
its cold, flat surface.
</P>
<P>
   The valley lay before us. The deep gouge where the glacier cut
its path was just to the left. But my gaze kept returning to the
huge granite monument. As the sun rotated, light began to pour over
the sheared off portion of the dome, exposing the crevices. The web
of scars. Imperfections that add to the beauty. That tell a story.
</P>
<P>
   I leaned back against Michael and experienced a perfect moment
in time.
</P>
<P>
   After everything _ floods, storms, avalanches and glaciers _
Half Dome is still here.
</P>
<P>
   And so am I.

SPIRITUAL LEADERS TAKE ON THE DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For three days they met in San Francisco to help
one another learn to better swim against a powerful tide. Like the
rest of the nation, more than 70 percent of Californians support
the death penalty. But the swimmers _ 150 religious leaders from
around the state _ know the majority can be wrong. They believe
capital punishment threatens the very soul of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capital punishment is an absolutely crazy idea,'' said Rabbi
Alan Lew of Congregation Beth Sholom in San Francisco. ``It's a
spiritual impossibility and a cruel hoax that is sold to the
families of victims. They are so vulnerable, the easiest thing to
sell them is anger. It's the biggest disservice we do to them. It
guarantees them a life of pain. The only possible healing comes
through forgiveness. The hard choice is the only one that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Lew met recently with other rabbis and with Catholic and
Episcopalian bishops, priests and nuns; ministers of several
Protestant and the Unitarian faiths and Buddhist, Muslim and Quaker
leaders. In ``Changing Hearts and Minds'' workshops and forums, the
group shared their ancient and sacred teachings against capital
punishment, heard from the families of murder victims and plotted
practical strategies for turning the tide against state-sanctioned
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The ``first-ever interfaith campaign against the death
penalty,'' the conference produced a Statement of Conscience, which
reads in part: ``We believe that the death penalty is morally
untenable, particularly when we have the means necessary to protect
ourselves from those who would kill.''
</P>
<P>
   The means referred to are ``life imprisonment without the
possibility of parole and restitution to the family of the
victim.''
</P>
<P>
   While most religions are based on a reverence for life, what now
prompts the formation of California People of Faith Working Against
the Death Penalty?
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the lopsided public opinion polls in favor of the
death penalty, group members point to pending state legislation
that would expand the number of crimes that are punishable by death
and clear the way for the execution of juveniles. Perhaps most
disturbing of all is the implementation of the 1996 federal
Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which mandates a
much shorter time for the appeals process and could create by next
year a virtual ``execution mill'' that would rapidly kill some 200
of California's 512 death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred percent of death row inmates are impoverished _ if
you have enough money, you don't get the death penalty _ and about
one-third don't have any legal representation at all,'' said Lance
Lindsey of Death Penalty Focus of California. ``The one-year time
limit (for appeals) is going to have a backlash, and we will have
the prospect of living with routine and almost invisible
executions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a prospect is intolerable for the women and men who
attended last week's conference. While the United States stands
alone among industrialized nations in its zeal for capital
punishment, and despite anti-death penalty pleas from the United
Nations and the American Bar Association, the bulk of the country's
politicians are in love with capital punishment. Thus, coalition
members are concentrating on a different arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen this issue politicized in recent years and
spiritual concerns pushed to the side,'' said Wilson Riles Jr., of
the Quaker-based American Friends Service Committee. ``Our campaign
will not be aimed at politicians, but at the people who elect
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides reacquainting many of those people with the basic tenets
of their professed faiths, coalition members want to raise public
awareness of how ``the language of rehabilitation is being lost''
in the American penal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our God seeks to restore the human soul by redemption,'' said
Rebecca Parker, president of Starr King Unitarian Theological
School. ``Capital punishment does not accomplish justice, bring
closure, heal or end the cycle of violence. It is the product of a
passive, weak, reactionary justice system. And capital punishment
diminishes the soul of the person who seeks retribution.''

DEMOCRATS SAY GOP CANDIDATE MISREPRESENTS COURT RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Mary Donohue, the Republican candidate for
lieutenant governor, touts herself in advertisements as a former
prosecutor who put criminals in jail, and as a former judge who
kept them there.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 17 months that Donohue served as a New York Supreme
Court justice, she never once sentenced anyone to jail and never
once presided over a criminal case, according to state Office of
Court Administration records.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue did, however, reject a series of routine habeas corpus
motions, attempts by incarcerated criminals to get out of prison on
the grounds that their confinement is illegal. The motions are
rejected by judges with rubber-stamp regularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There they go again,'' said Sandra Frankel, the Democratic
candidate for lieutenant governor. Donohue ``misrepresented
herself.'' Frankel said the Republicans have a history of
exaggerating their criminal justice accomplishments, and noted that
despite claims by Gov. George Pataki that crime is down because of
his leadership, crime is actually on the increase in many upstate
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Long, campaign spokeswoman for Donohue, said the
advertisements are accurate and appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mary was a judge she had murderers and other violent
criminals come before her in habeas corpus appeals in an effort to
be released from prison, and denied their requests,'' Long said.
``So, she kept violent criminals in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue, of Brunswick, was elected to a 14-year term as a state
Supreme Court justice in 1996 but resigned last May to run for
lieutenant governor on the Republican ticket with Pataki. In an ad,
titled ``Mary,'' released last week, Donohue says: ``As district
attorney I prosecuted violent criminals. And as a judge, I kept
them in prison and off the streets. ... New York is a safer place
to be because George Pataki is our governor.''
</P>
<P>
   In her brief tenure as a judge, Donohue primarily handled civil
cases and was never assigned a criminal term, according to state
records. Frankel said the new television advertisement falsely
leaves the impression that Donohue sentenced criminals to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a matter of trust, and when campaign ads are misleading
or distorted ... it raises serious questions about ethics,''
Frankel said.
</P>
<P>
   As a prosecutor, Donohue did indeed personally prosecute several
violent felony cases and her office boasted a conviction rate of 98
percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, many of those convictions stemmed from plea bargains,
even though as a candidate for Rensselaer County district attorney
in 1992 Donohue promised ``no more plea bargains.'' After unseating
incumbent Democrat Louis Catone and taking office as that county's
top law enforcement officer, Donohue plea-bargained scores of
cases, including several involving the sexual abuse of a child.
Virtually every district attorney plea-bargains criminal cases.

WOMEN AGAIN ASKING FOR IMPLANTS; SALINE TOUTED AS SAFER THAN
SILICONE GEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Refiling for those needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLIFFORD PUGH  
 c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A few years ago, Houston cosmetic surgeon Dr. Henry
Mentz rarely met a patient who wanted breast implants. Instead,
many women with silicone-gel implants were clamoring to have them
removed amid reports they might be unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   But now, his office is swamped with women who are lining up for
the surgery _ this time for saline implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're obsessed, but American women like to
have bigger breasts,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgeons nationwide are reporting the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite continued health concerns about the safety of implants
and an ongoing debate about what constitutes feminine beauty, a
growing number of women are again opting for cosmetic surgery to
enlarge their breasts.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons
reports that the number of breast-implant procedures has soared
nationwide nearly 40 percent in the past two years to more than
122,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   The figures rival peak levels of eight years ago, when breast
augmentation was the No. 1 form of cosmetic surgery in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Many women say they are opting for the procedure because it
makes them feel better about themselves. They see implants as just
another way to enhance their appearance, like dying their hair or
wearing makeup.
</P>
<P>
   One Houston socialite who has appeared on the Houston
Chronicle's Best Dressed list says she had implants about a year
ago in order to fit better into the body-conscious styles that are
the rage in stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally had no desire to be real large. I didn't want to
go out and be dancing at Rick's. I just wanted to fill out my
clothes a little more,'' she says. ``Now I have a lot more freedom
when I go shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stacy Thompkins lost weight during the past year, her
breasts decreased in size, along with her self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   So about six months ago, the 28-year-old interior designer had
breast-augmentation surgery that boosted her from a 34B to a 34D
cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what a difference it's made in my appearance,''
she says. ``People just treat you differently. I hate to say it,
but it's true. A lot more doors open for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompkins says she decided to undergo surgery after researching
the subject on the Internet and convincing herself that the surgery
was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends tried to talk me out of it, but once I had
it done, now they want to do it,'' she says. ``I guess it's sad in
a way, but that's the way our society is. I had the means to better
myself, so I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such testimonials, some experts suspect the resurgence
in the procedure and other types of cosmetic surgery is based more
on the unrelenting pressures on women to conform to unrealistic
ideals than the drive for self-betterment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a whole issue of how we deal with aging,'' says
Patricia Yongue, associate professor of women's studies at the
University of Houston. ``Are we going to be allowed to grow old
naturally or are we going to be put under the gun to look like
Cher?''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, the Food and Drug Administration banned
silicone-gel implants amid growing concerns that the gel might leak
and trigger such auto-immune diseases as lupus and scleroderma.
</P>
<P>
   The number of breast-implant procedures plummeted from an
estimated 120,000-150,000 in 1990 to nearly 33,000 in 1992, the
year the FDA ban took place. Many women with the silicone-gel
implants had them removed and some opted for saline implants, which
were touted as a safer, more natural alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Franklin Rose, who built a large practice in the boom years
of the 1980s with a clientele that included models and topless
dancers, estimates he removed 1,000 pairs of silicone-gel implants
from frightened women after the FDA ban.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is again performing several breast-augmentation
surgeries every week. He usually works with saline implants,
although he occasionally uses silicone-gel implants in an
FDA-approved experimental program.
</P>
<P>
   He says his typical client is a thirtysomething mother who wants
to have her breasts restored to pre-pregnancy perkiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desire for an attractive breast goes back to antiquity,''
Rose says. ``Certainly our culture places a great importance on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts say that hasn't always been the case. During the
Middle Ages, the ideal breast was the size of a walnut, says
Lorraine Stock, an associate professor of English at the University
of Houston whose speciality is the study of medieval times.
</P>
<P>
   She points out that in the 1920s the ``flapper'' look was so
popular that busty women bound their breasts to fit into skimpy
chemise dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a specific mark of our particular time in history that
women have been convinced that large breasts are more feminine or
more womanly than small breasts,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Mentz, whose practice is performing five times more augmentation
procedures than two years ago, believes the numbers have
skyrocketed, in part, due to pent-up demand.
</P>
<P>
   He says women desiring bigger breasts held off from having the
surgery until they could gather more information about the safety
and durability of saline implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients are satisfied about the research that has been
done,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Saline implants have not been linked to health problems,
although scar tissue can harden around the implants in some cases
and cause discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   In some thin patients, the implant shell may wrinkle noticeably
under the skin. Some patients complain of reduced sensation in the
breast area after the surgery. As with any surgery, there is also
the risk of infection and complications from anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   Implants also can interfere with mammography and make it more
difficult to detect cancer in early stages, says Dr. Mark
Schusterman, a cosmetic surgeon who specialized in breast
reconstruction at University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston before going into private practice last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to tell (implant) patients that especially as they
approach 40, they need to have mammograms, and they need to be done
in a very specific manner,'' says Schusterman.``It's something
patients need to understand before they get involved with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But such drawbacks have not deterred women from flocking to the
procedure, which costs from $4,000 to $8,000 in Houston and is
usually not covered by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Some women who have received implants say they are surprised by
the increased attention they get.
</P>
<P>
   For several months before undergoing the surgery, a 39-year-old
Houston teacher wore falsies to determine if she could handle the
added scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of attention and the `babe factor,' it's much more
than I had ever imagined,'' she says. ``There's definitely big
power in big breasts.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery, in which saline implants were placed under the
pectoral muscle for a natural, realistic look, was so painful that
she could not open a refrigerator door for a month.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she is pleased with the outcome, although she is
sometimes bothered by some reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do find some men will speak to my breasts. They won't speak
to me, and that's pretty outrageous,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   One Houston woman who had her breast implants removed after
seven years says men noticed her when she had them, but for all the
wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I look back on it, I got a lot of attention from men
who ended up being not worth two seconds of my time,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really want a man who is going to give you attention
because your breast size is bigger?''
</P>
<P>
   She says she originally got implants because she was newly
divorced and felt terribly insecure. She later met a wonderful man
(now her husband) who asked her to consider removing the implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if you won't like me anymore?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could fall in love with you with those fake breasts, I
can learn to love you with natural breasts,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   After having the implants taken out, her breasts returned to
their natural shape within three months. She's happy with her real
breasts and can't imagine why she felt compelled to enhance them in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they're a little droopy, but they're real, and they're
natural, and they're proportional to my body,'' she says. ``I feel
so much more feminine without (implants).''
</P>
<P>
   There are some subtle signs that Hollywood image makers, who
have been accused of manufacturing an ideal of sexiness that no
woman could maintain, are changing their attitude about implants.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny McCarthy, the big-busted actress who shot to stardom on
MTV, advises young girls not to get breast implants. Hers just
``gave me something to make fun of,'' she told Redbook magazine,
adding she was contemplating having her implants removed.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Sally Kirkland recently underwent surgery to remove
breast implants that had given her problems for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many women look to celebrities as role models for their
appearance,'' she said. ``I don't want to feel responsible in any
way that I might be the cause of another woman getting implants and
having to suffer the way I have for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Such actresses as Meryl Streep, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kristin Scott
Thomas and Calista Flockhart of the TV hit ``Ally McBeal'' have
resisted the urge to ``go bigger'' and are models of class and
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the new role models, some observers believe there is
still tremendous pressure in our society to conform to a standard
of beauty defined by TV shows such as ``Baywatch,'' movies and
magazine covers featuring braless babes, and the models in
Victoria's Secret catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures may be especially acute in Texas, where in many
cases, bigger is considered better.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Texas trailed behind California and Florida in the
number of breast-implant procedures performed last year, but women
in the Lone Star state requested bigger implants than those in any
other state.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always been the case,'' says Dr. Jim Moore. ``I guess
it goes with big blonde hair and Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore says that the average size of an implant requested in
Texas is more than double that in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not my decision. I have women put on a leotard and put
breast implants in front and look in the mirror. They decide what
size they want to be. We honor that entirely,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Others attribute the bigger size, in part, to the fact that
implants were originally invented in Houston and are considered
more acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women like to be sexier here, and they see breasts as
part of their sexy look,'' says Dr. R. Scott Yarish, who does more
than twice as many breast-augmentation surgeries as a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women tell me they just want to fill out their clothes or
they want to be back to where they were before they had babies, but
I think it also involves a little bit of showmanship. Women are
flashier here than anyplace I've ever been. That's part of the
flash.''
</P>
<P>
   It also may be a cultural thing. Dr. German Newall, whose
practice includes patients from South America, Central America and
Mexico, says those patients are usually more concerned than U.S.
</P>
<P>
   women about appearing too big.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's blueprinted in the Latin American mind that big breasts
are not cosmetically appealing. It's the medium size they're aiming
for,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Newall performed breast reduction surgery on some
teen-age girls from Merida, Mexico, who were embarrassed about what
they considered to be large breasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us it would have been very attractive large breasts. For
them it was just monstrous,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When considering implant surgery, women should make sure the
surgeon is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and
have all the facts before making a decision, says Schusterman.
</P>
<P>
   When patients ask him if implants are safe, he replies,
``They're as safe as any other piece of plastic you want to implant
in your body.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that in 10 percent to 20 percent of cases, scar tissue
hardens around the implants to the point that additional surgery is
necessary to remove the tissue. In some cases, the area around the
implants may become infected and have to be taken out.
</P>
<P>
   The implants also need to be monitored by a doctor for as long
as the woman has them in her body, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is a bad option as long as women understand
what they're getting into,'' says Schusterman.
</P>
<P>
   He adds that 95 percent of women who have breast-implant surgery
nowadays are happy with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously a majority of women feel like it's a worthwhile
thing,'' he says. ``I wouldn't recommend my daughter having it
done. But if she wanted it, I'd guess I'd say, `Fine, if that's
what you want.'''

CALIFORNIA LOSING WILDERNESS AREAS DESPITE FEDERAL RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California has been losing 97 acres of
wilderness a day for the past 19 years, despite federal policies
enacted to preserve it, according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Decades of Destruction,'' released Tuesday by the
California Wilderness Coalition, is the first detailed study of the
state's 6.3 million acres of land not accessible by roadways since
a 1979 inventory conducted by the U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis-based group, which represents some 80 environmental
organizations, found in its report that logging, road construction
and off-road vehicle use have contributed to the decline of
California's wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the report concludes that the Forest Service's
response to President Clinton's 1997 directive to develop a policy
to manage remote national forest areas is inadequate as well as
unimplemented.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service's second Roadless Area Review and Evaluation
(RARE II) identified 372 areas in California totaling 6.3 million
acres. Of that total, 1,826,212 have been officially designated
wilderness, while 3,867,802 acres remain roadless but unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilderness Coalition's report focuses on 675,449 acres that
have been permanently lost and concludes that ``we cannot afford to
lose another acre.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern California was the biggest loser of potential
wilderness, 248,921 acres, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Modoc National Forest in the northeastern part of the state lost
53 percent of its roadless land _ a far greater percentage than any
other national forest.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilderness Coalition contends that the Forest Service's
proposed roadless-area management policy is inadequate because it:
</P>
<P>
   _ Exempts 1.25 million acres of potential wilderness in
California from a ban on road construction.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provides no protection for roadless areas not included in
uninventoried potential wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Does not apply to logging, off-road vehicle use or other forms
of development.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Forest Service spokesman Alan Polk said his agency had
received 65,000 public comments on the proposed policy and that
``we're finalizing the evaluation. We anticipate that there will be
an interim rule by the middle of next month.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the interim rule is on the books, ``we will be developing a
Forest Service transportation policy which will take us well into
the 21st century,'' Polk said.

EXECUTION RULING ANOTHER BLOW TO THE 9TH CIRCUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE MILETICH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By quickly brushing aside a stay of execution in the case of
Washington state convicted murderer Jeremy Sagastegui, the U.S.
Supreme Court revived its longstanding battle with the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals on the issue of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sagastegui, 27, was put to death by lethal injection at the
Washington State Penitentiary at Walla Walla at 12:43 a.m. Tuesday,
hours after the Supreme Court cleared the way for the execution of
the triple murderer.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court lifted the stay a day after it was granted.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, it sent yet another pointed message that it takes a
dim view of the nation's largest appeals court intervening at the
last minute in what the justices have previously described as the
``sovereign power'' of states to punish death-row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   With its emphatic 7-2 decision Monday night, the Supreme Court
added to the tensions that have existed with the lower court since
1992, when the justices, in an all-night frenzy of bicoastal
dueling, lifted four last-minute stays granted to Robert Harris,
the first person executed in California in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The two courts also have skirmished over a broader range of
legal issues in recent years, leading to an unusually high reversal
rate of 9th Circuit decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the 28-member appeals court has been branded as too
liberal and California-dominated, although that tag doesn't always
neatly fit.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996-97 term, the Supreme Court reversed 28 of 29
cases it accepted from the 9th Circuit, compared with a two-thirds
reversal rate for all cases. In the 1997-98 term, 14 of 17 cases
from the 9th Circuit were reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many think the Supreme Court has been gunning for the 9th
Circuit in recent years,'' said Laurie Levenson, a law professor at
Loyola University in Los Angeles. ``The Supreme Court has stepped
in in an unusual number of cases with the 9th Circuit, including
death-penalty matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in Congress, including Sen. Slade Gorton,
R.-Wash, have repeatedly urged that the circuit be divided.
</P>
<P>
   But a commission appointed by Congress to study the issue fell
short of recommending that course, when it suggested last week that
the circuit, which now covers nine Western states and two Pacific
territories, be split into three geographical divisions, with a
central body to resolve conflicting decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The stay granted in Sagastegui's case marked the first time the
9th Circuit has granted a last-minute reprieve to a death-row
inmate in Washington since the state resumed executions in 1993
after a 30-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   In the two previous executions, Charles Campbell didn't seek a
last-minute stay before his 1994 execution, although the 9th
Circuit was criticized for the time it took examining his initial
appeals, and Westley Allan Dodd eschewed federal appeals before he
was hanged in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The stay in Sagastegui's case was granted by Judges David
Thompson and Stephen Reinhardt in a 2-1 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt, an outspoken liberal and death-penalty foe appointed
by President Carter, attacked the high court four days after the
Harris execution, condemning the justices for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court has made it plain that constitutional principles are
no longer its primary concern,'' Reinhardt said in an address at
the Yale Law School. ``What matters to the overwhelming majority of
this court is not whether an individual was convicted in an
unconstitutional manner or will be executed in an unconstitutional
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   His role in Sagastegui's case almost certainly was noted by the
Supreme Court, which has reversed a large number cases of all types
in which Reinhardt has participated or written the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reinhardt is more liberal than anyone on the Supreme Court,''
said Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University of
Southern California. ``On the other hand, he is a careful and
meticulous judge.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Thompson, an appointee of President Reagan, who wrote
the comprehensive, 34-page opinion that the Supreme Court, without
comment, overturned. A third 9th Circuit judge, Andrew Kleinfeld,
who was appointed by President Bush, dissented in the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thompson is sort of a conservative, moderate Republican,''
Chemerinsky said. ``So you can't just say this is the liberal Judge
Reinhardt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a majority on the current (Supreme) court
that wants to see stays of execution only in extraordinary
instances,'' Chemerinsky added.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit, with headquarters in San Francisco, has
jurisdiction over cases from Montana, California, Arizona, Nevada,
Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and the Northern
Mariana Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panels on the 9th Circuit are randomly chosen by
a computer program, which matches judges so they sit with each
other an equal number of times over a given period. Currently, the
pool consists of 22 judges because of six vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt and Thompson agreed to a last-minute stay in
Sagastegui's case after finding that his mother had raised
substantial questions about her son's mental competency to waive
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys asked the Supreme Court to lift the stay,
arguing Sagastegui's mother had no standing to bring an appeal on
his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The two Supreme Court justices who agreed that a stay was
appropriate were Stephen Breyer and John Paul Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   But their slim minority stance reflected the court's growing
hostility to death-penalty appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the court issued what was widely viewed as a clear
message to the federal appellate courts when it overturned a 9th
Circuit decision and cleared the way for California to execute
Thomas Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   The court rebuked the 9th Circuit for intervening in the case
two days before Thompson was to die in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute reprieve, after 13 years of unsuccessful
appeals, was a ``grave abuse of discretion,'' Justice Anthony
Kennedy said in a 5-4 ruling that he read from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, the state must be allowed to exercise its
sovereign power to punish offenders,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   During oral arguments in the case, Justice Antonin Scalia called
the 9th Circuit's handling of the matter ``unseemly,'' suggesting
that the reprieve was a deliberate attempt to skirt limits placed
on death-penalty appeals by Congress and the high court.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader range of cases, the justices have overturned 9th
Circuit rulings that declared a constitutional right to
doctor-assisted suicide and that upheld local records checks under
the Brady gun law. In the 1996-97 term, the court reversed nine
cases, including two favoring abortion rights, without even holding
a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But the 9th Circuit's liberal label couldn't be automatically
applied in those cases, because nearly half of the overturned
decisions were written by Republican appointees, who make up about
half the court's judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the cutting edge of a lot of cases,'' Chief Judge
Proctor Hug Jr. said at the time. ``If a ruling creates a lot of
heat, that's why we have life tenure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hug has said it would be unwise to break up the circuit, but
Kennedy, who once served on the 9th Circuit, has supported the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say a three-judge panel can represent one-fifth of the
people in the United States puts an undue burden'' on the circuit,
Kennedy said.

MINIMUM-WAGE MEASURE IS ALSO ABOUT VALUES AND BELIEFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington state Initiative 688 would raise the state minimum
wage to $5.70 next year, $6.50 in 2000, then index it. It's a hot
issue, and only partly of economics. It is mostly about values and
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   So let's get the economics out of the way. The statistical
effects of a minimum wage are clear enough. A lot of people get a
small raise and a few people lose their jobs. At the relatively low
levels at which the minimum wage has typically been set, a 10
percent increase will cut teenage employment by about 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest Policy Center at the University of Washington did
the classic study. It looked at the state minimum wage hikes in
1989 and 1990. Back then, the economy was at a peak, wages were
rising and a recession was just around the corner. In other words,
it was much like today.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what resulted. The law raised the wages of 6 percent of
workers in Washington, about 110,000 people. A similar number
enjoyed raises to keep them above those being paid the minimum.
About 0.3 percent of the total work force, 5,400 people in 1989 and
6,300 in 1990, lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Some prices went up. Some profits went down. By 1990, 25 percent
of employers had become fussier in screening job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty was little affected. Low-wage workers are in families at
all income levels. Said the report, ``the proportion of low-wage
households living in poverty continued to be substantially the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   This year Oregon has posted a minimum of $6, the highest in the
nation. No study has been done, but its state economist, Paul
Warner, says the increase has had ``some small negative effect on
employment, and a small positive effect on wages and income.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Seattle area, demand has been pushing wages above the
$5.15 federal minimum. Starting pay at company-owned McDonald's in
Washington ranges from $5.40 to $6.50. Wages are higher in Bellevue
than in Tacoma because ``the demand for labor is higher,'' says
human resources manager Will Lew.
</P>
<P>
   Dick's Drive-Ins just raised its starting pay from $6.75 to $7.
</P>
<P>
   The market, however, tends to raise wages only where economic
conditions demand it. Advocates of the minimum wage want it
universal. They typically argue, ``No one should get less than X.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in fairness,'' says Liz Pierini, president of the
League of Women Voters. ``If you work full-time, you shouldn't live
in poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an argument to base wages on need. It is not a principle
of the market, but of social work.
</P>
<P>
   Need depends on how many mouths one has to feed. Supporters of
I-688 focus on the group with the greatest needs. A $6.50 minimum
puts a single mother with two kids barely above the poverty line,
says John Burbank, executive director of Seattle's Economic
Opportunity Institute. (And what's needed to get mothers off
welfare, Pierini says, is a wage of $8.)
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of I-688 focus their argument on teenagers, the group
with the least needs. ``The minimum wage was never meant to be a
living wage,'' says Russ Goodman of the Washington Restaurant
Association. It's a training wage that allows employers to try out
someone new.
</P>
<P>
   Real life has examples of all of the above. I-688 applies to
teenagers (29 percent of those affected), single parents with kids
(8 percent), part-timers (54 percent), people in families living on
less than $10,000 per year (18 percent) and in families earning
$60,000-plus per year (17 percent). It applies to farm workers, new
immigrants and inmates out of prison. It applies indoors and out,
to an immense variety of work.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will see this issue through his own values and
experience. My first newspaper job was for a wage of zero. I wrote
stories, but was just a kind of volunteer. My employer, a sickly
tabloid called the Daily Commercial News, evaded the minimum wage
law by never hiring me. If they had had to pay it, I would have
been out on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Did I undercut myself? Well, I'm the one to judge that. If I
agree to work for nothing, or ten cents per hour, I may be foolish.
I may undercut someone else's bargaining power. But it is my right,
if my labor belongs to me.
</P>
<P>
   A job is a transaction between me and an employer. The voters
are not a part of it. They don't know my needs, my employer's
needs, or the value of the work I am to do. They are not competent
to set my wages.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what the U.S. Supreme Court decided 75 years ago.
Alas, the court changed its mind during the New Deal, and ever
since, wages in burger joints, movie theaters and tabloid
newspapers have become matters of public policy. But the argument
goes on, and it is never solely about economics.

NURSING HOME EMPLOYEES GET A DAY OF RECOGNITION, HELP FOR SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They do not warrant our attention until one of their number is
arrested for theft or abuse.
</P>
<P>
   They do not merit our interest until one of our own is in need
of their care.
</P>
<P>
   But tonight, at the Park Plaza Hotel in Boston, hundreds of
celebrants will gather to honor the men and women who change the
sheets, serve the meals, and monitor the health of the 50,000
patients living in nursing homes in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion is the 10th annual dinner gala sponsored by the
Massachusetts Long Term Care Foundation to fund scholarships for
employees trying to make the leap from nurse's aide to practical
nurse, from practical nurse to nurse practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the kind of feats that attract the notice of the
Nobel Prize committee; they are the kind that remind us that hard
work and education are still the fuel that propels individual lives
forward in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lives like those of John Kungu, Jian Hua Liu, and Erin O'Connor,
three of this year's 88 scholarship recipients whose efforts to
balance work, school, and family have required no less a commitment
than that shown by the Nobel winners announced in Stockholm this
week.
</P>
<P>
   John Kungu lives in Chelsea. For the last three years, he has
worked as a licensed practical nurse at Bear Hill Nursing Center in
Stoneham. It was not his career choice when he emigrated from Kenya
eight years ago. Taken aback by the pace and complexity of American
life, he says it ``took a while to adjust to a culture and
traditions totally different'' from his own.
</P>
<P>
   A summer job at a nursing home convinced Kungu he had made a
false start by enrolling in a computer science program. ``I
realized how much I had to offer to fellow human beings in need,''
he says. ``Working with the elderly in the nursing home had found a
place in my heart. There was no turning back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, while working nights and weekends as a
nurse's aide in Stoneham, Kungu earned his certificate from Quincy
College as an LPN. Two years ago, he enrolled in the College of
Nursing at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. He will earn
his nursing degree as the century turns. ``This is something my
body agrees with,'' he says. ``This is something my hands love to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no false starts for Jian Hua Liu, only delays imposed
by what sometimes seemed an insurmountable language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   She had worked as a registered nurse in her native Beijing for
more than seven years before leaving China for the United States in
1989. Her training at Beijing Nursing School and her experience at
Beijing Geriatric &AMP; Research Center gave her the clinical skills to
nurse the frail and the aged, but her trouble speaking English
threatened to keep her at a nurse's aide position.
</P>
<P>
   As millions of immigrants have done before her, Jian Hua Liu
charted her future from a table in a public library. ``I had no
friends, no relatives, and no money,'' she recalls. ``I studied at
the Brookline Public Library every day after work. When I could
afford, I bought nursing books and studied them. I reaped the
benefits of my hard work when I became an RN in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   With scholarship assistance _ the Massachusetts Long Term Care
Foundation has awarded more than half a million dollars to more
than 300 nursing home employees in the last decade _ Jian Hua Liu
is less than a year away from earning an undergraduate degree in
nursing from UMass-Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``My long-term goal is to pursue a master's degree to become a
nurse practitioner in geriatrics,'' she says. ``I feel like I have
the knowledge. I have the heart. I want to help people.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Erin O'Connor. She has wanted to be a nurse as long as
she can remember. ``I was basically raised at Keith Hill Nursing
Home in Grafton, where my mother was employed as a registered nurse
for over 20 years until it closed in 1995,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember going to work with my mother to visit the
residents. I can remember brushing the ladies' hair, making them
look beautiful, and I can remember sitting with them for hours on
end listening to their stories.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor began working in the kitchen at the nursing home when
she was 16. Now 22, she is a nurse's aide at Beaumont Nursing Home
in Northbridge. Someday, she says, she hopes to be a registered
nurse like her mother but ``for right now, I just want to be an
LPN.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, when the crowd in the Imperial Ballroom salutes her
dream, O'Connor might just decide that someday is sooner than she
thinks.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    On Oct. 7 millions of people demonstrated in the streets of
Russian cities. Their protest was responsible, their behavior
moderate, with no sign of extremism.
 &HT;    The demonstrators' main demand was for the resignation of
President Yeltsin and early elections of both the president and the
State Duma. It was a clear verdict on the political regime and the
kind of ``shock'' reforms that the country has had to endure for
the past seven years.
 &HT;    Russia is at a dangerous threshold. The clock shows five minutes
to midnight.
 &HT;    Yet, observers noted, the government of Yevgeny Primakov was
spared the demonstrators' criticism. Primakov, his first deputy
Yuri Maslyukov and the new Central Bank president Viktor
Gerashchenko had not been eager for jobs in the Russian cabinet. In
fact, they took some time before deciding to come on board. That
they finally agreed to carry this burden in the present dire
circumstances is a credit to them. These people are capable of
giving priority to the national interests rather than the narrow
interest of those who have become fabulously and unjustifiably rich
during the years of pseudo-reforms.
 &HT;    The new government, however, has already come under criticism
from extreme free-marketeers in Russia and in the West. Primakov is
being accused of dragging his feet and of lacking a clear economic
program. There is concern that the team may backtrack from market
economics. Much is being made of their past, such as the fact that
Maslyukov was chairman of Gosplan, the Soviet Union's central
planning agency.
 &HT;    I must disagree with this rush to judgment. I know these men,
their views and their character. During the years of perestroika
they were firmly in favor of reforms.
 &HT;    In spring 1990, Maslyukov was ready to resign from Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov's government, accusing him of stalling on
much-needed change. Other members of the new cabinet have also
shown on many occasions their commitment to socially responsible
market economics and democracy.
 &HT;    It would certainly be too soon to demand that they produce an
elaborate, detailed program or far-reaching decisions on how to
advance reforms at the very moment they have to focus on how to
stabilize the overall situation and avoid total disaster. This
might require measures, some of which could resemble a return to
command economics. But don't rush to label the new government
``anti-reform.''
 &HT;    The steps that may be needed to take the situation in hand do
not mean that reforms are being abandoned. They are the price that
must be paid for the misguided policies of the recent past. If
chaos became total, any reforms would have to be written off and we
would see a very different government, an economic dictatorship.
 &HT;    During the time needed to put the real economy _ the production
of goods and services _ back on track, we shall need aid and loans.
Even more than aid, we shall need direct investment and cooperation
projects. After what happened here, creditors and investors are
understandably doubtful about dealing with Russia. I feel, however,
that Primakov and Gerashchenko will be able to persuade the world
that they are serious people and responsible partners.
 &HT;    So both the West and our own economic radicals would do well not
to push the new team. Do not scare people with the prospect of a
``return to communism.'' Russia has made an irrevocable choice.
Even the communists, the lunatic fringe excepted, are saying that
the clock cannot be turned back. So let us not panic; let us work
with quiet determination.
 &HT;    I am afraid, though, that the government could be dealt a blow
from an unexpected quarter, and where it is least protected. I am
afraid the president might try to meddle in the government's work.
Even worse, he could reshuffle it before it had a chance to make a
difference. I have reason to believe that Yeltsin's entourage is
already intriguing to make this happen.
 &HT;    The president should be reminded that such things have always
turned out badly, for himself as well as for the country. It would
be best for all of us if the president gave the Primakov government
a carte blanche _ and then called for early elections of president
and parliament.
 &HT;    Concerns about the results of early elections are, I believe,
exaggerated. The Russians will not support extremists or
irresponsible populists. Today, much more than before, there is a
good chance for the emergence of a coalition of moderate, centrist
forces capable of winning a majority in the Duma and fielding a
strong candidate for president. Tomorrow, that chance could
disappear.
 &HT;    Who that candidate would be depends in large part on the
``content'' of the presidency. I believe that the constitution
should be amended in order to allocate more power to the parliament
and the cabinet.
 &HT;    With a more reasonable balance of government powers, the
president would no longer be a monarch in democratic clothing, nor
would he be able to usurp power and paralyze the federal
government, as Yeltsin was able to do.
 &HT;    The president would become a true guardian of the constitution
and of the people's rights and freedoms _ the nation's moral and
political leader. Primakov could turn out to be just the right man
for this role.
 &HT;    The Cabinet of Ministers would then become the main body of the
executive branch of government. And, although the mayor of Moscow,
Yuri Luzhkov, has already declared his readiness to run for
president, I think that he is better suited for the role of prime
minister.
 &HT;    I urge our Western partners to analyze the political realignment
now under way in Russia without prejudging it and with a
willingness to help Russia. Objectively, Russia may now have a
chance to begin recovering, and gradually reemerge as a serious and
dependable international player.

LOOK FOR MOON OF MENINO TO GO TO BAT FOR PLANET HARSGBARGER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ann Kramer, who spent a lot of years hauling water for the
Republican Party as a state committee member before the past eight
years of GOP governors, knows how the election tides run along the
shoreline of Massachusetts politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the `prenatal' Democrats I worry about,'' she has said in
this space once already this fall. A look at the registration
figures, please: unenrolled (that's independents) 49 percent;
Democrat, 38; GOP 13. Barely one in eight voters registers
Republican. Half are independents, but Democrats still outnumber
registered Republicans by 3 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   The defection of the usual suspects among
Democrats-who-can-be-had to Acting Governor Paul Cellucci is not
surprising. Any governor has a grab bag full of goodies with which
to woo wooable Democrats, and a number of those succumbing to the
Guv's blandishments are lined up at the trough. Election Day means
Halloween to Democrats who agree to defect when the governor is
handing out the candy.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, in the throes of recession, the number of
independents first surpassed the Democrats. And it is crucial to
Cellucci's survival that he run strong in that segment of suburban,
mostly college-educated swing voters who preferred Bill Weld to
John Silber or Mark Roosevelt, the last two Democrats who failed to
clinch the sale with the unenrolled.
</P>
<P>
   For Scott Harshbarger to nose past the incumbent in what most
insiders expect will be an election settled by a single-digit
margin, the challenger must gain ground among independents. He has
19 days to do it. He's getting help from the biggest names in the
Democratic Party. Two Kennedys are on board, all the congressional
delegation, the leaders of both House and Senate (though we'll put
an asterisk next to Speaker Tom Finneran's endorsement) and,
expected this week, Mayor Tom Menino.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most popular mayor this century _ we didn't have
polls for pols in the first half, but approval ratings in the 80
percent range are astronomical _ Menino has so far kept Harshbarger
at arm's length, cool to the point of chilly. But the gravitational
pull of politics is expected to put the Moon of Menino closer to
Planet Harshbarger before this week is out. A lot of the party
regulars were initially cool to the independent-minded attorney
general, whose 16 years as a prosecutor (eight as Middlesex DA,
eight as AG) saw his office prosecute a lot of politicians or their
pals.
</P>
<P>
   For that he caught considerable grief. But for lack of skillful
self-promotion, Harshbarger has so far been denied the concomitant
lift among independents, who in theory would go for a guy who has
not shied away from taking on his party's insiders when they skated
close to the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way that Cellucci should be leading Harshbarger
among independents,'' said a prominent Bay State Democrat after a
recent Globe poll gave Cellucci the nod with the unenrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger needs a stronger debate showing than he managed in
his first encounter with Cellucci. The challenger has already
sharpened his criticism of Cellucci's personal debt, last estimated
at around $740,000, which is a whopping figure for a governor whose
salary is $90,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner's TV ads slam Harshbarger for being fiscally
irresponsible. On that score Cellucci is living in a house with
acres of windowpanes. It would make sense for the Democrats to
respond energetically to Cellucci's ``Harshbarger can't be
trusted'' ads with skeptical queries about how a guy who's been
governor or lieutenant governor for eight years has rung up
$740,000 in personal debts. Joe Malone kept asking.
</P>
<P>
   The Menino endorsement will be the final piece in the
endorsement mosiac for Harshbarger. How fervent will it be? A
Menino intimate phrased it this way: Menino went all-out for Ted
Kennedy and stiffed Roosevelt's losing 1994 bid for governor.
Menino went ``in-between'' for John Kerry, and that's about what
Harshbarger will get from Hizzonor: No prominent City Hall types
will waltz publicly with Cellucci; any Menino acolyte who wants to
work for Harshbarger will be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Even a halfhearted Menino endorsement will help. Right now, for
instance, there's a 20-phone union phone bank office in Brighton
that is not staffed full-time. When Menino formally embraces
Harshbarger, those phones should crank up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Finneran endorsement wouldn't mean much in terms of
bodies,'' said one shrewd elected official. ``But Menino brings
people to the table. Look what the Mayor did for Tom Reilly,'' who
defeated Lois Pines by 6 percent in a primary race for attorney
general where Menino's influence loomed large.
</P>
<P>
   In his methodical, sometimes mechanical manner, Harshbarger has
reassembled a Democratic campaign with all the major pieces,
centered around labor unions. Even Finneran, the conservative
Democrat who would not be speaker except for Republican votes in
the House, decided to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran is billed as the ``Annual Victory Banquet'' speaker of
the Christian Coalition of Massachusetts at Worcester the night
after the election, before an audience that takes a dim view of
Democratic politicians. That should be a pro-Cellucci crowd. But
given the pulling power of the not-always-in-harness Democratic
coalition, a Harshbarger victory could cast a pall over the
speeches. Those who swung in line behind Harshbarger will get a
shot at those jobs and contracts Cellucci's been spraying about. A
lot of ``prenatal'' Democrats want to be postelection job
recipients.

DUEL OF FAITH AND REASON RAGES STILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few people have so greatly influenced the moral arena of the
20th century, particularly in the &UR;  &LR; battle between faith and reason,
than Sigmund Freud and C.S. Lewis. With their luminous literary
gifts, Freud articulated a materialist, secular world view, while
Lewis countered with a spiritual framework.
</P>
<P>
   The debate between these two competing ideologies still rages.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pope John Paul II, concerned with what he views as the
exaltation of human reason without moral underpinnings, is soon
expected to release a major encyclical on faith and reason. Freud
and Lewis helped shape the divergent philosophical worlds the pope
is trying to reconcile.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are receiving heightened attention this year because
it is the 100th anniversary of Freud's founding of psychoanalysis
and the 100th anniversary of Lewis's birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freud's philosophical writings ... have played a significant
role in the secularization of our culture,'' Armand M. Nicholi,
associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical
School, said last week during a series of three lectures on Freud
and Lewis at Harvard's Memorial Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 17th Century, people turned to the discoveries of
astronomy to demonstrate what they considered the irreconcilable
conflict between science and faith; in the 18th century, (they
turned) to Newtonian physics; in the 19th century, to Darwin; and
in the 20th century, to Freud,'' said Nicholi, who teaches a
popular course on Lewis and Freud at Harvard College.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, on the other hand, who fascinates scholars because he
began his academic life as an avowed atheist, is ``perhaps the
century's most popular proponent of faith based on reason,''
Nicholi said. ``If Freud serves as a primary spokesman for the
materialist world view in this century, Lewis serves as a primary
spokesman for the specific world view Freud attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   In Freud's philosphical works, which Nicholi says are more
widely read than his research into human sexuality, the Austrian
intellectual divided the world into believers and nonbelievers.
</P>
<P>
   Freud clearly sided with the nonbelievers, claiming his view of
the world to be scientific because it rested on the premise that
knowledge could only come from the scientific method.
</P>
<P>
   Once he carved out this intellectual space, Nicholi said, Freud
appeared to have had an intense emotional need to attack the
religious world view, and did so in unequivocally strong terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says no intelligent person can accept the `absurdities' or
`fairy tales' of the religious world view,'' Nicholi said. ``He
writes that the doctrine that the `universe was created by a being
resembling a man, but magnified in every respect ... as an
idealized superman, reflects the gross ignorance of primitive
peoples.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for the world's great religions, Nicholi noted that Freud
said they ``must be classed among the mass delusions.'' Freud
referred to the teachings of Jesus as ``useless.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that the belief in God was simply a manifestation of
human beings' deep-seated wishes, born out of a sense of
helplessness, for a protector or a parent-like figure. ``Acording
to Freud, God does not create us in his image; we create God in our
image,'' Nicholi said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a giant among scholars at Oxford University whose books
still sell widely around the world, was well-versed in Freud's
arguments and stood ready to rebut every one.
</P>
<P>
   He counters ``Freud's wish-fulfillment argument with the
assertion that the Biblical world view involves a great deal of
despair and pain and is certainly not anything one would wish
for,'' Nicholi said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis strongly rejected Freud's promotion of the scientific
method. ``The scientific method simply cannot answer all questions,
cannot possibly be the source of all knowledge,'' Nicholi said,
quoting Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis came to Christianity slowly and uneasily. From early on,
Lewis said, he often experienced an intense longing, though he was
unsure for what. Later, at Oxford, Lewis realized that many of his
close friends and the great writers he admired had embraced some
type of spiritual view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewis writes that he began to feel his `Adversary' _ the one
he wanted desperately not to exist _ closing in on him,'' Nicholi
said. Finally, Lewis makes a dramatic decision to ``open his mind,
to examine the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, in a profound moment, Lewis came to God. Quoting
Lewis, Nicholi says: ```I gave in and admitted that God was God and
knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night the most dejected and
reluctant convert in all England.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Nicholi concluded in his final lecture Wednesday
night, it is possible that Freud and Lewis ``represent conflicting
parts of ourselves: A part ... that yearns for a relationship with
a source of love, joy, hope, and happiness, and another part that
raises its fist in defiance and rebelliousness and says with Freud,
`I will not surrender.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whichever part we choose, Nicholi said, not only determines the
``purpose and quality of our lives, but also our identity and our
destiny.''

POET LAUREATE SPEAKS IN FRANK PROSE ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When he first came to San Francisco, Lawrence
Ferlinghetti liked what he saw. He doesn't like what he sees now.
</P>
<P>
   At his inauguration as San Francisco's first Poet Laureate
Tuesday night, Ferlinghetti told a standing-room-only crowd in the
Main Library that San Francisco looked Mediterranean when he saw it
in the afternoon light _ ``A small, white city. I thought it was
Atlantis, rising from the sea, as beautiful as any place in all
Europa.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, in the 1950s, Ferlinghetti saw San Francisco as
``this far-out city on the left side of the world, a frontier for
the free poetic life.'' As co-founder of City Lights bookstore,
Ferlinghetti rolled up his sleeves to publish the works of beat
poets, including Allen Ginsberg, whose ``Howl'' was deemed obscene
by the San Francisco police in 1957, leading to arrests and
headlines in local papers like, ``Cops Don't Allow No Renaissance
Here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti, along with Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac and a host of
others, added to San Francisco's signature reputation as a haven
for the odd and loving, the ragged and laughing, teeming reapers of
the spoken word, the hoyden and the hungry and the working man. But
that was then, Ferlinghetti said. Things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that made this city so unique in the first place seems to
be going down the tube at an alarming rate,'' he told the audience.
He quoted from newspaper reports describing San Francisco as ``just
another American city, a corporate city.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is everywhere, Ferlinghetti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This past weekend North Beach looked like a theme park,
overrun by tourists. Kitsch was king. ... What's happening to North
Beach?''
</P>
<P>
   The car, for one thing, Ferlinghetti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being destroyed by the car culture,'' he said as he
urged the city to kill the Central Freeway project and ``give
bicycles and pedestrians absolute priority over automobiles.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as possible, he said, North Beach should be made into a
historic district, like the French Quarter in New Orleans, to keep
out chain stores, ``which are killing off the local color, the
local tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested a ``poets' cottage'' on Treasure Island or in
the Presidio as a site for readings and annual poetry festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti, 79, read a selection of his San Francisco works,
including ``A North Beach Scene,'' ``In Golden Gate Park that
Day,'' ``The Artist,'' ``I Saw One of Them'' and ``Baseball
Canto.''
</P>
<P>
   The readings were greeted with warm applause and more than one
``Bravo,'' with a standing ovation awaiting the end.
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti offered half a dozen suggestions to give San
Francisco new life, including closing downtown to cars, uncovering
the city's rivers and creeks to let them run free, ``painting the
Golden Gate Bridge golden,'' and ``tilting Coit Tower. Just half an
inch, that's all I'm asking. Look what it did for Pisa.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in truth, it may be too late to bring back the city he
knew, Ferlinghetti said. ``It sure seems like it is,'' he said as
he signed autographs following his presentation.
</P>
<P>
   What he's seeing, Ferlinghetti said, is ``a total gentrification
of this city'' with high rents.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from the affordable city he came to in the
50's, he said, ``a city that always seemed to me more like an
island, separate from all the other cities in America, mentally and
physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti first came to San Francisco, via New York and Paris
and points West, because he'd heard it was wine-raising country.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone who consumed red wine in the quantities as I did
back then, it was reason enough to see what was here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   HE said he came to love the place and loves it still, even as it
festers and bloats.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I refuse being Poet Laureate?'' he asked. ``San
Francisco has never conducted illegal wars against other peoples,
never dropped bombs on other countries, never subjected others to
the horrors they've had to live with in Nicaragua ... ''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the evening, Mayor Willie Brown offered a
proclamation in honor of the poet, saying the choice for Poet
Laureate was ``a no-brainer.''

CALIFORNIA LOSING WILDERNESS AREAS DESPITE FEDERAL RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Refiling for those needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California has been losing 97 acres of
wilderness a day for the past 19 years, despite federal policies
enacted to preserve it, according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Decades of Destruction,'' released Tuesday by the
California Wilderness Coalition, is the first detailed study of the
state's 6.3 million acres of land not accessible by roadways since
a 1979 inventory conducted by the U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis-based group, which represents some 80 environmental
organizations, found in its report that logging, road construction
and off-road vehicle use have contributed to the decline of
California's wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the report concludes that the Forest Service's
response to President Clinton's 1997 directive to develop a policy
to manage remote national forest areas is inadequate as well as
unimplemented.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service's second Roadless Area Review and Evaluation
(RARE II) identified 372 areas in California totaling 6.3 million
acres. Of that total, 1,826,212 have been officially designated
wilderness, while 3,867,802 acres remain roadless but unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilderness Coalition's report focuses on 675,449 acres that
have been permanently lost and concludes that ``we cannot afford to
lose another acre.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern California was the biggest loser of potential
wilderness, 248,921 acres, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Modoc National Forest in the northeastern part of the state lost
53 percent of its roadless land _ a far greater percentage than any
other national forest.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilderness Coalition contends that the Forest Service's
proposed roadless-area management policy is inadequate because it:
</P>
<P>
   _ Exempts 1.25 million acres of potential wilderness in
California from a ban on road construction.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provides no protection for roadless areas not included in
uninventoried potential wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Does not apply to logging, off-road vehicle use or other forms
of development.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Forest Service spokesman Alan Polk said his agency had
received 65,000 public comments on the proposed policy and that
``we're finalizing the evaluation. We anticipate that there will be
an interim rule by the middle of next month.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the interim rule is on the books, ``we will be developing a
Forest Service transportation policy which will take us well into
the 21st century,'' Polk said.

TIME FOR POLITICS TO TACKLE TRAFFIC SAFETY 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ This city, which not too many years ago was still an
overgrown town, has finally entered the fast lane, and its
residents are paying a price.
</P>
<P>
   The overall quality of life is still good, better than in many
other places, but one essential ingredient to everyday living _
transportation _ has become a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   People in Austin, of course, don't expect much sympathy from
people in Houston or Dallas, who have been living through traffic
nightmares most of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But Austin has outdone Houston, Dallas and every other major
city in Texas in one particularly unsettling, deadly statistic.
Austinites are killing themselves and each other on the city's
streets and freeways at a higher rate per capita than people in any
of the state's other metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Travis County, where Austin is located, led Texas' six largest
counties in traffic fatality rate for the second year in a row in
1997, according to a recent story in the Austin American-Statesman.
</P>
<P>
   Citing findings by the Trans Texas Alliance, a coalition of
transportation groups, the newspaper reported that Travis County
had 1.53 traffic deaths for every 10,000 people. Dallas County was
second with 1.29 fatalities per 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   While traffic fatalities were dropping 6.2 percent statewide in
1997, they were increasing 11 percent in Travis County.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem obviously is Austin's recent rapid growth,
fueled in large part by the high-tech boom and articles published
in national magazines a few years ago about the high quality of
life here.
</P>
<P>
   Subdivisions started mushrooming, especially in the hills west
of the city. And streets and freeways suddenly (or so it seemed)
became overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American-Statesman, about one-fourth of the
traffic deaths in the Austin area occur on Interstate 35. The
portion that goes through Travis County is one of the most heavily
used _ and deadliest _ stretches of freeway in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of police officers patrolling the streets and writing
tickets also may have contributed to the carnage. The Austin police
force fell more than 100 officers short of its authorized strength
last year, the Austin newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   But, getting to the nitty-gritty, police said unsafe speed and
alcohol or drug use were the main factors in 65 percent of Travis
County's traffic deaths last year.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a follow-up article, the American-Statesman reported
that tailgating _ or following the car in front of you too closely
_ was the most common factor in local accidents in which someone
was injured, but not killed.
</P>
<P>
   The more crowded the streets and freeways become, the more
difficult it is for many drivers to exercise common sense, it
seems. And it's not just an Austin problem. Even though traffic
fatalities dropped statewide last year, 3,508 men, women and
children still died on Texas roadways.
</P>
<P>
   During this pre-election season, we are hearing countless
political candidates promise to get tough on crime. That posture is
fine, but it's also a no-brainer, since there aren't many
constitutional ways left to toughen anti-crime laws in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, I am much more concerned about a member of my
family being the victim of an auto accident than I am about him or
her falling prey to a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, I think it would be a welcome change for politicians
to vow to tackle traffic safety. But, in reality, there's only so
much that government can do to force people to drive responsibly _
short of beefing up police patrols to the extent that most
taxpayers wouldn't want to pay for them, or lowering the highway
speed limit again, which most Texans probably would protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature in recent years has toughened some laws against
drunken driving, but not nearly to the extent that some other
states have done. Some tougher proposals, including a lower
driving-while-intoxicated standard, may be worth a look.
</P>
<P>
   Some safety and insurance experts, meanwhile, think Texas may be
too lenient with traffic offenders. They question, for example,
whether we should continue to wipe a traffic ticket off a driver's
record if he or she takes a defensive driving course. We may be
hiding future crash risks, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   Austin native Rick Gentry has a double perspective on his
hometown's and the state's traffic problems. One view comes from
his office on the I-35 frontage road. He sees at least one wreck a
week. One car landed three feet from his office wall.
</P>
<P>
   The other view is from his role as executive director of the
Texas Insurance Organization, which represents most of the auto
insurance companies operating in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry said studies have shown that the biggest deterrent to
driving poorly is fear of bodily injury. The second is fear that a
driver's insurance rates may be increased.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry is the expert. But some people _ judging from the way
they drive _ no longer seem worried about the first possibility,
much less the second. &QL;

CALIFORNIA SEN. BOXER FIGHTS OPPONENT'S BLANDNESS, MODERATION?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 bY MARTIN F. NOLAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Year of the Woman was then, not now, as
Barbara Boxer, battling for another Senate term, is discovering.
The feisty Democrat is also plagued by historical forces, including
California's fabulously short attention span.
</P>
<P>
   ``We differ on choice. We differ on guns. We differ on the
environment. We differ on campaign finance reform,'' Boxer, 57,
told television viewers in a Monday night debate against her
Republican opponent, state Treasurer Matt Fong. ``I have the
support of the Sacramento Bee and the San Francisco Examiner. He
has the support of Newt Gingrich and Oliver North.''
</P>
<P>
   On most issues, most Californians agree with Boxer, yet her
favorability quotient is shaky, in part because of what the Bee's
endorsing editorial called her: ``A high-profile, high-energy
politician with a bent for partisanship and self-promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   History underscores her plight. GOP control of Congress has kept
ambitious congressmen happily in the House and out of a primary
that Fong, 44, won with middle-of-the-road views. In '92, Boxer
narrowly defeated a far-right candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Californians, when they choose senators, eventually favor
blandness and moderation over fame and charisma. In 1964, voters
replaced White House spokesman Pierre Salinger with vaudevillean
hoofer George Murphy. In 1970, they rejected Murphy for John V.
Tunney, son of the former heavyweight champion. In 1976, Tunney was
KO'd by S.I. Hayakawa, noted linguist and scourge of campus
protests, who served six years. A synonym for ``high-profile,
high-energy'' politician is one-termer.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Alan Cranston lasted four famously bland terms in the
Senate, even longer than blandly moderate Thomas Kuchel, who lost a
Republican primary in 1968 to a zealous pamphleteer, Max Rafferty,
who then lost to Cranston.
</P>
<P>
   The governorship is more important to Californians than a Senate
seat. In Sacramento, after the tempestuous reigns of Ronald Reagan
and Jerry Brown, the electorate has spent the last 16 years
swimming in the tapioca sea of George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's race has also been complicated by her relationship to
President Clinton, whose brother-in-law is married to Boxer's
daughter. More anxiously than most Democrats, she declared that
``it is time to move on ... to the issues that the people care
about. I think that's where the American people are, that's where
Californians are. And that's where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong, an Air Force veteran, has learned how to target a sound
bite. When a panelist in Monday night's debate asked the senator
about her contrasting attitude toward Clinton and Republicans like
Bob Packwood, she claimed she was ``the second senator to speak out
on the floor of the Senate.'' Fong countered that she was not ``as
vitriolic'' about the ``shameful'' conduct of Clinton, whose
fund-raising help she welcomes, then said: ``Barbara Boxer, your
silence for that seven months is certainly deafening. But your
hypocrisy in the way you just presented yourself is
ear-splitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer needs a big turnout, prompting her to plead: ``The pundits
and the pollsters and some of the cynics say you're just not going
to vote. I don't believe that's true.'' Fong's closing statement
called her ``a divider, not a fighter for California.''
</P>
<P>
   Women voters outnumber men in this election, which pleases
Boxer. ``I was a soccer mom before there was a name soccer mom,''
she said after the debate. But since 1992, Boxer has not widened
her base of women and liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Demographics have diminished the importance of abortion, an
issue on which her opponent's beliefs coincide with an evolving
majority. Fong favors parental consent, opposes late-term abortion,
and ``respects'' a woman's right to choose ``in the first
trimester.'' Most ominous of all for Boxer's senatorial career,
polls suggest that Republican women now choose party over gender.

PLENTY OF TAKERS FOR AMATEURS GIVING FREE ADVICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ There was a time when free advice was considered to be
worth about what it cost, but now a pair of amateur gurus have
discovered a vein of humanity hungry for priceless counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every Sunday for the past three years, Roderick MacElwain
and Neal Caldwell have spread their blanket under a blue-and-white
striped canopy beside the bike path on the shores of White Rock
Lake and hung out their shingle: ``Free Advice.''
</P>
<P>
   They continue to be amazed by the number of takers.
</P>
<P>
   For several hours each weekend, the lost, the lovelorn, the
bewildered and the clueless pause for consultation, for tips on tax
deductions, mending frayed relationships, dealing with troublesome
neighbors or obnoxious bosses or replacing the grout in their
bathroom tile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a comedy act,'' says MacElwain. ``It is serious
stuff. Some guy suspects his wife is cheating ... that's a real
problem for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, MacElwain and Caldwell, both 47, were lounging
by the lake and, on a whim, wrote the words ``Free Advice'' on a
piece of cardboard and propped it against a water cooler. That day,
15 passers-by visited their clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be a one-time deal,'' Caldwell says. ``But
it became a real challenge. We were almost giddy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, they were sometimes greeted with sneers and
jeers. Occasionally, a motorist would make an obscene gesture or a
jogger would offer his own advice: ``Get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   But as they became fixtures by the lake, the hostility waned.
White Rock Lake is the Central Park of Dallas and, like New York's,
it is a placid refuge from the urban frenzy that surrounds it.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell and MacElwain say their weekend avocation plays to a
basic human need _ not just for guidance, but for affirmation and a
sense that someone cares about their problems. Often, a line forms
in the shade of a nearby oak and cars crowd into the small parking
lot 30 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   For four, five, seven hours _ whatever the weather allows and
the traffic demands _ the two men sit at their outpost at the base
of a knoll where H.L. Hunt built his Mount Vernon-style mansion and
they listen to the problems of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain community here that we're a part of,''
MacElwain says. Familiar faces smile as they pass. A police
helicopter circles overhead, as if to look in on them. At social
gatherings, strangers will approach them and say, ``Hey, I've seen
you at the lake.'' Some of their clients have become as familiar as
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has formal training in most of the areas about which
they are consulted (neither, though, does Ann Landers), but they
think they perform a service simply by listening and responding
with detached common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had lawyers stop by for advice,'' says MacElwain, a
self-employed financial consultant with an education in accounting,
finance and history. He also has devoted considerable time to the
study of dream analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Do they ever worry that they might give the wrong advice and
screw up somebody's life? Nah. Most people become preoccupied with
problems that do not carry such serious consequences, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Such as:
</P>
<P>
   A young woman who alights from her bike, approaches tentatively
and asks the two strangers what to do about her boyfriend, who
communicates in Cro-Magnon grunts and channel surfs like an
Adrenalin junkie. Slap him? Cancel his cable service? Might work,
but MacElwain and Caldwell suggest something less provocative. Talk
to him. Tell him how you feel. Help him to understand that the
relationship is threatened by his behavior. Problem solved. Maybe.
Next!
</P>
<P>
   A middle-age woman in tennis shoes believes her mother, who
lives in another state, has been scammed by a mortician. After
shelling out $12,000 to prepay her burial, the mother received a
contract from the funeral home with suspicious small print:
``Prices and terms subject to change at any time.'' Instead of that
satin-lined bronze box she selected, Mom could spend eternity in
fiberboard while the mortician demanded more money from her heirs.
</P>
<P>
   MacElwain and Caldwell suggest that she request a refund on the
grounds of unacceptable fine print. If that fails, she should
complain to the consumer protection division of the attorney
general's office in her mother's home state. Problem solved.
Definitely. The woman returned a few months later and showed them
the $12,000 refund check she had received on her mother's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tell them what they must do,'' Caldwell says. ``We
explore different ways of looking at their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We build a model,'' MacElwain adds, ``and give them some
options.''
</P>
<P>
   One young man asked their opinion of a career move he was
contemplating: giving up a reliable and well-paying job in Dallas
to go to Hollywood and try to become an actor. Caldwell, a wine
store manager and musician (he plays in local clubs with a band
called The Enablers) briefed him on the hardships and high
mortality rate of show business and suggested that he wait until he
had a day job and a roommate on the West Coast and enough money to
see him through some lean times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back a few months later,'' Caldwell says. ``He had
organized things as we suggested, and he was ready to make the
move.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of repeats,'' MacElwain says. ``Or people will
come by just to thank us. One woman baked a pie for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more than a hobby, but it certainly isn't a career. Where
does it go from here?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking of going on tour,'' MacElwain says. ``Does
Houston have a park like this?'' &QL;

POPULAR CAKE WALKS SPOTLIGHT HOLIDAYS, SCHOOL CARNIVALS

<P>
   Styles in cakes may come and go, but school carnival cake walks
and bake sales will always be with us.
</P>
<P>
   Cake walks date to at least the mid-19th century. In ``The
Dictionary of American Food and Drink'' (Hearst Books, 1994), John
F. Mariani describes the cake walk as an African-American pastime
in which participants strutted or danced fancifully to win the
prize of a cake. The date of 1840 is mentioned in ``American
Manners and Morals'' by Mary Cable (American Heritage Publishing,
1969).
</P>
<P>
   At early-day cake socials, cakes were sold to raise money for
charity. How the cake walk evolved into a musical-chairs activity
at schools and churches doesn't seem to be well documented, but it
has been popular, at least in the South, for several generations.
At the usual cake walk, people buy chances and walk around a
diagram of numbered squares. When the music stops, the person on
the square with the number of the prize cake wins. Numbers are
assigned at random by the cake committee.
</P>
<P>
   Another method is to give each participant a ticket. When the
music stops, a ticket number is read and the holder of the ticket
gets to choose a cake.
</P>
<P>
   Still another is to pick a chair with a number to sit in; when
the chairs are full, a number is called and the winner chooses a
cake. Sometimes, participants just draw a number out of a jar.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, Southern cake socials were graced by hand-beaten
pound cakes, lavishly frosted fruit- and nut-filled Lord and Lady
Baltimore and Lane cakes, feather-light white cakes with fluffy
frosting, and jelly and jam cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Many early cakes were based on dried and fresh fruit:
Tutti-Frutti Cake, Dried Apple Cake, Stack Cakes, Fig Preserves
Cake, Prune Cake, Date Cake, Pineapple and Apple Upside-Down Cakes,
and more recently, Fruit Cocktail Cake, Apple and Applesauce Cakes,
Pia Colada Cake and Hummingbird Cake.
</P>
<P>
   Such cakes hold scant appeal for today's cake-walkers, who
generally are kids. They go for chocolate with chocolate frosting
and/or miniature candy bars, colored sprinkles and other
decorations. Devil's food cake topped with Halloween symbols such
as ghosts and spiders or candies or frosting spider webs lure young
cake-walkers most.
</P>
<P>
   Many time-pressed parents buy cakes to donate from supermarkets
or bakeries. Because all the cakes are usually put out at one time
(or one batch in the morning, another in the afternoon), cakes must
be able to endure several hours outside, often in the heat. Cream
cheese, buttercream and more delicate frostings are not good
choices unless you can keep the cakes cool until it's time to bring
them out.
</P>
<P>
   It's better to decorate with powdered sugar, canned or packaged
frosting. Package or wrap cakes securely so they won't fall apart,
because they may be carried around for hours. The cake walk is most
popular near the end of the carnival, because the cakes can be
transported home immediately.
</P>
<P>
   At neighborhood schools a Cake Walk is part of the annual spring
festival. Cakes shaped like soccer balls, footballs, basketballs or
baseball caps are especially popular with boys. They also go for
cakes decorated or shaped like sports logos or the school mascot.
Plain chocolate, German Chocolate, strawberry and carrot cakes
appeal more to the grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Some cake-walk organizers prefer individual cakes, brownies and
cupcakes. Others say cupcakes are not as popular. Possibly that's
because plain cupcakes are more ordinary to the kids, and
individual items are harder to keep up with and sell.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets often sell three for $1, and each round on the cake walk
requires one ticket.
</P>
<P>
   At neighborhood Halloween carnivals, cupcakes and layer cakes
decorated with Halloween designs, coconut, confetti sprinkles and
miniature candies are money-makers.
</P>
<P>

LEAVE IT TO AN OPTIMIST AMERICAN DESIGNER TO BRING BACK SOME FUN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ In the bleakness that has come to characterize
much of fashion in the 1990s _ mussed hair, hideous makeup, dull
clothes and footwear only a storm trooper could love _ happy
moments are few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   Such a moment occurred here this week, bursting like a ray of
sunshine through the gray rain that has settled over this Italian
fashion capital during the showing of designer women's
ready-to-wear for spring 1999. Leave it up to an optimistic
American to bring back some fun.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ford's Gucci collection emanated some of the steaminess of
his past collections, characterized by dark colors and barely
veiled sexuality. It even took the edge off the downer tour of the
new Gucci store on Montenapoleone, where merchandise is displayed
in museum-like cases amid a don't-touch atmosphere and one of the
interesting accessories is a pair of silver Gucci handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Described by the designer as ``Las Vegas hippie,'' Ford's spring
collection is replete with flower-child prints, beaded embroidery
and appliqus. He took the dark trousers from fall, removed the
buckles and let the glittering embroidery fall where it would. Torn
jeans featured feathers and beading in African and American Indian
motifs. Black leather high moccasin boots had laces up the front
and leather fringe around the tops. Ford's family comes from Santa
Fe, N.M., by the way, and he maintains a home there.
</P>
<P>
   The fuchsias and blue of Ford's ruffled flower prints, teamed
with black leather, looked bright enough for former Rudi Gernreich
model Peggy Moffit, who was in the audience and still sporting her
signature bowl cut. But just in case, the designer threw in
handbags and little sling-back shoes with princess heels, pairing
two and three colors from a palette that included turquoise,
orange, fuchsia, sunflower yellow, beige and black.
</P>
<P>
   Another American, Lawrence Steele, revved up the Italian fashion
week with a presentation of Greco-Roman-inspired bare tops and
halter-neck dresses, wrapped and tied with thin leather thongs.
There were bias-cut white linen and white jersey dresses, the
latter backless to the waist.
</P>
<P>
   In a fit of fish-and-fowl inspiration, Steele deftly segued from
a skirt of pale yellow feathers to one of large yellow sequins,
layered like fish scales. Then he cut pale beige chiffon into
jillions of feather shapes, layering them onto the lightest of
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Narciso Rodriguez, an American of Cuban heritage, is another
innovator who has raised the bar for Italian designers. He
maintained the simplicity of his pieces and brought back the tube
toppers from his fall and winter collection.
</P>
<P>
   In shades of gray, silver, sea green, azure and white, Rodriguez
cut simple and sometimes complicated tops, skirts, dresses and
pants, then layered over them knit tubes such as soft corsets or
obi sashes. Khaki tops and pants were the casual end of a
collection whose evening pieces were of a silvery matelasse fabric
that has the effect of a rich screen.
</P>
<P>
   Byblos owner Donatella Girombelli, who replaced designer Richard
Tyler with the American John Bartlett, appears to have that line
back on track with lighthearted safari styles and modern basics.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett used iridescent khaki, crumpled silk organza and
lacquered tulle to lighten up what might have been an intellectual
collection, with asymmetrical wrapping and caftans and the
same-old-same-old epaulets and patch pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Byblos also showcased what looks like the sleeper color of the
season for Italian designers, a greenish yellow, not quite
chartreuse. Max Mara, the Italian house known for its fine
tailoring, significantly lightened its view of the contemporary
woman, setting off coffee brown and khakis with the Pernod
yellow-green, glimpsed through slits and on the insides of pleats.
</P>
<P>
   Long, slim shapes, even in flared skirts, tie-dyed sweaters and
chartreuse snakeskin, moved Max Mara a tad off its traditional
image of producing classics. There were even India-style mirror
embroideries, albeit on beige. Moss greens and bright yellows
softened safari styles, and slits on the sides of skirts ensured
comfort even while stalking summer in the city. But this line
proves again that hat-weather urban dressing can be as simple as a
white camisole worn over a pleated taupe linen skirt.
</P>
<P>
   The Salvatore Ferragamo company, mourning the death last week of
designer Fiamma Ferragamo after her long bout with cancer, bought
out a refreshing line totally focused on a Chinese theme. From
several weights of Mao jackets with frog closures worn over easy,
roomy and often cropped pants, Ferragamo moved on to silks printed
with numerous signature motifs. These were worked into tiny Mao
jackets, tops and the cropped pants, using a tightly controlled
palette of black, white, beige and a little Chinese red.
</P>
<P>
   What made all the black and white drawstring pants so palatable
at Ferragamo was the use of metallic fobs on the end of the strings
instead of traditional knots. With little white leather jackets in
the Ferragamo tradition, these simple pairings look fresh and
young.
</P>
<P>
   At Emporio Armani, the show was noticeably shortened and
choreographed, from the perfection of the tailoring to the posing
of the line's designers on stage with Armani at show's end.
</P>
<P>
   This Armani secondary line focuses on the woman who wants the
designer's signature tailoring at a lower price. For spring, the
line also loosens up, mixing sporty looks with traditional ones.
Sage grays, pewter, beige, golden yellow, aquamarine and coral, as
well as some brushstroke and graphic patterns, figure in the
designs. Jackets resemble cardigans or lengthen into dusters worn
over pants or dresses, and there are lots of vests and bustier
tops.
</P>
<P>
   For evening, Emporio women take to lightweight Indian trousers
worn under dresses whose prints are superimposed with floral
embroidery. While there are touches of India and of Italian
tailoring in this collection, the overall sensibility seems to be
one of Asian austerity and serenity.
</P>
<P>
   There was no serenity in the Blumarine collection sent out by
designer Anna Molinari. Pink, fuchsia, beads, flowers, pointelle
cashmere sweaters _ every girly trick was there, and know what? It
all looked great. From a pink floral embroidered bikini to all-over
beaded sheaths, the pink froth was fun. Molinari's customers can
even dress up in Mama looks, thanks to the portrait neckline
wrap-and-tie jackets, based loosely on the kimono. And if there's a
chill to the air conditioning, try Molinari's fur-trimmed cardigan
on for size.
</P>
<P>
   Some design houses delight in giving fashion the bird. Moschino
did it literally this season, sending out a great, black flying
finger hat on one model, along with a bevy of other witty and
sometimes wearable designs. Miuccia Prada, on the other hand,
merely turned her back on what others are doing.
</P>
<P>
   While the models were not meant to look unattractive, as
sometimes seems the case at avant-garde fashion houses, the designs
still left one wondering what kind of life any woman who wears
these clothes might have. Who would want to strap a great hulking
bag on her behind? Who would wear a full pleated skirt that looks
like a school uniform, or skirts whose fronts and backs dangled
with pieces of mirror _ not sewn in, like Indian embroidery, but
sticking out every which way?
</P>
<P>
   Fabrics that had been stiffened to look like paper, shoes like
golf moccasins, large origami-type floral appliques along the
bottoms of A-line skirts _ well, it was all a puzzle to many in the
audience. And the program notes didn't help. Written in
stream-of-consciousness (or unconsciousness) style, they spoke of a
``sporty Alice in Pradaland.'' It is doubtful that many women will
follow the fashion rabbit down this design hole come spring.
</P>
<P>
   While Prada is to be applauded for her efforts to decorate the
mundane and her experiments with high-tech fabrics, it must be
remembered that most women do not dress to look silly. Groupies do
that. &QL;

WHAT'S COOKIN' AT THE ARIZONA STATE FAIR?  
 (ADV: INCLUDES RECIPES AT END) 
</HEADLINE>
 FAIR-FOOD-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In many ways, the Homemaking Arts Building at the
Arizona State Fair can be seen as one of the last shrines to the
domestic arts and sciences. Superintendent Lani Auwen and her crew
of 15 tend the flames of creativity that burn here for 18 days each
year, starting this season on Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   A look behind the scenes of the Homemaking Arts Department
reveals that much has changed over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, a couple of women from St. Johns dominated the
canning category. Their husbands brought a pickup full of food to
the fair. One year, one of the ladies made an American flag quilt
composed of the hundreds of ribbons she had won through the years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, this old barrel-roof building is no longer the
exclusive territory of domestic goddesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a dramatic increase in men entering the cooking,''
Auwen said, noting that men now make up almost 40 percent of the
entrants in the canning and baking classes. ``Men really picked up
on canning this year. They do cookies and pies,'' but women still
dominate the cake category.
</P>
<P>
   At least three married couples are competing against each other
in this year's fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``One couple even has their own little wager on it, over who
will win the most,'' Auwen said. ``They said, `The fair's going to
settle it once and for all, who's the better cook.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Male cooks are passionate about their efforts, the homemaking
workers have observed. Last year, there was only one woman who
entered in the two special piemaking contests, Auwen said. The rest
were an extremely competitive group of guys. The dean of pie bakers
is Lowell Ebrite, who has been entering and winning pie contests
``forever,'' or as long as the longtime homemaking arts workers can
remember.
</P>
<P>
   The special contests are one way to represent foods that can't
be displayed for the entire fair run. This year's contests include
pasta, Dutch-oven cooking, ice-cream making, a cookie bake-off for
kids and a ``Spice Up Your Life'' contest for hot and spicy dishes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the constants in the homemaking arts is that
practitioners of cooking as well as handcrafts are pressed for
time, Auwen says. However, she has found that there is a lot of
closet crafting crammed into our days. She notices people knitting
and making other things in all sorts of situations.
</P>
<P>
   Craft skills used to be passed from mother to daughter. Now,
demonstrations are one way that craft interest is sparked and
traditions passed along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do see people wanting to do more with their hands,'' Auwen
said. ``The first reaction is, `Oh, that's too hard.' But they see
someone tatting, and they watch for a while, and they realize it's
not really that hard, but it does take time. And that's what we're
all pushed against. Time.''
</P>
<P>
   One newly popular craft is weaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have really extended our weaving'' categories, Auwen said.
``It's really been growing in the counties'' across the state.
``Some local community colleges have added weaving and spinning
classes.''
</P>
<P>
   The cross-stitch category has expanded greatly, too, and
dollmaking is more popular than ever.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the entire class of wool garments has been
eliminated in sewing, Auwen said. A few years ago, there were
enough entries for a wool fashion show. Last year, one wool skirt
was entered. Although Arizona still has a wool industry,
woolgrowers' wives no longer have time to put into their auxiliary,
Auwen said.
</P>
<P>
   Clubs in general have gone by the wayside. Two women's clubs
that used to submit about 500 entries a year from their members now
send in less than 100. In the seven years that Auwen has been the
superintendent, most of the members of one of the big clubs, the
Busy Bees, have passed away.
</P>
<P>
   The steady stream of contests and demonstrations in the
Homemaking Arts Building is how the keepers of the flames fan the
embers. Auwen constantly is gathering information on what the
public wants to see.
</P>
<P>
   People who enter the fair are asked what they would like to see
in the future. Many people have asked for a fresh salsa contest,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Among newer categories in food are sugar-free candies,
preserves, jams, jelly, marmalade and conserves, because people who
are diabetic have asked for these, Auwen said. A class added last
year was conserves, a mixture of several fruits cooked to a jamlike
consistency. Nuts are optional.
</P>
<P>
   Technology causes certain classes of items to wax and wane.
</P>
<P>
   Machine-made bread is now in the bakery cases; microwaved cakes
and cookies are eligible for judging.
</P>
<P>
   Categories are eliminated only when there have been no entries
for two or three years. Macrame was dropped only recently.
</P>
<P>
   One constant remains, as it has for all 114 years of the Arizona
State Fair: prizewinning recipes. A few years ago, the Homemaking
Arts staff compiled many of them into a book, ``Arizona State Fair
Blue Ribbon Recipes.'' Blue Ribbon Recipes include the cheesecake
recipe from a Mesa baker in his 70s, Bill Graves, who wrote that
his mother owned a stagecoach tavern in New Hampshire. Another
baker who usually enters is Bebe Reed, who comes to the fair from
Nogales every year. Her recipe for Our Special Birthday Cake was
handed down from her mother and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Sternitzky of Apache Junction won the right to represent
the state with Arizona's Supreme Citrus Pie in the 1990 National
Pie Celebration, sponsored by Crisco, and was a runner-up. The
Apple Pie recipe, from Dianna Bennett of Phoenix, came from
techniques she was taught by both her grandmothers. &QL;

<P>
   1 cup shortening
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped cherries
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate Buttercream Frosting:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound softened butter
</P>
<P>
   2-pound package confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons vanilla (or other favorite flavoring)
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup cocoa
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 tablespoons milk
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Grease and flour three 9-inch cake
pans.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, beat shortening and sugar until creamy and
fluffy. In a medium bowl, beat egg yolks; add to creamed mixture
and beat well. Stir in vanilla and almond extract. Into a separate
bowl, sift together cake flour, baking powder and salt. Add to
creamed mixture alternately with milk, beating well after each
addition. Fold in chips and cherries.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Fold
into batter. Pour into the greased and floured pans. Bake for about
30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove layers from pans and let cool completely. Recommended
frosting: Chocolate Buttercream.
</P>
<P>
   For frosting, in a large bowl, slowly add sugar to butter a
little at a time. Beat well after each addition. When frosting
becomes stiff, add flavoring; beat well. Add cocoa, beat well.
</P>
<P>
   Add milk to mixture 1 teaspoon at a time while beating, until
proper consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Note: This cake is good with butterscotch chips, mint chips and,
if you can get them, the cherry, coconut and blueberry chips that
are available in the Midwest (or through baking catalogs). To make
these for small children, I use minichips and cupcake pans.

HOMOSEXUALS YET TO GET A FAIR SHAKE FROM POLITICIANS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 bY DERRICK Z. JACKSON 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The savage murder of Matthew Shepard has caused President
Clinton to urge Congress to expand federal laws on hate crimes to
acts done on the basis of sexual orientation, disability, and
gender. Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming, was
lured out of a bar, beaten until he had a fractured skull, then
left tied to a fence in the cold and in such a comatose state that
when a bicyclist rode past him 18 hours later, the cyclist first
thought the form was a scarecrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that in the grief of this moment for Matthew Shepard's
family and in the shared outrage across America, Americans will
once again search their hearts and do what they can to reduce their
own fear and anxiety and anger at people who are different,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is sincere about Americans searching their hearts, he
had better do more than just hope. He needs to lead. While there
might be dutiful outrage this week over Shepard's death, Clinton
knows there is no shared agreement on whether Shepard was a full
human being in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hardest hearts on homophobia are right in front of
Clinton's face, in Congress. Up to now, Clinton has been more an
accommodationist than a bold attacker of their views.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Clinton is the first president to openly court gay
and lesbian campaign support. He has a senior White House adviser
on gay issues. He has made 150 gay and lesbian appointments to his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But his groundbreaking promise at the beginning of his first
term to end discrimination against gay and lesbian soldiers in the
military ended with those soldiers still in the closet under his
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. Then, with reelection less than
two months away, Clinton signed a law that denies federal
recognition of gay and lesbian marriages.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton signed the act, Elizabeth Birch, executive director
of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's most prominent gay and
lesbian political organization, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is deeply disappointing that the president has chosen the
politically expedient course of action rather than standing up to
gratuitous gay bashing.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, gay bashing has been a rite on Capitol Hill. This
summer, both Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Majority
Leader Dick Armey both called homosexuality a ``sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott this year compared homosexuality to alcoholism, something
House Speaker Newt Gingrich did in 1994. Lott said, ``Others have a
sex addiction or are kleptomaniacs. There are all kinds of problems
and addictions and difficulties and experiences of this kind that
are wrong. But you should try to work with that person to learn to
control that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Lott who successfully opposed federal laws
banning discrimination against gay and lesbian workers because he
fears such laws are ``part of a larger and more audacious effort to
make the public accept behavior that most Americans consider
dangerous, unhealthy, or just plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Just to make sure no one would mistake Lott for an
equal-opportunity employer, he blocked the nomination of James
Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg this summer. Hormel would have
been the nation's first openly gay ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, who three years ago called gay Representative Barney
Frank ``Barney Fag,'' seconded Lott's position that homosexuality
is a sin. ``The Bible is very clear on this,'' Armey said. Senate
Assistant Majority Leader Don Nickles, in approving Lott's blockade
against Hormel, said, Hormel has ``promoted a lifestyle and
promoted it in a big way, in a way that is very offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   These feelings run so hot that the Texas Republican Party this
summer denied an information booth at its statewide convention to
the Log Cabin Republicans, the nation's leading organization of gay
Republicans. In California, in the race for the US Senate,
Treasurer Matt Fong, the challenger to incumbent Barbara Boxer,
said Lott's comments were ``accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   In this atmosphere, Clinton looks good with little effort. He
and Vice President Al Gore still go to gay and lesbian political
dinners. But when Clinton calls for an expansion of hate crime
laws, one should remember that Lott was still able to block
Hormel's appointment even after the firestorm of outrage that
greeted Lott's remarks about homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and his like-minded colleagues in the Republican Party have
yet to pay a political price for their homophobia. It is
meaningless for Clinton to ask Americans to search their hearts if
he does not summon within himself the passion for gay rights
necessary to openly fight the mixture of myth and paranoia that
tortures public discourse on homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already bargained with the Republican leadership on
the military and gay marriages. There has to be a point where he
will bargain no more on the idea that gay and lesbian people are
not equal either in the eyes of Republican gods, and thus, not in
the laws of the land. If the death of Matthew Shepard cannot move
him to stop the bazaar of equality, nothing will.

DISC DRIVES: ARE COMMUTER'S BOOKS ON TAPE GIVING WAY TO BOOKS ON
CD? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MELISSA FLETCHER STOELTJE 
C.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the advent of easier, sleeker compact-disc players, the
tape cassette player _ like its predecessor, the clunky, old
turntable _ is quickly going the way of the dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   But what does this bode for the burgeoning books on tape
industry, which nowadays pulls in more than $2 billion a year in
sales? What does it mean for folks who relish a little taste of
``Into Thin Air'' or ``Bridget Jones' Diary'' in their cars on the
way to work?
</P>
<P>
   Are people having to chunk their favorite book tapes because
their cars have gone high-tech?
</P>
<P>
   In short, no. These days, most cars still come equipped with
tape cassette players, even the luxury-end variety, according to
Ward's Autoinfo Bank, which tracks such information. In 1997,
almost five million domestic cars produced came equipped with
cassette players only, compared to a mere 1.4 million with CD
players only. (Among imported cars sold, the difference was some
700,00 to 400,000, respectively.)
</P>
<P>
   A call to a few Mercedes-Benz and Lexus dealerships in Houston
confirmed that, indeed, most of those high models continue to come
with cassette players: You can get a CD player installed, but it
must be ordered as an option. Only ``about 10 percent'' of clients
ask for that frill, says the general manager of one Mercedes-Benz
dealership, who didn't want to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   But even if someone decides to go exclusively with a CD on the
dash, they're not out of luck when it comes to listening to books
on the road. They can simply buy books on CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little more expensive right now to produce, because
they're not a high-volume product, like tapes are,'' says Jim
Grant, vice-president of Earful of Books, a major, Austin-based
retailer of audiobooks. Grant says that, of the approximately 7,000
audiobook titles his company sells, more than 90 percent are on
tape.
</P>
<P>
   While books on tape can be as inexpensive as $14.95 or as costly
as $90 _ it all depends on the length of the book, and, thus, how
many tapes required to tell it _ books on CD are about 20 percent
higher, he says. (However, CD books do cost about the same as tapes
if you're just renting them, he adds.)
</P>
<P>
   Since many folks still have cassette players in their cars,
there is not a big demand for books on CDs, which results in the
higher cost.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem affecting their popularity, says Grant, is CDs
don't ``bookmark'' well. (If ejected, CDs resume play at the
beginning.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're playing an unabridged book, it may take five or 10
times to hear it,'' he explains. ``If you're in the middle, you
can't go right back to where you were; you have to jump around the
track. Whereas with a tape, the device stops, so you can pick right
back up where you were.''
</P>
<P>
   As books on CD technology improves, the audio book industry will
respond accordingly, says Grant, whose company handles the
audiobook accounts of more than 300 publishers nationwide. The
quality, by the way, is the same, no matter if you're listening to
tape or CD, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   John Reilly, spokesman for the Automobile Parts and Accessory
Association, predicts the dashboard landscape will change
drastically in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next five years, it's very doubtful cars will be coming
out with tape players,'' Reilly says. Already, he says, the
``specs'' for many 1999 models reveal that many of the new,
high-end cars will be coming out equipped with CD players alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tape cassette players) are just being faded out,'' he says.
``Look at the music industry, and people just aren't buying
cassettes.''
</P>
<P>
   He also predicts books on CD will become increasingly more
common, since demographically speaking, the people who buy luxury
cars tend to be the same ones who listen to audio books. And demand
feeds supply. &QL;

U.S. DESIGNERS WORKING ABROAD SET LIGHT RUNWAY MOOD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ As skies remain gray and somber in this Italian
fashion capital, U.S. designers working abroad continue to set a
runway mood that is considerably lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Alfaro's collection summed up the apparent direction of
women's ready-to-wear designs for spring 1999. Using soft colors of
khaki, ivory, pale yellow and a violet so subdued it looked gray,
Alfaro executed an American Indian theme with sensitivity and
precision.
</P>
<P>
   From the melodious flute-and-drum soundtrack to tastefully
beaded and fringed evening wear to the models' buttery suede boots,
the theme wound its way into the presentation but did not scream
ethnicity. The mood was one of serenity.
</P>
<P>
   The finest cashmere yarns were woven into tiny tops and
cardigans worn over calf-length skirts. For chillier days, there
were open-weave, hand-knit sweaters with three-quarter linen
dusters topping cropped linen pants. Evening saw loose and thin
gauze dresses, often with tracery beading, worn over featherweight
cashmere tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Another American, Rebecca Moses, the designer behind Donatella
Girombelli's Genny line for five years, is leaving that house to
concentrate on her own collection. Presented in a series of
tableaux in her showroom, her designs included beautiful knits and
lovely chiffons and jerseys for evening.
</P>
<P>
   Moses' palette ran from aubergine to lavender, Capri sea blue to
pale powder blue, lemon to mint, pink to coral. The cutest pieces
were cashmere sweaters, both pullovers and cardigans, that combined
colors _ pale lemon with mint, pink with lavender _ and cashmere
tops with beaded sheer, short sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Her basics _ in black, beige, ivory and white _ included all the
pieces a woman counts on in a daily wardrobe or for traveling, with
a choice of straight-leg, toreador or satin pants, comfortable
jackets, long cardigans, overcoats and sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   Bergdorf Goodman is contracting with Moses to produce a
plus-size line.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost every other designer in Milan, expert tailors
Giorgio Armani and Antonio Fusco concentrated on luxury pieces but
with the softened lines they believe women want. This trend of
adding luxury pieces to the wardrobe appears to be the key to
taking women out of their stiff suits and jacketed dresses without
making them seem overly casual.
</P>
<P>
   Fusco was the more structured of the two, showing silky
shirtdresses and drawstring-waist skirts worn with easy jackets and
some pseudo-safari looks. Khaki and charcoal ribbed knits worn with
pin stripes and beaded starbursts on sheath dresses characterized
the collection. Special touches included a bare apron top and a
group of pretty matching beaded chiffon shawls and skirts worn with
knit tops.
</P>
<P>
   Armani, more than any other Milanese designer, focused intently
on gray. From charcoal to dove, the current of the Orient.
</P>
<P>
   Shirt jackets were worn like cardigans, fastenings were
invisible, and fabric weights were whisper-light. Tops and T-shirts
were small, while skirts and pants fell to the ankles. The palette
expanded to include dusty blue, wisteria green and palest purple.
</P>
<P>
   Armani's evening wear included prints on white, gray and
aquamarine silk gauze with transparent and iridescent sequins. Long
dresses appeared in jade, and there were bits of pink, mango and
Chinese orange-red.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming message of the collection, however, was an
outer layer of transparent fabric. Chiffon or organza layers topped
opaque pants and skirts. Sheer skirts and half-skirts topped narrow
pants. The effect was always one of veiling clothes to soften their
look.
</P>
<P>
   Jil Sander, another designer known for fine tailoring and
precisely fitted yet comfortable jackets, chose the casual path for
spring. Her shape of the season was an easy-fitting dress that was
folded, rolled and draped into shape with a smallish bodice and a
pear-shaped skirt.
</P>
<P>
   There were pressed and chintzed cottons, rayon with metallic
threads, rayon and rayon/wool blends and net jacquards. Ensembles
often included several fabrics of the same color _ black, powdery
blue, pale yellow, gray, beige or white. Pieces here and there were
a soft metallic gold.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Ferretti chose tucking and paint, often used together,
to individualize her soft silhouettes. From straightforward tucks
that defined busts, waists and hips, she moved to random tucks that
created patterns on dresses. Sheaths had bias tucking, with prim
V-necks in front dipping to lower V's at the back.
</P>
<P>
   Colors included khaki, brown, toast, orange-red, blue and black,
and Ferretti loved mixing them, adding a floral sleeveless knit
pale-blue top over brown hip-slung pants with a checkered
waistband.
</P>
<P>
   For evening, tucks either ran vertically on organza dresses or
formed myriad patterns on dresses that resembled origami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artistic'' is a fine way to describe the Dolce &AMP; Gabbana
collection. Building on the success of their fall/winter designs of
limited-edition painted Mylar and embroidered net dresses, Domenico
Dolce and Stefano Gabbana sent out schools of sardines painted on
long black lacquered silk dresses for spring. The marine theme was
based on Mediterranean aquatic life surrounding Sicily; there were
no prints in the collection. Silvery hologram fabrics were chosen,
Gabbana said at a news conference before the show, because they
reminded the designers of fish scales. Even black lace was pressed
onto latex.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of the fabrics in the collection were treated to
some kind of lacquering, either for shine or texture. And like the
``sensual, sexy lines of fish,'' there was nothing square or
rectangular in the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Jackets were often cut in one piece, with seams only under the
arms and down the sides. The effect was almost of a kimono cut,
more casual than a tailored jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Some pants and jumpsuits were shaped at the knees to make the
garments appear as if they were in motion, even on their hangers.
When jumpsuits and corseted dresses were low-cut, like a bustier,
Dolce and Gabbana added tiny black cardigans that were barely more
than pairs of sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   The Gianni Versace collection is still shaped by the late
designer's sexy, low necklines and clinging skirts and dresses. But
his sister Donatella Versace's designs for spring doted on dresses,
either slithery, silky jerseys for day or long metal mesh or
layered chiffons for evening.
</P>
<P>
   Versace came up lacking, however, if she aimed to reproduce her
brother's emphasis on the female form. While dresses and tops, as
in her earlier Versus line, were often slashed from the collarbone
to the waist, putting half of each breast on view, the result
lacked sensuality. Evening dresses that combined Gianni's signature
metal mesh with some fiber resembling hairy blue or white cotton
candy looked uncomfortable, while the painted, beaded, sequined and
what-have-you-layered chiffons looked like arts-and-crafts
projects.
</P>
<P>
   These were not the fine clothes the Versace label has come to
represent. The lively violet, fuchsia and aquamarine were there
along with ``de rigueur'' black, in materials from nappa leather to
rice fiber. But there was no clear idea of the woman for whom
Donatella is designing. &QL;

EFFORT LAUNCHED TO CUT RATE OF HIV INFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While the rate of AIDS deaths nationwide
continues to fall, the rate of new HIV infections has not.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine on
Tuesday issued a report saying HIV testing should be routinely
offered to all pregnant woman as part of prenatal care as a way to
keep the virus from being passed to children. A majority of
pregnant women currently undergo testing, but it is not universal.
</P>
<P>
   And in San Francisco, an ad campaign is being launched to
encourage people who think they may have recently been exposed to
enroll in a ``morning-after'' regimen that aims to rid the body of
the human immunodeficiency virus before it can take root.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is an affliction
in which HIV weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to
serious infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual
contact, sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are proving successful enough to drastically reduce the
chance of developing an HIV infection, as well as the chance that
an infected mother will pass the virus onto her newborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can prevent an HIV infection, you will have done a
tremendous amount for the person and for the community as a
whole,'' said James Kahn, medical director of the PEP Project, a
joint program of the San Francisco Department of Public Health and
the AIDS Research Institute of the University of California at San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The project offers free HIV drugs for a month, intensive
counselling and education about prevention to people who believe
they were exposed to the virus in the previous 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The medicines are the same used by people known to be infected
and are believed to be very effective in preventing HIV from taking
hold in the body, if given promptly.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 225 people have enrolled in the year-old program and no
one has yet tested positive for the virus, Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   The new ad campaign, targeted at gay men, will appear on city
buses. More explicit posters will be in bar restrooms. They
emphasize that mistakes happen, but if people act quickly the
deadly infection may be avoidable.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the National Academy of Sciences reviewed a
mountain of literature that shows pregnant women treated with AIDS
drugs are far less likely to transmit the virus to their newborns.
</P>
<P>
   While mother-to-child transmission is much less of a problem on
the West Coast than in the East, where IV drug abuse by women is
more prevalent, officials at San Francisco General Hospital have
developed a program that has virtually wiped out the problem among
those they have treated.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, only two infants have been born with HIV in
the past three years, both to mothers who did not seek prenatal
care, according to Karen P. Beckerman, director for the Bay Area
Perinatal AIDS Center at the hospital. That is out of a total of
more than 50 births to HIV-infected women, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She attributed the low rate to testing and follow-up treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been advocating HIV testing for pregnant women for
years,'' she said.

   Home Section stories in sight at this hour from The N.Y. Times
News Service for Thursday, Oct. 15:
</P>
<P>
   MAIN-STREET (Undated) _ The flap of American flags on lampposts
and the pages of a paperback flipped by a shop owner on a bench
outside her antiques store were the only things moving on a recent
afternoon in downtown Marceline, Mo. There was one customer and one
waitress down at Mom's Coffee Shop. Both were smoking. It was a
landscape out of ``The Last Picture Show,'' except for the new
street sign. It read ``Main Street USA,'' beneath a halo of mouse
ears. A light year away in Fort Collins, Colo., the pedestrian mall
known as ``the old town'' was thriving with after-school activity.
There was a line to use the phone at the Paris on the Poudre cafe;
teen-agers painted each other with trial-run Halloween makeup
outside an Aveda bath shop. Pool balls clacked in the back room of
the new cigar bar. This is a tale of the two main streets that
inspired the ultimate urban fantasy: Disneyland's Main Street, USA.
By Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   HERBAL-VILLAGE (Fulton, Md.) _ About a month ago, I stopped by
Jim Duke's garden to check out the little six-acre spread he calls
Herbal Village. Fulton is one of those little burgs off the
interstate, where the farms have given over to ranch houses, with
guys out on their power mowers every Saturday, riding herd on their
lawns. But Duke's place is as different as the man himself, who
looks more like a 69-year-old hippie, standing barefoot by his
kudzu vine, than an eminent botanist, with 20 books and 200
scientific papers under his belt (if he wore one with his cutoffs).
Last August, with the help of a few friends, Dr. Duke planted about
200 medicinal herbs, in 80 plots, each devoted to some disease or
ailment. By Anne Raver.
</P>
<P>
   WENGE-FURNITURE (Undated) _ Naomi, Kate, Shalom, Claudia, wenge?
It came down the runway two seasons ago in Milan. Now wenge
(pronounced WEN-geh) is the deep, rich darling of the
furniture-design moment, the bittersweet chocolate-brown muse of
the new minimalists _ from reigning sultans like Christian Liaigre
to young turks like Spencer Fung. If ever there was a wood that
was, it's wenge. It's so there, it could be over. By William L.
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   DEMETER-FRAGRANCES (New York) _ ``Techno fragrances are the
coming thing,'' said Christopher Broisus of Demeter, the company
whose line of fragrances won the best of show award last week at
Extracts, the trade show at the Javits Center. Demeter offers
little bottles of real-world fragrances like Rubber, Dirt and
Vinyl. The company is working hard on Gasoline, a fragrance that
offers less the raw smell of petrol than ``the idea of gasoline,''
Brosius said. By Phil Patton.
</P>
<P>
   SOLOMONOFF-HOME (New York) _ Over the last decades, work has
increasingly invaded the home and changed the way Americans view
the domestic landscape. Wing chairs, mantelpieces and newel posts
make little sense for houses that double as offices: cozy images
send unprofessional cues to clients, and cocoon people into
thinking their workday never starts. ``Baking cookies and ironing
shirts was not the image I had in mind,'' said Galia Solomonoff, an
architect who recently bought a former karate school to transform
into a live-in Manhattan workplace. ``I wanted to construct a house
around the way we actually live, not with cliches, and the most
important thing was that domesticity not interfere with my work.''
By Joseph Giovannini.

Galitzki

<P>
   NY-APARTMENT-PRICES (New York) _ In the current market, where
many New York apartments _ especially the overpriced ones _ have
already come down a peg or two in price, the sellers are feeling
squeezed by these bottom fishers, brokers say. By Tracie Rozhon.

we find religious freedom in the U.S. sense? No. But we found no

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ Of course it is better not to have to bomb Serbia than
to bomb Serbia in the hope of protecting Kosovar civilians.
 &HT;    But the rather vague agreement with Slobodan Milosevic, reached
only after NATO had lined up its planes and voted unanimous
authorization to use them, reflects the illogic of the whole
situation.
 &HT;    This is a bandaid measure, and only wishful thinking can see in
it a definite step toward resolution of the Kosovo problem, as has
been and is still the case with the Dayton solution in Bosnia. It
is better not to let killing continue, not to chase people out of
their homes into the rugged, frigid mountains.
 &HT;    But it isn't a policy or an idea even of how to sustain such
negative gains, let alone something positive, except indefinite
involvement in Bosnia's case of NATO, in Kosovo's case of civilian
monitors and the threat of NATO force.
 &HT;    The Bosnian peacekeeping mission now is costing some $7 billion
a year with no tapering off date on the horizon. Kosovo will be
less expensive, if it works, but it includes heavy responsibility
for humanitarian aid. Nothing has been said about who is to be
responsible for repairing all the deliberately destroyed villages
in the scorched-earth campaign.
 &HT;    The United States and the European powers backed themselves into
this situation without ever having made a clear decision of their
role in ex-Yugoslavia, what they are there to get done, but only
what they desperately hope to prevent continuing once the disaster
got well underway.
 &HT;    Despite all the official talk about not repeating the errors of
Bosnia, there has already been a replay of the dithering and now a
rather frightening renewal of what led to the intolerable seizure
of U.N. hostages in Bosnia.
 &HT;    The dispatch of 2,000 unarmed civilian ``monitors'' to make sure
the Serbs don't keep bashing the ethnic Albanians is to be
reinforced by NATO non-combat reconnaissance planes, both presented
as a big concession from Milosevic in allowing foreign intervention
on Serbian soil. But it was the presence of U.N. troops, armed but
not allowed to shoot unless shot at, that prevented the use of air
power in Bosnia until the United States sent in ground forces. It
could happen again.
 &HT;    There is no logic on Milosevic's side either. He has nothing to
gain by the scorched earth policy. It isn't going to replace 2
million ethnic Albanians with Serbian settlers, it only reinforces
the demand for Kosovar independence because Serbian rule is so
terrifyingly oppressive. Belgrade is simply trying to put down the
guerrilla force, which can have no more than short-term success.
 &HT;    The agreement to hold elections in a year is intriguing, but
opens endless questions. Who will run them? Who will be eligible?
What powers would the elected body have? If Milosevic really wanted
out of the box he has created for himself in Kosovo, this could be
a way to go but it isn't at all likely. The signs are that all he
wants is to cling to power as long as possible. Then what? He
doesn't seem to care.
 &HT;    There is a great, frustrating gap here between what the parties
involved would like to do and what they have to do it with. The
United Nations and NATO have imposed a painful embargo on Serbia,
which also hurts neighboring countries, but has only served as a
punishment, not as a deterrent. They can bomb, but destroying the
essentially irrelevant military targets provides no leverage on
political goals.
 &HT;    Some significant Serbian military and police will remain in
Kosovo because if they did pull out, independence would be quickly
proclaimed. But how and how much they will actually be constrained
by the presence of international monitors remains to be seen.
Friction, perhaps renewed crisis, may be unavoidable.
 &HT;    There is no available answer that would assure better results
and that the countries involved could agree on. It is already
remarkable that 15 NATO countries did agree, despite loud
objections from Russia. Outside factors, having nothing to do with
the Balkans, could change the atmosphere at another point.
 &HT;    Toying with the idea of keeping the peace, or at least stopping
war, without really being determined to do it inevitably leaves
this kind of dilemma that we aren't prepared to face but cannot
ignore.
 &HT;    It matters at least to be aware of these obstacles and not to be
misled by claim of diplomatic triumph, to be followed by dismay.
The world has changed some, in its disapproval of violence and
sense of a minimal responsibility to protect innocent civilians.
But there is no collective decision as to how far the world's
citizens want to go to protect other countries in need.
 &HT;    Instead of pretending a success, let us admit that and hope to
do better.

FOR THURGOOD MARSHALL, THE SUPREME COURT WAS THE EPILOGUE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who knows why Thurgood Marshall finally said yes? Supreme Court
justices rarely grant interviews, and Marshall, a man much scarred
by half a century of legal and racial battle, was more reticent
than most.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Williams, now 44, had been after Marshall to talk to him
for years. The letters had started when Williams, whose career at
The Washington Post had included tours as editorial board member
and White House correspondent, was at work on the book that
accompanied the award-winning 1987 PBS history of the civil rights
movement, ``Eyes on the Prize.'' Marshall finally agreed to talk in
July 1989, 3 1/2 years before his death.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall had long since ceased to be a flesh-and-blood
character. He had become a symbol _ and a caricature.
</P>
<P>
   The symbol was a civil-rights legend, the first black Supreme
Court justice. The caricature was a grumpy old man, ``out of sorts
and out of step,'' in Williams's words.
</P>
<P>
   Once a week, usually on a Wednesday or Thursday, Williams would
visit Marshall's chambers. Their sessions took place over the
course of the next six months. They'd last a couple of hours.
``He'd kick me out around lunchtime, when he'd have his soup,''
Williams recalled on a recent visit to Boston to promote his new
biography, ``Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   The tape recorder was on _ and Marshall would be off. Williams
was discovering that the man frequently described as the most
important lawyer (black, white, or otherwise) in 20th-century US
history was also one of its best storytellers. ``Oftentimes, it
felt like I was up to see the wizard and getting behind the curtain
and peeking,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was able to tell me stories that made me feel as if I was
doing time travel. This was a guy who went to high school with Cab
Calloway, the singer, then he goes to college with Langston Hughes.
When he gets his first job in New York at the NAACP Legal Defense
Fund, his office is next to W.E.B. DuBois's. He's in Asia
confronting Douglas MacArthur over the treatment of black soldiers.
Branch Rickey calls him up to help with Jackie Robinson's finances.
I'd find myself saying, `Did you really know all those people?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was there at Joe Louis fights. He remembers as a kid
watching Marcus Garvey's marches through Harlem. It's just
unbelievable that he touched so many other lives. In fact, I've
come to think it may be a function of segregation: that black
people were so concentrated back then they all knew each other.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Marshall who did more, perhaps, than any other individual
to end that era of racial separation. He masterminded the series of
court challenges to segregation that culminated in the Supreme
Court's landmark 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education.
Marshall argued Brown himself, one of 32 cases he presented before
the court. He won 29 of them. He went on to become the second black
to serve as a federal Appeals Court judge and the first to serve as
solicitor general, before being named an associate justice of the
high court in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the period between 1967 and 1991, when he retired
from the court, was an epilogue to Marshall's career, not its
highlight. Williams devotes barely a seventh of his text to the
court years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask most people about Thurgood Marshall, they'll say, `Oh
yeah, Supreme Court.' Well, I think that's the biggest mistake.
President Johnson said this when he nominating Marshall to the
court: `Even if he were never elevated to the court, this is a man
who has made his mark on American history.' I think lots of people
forget that, especially the young brothers. They say, `Oh, he's the
old guy in the black robes.' A lot of people think of him as a
token, a Tom, and they didn't give Marshall much credit. So then
they see him in his later years, he's fat, he's got the big robes,
he's an establishment figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams got to know a man who had a robustly ribald sense of
humor and enjoyed the company of attractive women. He loved to play
cards and knew how to open a bottle. But he was also a man who felt
a world of hurt at being misunderstood by the post-segregation
America he had helped to create.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt unappreciated by black Americans, which is a real
surprise. But if you think about it from his perspective: They're
making movies about Malcolm X, they got a holiday for Martin Luther
King. He's thinking, `I don't get it.'''
</P>
<P>
   For his book, Williams interviewed 10 present or retired
justices. Even in Marshall's later years, when the court had
shifted far from his liberal views, he continued to exert a moral
force on the court, a fact most clearly perceived by his fellow
justices, including his staunchest adversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the one Supreme Court justice who'd represented people
on Death Row, who knew the reality of what a back-alley abortion
was, who'd had to go into prisons where people weren't getting
their appeals heard. He'd had those experiences and he could bring
that to the table. You know, Justice (Antonin) Scalia said to me _
and, remember, he was Marshall's ideological opposite _ `Anytime
you're in conference and Thurgood Marshall was sitting there at the
table you had to pay attention, knowing all he had done in civil
rights and the law. Even if he didn't say anything, he made a
difference just by sitting there at the conference.'''

MAINE LOBSTER ILLNESS TAKES $2 MILLION TOLL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An apparently growing number of lobsters are being found sick
and dead in traps and pounds off the Maine coast, mystifying
researchers who cannot yet determine the cause and worrying
lobstermen who fear for their industry's future.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, more than $2 million worth of lobster have
been ruined by the plague, which seems to involve several strains
of bacteria infecting the normally hardy crustaceans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that lobsters are dying, but we don't know what's
going on precisely,'' said Robert Bayer, director of the Lobster
Institute at the University of Maine, who has organized a team of
researchers to attack the problem, which has been reported all
along the coast from York to Beals Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to have gotten worse in the last month, based on the
phone calls that we are getting from fishermen,'' Bayer said. ``We
were hoping it would go away, but instead, it seems to be getting
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   That worries lobstermen, not only because the problem is eating
into their $130 million annual revenues, but because they fear if
the public misunderstands the problem, it could drive people away
from eating Maine lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are scared the word will get out and ruin the lobster
industry,'' said one veteran Maine lobsterman who works a boat with
his son and asked not to be named. Some lobstermen have reported
hauling in a dozen dead or diseased lobsters a day.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Brown of the Maine Import/Export Lobster Dealers
Association said: ``We're concerned. This is big money.'' Maine
brings in an estimated one-quarter of all lobsters harvested in the
United States and Canada, more than 45 million pounds last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer and other specialists emphasized that the issue is not a
public health problem: Dead and sick lobsters are thrown out before
ever reaching fish markets, and any bacteria present in healthy
lobsters will be killed when they are boiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lobsters that are going to market are fine, and I would
eat them every night if I could afford to,'' Bayer said. ``It's not
a human health problem, but we know it's not going to be perceived
well by the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Estrella, Massachusetts state shellfish biologist, said
last week he had heard of the situation in Maine and understood it
to be a recent flareup of a longstanding, low-level problem of
infections that spread in pounds, where lobsters are stored so
dealers can sell them fresh when prices are high. Estrella said
there have been no reports of any similar outbreaks in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   A number of dead and sick lobsters were reported in Maine's Down
East coast last year, but the problem seemed to wane over the
spring and summer. In the last two months, however, lobstermen
working closer to the mid-coast and Casco Bay regions have reported
growing losses, Bayer said.
</P>
<P>
   Maya Crosby, a University of Maine microbiologist working with
Bayer and others, said several different bacteria have been found
in lobsters tested at the university's Darling Center in Walpole,
and the laboratory is seeking more samples of sick lobsters to
test.
</P>
<P>
   However, Crosby said, ``We've concluded that it's a secondary
infection, an opportunistic invader'' of lobsters that are being
weakened by some other, as yet unknown cause. ``We need to
understand the primary cause of the problem,'' Crosby said.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby and Bayer said scientists are far from having a working
hypothesis. Explanations such as rising sea-water temperatures have
been floated. Researchers are plotting the reported lobster deaths
and sickness on a map to see if there are any geographical trends.
</P>
<P>
   Tissue and blood samples from affected lobsters are also being
analyzed by researchers at the University of New Hampshire and
government biologists in Maine and New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak has prompted the state to set up a Lobster Health
Hotline, 1-888-317-4666. Pat White of the Maine Lobstermen's
Association said the group is urging members to report any problems
they find rather than try to hush them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to feed them as much information as possible.
They're the detectives,'' White said. ``We've got to get this down
to factual stuff.''

SOME LONGTIME US RESIDENTS FACE DEPORTATION FOR DRUNDEN DRIVING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOCORRO, Texas _ By almost every measure, David Balderrama is a
model immigrant: He worked in a sheet metal factory by day, fixed
houses by night, paid his taxes promptly every year, and then
retired to spend time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   But Balderrama also got behind the wheel of his pickup truck
after drinking beer with his relatives and union buddies. From 1988
to 1993, the police caught him driving drunk three times.
</P>
<P>
   That was one time too many for the US immigration service. On
Sept. 3, agents and police brandishing revolvers showed up at
Balderrama's adobe house. They announced that the 68-year-old
great-grandfather would be deported to Mexico, the country he left
42 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Balderrama is one of more than 500 people, most of them Mexican
laborers, who were rounded up by immigration agents in Texas and
threatened with deportation last month. The crackdown ensued when
the immigration service decided to enforce a little-known law
passed by Congress in 1996. It says that any non-citizen who has
committed an aggravated felony _ a violent crime, in other words _
can be deported.
</P>
<P>
   And in Texas, which led the nation last year in alcohol-related
driving deaths, three counts of drunken driving are considered an
aggravated felony.
</P>
<P>
   The roundup has led to charges of discrimination because most of
those targeted were poor men in the barrios of border cities, not
professionals in ritzy neighborhoods of Dallas or Austin. And
though immigration laws are supposed to be applied uniformly
throughout the country, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
has not gone after habitual drunk drivers in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drinking and driving is a serious offense, but you can't
compare it to murder, rape, or drug dealing,'' said Balderrama's
youngest son, Mario, 32, who works as an environmental inspector
for the state. ``My dad hasn't hurt anybody and he has never been
involved in any kind of accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Said another son, Joe, 36, ``The federal government is picking
and choosing when to apply the law. ... What they're doing seems to
us to be based on race and who has political power.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the house where he raised eight children, David
Balderrama is stoical. He is waiting for a deportation hearing in
nearby El Paso next month, and he'll see what happens. In the worst
case, he is prepared to move back to his birthplace in Chihuahua,
Mexico, a four-hour drive to the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an outlaw,'' he said in Spanish. ``If they want to
throw me out of the country, I won't fight them. But they don't
have to storm my house and scare my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Balderrama's lawyer, Albert Aramandariz, is working with other
immigration lawyers to show that the DWI rule punishes those who
have already paid fines and gone through court-ordered
rehabilitation programs. The deportations will needlessly break
apart families and leave fatherless children with no option but
welfare, the lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service, expecting criticism, sought the support
of community groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD).
Those organizations say the crackdown has nothing to do with
ethnicity. ``If someone is deported, his family still has the
opportunity to get together, even if it's in another land,'' said
Dale Chavez, administrator of the MADD chapter in El Paso. ``But if
he kills somebody, then the victim's family can only get together
at the graveyard.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, two dozen anxious families met in a community
center in downtown El Paso, just a few blocks from the Mexican
border. Everyone had a father, brother, or uncle who was rounded up
in ``Operation Last Call,'' as the immigration service dubbed the
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   While children played ping-pong, the parents spoke of their
fears. Marta Oliva said her husband, Joel Vargas, faithfully pays
child support for his three teenage children from a first marriage.
``If Joel is deported, who is going to pay those bills?'' Jesus
Marquez, a carpenter who has been arrested for DWI six times, said
he has stayed off alcohol for a year, thanks to a court-ordered
treatment program. ``I've never been in an accident, and now I'm
clean,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Spector, the lawyer who organized the families, says
statistics show that the immigration service is unfair. In the
roundup, 116 people have been arrested in El Paso and 101 in
Harlingen, another poor town. Yet only 76 were arrested in San
Antonio and none in Austin _ both cities where the Hispanic middle
class has political clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outrageous, ridiculous enforcement measure,'' said
Jeanne Butterfield, executive director of the American Immigration
Lawyers Association in Washington. Many of those arrested had DWI
offenses dating back to the 1970s and '80s, but the 1996 law is
retroactive, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Immigration and Naturalization Service office in El Paso,
spokeswoman Theresa Barraza said agents worked with the sheriff's
office and local police to find repeat DWI offenders. ``We didn't
single out Hispanics,'' Barraza said. ``We're on the border, and
the majority of the immigrants come from Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   David and Marina Balderrama crossed the border into Texas in
1956 with their infant daughter, Lucy. They handed in their
documents and became legal residents. ``We were not mojados,''
Marina Balderrama pointed out, using the word for ``wetbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Balderramas had seven more children, all born in the United
States. David Jr. served in the Army's 82d Airborne Division.
George is the owner of a sheet metal company. Patsy works in a
hospital. Joe is a sheet metal worker. Peter is a produce manager
in a grocery store. Mario works for the state natural resources
department. All graduated from high school. Maritza, the youngest,
went on to college and is now working toward a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   The children shared a single room until 1970, when the whole
family pitched in and built an addition to the house. David was a
loving and strict father who insisted that every child over age 5
help clean the house and do the dishes and the laundry. He used to
say, ``Do good in your job because your work represents who you
are,'' Joe remembers.
</P>
<P>
   For his three DWI arrests _ in 1988, 1992, and 1993 _ David
Balderrama pleaded guilty. If he had known that the three pleas
would haunt him in his old age, he might have requested a jury
trial, his family says. By the time David got around to applying
for American citizenship a few years ago, he was rejected. His
family blames the drunken-driving arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children are grown up and it's just the two of us left
here,'' said Marina Balderrama as she sat inside the house, which
is adorned wih porcelain figurines and photos of her 22
grandchildren and one great-grandchild. ``I have diabetes and
sometimes I have to go to the emergency room. Who is going to take
me?''
</P>
<P>
   David Balderrama says Alcoholics Anonymous sessions taught him
the gravity of drinking and driving. In his carport is a broken red
Chevy pickup with a bumper sticker that speaks to another time. ``I
don't have a drinking problem. I drink. I get drunk. I fall down.
No problem!'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   Balderrama's family agrees that drunken driving is a serious
offense. ``Since I became a father, it's always been, `DWI? Get
them off the street, take their license away,''' Joe said. But he
wonders if his father would be threatened with deportation if he
were a European immigrant, not a retired sheet metal worker from
Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, at the MADD office, volunteers update a set of
statistics every month. So far this year, the tally shows, El Paso
police have arrested 2,514 people for drunken driving. The city has
had 42 traffic fatalities this year; 18 involved alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Molina knows that drunk drivers are equal opportunity
killers. Her son, Mark Anthony, was 21 and serving in the Navy when
he was killed by a drunk driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who comes to this country should obey the laws or
suffer the consequences,'' said Molina. ``If you are caught driving
drunk once or twice and you don't learn from that, why would you
learn the next time? Do you learn the fourth time? Or do you have
to kill or injure someone first?''

TEXAS DISTRICT ASKS FEDERAL COURT TO HEAR SCHOOL UNIFORM LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEANNE RUSSELL  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGLE PASS, Texas _ Lawyers for the city school district, the
first in Texas to require students to wear uniforms, have asked
that a lawsuit challenging the fairness of the khaki-and-white
outfits be moved to federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Pass School District officials are accused of allowing
children of politically connected parents to opt out of the uniform
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   A state court hearing on the issue was canceled Tuesday when
school attorneys requested that the case be moved to federal
jurisdiction, where a separate lawsuit challenges the
constitutionality of the uniform requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the two lawsuits are consolidated or are heard
separately, the courtroom bouts are sure to be watched closely by
school administrators in other cities where uniforms now are the
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you need to define whether it's a constitutional right
to determine what you wear to school,'' said Oscar Trevino, an
Austin attorney representing the district.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Pass attorney David Riojas, representing 13 parents, said
he planned to ask the federal court to return the lawsuit to the
state court.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my claims are state law claims. They have nothing to do
with the federal courts, federal laws or federal statutes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The courts also may need to resolve the meaning of a 1995 Texas
law allowing school districts to grant uniform waivers for ``a bona
fide religious or philosophic objection.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where parents of children who were denied waivers say
politics stained the Eagle Pass khaki and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not against the uniform policy in itself. We're just
against the dirty way in which they were granted,'' said Juanita
Martinez, a district employee and mother of twin girls.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Eagle Pass became the first Texas school district to
adopt a mandatory uniform policy. School board trustees heralded
the outfits as the key to fewer fights, better attendance and
savings for financially strapped parents in this border city 140
miles southwest of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   About 97 percent of the district's 10,200 students complied with
the uniform requirement, district officials estimate. And support
remains, including a grandfather who stopped off at the courthouse
to call the uniforms the greatest thing ever for poor children.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, about 338 students received waivers. Another 119
requests submitted late were denied.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the school board reviewed each waiver request and
granted 51 of a total of 432 submitted.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit over fairness alleges the board rejected waivers
worded identically to those granted.
</P>
<P>
   School officials say they sought to draw a tough line so as not
to erode the effectiveness of the uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look down the road, if you continue to have that many
people, high school kids basically, asking for a waiver, pretty
soon you'll have no one wearing the uniform,'' district spokeswoman
Johnnie Lee Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   The fairness issue resonated at the district's high school
campus, where most students shed their uniforms when State District
Judge Ray Perez issued a temporary restraining order last week that
puts the uniform policy on hold.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Eagle Pass superintendent asked parents and
students to continue to voluntarily comply with the uniform policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about politics here in Eagle Pass,'' said Eagle Pass
High School junior Danny Hernandez, taking a lunch break on the
school steps Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get the waivers because they know people,'' Hernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents said political and school leaders have received waivers
for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Trevino said he only knew of a waiver given to former school
board member Marcial Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should either make everybody wear the uniforms or
nobody,'' Alejandra Barreto, 16, said.
</P>
<P>
   The teens complained of detention and in-school suspension for
refusing to wear or being out of uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Parent Rafael Hernandez Jr. said he had taken to eating lunch
with his kindergarten son Rafael because the boy was separated from
students as punishment for not wearing a uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 5-years-old and he's being treated like a criminal,''
Hernandez said.

   LEXINGTON, Mass. _ Dan Schwinn already was courting a new love
long before he said goodbye to Shiva Corp., the pioneering computer
networking company he helped start when he was just two years out
of college.
</P>
<P>
   That love was flying, and last week, Schwinn, now 37 and three
years removed from Shiva, put on display the outcome of this
romance _ an electronic aircraft navigational device &UR;  &LR; that gives
small airplanes some of the same high-tech safety features big jets
have enjoyed for years.
</P>
<P>
   Called a Flight Situation Display, or FSD, the device is the
product of Avidyne Corp., a company Schwinn incorporated in 1993,
as he was getting ready to exit Shiva. At the time, he said he got
more pleasure out of starting a company than running one.

   Shiva was a leader in introducing telecommuting to the world,
with its software that let remote computers connect over telephone
lines with the mainframe at corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is still in business but has shifted to
encryption software, went public in 1994. Investor demand doubled
Shiva's share price on its first trading day. Schwinn and Frank
Slaughter 3d, his partner in launching Shiva in 1985 _ both were 24
and just two years out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
_ were rich overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Schwinn wouldn't say how much he ultimately netted from his 18
percent share in Shiva before selling the last of those shares
about a year and a half ago. But of those proceeds, almost $6
million has gone into Avidyne, he said. He expects to personally
invest more, while also recruiting outside investment.
</P>
<P>
   Avidyne's product is a shoebox-sized unit that fits into the
instrument panel of a small airplane and displays flight
information in a way that was never available to &UR;  &LR; small-plane
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Push a button and its multicolor flat-panel screen shows a map
of where the plane has been and where it is heading. The map image
crawls slowly across the screen as the plane flies on, synchronized
by signals from global positioning satellites circling the Earth
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Push another button and the screen shows the same information in
a form suited for flying when visibility is too low for ``visual
flight rules.'' Another button pops up data about weather ahead.
Another identifies thunderstorms. Another tells how far and which
way to the nearest airport.
</P>
<P>
   The FSD is based on personal computer technology, using Windows
NT hardware and software. Sized to fit into crowded cockpits, it
has a base price of $7,500, plus software at around $1,000 per
function. Installation starts at around $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.3l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Schwinn sees a big market among owners of the nearly 230,000
private and corporate aircraft now flying in the United States _
almost all of which depend on dials and gauges that sometimes date
back to the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 units have been sold so far, Schwinn said. Three
manufacturers of private planes have agreed to offer Avidyne units
as optional equipment on new aircraft beginning next year, Schwinn
adds.
</P>
<P>
   The Avidyne FSD, which promises pilots a new view of the skies,
also offers a peek at how Schwinn, who in his final days at Shiva
admitted dislike for executive life, looks now at doing business.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Interviewed inside a hangar at Hanscom Field in Bedford,
Schwinn was casually dressed in a blue short-sleeved knit shirt,
khaki trousers, moccasins and no socks. Rain had spoiled his plan
to take writers and photographers aloft in his own 1980-model
Mooney single-engine plane. But that allowed time to talk about
Avidyne's history and goals, linking them with lessons he learned
in building Shiva.
</P>
<P>
   Schwinn said he finds satisfaction in making tangible products
that are sold directly to consumers, after a previous life spent
developing software that &UR;  &LR; was incorporated into other applications.
</P>
<P>
   Building products, he emphasized, means that ``you have to think
about making your customer happy.'' He continued, ``We did a lousy
job at that in the early days of Shiva. Now I say, whatever you
have to do to make the guy happy, do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Avidyne's goal is to be ``a company that manufactures a
technologically advanced product that satisfies real customers and
makes real profits, we hope, while doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   He contrasts this with the emphasis high-tech entrepreneurs are
putting on Internet applications _ observing that enticing venture
capital sources to invest in Avidyne may be difficult because ``a
lot of them are so focused on the Internet. We're a solid business,
but we're not a go-go company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to try things that are new and different,'' he added.
Schwinn's turn to aviation stems from a boyhood dream that he might
someday be a pilot. That hope was renewed at MIT, where as a
freshman he applied for the Air Force Reserve Officer Training
Program _ only to be turned away because of his vision.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1987, two years after he and Slaughter founded Shiva
but before real growth began, Schwinn began flying lessons at
Hanscom.
</P>
<P>
   Winning his pilot's license that year, he began to see, while
flying to Florida or the Bahamas on vacations, how different his
instrument panel was from those that he would see through the
cockpit doorway when boarding a big jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to build technology-based devices and I couldn't
understand why some of what I saw was so primitive,'' he said.
``Why doesn't this other stuff exist for light planes?''
</P>
<P>
   Schwinn incorporated Avidyne in mid-1993, and from then on was
intent mostly on hiring a successor as Shiva's chief executive so
he could move on. Frank Ingari, from Lotus Development Corp., took
the job in September that year and Schwinn retreated to serving
only as Shiva's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1995, he quit that post, too, to spend full-time on
Avidyne. He hired a small group of programmers to develop the
product. Progress was slow because avionics software must meet
exacting Federal Aviation Administration rules. This took 2 1/2
years, Schwinn said, twice as long as he had expected. Out of that
experience, though, came an unexpected and perhaps profitable
collateral benefit _ specialized software that puts the FAA's
voluminous regulations into programming language. Avidyne has
applied for a patent on the software and hopes to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots who have tried the FDS, which has a liquid crystal screen
just a little bigger than a playing card, say they like it. Stunt
pilot Michael Goulian, who teaches flying at Hanscom, points out
that its moving map means that pilots no longer have to use
cumbersome large paper maps while in flight. &UR;  &LR;  Aaron Galvin, a
retired business executive who spends summers in Cambridge and
winters in Florida, says he owns the first Avidyne FSD sold. His
favorite feature is the constant display of numbers indicating
distance and direction to the nearest airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get in trouble you can just look at it. If you know the
magnetic direction and the distance, you can get there damn fast,''
Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Additional software, due out next year, will offer more
in-cockpit views _ of the terrain below, of aircraft in surrounding
airspace, and same-screen display of radar readings.
</P>
<P>
   Avidyne sold its first units in August 1997. Predictably,
initial sales were slow. Revenues for all of 1997 were about
$400,000, Schwinn said. Sales for the first nine months of this
year reached $800,000, he said, and Avidyne expects to end the year
with total revenues of about $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   While breaking new ground, Avidyne is not alone. The Aircraft
Electronics Association, based in Missouri, says eight other
companies now offer instrument-panel display units for private
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Schwinn said &UR;  &LR;  Avidyne's plan is to ward off direct competition
by licensing its technology to others _ an arrangement borrowed
from the the computer industry. At the same time, Avidyne would
continue to sell under its own name. Its units now are made under
contract by Electronic Designs Inc., of Westborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take us 18 months,'' Schwinn said, to build the
arrangements he envisions.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to fast turnarounds in the computer industry, he
said, ``that seems like a long time. But I guess in the auto
industry it takes five years to get a car out.''

SEIDMAN, WHO CONTAINED US BANKING CRISIS, REFLECTS ON JAPAN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. _ The man who was an instigator of Japan's bank
rescue proposal removes the black cap from his freckled, bald head.
He reads aloud the large button pinned to the cap: ``Lifetime
Permit (NU)318 for taking shellfish and eels.''
</P>
<P>
   L. William Seidman finds time for clam digging in September as
summer winds warm Nantucket's beaches, time he did not have a
decade ago. As chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
the Resolution Trust Corp. until 1991, he closed an astonishing
1,000 financial institutions, containing a banking disaster that
had engulfed Texas, flared in New England, and threatened to spread
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Now Seidman has discovered his unique expertise is in high
demand halfway around the world. The man who probably knows more
than anyone about fixing insolvent banks is advising Japanese
business and political leaders on how to solve the biggest banking
problem ever encountered: a banking system steeped in up to $1
trillion of bad loans, a system that is at the center of a global
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh prescriptions Seidman laid out for Japanese leaders
will be a test of whether a US-style bailout can solve a financial
quagmire in a country with vastly different business mores.
</P>
<P>
   Seidman, a former Naval officer who fought in the Pacific during
World War II, spoke bluntly to lawmakers in a country known for its
understatement: Japan must quickly find a solution to the financial
crisis saddling the second-biggest economy _ and the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Take back the message the world is going to be very
upset if you don't get started for two years,''' Seidman recalls
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Revealing some impatience with Japan's slow progress, Seidman,
who served as assistant for economic affairs under President Ford,
believes that tough measures _ Japan calls his solutions a ``hard
landing'' _ are long past due.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly won't be able to get their economy going until
their banking situation is on a viable basis,'' Seidman says,
looking out at Nantucket Harbor from the rooftop deck of his
vacation home, which was built by a seaman in 1830.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Seidman is in no way singularly responsible for the
bill now being arduously crafted in Japan. The gargantuan plan has
been labored over for months inside Japan's legislature, the Diet.
A remedy was urged on by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan
and was partly shaped by dozens of advisers, including people like
Robert Glauber, a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School
of Government who helped draft legislation to bail out US savings
and loans.
</P>
<P>
   Though Japan has yet to enact it's own legislation, warring
factions made progress last week in lurching toward a compromise.
The proposals advocated by Seidman in June are the heart of the
fight between an intransigent Liberal Democratic Party seeking to
protect a business elite with much to lose, and opposition parties
in the Diet pressing for tough solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Invited to Tokyo last summer, Seidman laid out his plan to Diet
members, the central bank governor, and Ministry of Finance
officials just days before US Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers would arrive.
</P>
<P>
   When Seidman gave a speech to key LDP members in the Diet,
``people listened. The LDP drafted a law after the speech. He
helped the process,'' says Seidman's host and client in Tokyo, Iwao
Tomita, the influential founder of Deloitte Touche Tohematsu, a
large Tokyo accounting and consulting firm affiliated with the US
firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired from government, the lively Seidman apparently
could not stop working. At age 77, he is a paid business
commentator for the CNBC cable network in Washington, his primary
residence. He wrote a book, ``Full Faith and Credit: The Great S&AMP;L
Debacle and Other Washington Sagas.''
</P>
<P>
   He cares for his wife, Sally, who requires intensive physical
rehabilitation after hitting her head in a fall two years ago.
Seidman, one-time dean of the business school at Arizona State
University in Tempe, also raises cattle on his ranch in the
foothills of the Sangre de Cristo mountains of New Mexico. And he
is in contact with six children, who live in California, New
Mexico, Nebraska, and Vermont _ and 11 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His June visit to Tokyo was not his first to Japan and won't be
his last _ he was invited to give a speech there in December.  &UR;  &LR; In
September, he went to China, where he discussed reform of the
state-controlled banking industry &UR;  &LR; with top government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tomita, a prominent Japanese businessman with high-level
connections _ he arranged Seidman's meeting with his high school
classmate, Bank of Japan governor Masaru Hayami _ is known as a
crusader for American-style accounting standards for Japanese
business. He credits Seidman as being a forceful ally in persuading
key government officials that the only way to deal with the problem
was through a ``hard landing.''
</P>
<P>
   That means writing off bad loans, forcing weak banks to raise
capital on their own, and closing insolvent banks that threaten the
entire system. It is a solution that runs counter to the Japanese
system of cozy business relationships and subsidies to businesses
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But Seidman's plan worked in the United States and became a
model for rescues that put the safety of a nation's deposits first.
Seidman ``is very well respected'' in Japan, says Richard Katz,
senior editor of Oriental Economist Report, who recently completed
a book, ``Japan: The System That Soured.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving in Tokyo, Seidman says, he presented a five-part
plan to Diet members, the central bank governor, and Ministry of
Finance officials: establish an independent regulatory agency to
supervise banks; establish a separate agency to oversee the
bailout; establish an RTC-like agency solely to sell property
seized from failed banks to recoup the bailout costs; force weak
banks to raise capital in the public market; close insolvent banks
and nationalize them under a so-called ``bridge bank'' to ensure an
orderly transition while regulators go about the messy task of
cleaning up the books.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Summers and Japanese officials held a press
conference in which the officials vowed to act decisively, the
language of Seidman's FDIC began seeping into news reports out of
Tokyo: ``Japan Plans Bridge Bank for Failed Lenders,'' said a June
22 article in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Seidman, a Republican appointed FDIC chairman by President
Reagan in 1985 (four years later, Congress appointed him to head
the RTC after creating the agency), is sympathetic to the
difficulties Japanese officials face. The bailouts of US savings
and loans cost US taxpayers $200 billion, though much of that was
recouped through the government's sale of real estate held by the
thrifts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; cl10.8 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The heated battles among the Japanese over who should pay _
taxpayers or bank shareholders or businesses _ is ``all part of the
process of democracy,'' Seidman says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Seidman's cool professionalism in handling US banking
problems enraged just about everyone with an interest in the
industry. With each bank closing, he choked off credit to wealthy
or influential customers. He angered taxpayers who complained he
spent too much. And he infuriated shareholders stripped of their
bank stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Japanese banks, too, would hurt deeply entrenched
political interests, especially in the powerful agricultural and
construction industries there. By its nature, the plan is an attack
on Japan's ``convoy'' system of doing business: Government and
corporations help and subsidize one another.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, ``90 percent of the problem is political,'' explains
Jean Kertudo, head of financial analysis for the Bank of
International Settlements, which monitors lending among countries.
</P>
<P>
   As Tomita describes bank politics, ``the Ministry of Finance
tried to protect every weak bank. But (there are) so many weak
banks now (Japan) cannot afford to finance them all. That's why
Seidman said hard landing, not soft landing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Japan's problems deepen. One of the country's largest
financial institutions, Long-Term Credit Bank, may be insolvent. A
report by Nomura Securities found that the 19 largest banks in
fiscal 1997 reported losses on bad loans of nearly 10.5 trillion
yen, or about $88 billion at current exchange rates. Losses this
year will be worse, analysts say. And Japan's financial troubles
extend beyond its islands: The country's banks hold nearly a third
of all loans to Asia's other contracting economies.
</P>
<P>
   Seidman fears that ``no one knows'' the extent of Japan's
problem. ``I mean no one. I don't think they know themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The forced bankruptcy last month of Japan Leasing, a huge
subsidiary of Long-Term Credit Bank, is being hailed as a first
bold attack on the problem _ and may be a harbinger of
nationalization of the parent company. Seidman calls it ``a
positive sign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Seidman believes that Japan's banking problems are ``much
worse, much worse'' than those a decade ago in the United States.
``Those were regional problems for us, and Japan's are focused
right in the center'' of its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, outsiders like Seidman will be unable to determine
the final outcome. In the end, he says, ``This is a Japanese
problem. It's got to be fixed by the Japanese _ nothing we can
do.''

CONSUMERS JUMP INTO BIDDING WARS ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Santos has a thing about his fax machine. It's not some
ordinary office fax, but a hulking behemoth designed for
``blast-faxing'' thousands of messages a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was brand new,'' says Santos with a trace of awe, ``it
was $10,000.'' But Santos, owner of a San Francisco computer store,
got his refurbished unit for a little bit less _ $149, plus $75 for
shipping. ``I laugh every time I go use it.'' Santos bought his
beloved fax machine, and a great many other items, by hanging out
at Onsale, an Internet shopping site that auctions off merchandise
to the highest bidder. Entrepreneur Jerry Kaplan launched Onsale in
1995 with a charity auction for Boston's Computer Museum. Today,
the company said its site sells $700,000 worth of merchandise a day
to consumers and business people who love bidding on bargains
almost as much as actually finding one.
</P>
<P>
   Onsale has plenty of competition. The on-line auction business
is soaring, with dozens of companies building sites to solicit bids
on everything from live cattle to Beanie Babies. Buyers are
attracted by the bargains they find, the constant hope of finding
more, and the excitement of competing with shoppers scattered
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the sale of books and music, the on-line auction has
emerged as one of a handful of mass market uses of the Internet
that holds the promise of developing into a full-blown money-making
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Already, business-to-business auctions are generating big money.
Companies with excess supplies of industrial commodities, or firms
in desperate need of a few thousand extra computers, are turning
first to the Internet auctioneers. Forrester Research, a
Cambridge-based market research firm, found 50 leading Internet
auctioneers that had sold a total of $2.9 billion last year.
Forrester predicts that by 2002, the total business-to-business
auction market will top $52 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Accurate numbers on the consumer on-line auction market aren't
as easy to come by. But a glance at the financial data from two of
the top public auction sites shows a market in the midst of
dramatic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Onsale, which brought in $91 million in the first six
months, up from total 1997 sales of $88.9 million. Another popular
auction site, eBay Inc., went public last month _ its stock price
zoomed from $18 a share to $47 on the first day of trading. eBay
reported $14.9 million in revenue for the first six months of the
year, compared with $5.74 million for all of last year. &UR;  &LR; It closed
Friday at 30 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The Home Shopping Network, which proved people would hunt for
bargains on their TV sets, has created an Internet site called
First Auction as a new outlet for its merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, major Internet ``portal'' sites that seek to attract
millions of regular visitors see the on-line auction as another way
to keep the Web surfers coming back. Yahoo Inc., owner of one of
the Web's most popular sites, has done a deal with Onsale to run
auctions at the Yahoo Web site. Another leading portal, Excite, has
acquired the Internet classified ads service Classifieds2000 Inc.,
and is using it as the basis of its own auction service.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are dozens of highly specialized auctions aimed at
narrow but lucrative market niches: sports enthusiasts, antique
collectors, classic car buffs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Onsale hooks its visitors with eye-popping prices. The site
commonly offers new computers with opening bids of $1. But prices
almost never stay that low. The cheap opening price is just to get
the bidding started, says Onsale spokesman Brian Fawkes. ``You find
the lower the starting bid, the tendency is that more people will
buy the product.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; cl10.8 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, someone soon bids $2, then $3 _ why not? It's still
a great price. And so the jousting begins.
</P>
<P>
   Computerization enables bidders to play a cat-and-mouse game
with one another. You can, for instance, preset the highest price
you're willing to pay _ say $500. If somebody bids $200, the
computer will automatically up your bid to $201. Someone else's
automatic bidder will offer up $202, and so on, till you've hit
your limit. Or you can sit in front of your computer all day,
watching the bidding and plunging in whenever you see something you
like.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just bargain-hunting. On-line auctions can be fun,
and customers like Santos keep coming back as much for the
entertainment value as for the bargains. At Onsale, he purchases
items for his personal use, as well as merchandise so cheap that he
can resell it at a profit at his computer store.
</P>
<P>
   Onsale says it was the first company to dream up the concept of
Internet auctions, but it would certainly have occurred to somebody
sooner or later. The Internet enables buyers to reach thousands of
potential customers at very low cost, and makes it easy to provide
a lot of information about the product being sold. On the other
hand, potential buyers anywhere in the world can easily bid and
keep tabs on how much others are bidding.
</P>
<P>
   The on-line auctioneers have provided orderly, reliable systems
for bringing the buyers and sellers together. But these systems can
vary significantly from one auction site to another.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, sites like Onsale are similar to cut-price retail
stores, with merchandise provided by various companies for sale to
consumers. Onsale buys from the producer, and tries to auction off
the products at a higher price than it paid, turning a profit on
the spread.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, eBay sponsors auctions by individual sellers
as well as businesses. A Chicago tire distributor can sell on the
site; so can a baseball fan in Florida with an autographed Hank
Aaron bat. At eBay, both shoppers will be charged a fee for listing
the items at the site, as well as a percentage of the price they're
paid.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Westly, eBay's vice president of marketing and business
development, says even other on-line retailers can't match his
site's vast assortment of merchandise. ``Not only are there 800,000
items right now,'' Westly said, ``but if you come back tomorrrow
there will be over 100,000 new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be why eBay can boast of something that Onsale and many
other auction sites can barely dream of: profits. The firm earned
$870,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly people like this service,'' said Forrester Research
analyst Kate Delhagen. ``It's a great way to unload a lot of stuff
that's been accumulating in their closet over the years, but it's
also a great way to find things.''
</P>
<P>
   But eBay may face a severe threat from Yahoo's new auction site.
It also offers listings to individual sellers, but unlike eBay,
Yahoo charges nothing to either the buyer or seller. The company
simply wants to encourage Internet users to keep coming back to the
Web site, thus allowing Yahoo to earn millions by selling
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Auction sites generally require the visitor to sign in and
provide a credit card number. The user is assigned a password and
is free to begin bargain-hunting. Auctions generally take two
forms: the standard kind, where the highest bidder wins; and the
Dutch auction, where the seller sets a price that goes down by a
certain amount every day until somebody buys the item. In a Dutch
auction, the buyer can hold off buying, day after day, in hopes of
a lower price _ at the risk that someone will come along who's
willing to pay the higher price.
</P>
<P>
   Many items _ including some of those eye-popping bargains _ have
a ``reserve price,'' the lowest acceptable bid for an item. That $1
computer likely has a $1,000 reserve on it, so if the price stays
at $1, it won't be sold.
</P>
<P>
   When two bids come in at the same price, the one received first
gets priority. Quantity can also play a part. If you bid $50 for a
lot of 10 items, somebody else could bid $70 for only five. The
high bidder gets the five items, while you get the remaining five
at the lower price.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders can have second thoughts and retract a bid while the
auction is in progress. But once the hammer falls, a binding
contract exists, and the bidder must pay the agreed price.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with a site like Onsale or First Auction, customers
have little reason to worry about fraud. They're buying directly
from the auctioneers, and both firms guarantee satisfaction. But
what about a user of eBay or Yahoo, doing business with a total
stranger a thousand miles away? Do buyers pay first and hope the
merchandise shows up? Do sellers ship the goods before the money
arrives?
</P>
<P>
   It's no idle worry. The National Consumers League, a consumer
group in Washington, D.C., says on-line auction fraud has become
the most common kind of Internet fraud. And eBay and Yahoo don't
guarantee that buyers and sellers are trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are services like I-Escrow, at www.iescrow.com.
I-Escrow works with both buyers and sellers. The seller won't ship
the product until I-Escrow receives the buyer's payment. And
I-Escrow won't hand over the payment to the seller until the buyer
has received the merchandise. I-Escrow charges 5 percent of the
value of each transaction.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, eBay and Yahoo feature rating services, in which
customers are asked to rate the quality of goods purchased from
particular sellers. Complaints from previous customers are
prominently displayed next to the names of sellers, and sellers
with a reputation for rip-offs are kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   The sites also contain message boards where shoppers compare
notes on interesting bargains. The message board on eBay, the eBay
Cafe, has become a hangout where many bidders visit simply for the
companionship.
</P>
<P>
   So on-line auction sites are entertaining and reasonably safe.
But can buyers really save money? Only if they keep their heads.
Santos warns that some bidders have so much fun, they drive the
price too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get pumped, they get excited, they get the adrenaline
flowing, and they become idiots,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But if you know exactly what you want to pay, and stick to it,
Santos adds, consumers can bid their way to some exceptional
bargains.

TUCCI HAS THE TOUCH FOR COMEDY IN `IMPOSTORS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Two out-of-work actors face the thespian's nightmare:
having to get a real job. Their plight sets off a chain of
silliness in ``The Impostors,'' a throwback comedy that attempts to
reinvent the theatrical farce _ and mostly succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Impostors'' is set in the 1930s but is approached with a
'90s sensibility, which works to amusing effect in all but two
glaring instances.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur (Stanley Tucci) and Maurice (Oliver Platt) are two
bumbling actors who stumble from one mishap to the next, eventually
landing on an ocean liner as accidental stowaways.
</P>
<P>
   While Maurice and Arthur try to escape from a mad British ham
(Alfred Molina) who wants their hides, they bump around a ship full
of fools, con artists, femmes fatales and revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Tucci, ``The Impostors'' begins as a
warmhearted comedy, much like his first delight, ``Big Night.''
</P>
<P>
   But then ``The Impostors'' veers off into farcical realms. The
movie gets sillier and sillier, until it's a full-blown,
in-one-door-and-out-the-other kind of farce, all told with a rush
of slapstick and flip repartee.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising cast of supporting players includes a couple of
cameos I won't give away here and some unexpected character actors
having fun: Steve Buscemi (``Armageddon'') as a suicidal lounge
singer, Hope Davis (``Next Stop Wonderland'') as a mournful
romantic, Campbell Scott (``TheSpanish Prisoner'') as an overwound
ship steward, and Billy Connolly (``Mrs. Brown'') as an athlete who
is too much of a man's man.
</P>
<P>
   They all take turns carrying the comic load, while Tucci and
Platt (``Bulworth'') transform themselves into a '90s version of
Laurel and Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   As a hangdog comic, Tucci is impeccable. But as writer and
director, he slips twice:
</P>
<P>
   (1) He throws in too much anachronistic cursing, which is
unnecessary to the comedy.
</P>
<P>
   (2) He lets the sexual situations slip from the risque into the
raunchy.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``The Impostors'' is a comic throwback to Hope/Crosby road
picture nonsense, seniors are potentially a large part of the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   People who would appreciate the amusing virtues of an
old-fashioned farce would probably find the R-rated movie funnier
if it had not resorted to profanity and over-the-line sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you enjoyed the elevated nonsense of ``Radioland
Murders'' and ``The Hudsucker Proxy,'' don't miss ``The
Impostors.'' 3 stars. &QL;

<P>
   BEIJING _ Oil barons around the world, take heart: China's leap
toward prosperity has caused nearly 1 million families to switch
from bicycles to cars.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the coming of the car culture to China isn't going to
shock the world's oil markets, as did the Arab oil embargo of
1973-74.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Chinese private car phenomenon should gain momentum
in the next few years just when the rest of Asia is soaring back
from its current economic crisis, the combined impact on world oil
prices could be dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The simple mechanism of supply-and-demand could slowly crimp the
world oil market in much the same way as members of OPEC did in the
oil cartel's heyday, when they agreed to cut production quotas --
and then stuck to the rules. Gradually, oil would become less
available and the price would go up.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the number of private cars in China has jumped from
virtually zero five years ago to at least 699,000, according to a
report by the China Automobile Market Survey and Research Society.
China's auto makers are now increasing the production of passenger
sedans by 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2000, there will be at least 1 million privately
owned vehicles in China's cities,'' the research society declared.
``In major municipalities and provincial capitals, the ownership
rate among families will reach five(CQ) percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, since 1996 China has ``trimmed'' the production of
bicycles, the China Light Industry News reported last month. It
attributed the fall-off to ``shrinking market demand'' and
``accelerated development of the automobile industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Though affluence is on the rise in China, the rest of Asia is in
a deep recession. This has flattened Asia's spectacular 5
percent-a-year growth in oil consumption that generally kept world
prices above $24 a barrel throughout the 1980s. When Asia's energy
demand sagged last year, world oil prices slid by this summer to
below $11 a barrel, their lowest level (on an inflation-adjusted
basis) since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, almost every expert believes that Asian oil demand will
start to rebound fairly soon. When that happens, it will probably
spell the end of cheap gasoline around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Writing this March in the American journal ``Foreign Affairs,''
world oil experts Daniel Yergin, Dennis Eklof and Jefferson Edwards
predicted that overall Asian energy consumption ``will again rise
sharply in two or three years'' -- once Japan and its neighbors
solve their internal economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the lowest trough of the Asian economic doldrums,
Asian countries consume about 19 million barrels of oil a day.
That's just over one-fourth of the oil that is used worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Oil fields in Asia produce just 8 million barrels for Asia's
daily needs; the remaining 11 million barrels a day must be
imported. Three-fourths of Asia's imported petroleum comes from the
Persian Gulf, with Saudi Arabia by far the largest supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sum, the prospects for Asia's oil supply look decidedly
grim,'' wrote Yergin, Eklof and Edwards. ``By 2010, (Asian)
productive capacity will have declined 6 percent from its 2005
peak, with new oil field developments unable to compensate for
maturing Indonesian, Malaysian and Australian fields. So regardless
of exploration, Asia is destined to import more than 20 million
barrels of oil per day by 2010, compared with approximately 11
million today.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   China is the newest and fastest-growing customer for Middle East
oil. Until five years ago, China was proud of its status as an
``energy-independent'' oil exporter. But thanks to its own meteoric
economic growth, China now imports 25 percent of its oil, amounting
to 1 million barrels a day. So far, most is for industrial uses and
only a small fraction for private cars.
</P>
<P>
   China derives another 3 million barrels a day of oil from
domestic oil wells while obtaining the balance of its energy from
massive reliance on coal, and hydro-electric and a few nuclear
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of China's imported oil now comes from Saudi Arabia, Iran
and the United Arab Emirates. Determined to diversify its oil
sources beyond the Persian Gulf, China's national petroleum
corporation last year outbid some of the biggest Western oil
companies for the right to help develop some of the choicest
Caspian Sea Basin oil properties in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, China's steep increases in oil imports worries some
Chinese energy experts. Early last year retired scientists Yang
Jike, the former vice president of China's national environmental
protection committee, published a warning that it was better to
rely
</P>
<P>
   on coal than imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   If China allowed its oil imports to increase, ``China will get
entangled in Middle East politics, like the United States,'' Yang
wrote.

   THEN AND NOW: CHANGES SINCE THE 1973 ARAB OIL EMBARGO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Imports, 28 percent of total U.S. oil consumption in 1973,
have risen to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), which supplied 54 percent of the world's crude oil, now
provide 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Inflation-adjusted retail prices have risen 6.5 percent for
gasoline and 7 percent for electricity in those 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inflation-adjusted price paid by refiners for crude oil
has risen by 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inflation-adjusted price of natural gas as it comes out of
the ground has increased by 187 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. consumption of petroleum is up by 13 percent, though the
nation's growing population means that on a per-person basis, it is
down by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Improved exploration and development technology has cut the
cost of finding new oil and gas wells by 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The average car then got 14 miles per gallon, compared to
today's 28.5 miles per gallon for a car and 20.4 miles per gallon
for light trucks -- including minivans, sport utility vehicles and
small pickups.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Today's average car or light truck has 25 percent more
horsepower than its equivalent in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The 31 percent share of homes heated by oil has dropped to 17
percent. The main reason: The 54 percent share of new homes heated
by natural gas has risen to 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Electric utilities, which got 17 percent of their power from
oil before the embargo, get only 2.5 percent from oil today.
Natural gas, then 18 percent of fuel for utilities, fell to 9.5
percent. To make up the difference, coal rose from 46 percent to
nearly 57 percent of utility fuel, and nuclear rose from 4.5
percent to about about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  While U.S. energy consumption has increased by 27 percent
since the embargo, energy use has grown so much faster in other
countries that the U.S. share of the world's energy consumption has
dropped from 31 percent in 1973 to 25 percent today.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-five years ago, Arab countries around the
Persian Gulf started an oil embargo that shattered Americans'
complacency over the security of their energy supply.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial oil shortage that began on Oct. 18, 1973, led to
six months of agonizing and improvising by government officials and
drivers desperate to find a service station that still had gas.
</P>
<P>
   In the next quarter-century, the federal government spent more
than $90 billion looking for ways to reduce our reliance on foreign
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Today, over-production and faltering demand from developing
countries has created a worldwide glut of oil. Half the oil
consumed in the United States -- or roughly one-fifth of the
nation's total energy supply -- is imported from Mexico, Canada and
other foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans have apparently forgotten about that crisis of
25 years ago,'' said Cecile Warner, who has not. An engineer who
directs the federal Center for Renewable Energy Resources in
Golden, Colo., she designed, built and lives in ``a passive solar
home that uses less than one-third of the energy of a home built to
today's standards.''
</P>
<P>
   New energy efficiencies have cut petroleum use per person. But
expensive efforts to develop clean, non-nuclear alternatives to
fossil fuels have failed to come up with a product cheap enough to
compete with deregulated oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half our oil now is imported, compared to only a
little more than one-third before the embargo, and that figure is
expected to rise to about two-thirds by 2020,'' Warner cautioned.
``Average vehicle miles per gallon are decreasing because of the
popularity of sport -utility vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, today's SUVs and other light trucks average more than 20
miles per gallon -- while the average car or pick-up of 1973 burned
up a gallon every 14 miles.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason why few Americans even noticed the three
price-propping production cutbacks announced in the last 10 months
by the the Arab and non-Arab countries in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's first two cutbacks flopped. The third, announced in June,
might be taking hold. After sliding from $25 a barrel in October
1996 to under $14 in August, the world price for crude oil has
bobbed up to around $16 in the last two months. The two-dollar jump
translates to about a nickel a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Sales from new suppliers dilute any cutback's effects. ``Russia,
the Caspian Sea region, Asia, West Africa and Latin America'' are
the industry's new frontiers, said Michael Cates, chief economist
of the American Petroleum Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond this, our vulnerability to such disruptions has been
significantly reduced by the development of the (federal) Strategic
Petroleum Reserve,'' Cates said. The reserve's storage pits hold
enough crude oil to make up for the loss of all U.S. imports for
about 60 days -- longer in the more likely event that only part of
the imports are blocked. The reserve system worked well in 1990
during and after the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   But the 1973 embargo was another story. The Saudis announced
that if the United States continued supporting Israel militarily,
it wouldn't be allowed to buy Arab oil.
</P>
<P>
   That threat was issued just one day after 11 Arab nations agreed
in Kuwait City to raise the charge for their oil by 17 percent and
prop up the new price by cutting their production by five percent
each month.
</P>
<P>
   Defying the economic and political threat, the United States
continued to re-supply the Israelis as they drove back the
Soviet-supplied armies of Syria and Egypt, which had invaded Israel
earlier in the month on the solemn Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence in American leaders was sinking that month, as
Vice President Spiro Agnew was forced to resign and President
Richard Nixon ordered the firing of the Watergate special
prosecutor. In addition, an elaborate system of price and wage
controls had failed to prevent heating-oil shortages the previous
winter and disruptions of the gasoline supply that summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall consumers following our delivery trucks and when the
truck arrived at the station, it would be trailing a ready-made
line of cars waiting for gas,'' said Leo Liebowitz, president and
CEO of Getty Oil, an independent oil marketer on Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pumping about 52,000 gallons a month, but as soon as
the embargo hit, I was cut back to 26,000,'' remembered station
owner Larry Beattie of Augusta, Ga. ``I think the oil companies and
the government, both of them, overdid it, and, of course, there was
a little abuse of the situation by some people on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Station closings were most common in Florida, Georgia, the
Carolinas and Tennessee. ``We'd have 70 to 100 dealers who'd spend
their own money to go up to Washington and lobby for relief,'' said
Jack Houston, retired executive director of the Georgia Association
of Petroleum Retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who used to wait until their gas tank was three-quarters
empty began refilling when their tank was three-quarters full.
``Better safe than sorry,'' said Lois Epstein's grandfather, when
she asked why they were lined up to buy gasoline for the second day
in a row. Multiplied by millions of motorists, that precaution
drained oil terminals, tank farms and refineries of surpluses that
could have eased the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, now a senior engineer with the Environmental Defense
Fund, said she worries that oil today is so cheap and plentiful
that careless companies lack economic incentives to fix leaky
equipment that could contaminate water or soil.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   At the embargo's peak, crude oil imports dropped by 17 percent.
The 38-cent average price for gasoline jumped to 54 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, a governor who three years later would be elected
president, asked Georgia's state employes to save electricity by
using the stairs instead of the elevators at work.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans heeded Nixon's pleas to turn down their
home and office thermostats to 68 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines conserved jet fuel by packing more passengers onto
fewer flights. They overbooked so heavily that when consumer
advocate Ralph Nader was bumped, a federal district judge ordered
the airline to pay him $25,100.
</P>
<P>
   The big neon signs in front of motels blinked off. Nixon parked
Air Force One and caught a commercial flight to his home in
California. That year, the lights on the national Christmas tree
erected outside the White House each December were kept turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices stayed up, and Israel reached a truce with Syria and
Egypt. Missions accomplished, the Arabs halted their embargo in
March 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But many older Americans still suspect it was all a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what was going on,'' recalled Lee Ramsnyder, who
operated the Lan-Mar Marina on Georgia's Lake Lanier. ``I remember
hearing there was a secret supply in Louisiana or someplace like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We pumped most of our gas to boaters on weekends, and we kept
running out by Sunday afternoon,'' he said. ``I think maybe a lot
of it was done by the government to pull us out of a little
recession by making people back up a bit on fuel use and dig in.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ramsnyder rebuilds used tour buses, installs luxuries
ranging from stoves and showers to trash compactors, and then sells
the vehicles to entertainers and other travelers who don't care
that they only get about eight miles to the gallon.

   MEXICO CITY _ When the price of crude oil falls, it's happy days
for American consumers and the U.S. economy. But those same price
cuts strike fear in the hearts of Mexicans and Venezuelans, now
critical exporters of oil to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil dominates the economies of Latin America's biggest
producers. And every time prices fall, big cuts in federal spending
and economic crisis are sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The ties that bind the U.S. and its Latin American suppliers
have grown strong since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, part of
a promise by the U.S. to diversify and avoid oil dependence on one
region.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, for example, is expected to supply the U.S. with 13.4
percent of its imported oil in 1998. That's up from 1.2 percent in
1975. In 1985 Mexico's share of U.S. oil imports hit a high of more
than 16 percent, then dropped a bit before rising again this year.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   The growth of mutual dependency between the United States and
Mexico is ironic, given how jealously Mexico guards its national
resources. In Mexico, the day that oil was nationalized in 1938 is
still celebrated as a moment of civic pride, and suggestions that
privatizing the nation's oil industry to make it more efficient
always prompts a flurry of angry denunciations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, not all of Mexico's oil was sold to the United
States,'' said John Lichtbleu, an analyst with Pira Energy Group in
New York. ``There was a time when they didn't want to sell more
than 50 percent of exports to the U.S. because of a fear of
domination. Now 85 to 90 percent of Mexican exported oil goes to
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   While the northward flow helps stabilize the Mexican economy, it
also means demand and price fluctuations have a greater impact on
average Mexicans. About 33 percent of the country's federal revenue
comes from Petroleos de Mexico -- Pemex -- the government's oil
company.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   That's a dependency Mexico has tried hard to shake. A decade
ago, oil money made up 45 percent of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   And oil used to be Mexico's number one export, drawing three out
of every four dollars worth of foreign capital flowing into the
country. Today, as Mexico has built up its manufacturing base, oil
accounts for only 5.4 percent of the foreign revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the economy and the national budget are highly vulnerable
to the ups and downs of international oil prices. Three times this
year Mexican government officials made emergency budget spending
cuts to make up for oil revenue shortfalls. More cuts are expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico will have to operate next year with an austere budget
and somehow depend less on oil revenues,'' said Jonathan Heath, a
Mexico City-based economist. ``That will be tough for a country
like Mexico, where public needs are so great today.''
</P>
<P>
   The bust-and-boom oil price cycles have been even rougher on
Venezuela, who's main crude producer, Petroleos de Venezuela, is
the world's second largest.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela puts out 3 million barrels of crude each day, and
relies on oil to generate 60 percent of its government budget
revenue and 80 percent of its foreign income.
</P>
<P>
   The result: recession and political instability this year as the
price for Venezuelan crude hit a 12-year low; oil revenue is off by
a third; the government has slashed spending by $4 billion; and
bank-loan interest rates have soared to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos has opened the door for protectionist politicians like
Hugo Chavez, a former military leader who headed a failed coup in
1992 against then-president Carlos Andres Perez. Chavez is the
front-runner in the race for presidency, which culminates in a
December vote.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has promised to revisit Venezuela's open-door policy on
outside investments in the nation's oil business -- a move that
could crimp the revenues of dozens of foreign companies that
operate in Venezuela. He's even hinted at cutting back on exports
to rich nations, like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez is really the big unknown and he's got investors
scared,'' said Don Bowles, Latin America director for the Economist
Intelligence Unit, a research firm in London. ``Whether he wins,
and what he decides to do if he does, will shape the country's
economic future and could affect the oil industry.''

<P>
   KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ There has never been so much available
oil, which is good news for motorists at gas pumps just about
everywhere -- but here.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices are dropping. So, nervous officials in this oil-rich
sheikhdom might raise the price of gasoline in their own land to
raise money for the government-sponsored lifestyle of free
health-care, full employment and air-conditioned comfort.
</P>
<P>
   High-priced gasoline would be a reversal of fortune for Kuwait.
It's oil reserves make up nearly one-tenth of the world's supply
and gushes up through drill holes to the desert surface without the
pumps needed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks odd and peculiar that, at a time when many countries
are cutting the prices at the gas stations, you're increasing it in
Kuwait,'' said Kuwaiti Oil Minister Saud Nasir Al-Sabah in a recent
interview with Cox News Service. ``That's absurd . . . I don't
think this is something that's acceptable to us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is still good here. Car dealerships are busy every night
and young Kuwaitis can still count on a job in the bloated
government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuwait and its oil-producing neighbors, from wealthy Saudi
Arabia to giant and volatile Iran, are struggling with the
ramifications of low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, the so-called Arab oil embargo shocked
the West. Attempting to keep the U.S. from backing Israel, these
countries threatened to cut oil supplies -- particularly to the
U.S., where frightened Americans rushed to line up their
gas-guzzling automobiles at pumps despite rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   The panic in the West brought a windfall in the Gulf, which
became awash in cash as well as oil. Big countries like Iran and
Iraq could bring their people modern social services, roads and
education. Small countries, like Kuwait, could luxuriate.
</P>
<P>
   It raised the gulf countries' world clout. Arabic became an
official language at the United Nations. The United States started
selling sophisticated military airplanes to the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   But, prompted by the higher prices, new competition in oil
production took off from Mexico to Russia. And, oil importers --
especially the United States -- found ways to conserve.
</P>
<P>
   Today, oil prices are about as low, adjusted for inflation, as
they were before the embargo in 1973. More oil is produced than
ever -- 73 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Persian Gulf oil exporters still sit on 65 percent of
the world's supply, it is losing value. The 11-member OPEC cartel
(including three nations outside the Mideast) will see revenues
drop by a third this year -- down about $40 billion. Since 1980,
the per capita income in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and three other
oil-producing monarchies has dropped by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A continued decline in oil prices could cause hard times here,
leading to radicalism -- or worse, instability -- even among
stalwart American allies like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kuwait has just 1.8 million inhabitants and nearly 10 percent
of the world's oil. But, Kuwaitis are edgy about the soundness of a
system that provides free health-care, subsidized utilities and
charges no income or sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More vulnerable is Saudi Arabia, with about 18 million people.
It is also cutting back benefits -- like the low-income housing
loans for newlyweds -- while trying to calm a restless minority of
have-nots and religious fundamentalists. Unemployment is rising.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More volatile still is Iran. A regional giant with 68 million
people, Iran's government deficit and economic recession could
undercut nascent steps toward detente with the West.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Iraq is another story. Its oil production has been limited by
economic sanctions and industrial disrepair following the Persian
Gulf War. But, should things improve -- and Russia and China have
their way -- its production will kick into gear and add to the oil
glut.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Zalmay Khalilzad, director for Strategic Studies at the Rand
Corp., warns that the United States is still dependent on Persian
Gulf oil supplies. If Americans want low prices, he said, they may
have to be ready to help quell the resulting unrest in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The oil producers tend to make the problem worse. Most have
refused to make tough cuts in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gulf countries, unfortunately, are still dreaming that the
welfare state will last forever,'' said Kuwaiti political scientist
Shamlan al-Essa(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they just try to raise money by pumping and selling
more oil. That lowers the price even more.
</P>
<P>
   Far from controlling the market, OPEC members now are struggling
just to keep their organization together.

   MOSCOW _ Think of the world's major oil powers and the first
images likely to come to mind are of Persian Gulf sheikdoms or the
sun-baked Texas plains.
</P>
<P>
   Think vodka and snow, too.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable portion of the world's future oil and natural gas
supplies will come from Russia and other former Soviet republics,
if Western oil companies can get to it.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Soviet Union seven years ago sparked the
last great oil boom of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Oil giants like Exxon, Amoco, Mobil, Shell, Texaco and British
Petroleum are investing billions of dollars across the continent to
tap oil and gas fields from the Siberian tundra of Russia to the
arid Central Asian plains of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be here and ready with this kind money if it
wasn't worth it,'' said Alexander Ordjonikidze of the Sakhalin
Energy Investment Company, a consortium of Shell, Marathon and
several Japanese partners that is set to begin offshore production
next year off Russia's far east coast.
</P>
<P>
   Worthwhile maybe, but it is far from easy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is the world's second largest energy supplier; it
produces more natural gas than any country in the world and is
third behind Saudi Arabia and the United States in quantities of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   But its teetering economy and aging production facilities have
left its status as an oil and gas giant in a sorry state, pumping
about half the levels it did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Western oil companies have touted themselves as the solution to
Russia's problem -- with partnerships to help Russia extract its
oil and get it to market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet frustrated oil companies have run up against a snarl of
bureaucracy, unfavorable tax conditions and changing terms of the
production deals by Russian partners who want a bigger stake. With
Russia's economy now in crisis and its market reformers on the
political outs, conditions are not expected to improve soon.
</P>
<P>
   Flat world oil prices and a threat of global recession have
further eliminated the urgency and eagerness to push ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Caspian Sea on Russia's southern fringe, billions of
dollars in deals are going forward in a region with the largest new
oil finds in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   It is hailed as the next great Middle East, and the Caspian Sea
basin -- including the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and the breakaway Russian republic
Chechnya -- could be just that.
</P>
<P>
   The region combines the lucrative and dangerous elements of oil,
political unrest and geopolitical implications as the United
States, Russia and Iran vie for influence there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cliche about the former Soviet Union is it is a place with
lots of problems and lots of opportunities. The problems may now
look bigger than they did two or three years ago, but the oil is
still here,'' said Stephen O'Sullivan, an oil and gas industry
analyst in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the Caspian prizes is the Tengiz oil field in
Kazakhstan. Tengiz potentially could produce more than 1 million
barrels a day -- more than the current yield of Alaska's Prudhoe
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But how to get the oil from the Caspian basin to market has been
a source of diplomatic frustration and intrigue. Russia, Iran and
the United States have differing alternatives for pipelines to the
West.
</P>
<P>
   In the far east, an estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil and 400
billion cubic meters of natural gas lie under the waters around
Sakhalin Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Sakhalin consortium so far has spent $1 billion and is
prepared to spend ten times that to fully develop its offshore
fields. But it is stalled by the Russian parliament's refusal to
approve legislation on a production-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma, the lower house of parliament, is dominated by
Communists and die-hard nationalist parties suspicious of the West
and reluctant to share Russia's resources with big oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the allure of Russia is fading. Countries in Latin America
and Asia, whose economies also need foreign investment, have begun
to woo the oil companies. Even Saudi Arabia, which nationalized its
oil interests in the 1970s, is making overtures to Western
companies to buy a stake there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Western oil companies take a very long view in
Russia, but they've begun to direct their attentions elsewhere,''
said O'Sullivan. ``They won't leave completely. But they may be
content to allow the oil to stay in the ground another five, 10 or
20 years longer.''

<P>
   UNDATED - Don't think of ``Gadjo Dilo'' as a foreign film
forcing you to read subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as a marvelous movie through which you can journey
into the world of Romanian Gypsies for only $6. You won't get a
better deal on a more rewarding and exotic journey this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsy filmmaker Tony Gatlif explores his heritage in this sly,
subtle tale of self-discovery and passion.
</P>
<P>
   Stumbling on both is Stephane (Romain Duris), a young Parisian
traveling by foot through the barren plains of Romania.
</P>
<P>
   He has come to this wasteland on a mission both personal and
vague: searching for a Gypsy singer whom his recently deceased
father loved.
</P>
<P>
   His search is transformed when he begins recording a variety of
village musicians, some of them startlingly good.
</P>
<P>
   One night, Stephane falls in with an old drunkard, Izidor
(Isidor Serban), who brings the young man home to his Gypsy
village, where Stephane is looked upon as a crazy outsider (the
``gadjo dilo'' of the title).
</P>
<P>
   The superstitious villagers fret that Stephane will put a curse
on them and steal their chickens and their women, in that order of
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane intends to spend only one night. But he finds himself
caught up in the lives of Izidor, a fiddler who plays at
celebrations, and Sabina (Rona Hartner), a dancer whose energy and
provocative beauty draw Stephane into the Gypsy life.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be drawn in, too, as the wild music and dancing of the
weddings, parties and funerals is irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Out of these slender threads, director Gatlif weaves a tale
about what it means to belong to a culture as apart and demanding
as the Gypsies. Gatlif evokes the great joys and great sorrows of a
people who remain a persecuted minority wherever they live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gadjo Dilo'' is also a surprisingly raunchy film, with a
seduction scene so original and erotic that a dozen Hollywood
directors are probably scheming at this moment how to imitate it.
</P>
<P>
   Gatlif, a Spanish Gypsy who works in France, has explored Gypsy
themes in two previous movies, ``Latcho Drom'' and ``La Terre Au
Ventre.''
</P>
<P>
   He's discovered a secret about great filmmaking: Film something
you love and show the world.
</P>
<P>
   French actor Duris (``When the Cat's Away'') and Hungarian
actress Hartner (``Double Ecstasy'') create one of the hottest
romantic couples in years.
</P>
<P>
   Unrated, ``Gadjo Dilo'' contains profanity, nudity and sex. It
is in Romanian and French with English subtitles. 4 stars. &QL;

NEXTERA HAS WELL-HEELED BACKERS, AMBITIOUS GOALS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND STEVE BAILEY 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Nextera Enterprises Inc. part of the next knowledge industry
megabrand or just another consulting business roll-up?
</P>
<P>
   Most people have never heard of Nextera, a Lexington-based
management consulting firm that picked a particulary bad time last
month to announce its plans to go public. The market for initial
public offerings has since dried up with the rest of the stock
market, making it extremely difficult to launch any new deal for
now.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Nextera special are the people and money behind the
20-month-old company. Nextera has been able to dole out cash and
run up substantial debt for acquisitions thanks to the controlling
interest of Knowledge Universe, a venture backed by former junk
bond king Michael Milken, his real estate investing brother Lowell
Milken, and billionaire Oracle Corp. chief executive Larry Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge Universe captures the new, or at least latest, Michael
Milken persona. Once on top of the financial world at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.; later scorned and sent to prison for two
years on felony securities violations; still later a
philanthropist, high-profile cancer victim, and cookbook author,
Milken has gone through many incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   The Milken brothers and Ellison chipped in $500 million two
years ago to launch Knowledge Universe, which operates out of an
office in Burlingame, Calif. The goal: buy and build a
knowledge-based empire with high name-brand recognition and many
interests, mostly focused on educational services and products.
</P>
<P>
   But Knowledge Universe has spent most of its brief corporate
life operating well below the radar. The venture has been so
low-profile that its telephone number reportedly wasn't even listed
until this year. President Tom Kalinske, a former chief executive
of Mattel Inc. and Sega of America, did not return our calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Milken is really creating, through the businesses he
acquires, this kind of cradle-to-grave lifetime learning
enterprise,'' said Michael Moe, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge Universe spent a third of its cash in 1996 to buy a
48.3 percent interest in CRT Group, Britain's largest vocational
training firm and now called Spring Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Among KU's other ventures: a California child-care company that
operates 255 centers; educational toy company LeapFrog; Bookman
Testing Services of New York; training software publisher MindQ
Publishing Inc. of Reston, Va.; and Productivity Point
International, a Florida-based training company that teaches
computer skills. Knowledge Universe also owns a minority interest
in Nobel Education Dynamics, a Pennsylvania company that runs
elementary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a consulting company like Nextera fit into this
picture?
</P>
<P>
   There is no direct connection between educational ventures and
Nextera. Executives at companies in the process of selling public
stock usually are not allowed to comment on their business and
Nextera officials did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   But Nextera has acted much like Knowledge Universe by
aggressively purchasing companies in niches of the corporate
consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Nextera hired two former executives from
Renaissance Solutions Inc. with broad consulting backgrounds to get
the company off the ground and start making deals.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive Gresham Brebach and chief operating officer
Ronald Bohlin left Renaissance months before it announced a deal to
be acquired by fellow technology consulting firm The Registry. The
combined companies have since been renamed Renaissance Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Brebach and Bohlin were both part of Digital Equipment Corp.'s
earlier efforts to grow its professional services business. Both
had years of previous experience at big consulting firms like
McKinsey &AMP; Co. and Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   At Nextera, they have spent nearly $80 million and have issued
hundreds of thousands of shares to acquire a string of firms like
Sibson &AMP; Co., a human resource consulting firm, and Symmetrix, a
management and technology consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   What makes consulting companies attractive? Healthy businesses
and prospects in a fragmented industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professional service firms are showing good growth and
profitability, which makes them attractive,'' said Joe Nolan, a
partner at GTCR Golder Rauner, a private equity firm in Chicago
that sometimes helps fund companies buying consulting firms.
</P>
<P>
   Nextera said in public documents that it wanted to go public, in
part, so it could offer stock as a currency for more consulting
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Given the IPO market today, it may have to stick to cash.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-five years ago, Arab countries around the
Persian Gulf started an oil embargo that shattered Americans'
complacency over the security of their energy supply.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial oil shortage that began on Oct. 18, 1973, led to
six months of agonizing and improvising by government officials and
drivers desperate to find a service station that still had gas.
</P>
<P>
   In the next quarter-century, the federal government spent more
than $90 billion looking for ways to reduce our reliance on foreign
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Today, over-production and faltering demand from developing
countries has created a worldwide glut of oil. Half the oil
consumed in the United States -- or roughly one-fifth of the
nation's total energy supply -- is imported from Mexico, Canada and
other foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans have apparently forgotten about that crisis of
25 years ago,'' said Cecile Warner, who has not. An engineer who
directs the federal Center for Renewable Energy Resources in
Golden, Colo., she designed, built and lives in ``a passive solar
home that uses less than one-third of the energy of a home built to
today's standards.''
</P>
<P>
   New energy efficiencies have cut petroleum use per person. But
expensive efforts to develop clean, non-nuclear alternatives to
fossil fuels have failed to come up with a product cheap enough to
compete with deregulated oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half our oil now is imported, compared to only a
little more than one-third before the embargo, and that figure is
expected to rise to about two-thirds by 2020,'' Warner cautioned.
``Average vehicle miles per gallon are decreasing because of the
popularity of sport -utility vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, today's SUVs and other light trucks average more than 20
miles per gallon -- while the average car or pick-up of 1973 burned
up a gallon every 14 miles.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason why few Americans even noticed the three
price-propping production cutbacks announced in the last 10 months
by the the Arab and non-Arab countries in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's first two cutbacks flopped. The third, announced in June,
might be taking hold. After sliding from $25 a barrel in October
1996 to under $14 in August, the world price for crude oil has
bobbed up to around $16 in the last two months. The two-dollar jump
translates to about a nickel a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Sales from new suppliers dilute any cutback's effects. ``Russia,
the Caspian Sea region, Asia, West Africa and Latin America'' are
the industry's new frontiers, said Michael Cates, chief economist
of the American Petroleum Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond this, our vulnerability to such disruptions has been
significantly reduced by the development of the (federal) Strategic
Petroleum Reserve,'' Cates said. The reserve's storage pits hold
enough crude oil to make up for the loss of all U.S. imports for
about 60 days -- longer in the more likely event that only part of
the imports are blocked. The reserve system worked well in 1990
during and after the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   But the 1973 embargo was another story. The Saudis announced
that if the United States continued supporting Israel militarily,
it wouldn't be allowed to buy Arab oil.
</P>
<P>
   That threat was issued just one day after 11 Arab nations agreed
in Kuwait City to raise the charge for their oil by 17 percent and
prop up the new price by cutting their production by five percent
each month.
</P>
<P>
   Defying the economic and political threat, the United States
continued to re-supply the Israelis as they drove back the
Soviet-supplied armies of Syria and Egypt, which had invaded Israel
earlier in the month on the solemn Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence in American leaders was sinking that month, as
Vice President Spiro Agnew was forced to resign and President
Richard Nixon ordered the firing of the Watergate special
prosecutor. In addition, an elaborate system of price and wage
controls had failed to prevent heating-oil shortages the previous
winter and disruptions of the gasoline supply that summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall consumers following our delivery trucks and when the
truck arrived at the station, it would be trailing a ready-made
line of cars waiting for gas,'' said Leo Liebowitz, president and
CEO of Getty Oil, an independent oil marketer on Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pumping about 52,000 gallons a month, but as soon as
the embargo hit, I was cut back to 26,000,'' remembered station
owner Larry Beattie of Augusta, Ga. ``I think the oil companies and
the government, both of them, overdid it, and, of course, there was
a little abuse of the situation by some people on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Station closings were most common in Florida, Georgia, the
Carolinas and Tennessee. ``We'd have 70 to 100 dealers who'd spend
their own money to go up to Washington and lobby for relief,'' said
Jack Houston, retired executive director of the Georgia Association
of Petroleum Retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who used to wait until their gas tank was three-quarters
empty began refilling when their tank was three-quarters full.
``Better safe than sorry,'' said Lois Epstein's grandfather, when
she asked why they were lined up to buy gasoline for the second day
in a row. Multiplied by millions of motorists, that precaution
drained oil terminals, tank farms and refineries of surpluses that
could have eased the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, now a senior engineer with the Environmental Defense
Fund, said she worries that oil today is so cheap and plentiful
that careless companies lack economic incentives to fix leaky
equipment that could contaminate water or soil.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   At the embargo's peak, crude oil imports dropped by 17 percent.
The 38-cent average price for gasoline jumped to 54 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, a governor who three years later would be elected
president, asked Georgia's state employes to save electricity by
using the stairs instead of the elevators at work.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans heeded Nixon's pleas to turn down their
home and office thermostats to 68 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines conserved jet fuel by packing more passengers onto
fewer flights. They overbooked so heavily that when consumer
advocate Ralph Nader was bumped, a federal district judge ordered
the airline to pay him $25,100.
</P>
<P>
   The big neon signs in front of motels blinked off. Nixon parked
Air Force One and caught a commercial flight to his home in
California. That year, the lights on the national Christmas tree
erected outside the White House each December were kept turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices stayed up, and Israel reached a truce with Syria and
Egypt. Missions accomplished, the Arabs halted their embargo in
March 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But many older Americans still suspect it was all a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what was going on,'' recalled Lee Ramsnyder, who
operated the Lan-Mar Marina on Georgia's Lake Lanier. ``I remember
hearing there was a secret supply in Louisiana or someplace like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We pumped most of our gas to boaters on weekends, and we kept
running out by Sunday afternoon,'' he said. ``I think maybe a lot
of it was done by the government to pull us out of a little
recession by making people back up a bit on fuel use and dig in.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ramsnyder rebuilds used tour buses, installs luxuries
ranging from stoves and showers to trash compactors, and then sells
the vehicles to entertainers and other travelers who don't care
that they only get about eight miles to the gallon.

   MAIN-STREET (Undated) _ The flap of American flags on lampposts
and the pages of a paperback flipped by a shop owner on a bench
outside her antiques store were the only things moving on a recent
afternoon in downtown Marceline, Mo. There was one customer and one
waitress down at Mom's Coffee Shop. Both were smoking. It was a
landscape out of ``The Last Picture Show,'' except for the new
street sign. It read ``Main Street USA,'' beneath a halo of mouse
ears. A light year away in Fort Collins, Colo., the pedestrian mall
known as ``the old town'' was thriving with after-school activity.
There was a line to use the phone at the Paris on the Poudre cafe;
teen-agers painted each other with trial-run Halloween makeup
outside an Aveda bath shop. Pool balls clacked in the back room of
the new cigar bar. This is a tale of the two main streets that
inspired the ultimate urban fantasy: Disneyland's Main Street, USA.

   HERBAL-VILLAGE (Fulton, Md.) _ About a month ago, I stopped by
Jim Duke's garden to check out the little six-acre spread he calls
Herbal Village. Fulton is one of those little burgs off the
interstate, where the farms have given over to ranch houses, with
guys out on their power mowers every Saturday, riding herd on their
lawns. But Duke's place is as different as the man himself, who
looks more like a 69-year-old hippie, standing barefoot by his
kudzu vine, than an eminent botanist, with 20 books and 200
scientific papers under his belt (if he wore one with his cutoffs).
Last August, with the help of a few friends, Dr. Duke planted about
200 medicinal herbs, in 80 plots, each devoted to some disease or
ailment. By Anne Raver.

little bottles of real-world fragrances like Rubber, Dirt and

   SOLOMONOFF-HOME (New York) _ Over the last decades, work has
increasingly invaded the home and changed the way Americans view
the domestic landscape. Wing chairs, mantelpieces and newel posts
make little sense for houses that double as offices: cozy images
send unprofessional cues to clients, and cocoon people into
thinking their workday never starts. ``Baking cookies and ironing
shirts was not the image I had in mind,'' said Galia Solomonoff, an
architect who recently bought a former karate school to transform
into a live-in Manhattan workplace. ``I wanted to construct a house
around the way we actually live, not with cliches, and the most
important thing was that domesticity not interfere with my work.''

   BEIJING _ Oil barons around the world, take heart: China's leap
toward prosperity has caused nearly 1 million families to switch
from bicycles to cars.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the coming of the car culture to China isn't going to
shock the world's oil markets, as did the Arab oil embargo of
1973-74.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Chinese private car phenomenon should gain momentum
in the next few years just when the rest of Asia is soaring back
from its current economic crisis, the combined impact on world oil
prices could be dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The simple mechanism of supply-and-demand could slowly crimp the
world oil market in much the same way as members of OPEC did in the
oil cartel's heyday, when they agreed to cut production quotas --
and then stuck to the rules. Gradually, oil would become less
available and the price would go up.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the number of private cars in China has jumped from
virtually zero five years ago to at least 699,000, according to a
report by the China Automobile Market Survey and Research Society.
China's auto makers are now increasing the production of passenger
sedans by 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2000, there will be at least 1 million privately
owned vehicles in China's cities,'' the research society declared.
``In major municipalities and provincial capitals, the ownership
rate among families will reach five(CQ) percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, since 1996 China has ``trimmed'' the production of
bicycles, the China Light Industry News reported last month. It
attributed the fall-off to ``shrinking market demand'' and
``accelerated development of the automobile industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Though affluence is on the rise in China, the rest of Asia is in
a deep recession. This has flattened Asia's spectacular 5
percent-a-year growth in oil consumption that generally kept world
prices above $24 a barrel throughout the 1980s. When Asia's energy
demand sagged last year, world oil prices slid by this summer to
below $11 a barrel, their lowest level (on an inflation-adjusted
basis) since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, almost every expert believes that Asian oil demand will
start to rebound fairly soon. When that happens, it will probably
spell the end of cheap gasoline around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Writing this March in the American journal ``Foreign Affairs,''
world oil experts Daniel Yergin, Dennis Eklof and Jefferson Edwards
predicted that overall Asian energy consumption ``will again rise
sharply in two or three years'' -- once Japan and its neighbors
solve their internal economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the lowest trough of the Asian economic doldrums,
Asian countries consume about 19 million barrels of oil a day.
That's just over one-fourth of the oil that is used worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Oil fields in Asia produce just 8 million barrels for Asia's
daily needs; the remaining 11 million barrels a day must be
imported. Three-fourths of Asia's imported petroleum comes from the
Persian Gulf, with Saudi Arabia by far the largest supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sum, the prospects for Asia's oil supply look decidedly
grim,'' wrote Yergin, Eklof and Edwards. ``By 2010, (Asian)
productive capacity will have declined 6 percent from its 2005
peak, with new oil field developments unable to compensate for
maturing Indonesian, Malaysian and Australian fields. So regardless
of exploration, Asia is destined to import more than 20 million
barrels of oil per day by 2010, compared with approximately 11
million today.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   China is the newest and fastest-growing customer for Middle East
oil. Until five years ago, China was proud of its status as an
``energy-independent'' oil exporter. But thanks to its own meteoric
economic growth, China now imports 25 percent of its oil, amounting
to 1 million barrels a day. So far, most is for industrial uses and
only a small fraction for private cars.
</P>
<P>
   China derives another 3 million barrels a day of oil from
domestic oil wells while obtaining the balance of its energy from
massive reliance on coal, and hydro-electric and a few nuclear
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of China's imported oil now comes from Saudi Arabia, Iran
and the United Arab Emirates. Determined to diversify its oil
sources beyond the Persian Gulf, China's national petroleum
corporation last year outbid some of the biggest Western oil
companies for the right to help develop some of the choicest
Caspian Sea Basin oil properties in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, China's steep increases in oil imports worries some
Chinese energy experts. Early last year retired scientists Yang
Jike, the former vice president of China's national environmental
protection committee, published a warning that it was better to
rely
</P>
<P>
   on coal than imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   If China allowed its oil imports to increase, ``China will get
entangled in Middle East politics, like the United States,'' Yang
wrote.

   THEN AND NOW: CHANGES SINCE THE 1973 ARAB OIL EMBARGO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Imports, 28 percent of total U.S. oil consumption in 1973,
have risen to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), which supplied 54 percent of the world's crude oil, now
provide 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Inflation-adjusted retail prices have risen 6.5 percent for
gasoline and 7 percent for electricity in those 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inflation-adjusted price paid by refiners for crude oil
has risen by 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inflation-adjusted price of natural gas as it comes out of
the ground has increased by 187 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. consumption of petroleum is up by 13 percent, though the
nation's growing population means that on a per-person basis, it is
down by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Improved exploration and development technology has cut the
cost of finding new oil and gas wells by 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The average car then got 14 miles per gallon, compared to
today's 28.5 miles per gallon for a car and 20.4 miles per gallon
for light trucks -- including minivans, sport utility vehicles and
small pickups.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Today's average car or light truck has 25 percent more
horsepower than its equivalent in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The 31 percent share of homes heated by oil has dropped to 17
percent. The main reason: The 54 percent share of new homes heated
by natural gas has risen to 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Electric utilities, which got 17 percent of their power from
oil before the embargo, get only 2.5 percent from oil today.
Natural gas, then 18 percent of fuel for utilities, fell to 9.5
percent. To make up the difference, coal rose from 46 percent to
nearly 57 percent of utility fuel, and nuclear rose from 4.5
percent to about about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  While U.S. energy consumption has increased by 27 percent
since the embargo, energy use has grown so much faster in other
countries that the U.S. share of the world's energy consumption has
dropped from 31 percent in 1973 to 25 percent today.

HATE-CRIME LAWS A CONTINUING SOURCE OF DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Within a day of his son's death, less than a week after
his son was beaten and tied to a fence post in near-freezing
temperatures, Dennis Shepard issued a quiet warning against ``just
passing all kinds of new hate crime laws.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, to some, an odd comment at that hour. Elsewhere in the
country, the beating death of the 21-year-old gay Wyoming student
sparked anti-bias demonstrations and vigils, and both Sen. Edward
Kennedy and President Clinton immediately called for a broader
federal law punishing violent racial and sexual attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But to some free speech activists in Boston, particularly those
who objected to expanded state hate-crime legislation enacted in
1996, Shepard's remark was a natural response to the increasing
number of such laws, which add substantial penalties to existing
offenses if they were accompanied by statements reflecting bias
against a protected group.
</P>
<P>
   The father's comment also raised crucial questions: Does
singling out slurs as potential incitements to violence really
work? And where, exactly, is the line between a hate crime and an
unpopular point of view?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very hard problem,'' said Wendy Kaminer, a public
policy fellow at Radcliffe College. ``On the one hand, I think that
law has some symbolic value...But I'm also troubled by a law that
says an assault is worse if we don't like the attitude behind it.
It's a kind of thought policing.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the country, 40 states have passed hate crime laws in
order to mete out harsher punishment to crimes committed with bias
in mind. Definitions vary; in nearly half the states with such
laws, homosexuals are not among those protected against bias crime.
</P>
<P>
   In Wyoming, where on Monday police charged Russell A. Henderson
and Aaron J. McKinney with first-degree murder in Shepard's death,
there is no hate crime law _ despite several attempts to pass one.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the murder, Gov. Jim Geringer urged legislators
to pass one, even as Shepard's father said he hoped the killing
would not be twisted into a political platform. Sen. Kennedy also
pushed ahead with his proposed federal hate crime legislation,
which would widen the definition of possible hate crime victims to
include gays, women or the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hopeful after the tragedy in Wisconsin, which has shocked
the conscience of the nation, that Congress will pass the Hate
Crimes Act before adjourning for the year,'' he said in a prepared
statement.
</P>
<P>
   But in Massachusetts, where such laws have included broad
definitions since 1996, questions remained about the effectiveness
of singling out one particular sort of violent crime. Even Gary
Busek, executive director of the Boston-based Gay &AMP; Lesbian
Advocates &AMP; Defenders, a gay-rights group, admitted ``the laws
certainly don't mean that hate crimes don't continue to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The existence of the law is a good thing, but it isn't a
silver bullet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more troubling than its possible ineffectiveness, according
to Boston attorney Harvey Silverglate, is the slippery nature of a
law that punishes unpopular thought.
</P>
<P>
   If someone is convicted of beating a man at random, the prison
sentence could be up to ten years; if the same crime is found to
have been fueled by bias, then it can be considered a ``triple
felony,'' carrying up to 25 years in prison. Arguing against that
standard, Kaminer pointed out that ``all murder is horrible,'' and
Silverglate agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The author of a recent book on freedom of speech on campuses,
where codes attempting to prevent hate speech have been applied
across the nation since the late '80s, Silverglate said he is
especially angered by Clinton's renewed call for expanded
hate-crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to devote most of a scheduled lecture at the
Boston Public Library to arguing against such measures, claiming
they would have had no effect in discouraging Shepard's murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current legislation should be repealed,'' Silverglate
said. ``We have laws against murder, we have laws against
desecration of property, we have laws against threats. To begin to
single out certain people because of certain characteristics is
dangerous. ... Equality before the law is the only thing that saves
us.''

<P>
   KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ There has never been so much available
oil, which is good news for motorists at gas pumps just about
everywhere -- but here.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices are dropping. So, nervous officials in this oil-rich
sheikhdom might raise the price of gasoline in their own land to
raise money for the government-sponsored lifestyle of free
health-care, full employment and air-conditioned comfort.
</P>
<P>
   High-priced gasoline would be a reversal of fortune for Kuwait.
It's oil reserves make up nearly one-tenth of the world's supply
and gushes up through drill holes to the desert surface without the
pumps needed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks odd and peculiar that, at a time when many countries
are cutting the prices at the gas stations, you're increasing it in
Kuwait,'' said Kuwaiti Oil Minister Saud Nasir Al-Sabah in a recent
interview with Cox News Service. ``That's absurd . . . I don't
think this is something that's acceptable to us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is still good here. Car dealerships are busy every night
and young Kuwaitis can still count on a job in the bloated
government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuwait and its oil-producing neighbors, from wealthy Saudi
Arabia to giant and volatile Iran, are struggling with the
ramifications of low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, the so-called Arab oil embargo shocked
the West. Attempting to keep the U.S. from backing Israel, these
countries threatened to cut oil supplies -- particularly to the
U.S., where frightened Americans rushed to line up their
gas-guzzling automobiles at pumps despite rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   The panic in the West brought a windfall in the Gulf, which
became awash in cash as well as oil. Big countries like Iran and
Iraq could bring their people modern social services, roads and
education. Small countries, like Kuwait, could luxuriate.
</P>
<P>
   It raised the gulf countries' world clout. Arabic became an
official language at the United Nations. The United States started
selling sophisticated military airplanes to the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   But, prompted by the higher prices, new competition in oil
production took off from Mexico to Russia. And, oil importers --
especially the United States -- found ways to conserve.
</P>
<P>
   Today, oil prices are about as low, adjusted for inflation, as
they were before the embargo in 1973. More oil is produced than
ever -- 73 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Persian Gulf oil exporters still sit on 65 percent of
the world's supply, it is losing value. The 11-member OPEC cartel
(including three nations outside the Mideast) will see revenues
drop by a third this year -- down about $40 billion. Since 1980,
the per capita income in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and three other
oil-producing monarchies has dropped by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A continued decline in oil prices could cause hard times here,
leading to radicalism -- or worse, instability -- even among
stalwart American allies like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kuwait has just 1.8 million inhabitants and nearly 10 percent
of the world's oil. But, Kuwaitis are edgy about the soundness of a
system that provides free health-care, subsidized utilities and
charges no income or sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More vulnerable is Saudi Arabia, with about 18 million people.
It is also cutting back benefits -- like the low-income housing
loans for newlyweds -- while trying to calm a restless minority of
have-nots and religious fundamentalists. Unemployment is rising.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More volatile still is Iran. A regional giant with 68 million
people, Iran's government deficit and economic recession could
undercut nascent steps toward detente with the West.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Iraq is another story. Its oil production has been limited by
economic sanctions and industrial disrepair following the Persian
Gulf War. But, should things improve -- and Russia and China have
their way -- its production will kick into gear and add to the oil
glut.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Zalmay Khalilzad, director for Strategic Studies at the Rand
Corp., warns that the United States is still dependent on Persian
Gulf oil supplies. If Americans want low prices, he said, they may
have to be ready to help quell the resulting unrest in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The oil producers tend to make the problem worse. Most have
refused to make tough cuts in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gulf countries, unfortunately, are still dreaming that the
welfare state will last forever,'' said Kuwaiti political scientist
Shamlan al-Essa(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they just try to raise money by pumping and selling
more oil. That lowers the price even more.
</P>
<P>
   Far from controlling the market, OPEC members now are struggling
just to keep their organization together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole situation is very different than it was in the
past,'' Al Sabah said. ``We have to be extremely careful about
mixing oil and politics.''

   MOSCOW _ Think of the world's major oil powers and the first
images likely to come to mind are of Persian Gulf sheikdoms or the
sun-baked Texas plains.
</P>
<P>
   Think vodka and snow, too.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable portion of the world's future oil and natural gas
supplies will come from Russia and other former Soviet republics,
if Western oil companies can get to it.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Soviet Union seven years ago sparked the
last great oil boom of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Oil giants like Exxon, Amoco, Mobil, Shell, Texaco and British
Petroleum are investing billions of dollars across the continent to
tap oil and gas fields from the Siberian tundra of Russia to the
arid Central Asian plains of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be here and ready with this kind money if it
wasn't worth it,'' said Alexander Ordjonikidze of the Sakhalin
Energy Investment Company, a consortium of Shell, Marathon and
several Japanese partners that is set to begin offshore production
next year off Russia's far east coast.
</P>
<P>
   Worthwhile maybe, but it is far from easy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is the world's second largest energy supplier; it
produces more natural gas than any country in the world and is
third behind Saudi Arabia and the United States in quantities of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   But its teetering economy and aging production facilities have
left its status as an oil and gas giant in a sorry state, pumping
about half the levels it did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Western oil companies have touted themselves as the solution to
Russia's problem -- with partnerships to help Russia extract its
oil and get it to market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet frustrated oil companies have run up against a snarl of
bureaucracy, unfavorable tax conditions and changing terms of the
production deals by Russian partners who want a bigger stake. With
Russia's economy now in crisis and its market reformers on the
political outs, conditions are not expected to improve soon.
</P>
<P>
   Flat world oil prices and a threat of global recession have
further eliminated the urgency and eagerness to push ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Caspian Sea on Russia's southern fringe, billions of
dollars in deals are going forward in a region with the largest new
oil finds in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   It is hailed as the next great Middle East, and the Caspian Sea
basin -- including the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and the breakaway Russian republic
Chechnya -- could be just that.
</P>
<P>
   The region combines the lucrative and dangerous elements of oil,
political unrest and geopolitical implications as the United
States, Russia and Iran vie for influence there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cliche about the former Soviet Union is it is a place with
lots of problems and lots of opportunities. The problems may now
look bigger than they did two or three years ago, but the oil is
still here,'' said Stephen O'Sullivan, an oil and gas industry
analyst in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the Caspian prizes is the Tengiz oil field in
Kazakhstan. Tengiz potentially could produce more than 1 million
barrels a day -- more than the current yield of Alaska's Prudhoe
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But how to get the oil from the Caspian basin to market has been
a source of diplomatic frustration and intrigue. Russia, Iran and
the United States have differing alternatives for pipelines to the
West.
</P>
<P>
   In the far east, an estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil and 400
billion cubic meters of natural gas lie under the waters around
Sakhalin Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Sakhalin consortium so far has spent $1 billion and is
prepared to spend ten times that to fully develop its offshore
fields. But it is stalled by the Russian parliament's refusal to
approve legislation on a production-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma, the lower house of parliament, is dominated by
Communists and die-hard nationalist parties suspicious of the West
and reluctant to share Russia's resources with big oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the allure of Russia is fading. Countries in Latin America
and Asia, whose economies also need foreign investment, have begun
to woo the oil companies. Even Saudi Arabia, which nationalized its
oil interests in the 1970s, is making overtures to Western
companies to buy a stake there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Western oil companies take a very long view in
Russia, but they've begun to direct their attentions elsewhere,''
said O'Sullivan. ``They won't leave completely. But they may be
content to allow the oil to stay in the ground another five, 10 or
20 years longer.''

UKRAINIAN IMMIGRANT MAKES HIS MENSWARE DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE _ Yuri Kroutskikh has nerve.
</P>
<P>
   A Ukrainian immigrant, his English is iffy. His job _ a tailor
at Saks Fifth Avenue in Boston _ is low profile. And his name,
Kroutskikh, is, in his own opinion, unpronounceable.
</P>
<P>
   So why does this guy think he's got the stuff to become a famous
fashion designer?
</P>
<P>
   He runs a mean sewing machine. So mean, in fact, that he demands
$1,600 for the business suits he creates. And he's getting it.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Kroutskikh (who prefers to be called by his
grandmother's maiden name Misharev) will make his official Boston
debut as part of Boston Fashion Week, which is designed in part to
educate the public that this city does generate fashion talent.
Misharev joins more than 20 local designers who are showing their
wares on various catwalks this week.
</P>
<P>
   Misharev, who was born, raised, and trained in the Ukraine,
stands out from the pack. His menswear show will feature striking
garments such as a reversible three-quarter-length coat that is
tweed on one side, leather on the other. A full-length raincoat is
transparent to show off the clothes underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The designer is expecting about 50 people to visit his showroom,
where models will walk through informally, not on a runway. Of
course, it's doubtful he'll be seeing influential buyers from
stores like Neiman Marcus or, alas, even his employer Saks.
``People won't accept new names,'' says the slender, 6-foot-1,
33-year-old, in a heavy accent. ``But I like the competition
because I'm very skilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Misharev, the son of a university professor and an accountant,
grew up a long way from high fashion. ``In the former Soviet Union,
everyone wore drab colors _ black, blue and gray,'' he says (at a
time when those weren't the ``in'' colors). ``We didn't have
access'' to world-class fashion shows or magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Misharev was crazy about clothes. He attended a
vocational school for pattern-making and equipment use, and a
fashion design school in Kiev, his home city.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Misharev _ with his wife Yanina Zabrodina, a
doctor _ followed some friends and moved to Boston. ``We left the
Ukraine because it wasn't a good time economically and politically.
I couldn't establish myself as a designer there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, in contrast, he says people stop him on the street to
ask where he buys his clothing. When he explains the clothes are
his creations, ``Sometimes they don't believe me.''

   After working in the alterations department at Saks for about
four years, Misharev mustered the nerve to start his own business
last year _ selling custom suits, jackets, and other menswear out
of his apartment via word of mouth. ``Most of the collection I did
at night,'' drafting patterns on a pool table.
</P>
<P>
   And customers came, despite an average suit price of $1,600 and
outerwear for $350 to $400. Some of them had heard of his skill at
Saks. Others saw his handiwork on friends. ``When I got to his loft
and saw the suits, it took me about a millisecond to decide that I
wanted one,'' says Keith Hanson, a Norwood resident who initially
approached Misharev for some alterations.
</P>
<P>
   A regular shopper at Neiman Marcus and Saks, Hanson was struck
by Misharev's craftsmanship. He quickly ordered a $1,200 suit and
three pairs of trousers for $900. He liked the details like
reversible pleats on the pants (achieved by buttoning a flap in one
direction or another, completely changing the look), jacket cuffs
cut at an angle, and back pockets slanted on the trousers. ``Not
too many people pay attention to detail in pants. This is taking it
to another level,'' says Hanson.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Misharev's other signatures include: suit jackets made
with front vents for easy access to pockets; coat collars adorned
with faux fur; and long suit jackets tailored to emphasize the
body. His fabrics, mostly wools and silks that customers select
themselves from look books, come from France, Italy, Portugal,
Japan, Korea, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although Misharev has never shown his work in Boston, he did
unveil a collection of about 20 outfits to 50 retailers (including
Lord &AMP; Taylor) and editors during men's fashion week in New York
this summer. It was a bold move, since most of the designers who
show there are in the big leagues, like Donna Karan and Tommy
Hilfiger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent our portfolio to 7th on Sixth (the organizers), and
they accepted us, after the deadline. We were lucky,'' says
Zabrodina, who manages the business's finances in addition to
working part time as a researcher at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sewed all the clothes ourselves and found some models to
model free,'' adds Misharev. ``Some friends helped backstage, and a
makeup artist worked for free. It was great.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, called Y&AMP;Y Apparel Inc., didn't receive any orders
after the show, but Misharev is satisfied; it was strictly a debut.
``I have a timetable of three to five years to establish my name,''
he says. ``I believe in myself. I'm going to be famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Misharev plans to show his clothes in a booth at a
retail trade show in New York. His agenda is to return luxury
dressing to the everyday lifestyle. ``I'd like to see gentlemen
(dress) more elegantly,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Misharev has a long way to go. He has only 20
regular customers. He can't slash his prices because, with no
manufacturing help, he can spend more than 30 hours on one
hand-sewn suit. The designer says a few investors have approached
him about buying into his company, but that would mean reduced
control, something he's not ready for. ``It's hard to start a
business, basically from zero,'' says Zabrodina.
</P>
<P>
   But Misharev is hopeful. ``America is a wonderful market, if you
can prove yourself.''

NEW ENGLAND CRANBERRY GROWERS ARE EDGED OUT BY WISCONSIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARVER, Mass. _ For cranberry grower Clark Griffith, the red
tide of enthusiasm that led droves of farmers to try their hand at
cultivating the tart berry in recent years can't turn too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Cranberry-scented air fresheners. Cranberry wine.
Cranberry-flavored horseradish. Space-age, freeze-dried cranberry
powders for flavoring and coloring almost anything imaginable.
They're all out there.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of an industry plan to use an avalanche of
new berries to give red M&AMP;M candies their crimson color, some
growers began thinking they might have been looking at the world
through rose-tinted glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just too many cranberry growers these days,''
Griffith said, standing near a bog bobbing with berries being
harvested. ``The only way to solve the problem is to get out there
and make people want more.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in tiny Carver, in the heart of Massachusetts'
cranberry-growing country, cultivators of the jewel-red fruit who
gathered yesterday at the Massachusetts Cranberry Harvest Festival
found themselves standing at a crossroad.
</P>
<P>
   Once the king of cranberry producers, Massachusetts has been
edged out in recent years by Wisconsin, where bogs are now as
ubiquitous as barns. Other states, including New Jersey and Oregon,
have also cranked up output.
</P>
<P>
   For Massachusetts' 500 or so growers, more than half of whom
belong to the Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. cooperative, the past
two years have had disappointing harvests. Thanks to a soggy
spring, the state's harvest this year, expected at around 200
million pounds, or a third of the national total, will be 5 percent
below last year's haul.
</P>
<P>
   While cooperative growers get paid for every berry they produce,
a leveling off in consumer demand and general oversupply have kept
the prices they receive from rising.
</P>
<P>
   This year, growers are looking at $60 a barrel, about the same
as last year. (A barrel holds 100 pounds). At the height of the
cranberry craze in 1996 and 1997, independent growers not allied
with Ocean Spray were paid up to $110 per barrel amid fierce
skirmishes for supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive rivalries are still afoot in bogs across the
country. For proof, look no further than the red royalty that
traveled all the way from Wisconsin to check out Carver's festival,
which continues through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Massachusetts, the proceeds from this festival go to the
growers, but we take money from our festivals and give it back to
the community,'' said June Potter, a cranberry grower from Warrens,
Wisc., population 400. ``And the marshes here are much smaller and
more irregular,'' she said. ``Ours are straight and
laser-leveled.''
</P>
<P>
   A fresh-faced teenage girl standing next to her nodded solemnly.
``Ours are perfect,'' said Amy Nemitz, 17, the Warrens Cranberry
Festival Queen, who sported a diamond tiara that attracted
inquisitive looks.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray, based in Lakeville and Middleborough, is to
cranberries what South Africa's De Beers is to diamonds. Owned by
grower-members, it accounts for 70 percent of all domestic
cranberry production. The cooperative was responsible for creating
new demand in recent years, with splashy advertising campaigns that
fueled a consumption craze and new products and inspired a fresh
generation of growers.
</P>
<P>
   While cranberries may be reaching their application limits in
this country, Ocean Spray says it's not reaping a bitter harvest.
But it admits it may have created a sour pill to swallow. ``We have
the acreage we need right now,'' said Irene Sorensen, Ocean's
Spray's head of grower relations, meaning that the cooperative is
no longer expanding by admitting new members.
</P>
<P>
   Growers insist that changing supply and demand isn't about to
turn bog cultivation into trench warfare. ``Whatever's good for the
cranberry is good for all of us,'' said Carolyne Gilmore, a
Rochester grower who also publishes a trade newsletter called
Cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   While brimming with Midwestern friendliness, Potter isn't so
sure. ``There's getting to be oversupply,'' she said, shaking her
head as golden trees stood drenched in the gray distance.
</P>
<P>
   Now the cranberry's mission lies overseas. Growers are scouring
the globe to see whether the British, Taiwanese, and Lithuanians
could be persuaded to develop a hankering for the acidic berry, one
of only three fruits native to North America. (Concord grapes and
blueberries are the others).
</P>
<P>
   ``The craze here has tempered a bit,'' said Carol Gifune,
marketing manager for Carver-based Decas Brothers Cranberry Sales,
a prominent independent grower and a rival to Ocean Spray. ``The
race is on to find new markets.''

WHAT IF `PLAYBOY' HAD AN ESSAY TEST? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I already know I'm not ``Playboy'' material. I'm a
mess.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't been completely naked since I was 4, and besides, God
didn't intend for me to be a Playmate when he made me. I don't run,
I gallop. I don't walk, I trod. I'll eat lunch and talk to five
people afterward before I realize I have refried beans on my cheek.
Sometimes on accident I spit on people when I talk. I once flossed
my teeth with a strand of my own hair. Each of my hips has enough
shelf space to balance a bushel of potatoes without using my hands.
</P>
<P>
   But here I was, sitting in a villa at the Arizona Biltmore
resort, wrapped in a thick, thirsty white bathrobe with a bunny
embroidered on the lapel, filling out an application for the
Playboy Playmate 2000 contest.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't really my idea, honest. I had been sent to cover the
contest for a feature story and was interviewing the photo editor,
Kevin, when I decided to put him on the spot and ask him what he
thought my chances were of becoming the centerfold of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should try out,'' he flattered me. ``You never know when
we'll want to do a spread with reporters and writers!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if you pick me, you'll have to pay for my liposuction,''
I said. ``I've got enough lard in just one of these cheeks to make
tamales for every man, woman, child and wild dog in the state of
Oaxaca!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should do it,'' he urged. ``How else can you write about
what the tryouts are like?''
</P>
<P>
   He was kind of right, I thought, and hell, I'm always up for a
humiliating experience that leaves me feeling entirely inadequate
and rather hopeless, an experience that's equivalent to taking your
self-esteem balloon and throwing it on a cactus.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding me was a roomful of mutants, genetically blessed
creatures that have no business calling themselves ``human,'' all
clad in bikinis, high heels and robes swinging wide open. One of
them didn't have a single freckle on her entire body, and another
one had what I can only assume were the bones of her pelvis poking
out so far they nearly broke her skin. I looked down at my own arm,
sprinkled with enough spots and dots to make their own
constellations, and thought, ``Man, the next time someone sees the
bones of my pelvis, it will be at my autopsy!''
</P>
<P>
   There were so many boobs in that room _ the only thing that
popped into my head was ``Got milk?'' There was one lady who was so
. . . bountiful that I couldn't figure out how she even managed to
brush her teeth, and that's when I realized I was staring at THEM.
At her. I felt like a guy, but I couldn't help it. They were circus
big, and defied gravity so devoutly I was positive the implants
were reinforced by magnets.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many payments do you have left?'' I wanted to ask her, but
I was afraid that she'd hit me with one of them and knock me out
cold. So what if my ``best feature'' touches my lap when I sit
down, so what, I reminded myself. At least they don't accrue a 19
percent annual interest rate on my Visa.
</P>
<P>
   I took a deep breath and settled down to fill out the
application form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Height,'' the application requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five foot 6,'' I fudged.
</P>
<P>
   Weight. ``N/A,'' I wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Hair. I thought a moment. ``Clean,'' I jotted. ``AND strong
enough to dislodge a particularly stubborn piece of corn!''
</P>
<P>
   Special achievement. ``In 1994, I quit smoking,'' I scribbled,
``gained 40 pounds, and got a guy to marry me anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   I signed the model release just in time for David, the
photographer, to tell me that he was ready for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' he said as I entered the bedroom they had set up as a
studio, ``you can disrobe now.''
</P>
<P>
   I untied the robe and stood there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Um,'' he said, looking at me, still covered in my gray jumper,
black shirt and tights. ``Didn't you want to . . . change?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I take any of this off,'' I said kindly, ``waves of horror
will burn your corneas to a crisp, and you'll probably grab the
nearest utensil to claw them out yourself. Really, I'm acting in
your best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   David nodded. ``OK, well, then, lean on the bed over here and
kind of shake your hair with your hands,'' he instructed me. ``Now
smile!''
</P>
<P>
   I leaned on the bed, I lifted my arms up to tousle my hair, I
smiled. Then I smelled bagels. Onion bagels. ``You have snacks in
here?'' I asked, looking around.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said as he clicked the first photo. ``Turn your head
more to the right.''
</P>
<P>
   I complied, thinking him stingy not to share until I caught a
really strong whiff of a Jewish deli and realized it was coming
from my right armpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's enough of that pose!'' I said, shooting my arms
straight down to their sides.
</P>
<P>
   David came over and positioned me for the next photo, turning me
completely around. ``Hold still,'' he said as he backed away.
``Hey, I think lunch is here. I smell onion bagels!''
</P>
<P>
   I stood staring at the wall, and then it hit me. ``You're taking
a heinie shot!'' I cried. ``You're shooting my heinie?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big lens,'' he commented. Click. ``OK, we're done. You
did VERY WELL.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know my mother is going to make me go to confession for
this,'' I said as I handed him back the bathrobe and gathered up my
stuff. ``But if you choose me for a pictorial of reporters, the
only way I'll do it is if you put my nudie shots in between Barbara
Walters' and Helen Thomas'.''
</P>
<P>
   On my way out, I passed by the girl I had gawked at earlier. I
smiled. She smiled slightly, sweeping her eyes over my jumper, then
sneered.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped. ``David said I did VERY WELL,'' I mentioned. ``But I
think I'll actually score a lot higher on the essay part of the
contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Her face dropped. ``There's an essay?'' she said, shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' I nodded. ``With footnotes and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Visibly, her panic grew. ``I can't write with my feet!'' she
cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better start practicing!'' I said with a tiny giggle before I
headed out the door. &QL;

ONCE A PARIAH, SINN FEIN LEADER SNAGS ACCOLADES AND CASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For an Irish leader who shoulders such a heavy
burden of his island's troubled past, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
traveled light on a fund-raising visit here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he will need a large, empty suitcase to carry back all the
U.S. dollars he has raised.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a six-city tour that will gross $500,000 for
Sinn Fein in less than a week's work, Adams, the reed-thin,
bespectacled political philosopher behind the explosive brawn of
the Irish Republican Army was given the kind of welcome normally
reserved for another Irish import _ Bono, the rock star of the band
U2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an honor just to be near him. The guy's a legend now, a
world leader,'' said Brendan Mayer, 22, of Yonkers, who commutes to
a job with the state Department of Environmental Conservation in
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just shook his hand and said, `You're our only hope,''' said
Pat Gioia, a middle-aged upstates New York woman who is an advocate
for the rights of crime victims.
</P>
<P>
   Swarmed over by politicians and business people in pinstripe
suits at a $100-a-ticket fund-raiser at the Omni Hotel and bathed
in the strobe flash of a hundred photo opportunities, Adams has
transformed himself from the fear and loathing of his terrorist tag
into a bona-fide political celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Adams smiled and made small talk Tuesday with the supplicants
who wanted a photo souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those years, he was portrayed as a terrorist, a devil, and
nobody would pay attention to him. This is like a dream come
true,'' said Jean Murray, who, with her husband, Paul Murray,
organized Adams' visit. The couple have raised tens of thousands of
dollars over the past two decades for Sinn Fein through their
leadership roles in New York State Irish Northern Aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``To use a Belfast term, it was magic,'' said Paul Murray, who
estimated the 250-person Omni event and a $20-a-head reception at
the Polish-American Citizens Club in Albany that drew an estimated
600 would bring in about $35,000 for Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein is the political arm of the IRA. Under Adams'
leadership, the organization has embraced peace after years of
violently opposing British rule in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp of legitimacy this time around _ compared to Adams'
1995 visit to Albany when last April's historic Good Friday peace
accord in Northern Ireland was just a dream _ created a striking
contrast for those with a long memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see business people and the corporate community
signing $100 checks to Friends of Sinn Fein, that's when you know
we've turned the corner,'' said Murray, who stood with Adams in the
salad days and now munched on fancy hors d'oeuvres at the Omni.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Downes, the New York City-based fund-raiser for Friends
of Sinn Fein, said the group has raised $3.5 million in the United
States in the past three years and more is on the way. Smaller
cities are consistently bringing in $25,000 and more at events as
the political party's geographical reach expands.
</P>
<P>
   Next spring, Sinn Fein expects to make a fund-raising swing
through the South. Invitations also have arrived from Hawaii and
Montana. ``There's not a state in this country where we couldn't
hold a successful event,'' Downes said.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the money go? After travel and event expenses, Downes
said it is used to fund lobbying activities in a Washington, D.C.,
office with three paid staff members, a New York City office with
one staffer and efforts to modernize the Belfast operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, people in this country have heard clearly
what Gerry Adams and Sinn Fein has to say and like it,'' said Rita
O'Haire, Sinn Fein's lobbyist in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having friends in high places is a new experience for Sinn Fein,
which seemed to handle it in stride. Adams excused his tardiness at
the reception because he was on the phone to the White House,
explained he got the private plane from Pittsburgh at the last
minute with help from Rep. Michael R. McNulty, D-N.Y., and huddled
with Gov. George Pataki in a private room.
</P>
<P>
   Adams joked he went to Albany as ``both a democrat and a
republican (as in Northern Ireland freedom fighter). But he was
deadly serious about the work that needs to be done to nurture the
fragile peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``My visit is to motivate people to keep focused on the prize.
And the prize is a just and a lasting peace,'' Adams said. ``We
want the people of Ireland to live in a united, independent Ireland
at peace with ourselves: Catholics, Protestants and dissenters. And
it is my conviction we will achieve those objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams reached into Ireland's anguished past: ``We want to see a
healing process for all of the pain of the last 30 years and
decades and centuries before that. For hurt done, for hurt
inflicted and for hurt suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   He touched on the hard-fought immigrant stories of Irish
Americans. ``You people here are the survivors,'' he said,
describing a placard he keeps that reads, ``No Irish Need Apply.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You must want to be people who can sit back and talk to the
ghosts of your grandparents and great-grandparents and say to them,
`When Ireland needed me, when the children of Ireland needed me,
when those wanting peace and justice needed me, I helped,''' Adams
said.

<P>
   The flapping American flags on lampposts and the pages of a
paperback flipped by a shop owner on a bench outside her antiques
store were the only things moving on a recent afternoon in downtown
Marceline, Mo. There was one customer and one waitress down at
Mom's Coffee Shop. Both were smoking. It was a landscape out of
``The Last Picture Show,'' except for the new street sign. It read
``Main Street USA,'' beneath a halo of mouse ears.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 650 miles but a light year away in Fort Collins, Colo.,
the pedestrian mall known as ``the old town'' was thriving with
after-school activity. There was a line to use the phone at the
Paris on the Poudre cafe; teen-agers painted each other with
trial-run Halloween makeup outside an Aveda shop. Pool balls
clacked in the back room of the new cigar bar.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tale of the two main streets that inspired the
ultimate urban fantasy: Disneyland's Main Street, U.S.A., a frothy
row of gingerbread storefronts intended to invoke the true grit and
boisterous optimism of turn-of-the-century America.
</P>
<P>
   While not quite a search for the meaning of Rosebud, this is a
visit to see what, if anything, remains in these two towns of the
spirit that moved two of the Magic Kingdom's creators: Walt Disney,
who lived in Marceline from 1905 to 1910, moving there when he was
5, and later mythologized his hometown on Disneyland's Main Street,
and Harper Goff, an art director from Fort Collins, whose earliest
renderings for the Disney park evoked his birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, these two men would freeze-frame their
childhood memories in the amber gloss of a theme park, first in
Anaheim, Calif., and then around the world. And while Disney
specialists point out that there were other sources (and other team
designers), none have turned out to be such poignant two-way
streets of inspiration as Marceline and Fort Collins.
</P>
<P>
   For Marceline, 100 miles northeast of Kansas City, at a defunct
railroad juncture, the per capita income has stalled just above
$10,000, and the Disney connection may be its greatest hope for
survival. In Fort Collins, on the other hand, where recent boom
years have ignited explosive growth and waves of newcomers have
arrived in search of the good life, the natives have become
increasingly wary as gentrification begins to look suspiciously
like Disneyfication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of preservation happening throughout the country,
not just in Fort Collins,'' said Richard Francaviglia, a historical
geographer and author of ``Main Street Revisited'' (University of
Iowa Press, 1996), a study of several hundred small town centers.
``As people are lovingly restoring their towns, they're also
filtering it through so many lenses _ of memory, popular culture _
that they're creating something that never actually existed
before.''

   Disneyland's bright pastels and gingerbread turrets are not much
in evidence in Marceline, but locals still point out the garbage
dump _ a former slag pit outside Disney's bedroom window that he
commemorated as Magic Mountain. This one-strip town (population
2,650, down from 3,000 in 1905) is trying to transform itself into
the official Hometown and hitch its fate to the Disney juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney lived in Marceline for just over four years, while
his father tried and failed to run a farm. Disney Senior was a
jack-of-no-trades who kept his family on the move. His youngest
son, born in Chicago, always maintained that he was just a
small-town boy, albeit one who grew to be the preeminent
interpreter of the nation's PG fantasy life. It was in the
Marceline of the early 1900s that Walt first sketched barnyard
animals and fell in love with trains.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Disney and his brother Roy came back to town for the
first time, to dedicate the public swimming pool, and then Walt
returned in 1960 for the opening of Walt Disney Elementary School.
Disney brought in his own artists to decorate the gymnasium with
Disney-licensed characters that still prance around the basketball
court.
</P>
<P>
   Though his years in Marceline were few, they were apparently
golden. And the folks who live there still seem to believe that
they've been sprinkled with ``pixie dust,'' as Kaye Malins, the
director of the town tour and a touchstone for Marceline's Disney
boosters, put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an atypical town in that we're still here,'' she said as
she stooped to pick up a crumpled cigarette pack, the one bit of
trash visible on downtown Kansas Avenue _ renamed ``Main Street
USA'' in August to cement the Disney connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other towns up and down the track are gone,'' she added.
``We have a lot of community pride. We still have that magic that
Walt sensed the moment he stepped off the train in 1905.''
</P>
<P>
   The abandoned train depot will be transformed into a Walt
Disney-Santa Fe Railroad Museum in anticipation of Walt Disney's
100th birthday in 2001. The town tour attracts several thousand
visitors each year.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekday, about 60 visitors and locals gathered
around the gazebo on the town green for the tour that Ms. Malins
choreographed with an appealing mix of Disneyesque production
values and home-made props. Six high-school girls in knee-socks,
short black skirts and red plaid vests _ modeled after the plaids
worn by Disneyland employees _ pantomimed with cheerleader grace
key events in the Disney-Marceline cycle, such as the time Walt and
his sister painted a cow in tar pitch on the side of their house
(where Kaye Malins now lives).
</P>
<P>
   Over at C.U. Murray's, the local department store selling
overalls and sewing needles, its fourth owner, Veda White, recalled
Walt and Roy's 1956 visit. ``Back then nobody knew he was that big
of a deal; he was just walking around like anyone else,'' she said.
She stood beneath a five-foot blow-up of a photograph showing
Disney disembarking from the Santa Fe passenger car and being
greeted by Ms. Malins' parents. (Rush Johnson, her father, was
Disney's partner in a plan, interrupted by Disney's death, to turn
his childhood home into a working-farm theme park.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a great deal of potential,'' Ms. White said. ``People
are coming back to small communities. They want to visit the life
here. I like to see the city people gape. They're thinking, `Does
this still exist?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Barely. ``It's been rough since the railroad moved,'' Ms. White
said. In 1986, when the Missouri division headquarters of the Santa
Fe Railroad closed in Marceline, 100 local families lost their
source of income.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the postcards; it's a singularly unlovely town,''
said Karal Ann Marling, the curator of `` The Architecture of
Reassurance: Designing Disney's Theme Parks,'' which opened last
week at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York.
``Walt was disaffected, and like many of his generation, he was
starting to feel the loss of community that characterized the
'50s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His view of Marceline was a child's eye view of a perfect
place _ always clean, and safe and bright,'' she added. ``He only
visited there twice. He probably sensed the fragility of his own
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   To get closer to the architectural oompah characteristic of
Disneyland's Main Street it's necessary to visit Fort Collins, a
thronging college and technological boom-town fast leaving its
farming roots in the dust of development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney's Main Street has been hugely influential as to how we
see the environment,'' Ms. Marling said. ``The iconography, with
its gingerbread, its porches, its awnings, its domesticity of
scale, still connects with people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Collins, there are the mansard roofs, the jig-jag rhythm
of irregular shop facades, lacey Victorian ironwork and the
distinctive fish-bone street plan, where side streets feed into the
main artery, College Avenue. Disneyland's City Hall is clearly
drawn at three-quarters scale from the courthouse in Fort Collins,
with its exuberant up-thrust tower. The red brick fire station is
more than just an echo.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney never set foot in Fort Collins, but he was impressed
by the vivid tales told by Harper Goff, the son of a local
newspaper editor.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 106,000, Fort Collins today is more than
seven times what it was in 1950, when the population stood at
14,000. The city, which was dry from 1896 to 1969, was once
described as a town ``with wide streets and narrow minds.'' Home to
Colorado State University, in recent years it has started to draw
new technology companies, following Hewlett-Packard. In the last
six years, the rent on a one-bedroom apartment has jumped from $450
a month to $750, a far cry from 1976, when half the buildings in
the old town were boarded up. Today, Banana Republic is said to be
looking for space there.
</P>
<P>
   The red stone buildings have been sand-blasted to near
perfection. Concrete planters are brimming with hardy begonias.
Cafes outnumber grocery stores and personalized T-shirts are easier
to find than banks. The old town has the slightly artificial charm
of, well, a theme park, and many local citizens seem loathe to play
up the Disney association. ``I don't know that I'd even tell
anybody about that,'' said Bob Blase, a contractor and the son of a
third-generation Fort Collins farmer.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few years ago that Jill Gardner Stilwell, the
director of the Fort Collins Museum, learned about the Goff-Disney
connection. It was when someone tried to sell the museum a
presentation drawing by Goff of the Valley of the Jolly Green
Giant, a commission from the Green Giant frozen foods company. Goff
had incorporated some Fort Collins buildings into his drawing of
the Valley. Wouldn't the museum want it? ``I think that's when we
learned he'd worked for Disney, too,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the preservation of its architecture is secure, people
in Fort Collins seem most concerned about preserving its sense of
small-town neighborliness. Norm Cook, a retired freight dock
receiver who has lived in Fort Collins since the '40s, ticks off
the names of businesses that have been in operation since he was a
child. ``There's Garwood's Jewelers, J. Pitner's Menswear, and Al's
newstand, where it still smells like popcorn and tobacco like it
did when I was little,'' he said. ``But the town's growing like a
weed. I don't feel much community spirit anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Main Street, U.S.A. in Anaheim is experiencing its own growing
pains. Tony Baxter, a former ice cream scooper during the '60s, who
graduated to a senior vice president at Walt Disney Imagineering,
worries that Disneyland's ``Meet Me in St. Louis''-era imagery has
become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the creation of a generation that grew up in a certain
period and were nostalgic about it and wanted to share their
memories with their grandchildren,'' he said. Seated in a Victorian
red armchair in Walt Disney's private one-room apartment above the
fire station _ within earshot of the train blasts, mini-parades and
announcements _ Baxter said the challenge is ``to find new
experiences as nostalgia loses its edge and becomes a curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy: celebrate with Hallmark sincerity the most generic
seasonal rituals _ Christmas candle-light tours, harvest festivals,
spring flower shows _to keep attendance numbers high.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Co. could learn a thing or two from Marceline's town
spirit. On Sept. 30, as the last tour of the season was winding
down, two volunteers _ vice presidents at a local bank _ started
taking down the flags, and waved to Ms. Malins, who was seeing the
last visitor off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have to change or we'll be gone,'' she said
pensively. ``We're all trying to hold onto something, but we've got
something no one else has: Walt Disney's name, and it's the most
powerful in the world.''

WEDDING ADVICE VIA THE COMPUTER

   (Circuits)

 By ALICE KEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deliriously happy but a bit overwhelmed? Jumping for joy and
compulsively biting your nails? You must be a bride-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Planning a wedding can be a trying experience. In the five
months since our engagement, my fiance and I have made it a
priority to keep a positive attitude.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most determined couple can fall victim to the
pressures and oddities involved with putting a wedding together.
Already our apartment has become crowded with engagement
paraphernalia. What do we do with the cards, the pattern catalogs
and the catering menus? How should I organize the guest lists,
transportation requirements and hotel reservations?
</P>
<P>
   I realized I would need some help the day my fiance and I stood
staring blankly at seemingly indistinguishable forks as we tried to
choose our flatware pattern. A fork is a fork is a fork until you
consider eating with it for the rest of your lives. It was then
that we decided to seek a higher authority.
</P>
<P>
   I first tried some wedding planner books that I received as
gifts. If you take this route, there are some wonderful
possibilities: books that offer advice on every aspect of your
wedding and specially designed albums and journals to document your
event planning. There are even a few that offer a combination of
organizational tools and etiquette and planning advice. These books
have areas for writing information and ideas and keeping lists.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-copy album is great as a memory of the event, but it did
not accommodate the constant need to edit the written information.
I then turned to my trusty computer and compiled lists and notes in
my word-processing and spreadsheet programs. Although that was an
improvement, I was still searching for a better way.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of different types of software available to help
plan a wedding. While some are little more than spruced up or
preformatted spreadsheets, others provide guidance and ideas for
planning. I searched for a combination that would help me plan the
event and avoid etiquette missteps and would prevent me from
forgetting anything important.
</P>
<P>
   All the programs reviewed here helped with the guest lists and
budgeting, and all three helped me accomplish more than I could
have done on my own.I looked for programs that would take some of
the worry out of the planning, would help keep track of all the
details I was sure I would forget and would be fun to use. Above
all, I looked for programs that would keep the happiness and
romance in the planning. That's a lot to ask of any piece of
software.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Experts On Elegance &LR;
</P>
<P>
   EMILY POST'S COMPLETE GUIDE TO WEDDINGS
</P>
<P>
   (Multimedia 2000; $19.95; Windows 3.1 and later.)
</P>
<P>
   This software is the answer for the traditional yet
technologically adept bride. It balances planning tools and
worksheets with helpful and reliable etiquette lessons. Within a
week of my engagement, I had received a copy of the book ``Emily
Post on Weddings.'' The book provided more than enough information
about how to proceed with plans but lacked the organizational
details of the CD-ROM to help me with the actual planning.
</P>
<P>
   The guide is set up as a visit to a professional wedding
consultant. The opening screen has a video welcome from Elizabeth
and Peggy Post, relatives of Emily and etiquette experts in their
own right. In the Planning Center, at the top of the screen is a
section for personal wedding information and links to different
worksheets and note cards, which change in each section of the
program. On the left of the screen is a list of topics on which
video or written advice is offered. At the top of the list is
always advice from Elizabeth Post. Most of the other information is
presented by Peggy Post.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the screen offers a basic utilities list that
remains constant throughout the program. There is a planning
calendar and notepad, and buttons leading to file management,
printing, help and exit. The most important button on the utilities
bar is marked Places to Go. That navigational tool links to the
program's 12 main sections, which include such topics as the
budget, guest list, photography and music.
</P>
<P>
   The true gems of the program are the sections on style. For the
botanically ignorant, the flower section provides pictures and
descriptions of many popular flowers as well as advice on
purchasing, decorating and choosing a bouquet style. The music area
has audio clips of traditional music for the ceremony. There are
also worksheets for both the ceremony and the reception.
</P>
<P>
   Creating your invitation is a breeze with the Posts' help. There
is guidance on grammar, timing, paper and font choice and
invaluable detail about how to handle nontraditional couples.
Throughout the program, there is concise advice on etiquette. If a
bride is in the military or from a split family, or if the groom's
family is serving as host of the wedding, the Post women have the
answers.
</P>
<P>
   There are some cosmetic downsides to this program. The Places to
Go menu appears on top of the screen and blocks the list of options
behind it. While the user can close the menu easily, it becomes
tedious when jumping from screen to screen. The spreadsheet and
information storage areas of the program are elegantly laid out but
a bit difficult to get used to. I also found that some of the
spreadsheets did not cross-reference each other as easily as I
would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   The strengths of the Emily Post program easily outweigh the
downsides, and the program is beautifully designed and fun to use.
It maintains an air of elegance and excitement through such
stressful topics as whom to invite and how to budget. But grooms
should take heed: while the information in this software is
valuable to both of you, the language and tone is directed toward
your future wife.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   THE ESSENTIAL WEDDING PLANNER
</P>
<P>
   (The Learning Co; $14.95, discontinued by manufacturer; Windows
3.1 and later.)
</P>
<P>
   Are you tied to your Franklin Planner or glued to your
Week-at-a-Glance? Then this program should feel like home. The
Essential Wedding Planner is designed to look like a six-ring
organizer. This organizer, however, has spreadsheets and worksheets
that go far beyond what can easily be achieved with paper and pen.
</P>
<P>
   The first section, with a pink tab, is a yearlong checklist of
what a couple should accomplish by certain dates. The to-do dates
can be altered by hand if a couple wishes to set their own
schedule. The checklist breaks up the tasks into 12 manageable
steps. The software provides an additional page, preformatted as a
checklist, for adding items specific to your wedding. The
announcements section, marked with a blue tab, gives you the option
of either writing an original announcement of your forthcoming
marriage or filling in the blanks on a preformatted announcement.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The yellow-tabbed event schedule acts as a calendar, with spaces
to enter the dates of wedding-related events like showers and
engagement parties. The next four tabbed sections offer an area for
guest information and the tracking of invitations, RSVP's, gifts
and travel needs. These well-designed pages have fields for all the
necessary information and display just one guest (or party) per
page. The invitation-tracking links to the guest information and
allows you to record which events the guest will or will not
attend. It does not, however, keep a running total.
</P>
<P>
   The gift area takes a step beyond many of the available programs
and provides a place to record up to four gifts per guest (for
shower, engagement and wedding gifts and one other gift). It also
provides a check box for gifts that need to be returned and an area
to record when you sent a thank-you note. All four of these
sections cross-reference the guest information, so you need to
enter data only once.
</P>
<P>
   The final two sections, table assignments and expenses, are
thoughtfully designed and comprehensive. While the table
assignments area does not take the pain out of deciding whom to
seat next to that dreadful great-aunt, it provides a useful
tracking tool. The program graphically shows an area for each
table, allowing you to better envision your seating decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The expense area provides a page for each expense, including
fields to enter vendor names and phone numbers as well as cost.
There is a section for writing notes about each expense, which is
valuable when you are trying to lower the cost of some items. A
spreadsheet links to this page and can be called up at any time to
view the overall budget.
</P>
<P>
   While the simplicity of this program is its greatest strength,
it is at times also a weakness. The program fails to provide
consistent, adequate detail. I found that it was easy to draft and
print out an announcement, but difficult to go back and edit it.
The guest section allows you to view one guest per page but not the
entire list at once. One more caveat: the Learning Company recently
discontinued this title, but it may still be available through many
vendors.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   WEDDING WORKSHOP
</P>
<P>
   (Micro Precision; $29.99, Macinotsh and Windows 3.1 and later.)
</P>
<P>
   Wedding Workshop is a wonderful combination of planning tools
and helpful, entertaining advice. It is also graphically appealing
and extremely thorough. It covered all the topics, concerns and
areas of potential stress that a couple are likely to encounter
while planning their special event.
</P>
<P>
   The main screen, the Planning Center, offers a traditional menu
bar along the top. It is here that the user enters most financial
information. The pop-up menus have areas for estimates and expenses
for everything from jewelry to the wedding cake and the honeymoon.
Included on this menu bar are links for guest information, a help
menu and to-do lists. Unlike the to-do list in other programs,
these are created by the couple themselves _ a helpul
organizational lesson in itself. While the manual states that the
program provides an initial list of tasks, my list was empty.
</P>
<P>
   The to-do lists include fields for entering each project, the
person in charge, the timing and the date completed. The menu bar
also includes individual reports on the many occasions leading to a
wedding. The status of guests, gifts received, expenses and
projects to be completed can be printed from this menu bar as well.
While I would have liked to have been able to have viewed these
reports on the screen, the printed reports came in handy for times
when I was away from the computer and for permanent records.
</P>
<P>
   The Planning Center screen is filled with 10 buttons, each
leading to a different section, either organizational or
informational. There is a utilitarian button for the guest list and
for attendant worksheets and the overall budget.
</P>
<P>
   The attention to detail is impressive. Every linked screen
offers all the information relevant to the topic. There is no need
to flip from section to section to find information on budgeting,
head counts or contacts because the program cross-references all
details for the wedding couple. For example, the guest list window
shows a list of all invited guests and a count of how many
invitations have been sent and how many RSVP's received. Any name
can be highlighted from the list and details retrieved about that
specific guest. There is space to list the children invited, and
the wording for both the inner and outer envelopes, accommodations
and the guest's special needs.
</P>
<P>
   Gift information is available with the click of a mouse,
providing fields to record gifts for engagement, shower, wedding
and other gifts. There are check boxes for thank-you's sent and
gift descriptions. Details about every guest can be found without
backtracking to the main menu.
</P>
<P>
   Another outstanding feature of this program is the availability
of reference materials on the central screen. While clicking on the
user's menu was helpful, I was more impressed by the Tips and
Etiquette and Romantic Ideas buttons.
</P>
<P>
   The Tips and Etiquette section consists of a 79-page book, which
is read using Adobe Acrobat Reader, that offers advice on how to
plan a wedding and a lot of wonderful tips on how to survive the
whole experience gracefully. The tips range from how to buy a
diamond to how to estimate how many guests will actually attend.
</P>
<P>
   The Romantic Ideas button leads to a copy (Acrobat reader again)
of Gregory J.P. Godek's book ``1001 Ways to Be Romantic.'' It is
refreshing that Wedding Workshop remembers why people marry in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some Web sites devoted to wedding planning. While I
would not recommend these as your only planning tools, they provide
useful contacts and often invaluable supplementary advice.
</P>
<P>
   THE KNOT: www.theknot.com _ If you decide not to use planning
software, this comprehensive and extensive site is the best
substitute. The Knot has many useful, high-quality components,
including fashion information, a searchable bridal gown database, a
gift registry, beauty and etiquette tips, and planning and
budgeting tools. The planning area is personalized, and the
budgeting pages keep track of expenses and help you understand what
factors into each cost. Features include cost information for the
average American wedding, 56 Ways to Save and a Groom's Section.
The articles for men are interesting, but the site is not aimed at
the couple planning their wedding together.
</P>
<P>
   WEDDING CHANNEL: www.weddingchannel.com _ This provides a wealth
of information and links to pages where you can make many of your
wedding purchases and purchasing decisions. You can browse your way
through fashion, gifts, accessories and many other wedding products
and services. The site includes an online registry, a virtual store
and even a travel agency for honeymoon arrangements. The impressive
vendor list and business directory are useful both for large urban
areas and rural areas. The Groom's Section is a nice idea but
unimpressive.
</P>
<P>
   WEDDING BELLS: www.weddingbells.com _ This has a simple,
easy-to-follow layout and offers links to topics like fashion,
etiquette, planning, wedding services and travel ideas. The Strange
but True section provides interesting historical trivia. The Trends
and Traditions section contains personal anecdotes and traditions
and trends from around the world.

 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan Gosnell, a fire management planner in California for the
U.S. Forest Service, wishes he had had his service's new technology
two years ago. It was nearly Thanksgiving when a wildfire flared in
Waterman Canyon, in the San Bernardino National Forest. Flames
jumped the crest of the canyon and ripped down the foothills,
fueled by 30-mph Santa Ana winds. The fire stalked to within a mile
of the campus of California State University at San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   During such wildfires, the forest service has to worry about
more than buildings, however. As they try to stop the flames,
officials are also concerned with what they may accidentally
destroy _ say, archaeological deposits _ with their fire-control
techniques. In this case, the staff archaeologist could not be
reached for a midnight consultation, so the commander ordered a
bulldozer to make a break in the 6-foot chaparral to stop the
spread of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Only later did the firefighters learn that the area was rich in
Indian artifacts _ a fact they could have found at their fingertips
using the computerized maps that are now being loaded into
commanders' trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had known it was full of archaeological sites, we
wouldn't have called that dozer,'' Gosnell said.
</P>
<P>
   The maps are part of a system that combines satellite
communication, a global positioning device to show the vehicle's
location and computer mapping software that reads the positioning
information and shows the locations of Forest Service vehicles on
digital maps. The computerized maps also show the features of the
land, including topography, archaeological sites and the presence
of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   The system was designed to help fight the wildfires that rage
every year through the mountains and deserts of Southern
California. Incident commanders, when they face these fires, must
make a mind-boggling array of decisions. The chief question a
commander will ask is: Should he risk the wrath of the public and
allow the fire to burn, to avoid future risks in the area, or
should he put the fire out?
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends on many variables. How have fires burned in
the area in the past? Is the fire headed toward homes? Is it moving
into the habitat of an endangered species like the bald eagle? Will
it threaten endangered plants? Is the area full of dry grasses or
greener, less flammable chaparral? Based on the area's burn
history, can the fire be fought by ground crews, or must aircraft
be called in to drop retardant?
</P>
<P>
   The data attached to the digital maps can answer all of these
questions _ including when the last fire burned there and how it
behaved. The system helps in planning the attack, and if a
commander decides to let the fire burn, the electronic facts at his
fingertips can support the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, these decisions were made by veteran commanders in
the fire service who carry much of the information about terrain,
vegetation and burn history in their heads. But when they retire,
they take the riches of information with them.
</P>
<P>
   The computerized system has drawn praise from high-ranking
federal officials. Last year, the project was awarded a $625,000
grant from Vice President Al Gore's Information Technology
Innovation Fund. ``I was impressed,'' said Gayle Gordon, chief
information officer for the Bureau of Land Management and a member
of the grant committee. ``It was an application that pulled
together a lot of technology that would make a lot of difference to
people on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The system is now used in the San Bernardino forest, which is an
hour east of Los Angeles and one of the most-used forests in the
nation. Filled with lakes, ski resorts and mountains that reach
11,000 feet, it is a favorite spot for vacation homes. The 30,000
full-time residents occupy fewer than half the houses built in the
forest.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service system is also being adapted for other
federal agencies that control land in the Mojave Desert: the Bureau
of Land Management, the National Park Service and the Bureau of
Indian Affairs. Along with the Forest Service, these agencies hold
32 million acres of land that runs more than 200 miles south from
Death Valley to the Mexican border. The number of fire and police
incidents handled by these agencies increased from 3,400 in 1988 to
more than 11,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the technology project, Keith rigged a Humvee in
Death Valley with the system. The hardware requirements for the
Humvee, which is used for law enforcement, illustrate why a laptop
wouldn't do: to keep the system working under extreme conditions,
the monitor, keyboard and other components have been ``ruggedized''
to withstand heat, smoke, dust and hard mountain driving. The
4-gigabyte hard drive is bolted to the vehicle's floor in a
case-hardened ``data brick.'' The equipment in Death Valley must
withstand temperatures that reach 140 degrees in the cab. This
special equipment goes into all the vehicles, at a cost of $7,000
per system.
</P>
<P>
   While few firefighters dispute the system's value, some question
why so much is being spent for technology tailored in-house while
the staff is being cut.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Graham, district ranger for the Front Country District
of the San Bernardino forest, said he was afraid the day would come
when tourists go to the ranger stations and find only computer
screens that say: ``There are no more employees here. Please push
this button.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Forest Service is downsized so bad, we don't have anybody
left in the field,'' Graham said. ``We need to be high-tech, but
it's very expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see environmental savings from the system as a result of
better firefighting decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The development of the technology project grew from Keith's
regular duties, which include building and maintaining radio
networks in hard-to-cover mountain areas. Because of rapid advances
in technology, he must replace the entire radio network every 10
years at a present cost of $1.5 million. Building a satellite
communication system, he said, would not only insure communications
in remote areas for the long term, but would also limit the
building of ugly mountaintop transmission towers that annoy the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's eventually going to be cheaper than paying for
all our mountaintop signals,'' Keith said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The system he designed has been installed in just a handful of
vehicles so far, but it will go into all command trucks in the San
Bernardino National Forest this fall; then will gradually be
installed in command vehicles for all the Federal firefighting
agencies in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Keith's plans are well under way for creating advanced
features. He wants to add a feature in which incident commanders
can draw the boundaries of a fire, e-mail the map to the dispatch
center and automatically transmit the map to the Internet. That
way, the public could check the map on line, and dispatchers would
not be bogged down by calls from people in Los Angeles asking about
the safety of their vacation homes.
</P>
<P>
   Keith wants to take the system a step further, so that it can
actually help predict fires. The Forest Service already receives
constantly updated maps that show lightning strikes. Merge the
lightning maps with maps of high-risk areas, then, when the
lightning starts to strike, send aircraft to scout for telltale
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're going to have fires in this forest,'' Keith
said. ``We know where they're going to be and how they're going to
act. Instead of waiting for fires to start, and being in emergency
mode, why don't we predict where they're going to happen? We are
trying to build a system that doesn't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the system has proven to be an asset not only in
firefighting decisions, but in the other emergencies to which
Forest Service personnel respond.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, on a foggy Sunday morning last December, Jim
Higgins was the first official to reach the scene of a plane crash
in the San Bernardino Mountains that killed a father and son. As
investigators headed for the scene, Higgins, a law enforcement
officer for the Forest Service, consulted his computer.
</P>
<P>
   He opened a satellite link from his pickup truck. With the help
of the truck's Global Positioning Satellite device, he pinpointed
the location of the crash on a digital map. Within one minute of
his arrival, he reported the latitude and longitude of the crash to
the Federal Aviation Administration. Then, as the investigators
approached, Higgins guided them by radio through every turn of the
rugged roads to the crash site. Soon, reporters started to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   When the search and rescue team, the deputy coroner and the
accident investigators got there, they witnessed an unusual scene:
a group of reporters flocking around Higgins' truck, gawking at the
computer screen, leaving the plane crash all but forgotten.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Just inside the entrance of the public library
here hangs a photograph of the building's namesake, John Henry
Faulk, a radio performer and humorist famous for his uncompromising
defense of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, who was blacklisted in the McCarthy era but sued his
blacklisters and won, died in 1990. Were he alive today, Faulk
would no doubt shake his head at the tangle over free speech in
which the Faulk Central Library and the Austin Public Library
branches now find themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin Public Library is one of hundreds of public libraries
around the country grappling with the question of whether to keep
objectionable material on the Internet from reaching computers
intended for public use, and, for those libraries that have decided
on blocking, how much blocking to do. After much soul-searching,
the Austin library installed filtering software on most of its
computers, a decision that divided the community, as it has many
others.
</P>
<P>
   In Loudoun County, Va., a group of library patrons who object to
the county library's filtering software on its computers, along
with the American Civil Liberties Union and Web publishers, have
filed a court case challenging the constitutionality of the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side of the continent _ and the debate _ in
Livermore, Calif., a parent is suing the public library, accusing
it of failing to restrict minors' access to pornographic Net
content. Similar conflicts are taking place across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment issues raised by Internet filtering may seem
clear enough when public debate is at full tilt. But people's
positions are less clear in private as they struggle with their
commitment to free speech and their desire to protect children.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's two-year struggle, which is still unresolved even
though filtering software is on most Austin library computers,
reflects the national debate in all its complexity. At every step
of the way, librarians around the nation have watched Austin in
search of guidance, confirmation or any hook on which to hang a
policy of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Like her counterparts across the nation, Brenda Branch, the
energetic, high-spirited director of the Austin library, has been
at the center of the discussion. Like many other librarians, she
has always considered the defense of free speech to be part of her
job description. For most of the 23 years she has been at the
Austin library, that stand has presented her with no personal
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Branch's problems began in the summer of 1996, when
computers with unrestricted access to the Internet were placed in
the main library and its 19 branches. ``Upholding freedom of speech
becomes so second nature to librarians that unrestricted access was
our natural fallback position,'' Ms. Branch said. ``We almost
didn't question it.''
</P>
<P>
   When staff members saw children looking at questionable sites,
they resorted to an ad hoc method of control _ cajoling them to
move elsewhere. They suddenly felt thrust into the role of parents.
</P>
<P>
   But things remained relatively quiet until a branch librarian
happened to walk past the library's printer one day and saw a
graphic depiction of child pornography emerging. ``One look at this
and you knew it was illegal stuff,'' Ms. Branch said. As the
librarian was pulling the offending document out of the printer,
whoever had sent the print command disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, a few days later, another library employee shot
off an angry letter to the local newspaper, the mayor, the City
Council and the city manager, charging the library with making
pornography available, in violation of the state's ``harmful to
minors'' statute. Texas is one of several states with a law
prohibiting an adult from knowingly displaying material considered
harmful to anyone younger than 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, it was like the dam broke,'' Ms. Branch said.
She met with her staff members, she said, and many of them broke
down and told her how uncomfortable they felt with unfettered
Internet access. Ms. Branch's employees, it turned out, were
worried that they could be arrested if they were thought to be
exposing children to pornography, however inadvertently.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city reinforced those fears. One option, which
the library swiftly rejected, was to remove Internet access from
the libraries altogether, Ms. Branch said. The lawyers then
recommended strongly that the library install software to filter
objectionable material.
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks, the library had installed Cyber Patrol, a
filtering program popular among parents but much maligned among
civil libertarians, on the 52 public computers with Internet
access. In its haste, the library installed the software at full
throttle. The product was set up at its most restrictive so it
blocked Web sites promoting ``intolerance,'' ``alcohol and
tobacco'' and ``illegal gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Filtering products often work by searching Web sites for strings
of what appear to be unseemly text. Such a method can cause the
words ``Essex County,'' for example, to be blocked, or ``chicken
breast.'' Cyber Patrol looks for keywords, not text strings. The
company also maintains a proprietary list of site addresses that it
chooses to block, and it updates the list regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, a stack of written complaints two inches thick
had arrived on Ms. Branch's desk. Many library patrons objected to
being subject to any censorship. Others complained about the
software's hamhanded blocking, which censored harmless sites while
giving ready access to others filled with obscene language and
images.
</P>
<P>
   One library user conducted an Internet search for ``toys.'' At
the top of the search results was ``Toys 4 Lovers.'' At the same
time, patrons trying to retrieve Web sites dedicated to Georgia
O'Keeffe and Vincent Van Gogh were confronted by a computer screen
flashing a yellow Cyber Patrol police badge. An HIV Information
Center was also found to be off limits.
</P>
<P>
   People even complained that sites containing the names John
Henry Faulk were banned, presumably because of the proximity to one
another of the letter F, U and K.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's operating like the KGB!'' one person complained. Another
wrote, ``Incensed that you would tell me as a parent what my child
should see and what they should not see.'' But Cyber Patrol says
its software would not exclude those kinds of sites.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Branch's office in the Faulk Central Library in downtown
Austin is playfully decorated with stuffed animals and dishes of
candy. On her door frame is a magnet that reads: ``Don't rush me.
I'm making mistakes as fast as I can.'' Inspired more by Gidget
than gravitas, Ms. Branch's office betrays no trace of the somber
situations in which the librarian has found herself.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Branch, 51, was named director of the Austin public library
system in 1991. She said the only previous experience that
foreshadowed the current debate occurred in 1992, when Madonna's
graphic book ``Sex'' sparked an outcry from some parents and church
groups on the the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   During the Madonna incident, as Ms. Branch refers to it, she was
in frequent touch with the American Library Association. ``The ALA
was an incredible source of support,'' she said. ``I really
depended on them for information and legal advice.''
</P>
<P>
   When the issue of filtering Internet content arose, however, the
ALA left Ms. Branch trapped squarely between library science and
the politics of her community. In late 1996, a few months after the
library introduced Internet access, Ms. Branch sought guidance from
the ALA about whether to install filters. She was surprised to get
a sharp letter in reply, in which the ALA endorsed the idea of
unrestricted Internet access for adults and minors alike. In July
1997, the ALA issued a formal resolution condemning the use of
filtering software that blocks access to constitutionally protected
speech and recommended parental discretion.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ALA's Office for Information Technology Policy,
11,600 of the nation's nearly 16,000 libraries offer Internet
access, and some 15 percent of those have installed filtering
software. Most libraries, including many with filters, have an
``acceptable use'' policy in place, which urges patrons to use the
Internet responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policies are very carefully considered,'' said Richard
Matthews, deputy director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at
the ALA. ``We certainly have addressed the First Amendment
implications of our stance against filtering, and to take any
position accepting something less than that ideal stance would be
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Branch said she found the ALA's policy frustrating because
it fails to take into account the practical considerations of
exposing children to what she calls ``some of the horrifying stuff
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That horrifying stuff is precisely what has given rise to the
pro-filtering position among a number of Austinites. ``If we live
in a society that requires one to be 21 to drink, 18 to smoke, and
last I understood, 18 to purchase porno magazines, why is it free
and acceptable to view porno on the Internet at a public library?''
one Austin parent wrote to Ms. Branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest dilemma,'' Ms. Branch said, ``is how to balance the
rights of adults with the need to protect youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Austin installed filters, the ACLU condemned the
new practice. ACLU lawyers investigated the possibility of filing a
lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of the library's action.
</P>
<P>
   Austin has long been known as a city more liberal than the rest
of the state. For nearly eight years, the city has been home to
Electronic Frontiers-Texas, a small but active group of civil
libertarians who focus on the rights of those who travel in
cyberspace. When members of EF-Texas heard about the library's
filters, they joined forces with the ACLU and complained to the
City Council, which controls the financing for the library.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking an analogy often used when discussing library
filtering, Jon Lebkowsky, an EF-Texas member, said, ``It came down
to a fundamental question: Are you taking books off the shelves, or
are you exercising the library's prerogative to select some books
and not others?''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, city officials convened a community roundtable,
with Ms. Branch and other librarians, EF-Texas, the ACLU, the city,
and Jennifer Padden, a representative of the local PTA.
</P>
<P>
   After several weeks of debate, the library disabled the keyword
blocking and reduced the number of categories being filtered out to
four: ``gross depictions,'' ``sexual acts,'' ``partial nudity'' and
``full nudity.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there are four unfiltered computers scattered around the
library system, with plans to have one unfiltered computer at each
branch by this time next year. The screens for the unfiltered
machines are in specially built recessed tables that keep the
computer screens well out of public view. Only patrons 18 and older
may use an unfiltered machine, and they must present proof of age.
Minors cannot use the machines even if they have parental
permission slips or are accompanied by parents.
</P>
<P>
   Now that fewer categories of Web sites are blocked and
unfiltered computers are available to adults, Ms. Branch said,
complaints about the filtering have diminished sharply. A library
customer who objects to the blocking of a certain site can complain
to the library staff, who can ask Cyber Patrol to stop blocking the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the current setup in Austin is a fragile
compromise. From the point of view of EF-Texas and the ACLU, which
calls filtering ``censorship in a box,'' it is an unacceptable one.
``The least filtering we're likely to get is still more filtering
than any of us want,'' said Jim Robinson, an EF-Texas member who
opposes filters.
</P>
<P>
   But EF-Texas members aren't completely in unison. While Robinson
is unwavering in his stance against any and all filtering, others,
like Lebkowsky, are less so. ``There's the potential for libraries
to become like adult arcades if access to hard-core porn isn't
somehow restricted,'' said Lebkowsky. He said ``minimal filtering''
might be the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Padden, of the PTA spoke out passionately at the community
roundtable in favor of filtering, yet the computer she has at home
is unfiltered. When her children go on line, she goes with them.
``I'd like to think I've raised my kids with my values, and they
respect them,'' she said. ``But there are probably 10 times more
kids whose parents don't have the time or the computer capability
to understand what their kids are looking at or doing at the
library.''
</P>
<P>
   Some version of mandatory-filtering legislation for public
libraries and schools may become law as part of the appropriations
bill being considered this week in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Librarians in Austin and elsewhere are also watching the Loudoun
County case.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Beeson, an ACLU lawyer who spends much of her time on Web
cases, said: ``We hope the decision coming out of Loudoun will
heavily influence how other jurisdictions proceed. If we get a
strong decision in our favor, we'll feel even more confident in
challenging other jurisdictions trying to impose mandatory
filtering.''
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California
at Los Angeles, speculated that a court might be more likely to
accept Internet filtering that, like Austin's, would affect only
children. ``Then again,'' he added, ``it's conceivable that a court
will say the library has a completely free hand, that blocking the
Internet is more like not buying the book in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beeson, who is monitoring cases or controversies in several
cities several cities simultaneously, said the ACLU continued to
watch Austin closely. ``It's still not off the radar screen,'' she
said. ``We've just been eminently patient with Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beeson said she approved of the plan to place an unfiltered
machine in every library branch, but she objects to the library's
uncompromising restrictions on minors, particularly older
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Beeson said she also sympathized with Ms. Branch. ``Like
many librarians, she's been caught between a rock and a hard
place,'' Ms. Beeson said. ``Her instincts are in all the right
places, but she's in a very awkward position.''

SILICON VALLEY TOUR OPERATOR TRIES TO MAKE HIGH-TECH OFFICES
INTERESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 By GARY ANDREW POOLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ We must have been the only high-tech
sightseers within miles. ``Driving down the Central Expressway now,
and soon we're going to see, uh, Applied Materials and National
Semiconductor,'' said Ed Pansullo on a Thursday morning in Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Pansullo is the only tour guide here specializing in technology
tours for the public. ``Mitsubishi will come up on the left-hand
side, and on the right is the new headquarters of Yahoo.''
</P>
<P>
   He valiantly tried to sound excited, but through a smoggy haze,
we stared at darkish office buildings and motionless parking lots.
In a slapstick effort to stay awake, Pansullo, 49, slapped his face
with his tie.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy being a tour guide, or a tourist, in Silicon
Valley, the 50-mile strip between San Francisco and San Jose,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the geographic epicenter of high technology, where the
computer revolution blossomed, a place that defines American
innovation and business free-spiritedness. There really isn't a lot
for your average tourist to see.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they come, if not in droves at least in twos and threes.
They will be turned away from every high-tech building (except
one), and there are no famous-sites maps or any tour guides (except
Pansullo), but some techno-tourists will drive aimlessly for hours,
searching for something, anything, and usually finding nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourism reflects recreation, but this is a town about work,''
said Jan English-Lueck, an anthropology professor at San Jose State
University. ``Going to see work is not very much fun. It is not
like going to a distillery where at the end of the tour you have a
sip of Scotch. This place is grim. Plus, companies don't want dirty
people shedding dust particles onto their machines.''
</P>
<P>
   That viewpoint upset two German tourists, Dirk Lebert and
Dietmar Konermann. They were checking out the Intel Museum and were
two of the three people in it, not counting Pasullo and his one
client. They were sweaty and mad, having been trying to master the
maze of freeways while finding something to see. Konermann, a
customer service representative for Hewlett-Packard, said: ``We
drive all day and all we see are highways and offices. Ugly. Three
days in the Bay Area. One day we dedicate to Silicon Valley. Very
confusing. And this is what is here? This, this . . . museum. Ha!
Very, how do you say, ground level. Disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ja, disappointing,'' added Lebert, a systems programmer for a
German insurance company, who always dreamed of seeing Silicon
Valley. And the Intel Corporation wants to accommodate him, since
it is the only company that allows the public past its front door.
In 1992 it opened the Intel Museum, a 3,500-square-foot shrine to
the company in its Robert Noyce Building here. Visitors take a
self-guided tour, staring at Intel memorabilia and reading about
the workings of a microprocessor. Lebert and Konermann wiped their
brows, cursed in German and stormed out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Pansullo wants to help people like the apoplectic German
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's challenging,'' said Pansullo, a graduate of the
International Tour Management Institute who is trying to build a
business of guiding tourists around Nerdsville.
</P>
<P>
   Pansullo looks like a cop straight out of central casting, and
he actually is a cop out of central casting, having played police
officers in ``Repo Man,'' ``Beverly Hills Cop II'' and ``Sid and
Nancy.'' Business isn't great, so Pansullo also has his own travel
agency, called Seven Seas Travel, and still acts.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was an explosion of interest in traveling to
Silicon Valley. He started giving a few tours a year 10 years ago;
now he gives two tours a month, mostly to techies attending the
numerous conventions here. They go on a tour, he said, because they
get goosebumps looking at high-tech historical sites and company
headquarters, or they want to get a better feel for Silicon Valley,
or they're looking to kill a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Pansullo charges $150 per tour, which lasts two hours. He
usually starts at the Intel Museum and ends in downtown San Jose at
the Tech Museum. The hour and a half in between is the tricky part.
After we left Intel, Pansullo went over his script, tugging on his
yellowish mustache. We neared the NASA Ames Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up the road from there is the Shoreline Amphitheater,'' he
said, adding that it was a favorite hangout of Steve Wozniak, a
co-founder of Apple Computer. ``He is often seen at concerts, in
his box, with his head down like this, staring into his hands.''
Pansullo stared at his hands, fluttering his fingers. ``The Woz is
carrying on a weekly Tetris tournament with his buddies,'' he said,
referring to a popular video game. ``People see him there, and they
say, `I saw you, but you didn't seem to be paying attention.' He
says: `No, I listen to the music. Some people have a poker night;
that's my Tetris night.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are generally more interested in learning about people
rather than buildings,'' Pansullo continued, going into a
description of how Steve Jobs started Apple, was thrown out and is
now reviving it. But those stories soon run out. ``So here's
another portion of Intel's campus and a small portion of
Hewlett-Packard's campus. Most of H-P's research and development
and disk drive manufacturing is in south San Jose.'' Pansullo
looked weary.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose had 760,000 visitors last year who stayed at hotels,
according to the San Jose Convention and Visitors Bureau, compared
with 500,000 in 1992. Most of those people were here on business,
but the hospitality industry would like to make Silicon Valley more
of a destination site. Part of the Visitors Bureau's plan focuses
on encouraging companies to crack open their doors to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focusing our efforts toward high-tech tourism,'' said
Leonard Hoops, a spokesman for the Visitors Bureau. Apple Computer
and Silicon Graphics have obliged, opening company stores where
they sell merchandise with company logos: T-shirts, umbrellas, golf
balls, teddy bears.
</P>
<P>
   But for outsiders, there's really not much to see. Sometimes on
a tour Pansullo will get a roustabout who wants to go into an
actual office building to look around. But that's laughable. In
Silicon Valley, where the most popular phrase is ``only the
paranoid survive,'' forget about trying to actually see anything.
Unlike companies like Coors Brewing Co. and General Motors,
businesses in the valley do not give public plant tours. ``We have
security issues, such as high-tech theft,'' said Anne Little, a
spokeswoman for Sun Microsystems, echoing the most commonly cited
reason for dening access to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason is lack of interest. As hard as Pansullo
tries, there is not really a big demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a concierge since 1973 and no one has ever asked for
a tour of Silicon Valley,'' said Tom Wolfe, chief concierge at the
Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Winding down after two hours of driving and seeing little except
office parks, traffic and more office parks, we drove around
downtown San Jose looking at the outside of the convention center,
the arena and some newish hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Pansullo ended his tour at the new home of the Tech Museum of
Innovation, a mango-colored building that is to open Oct. 31. ``We
hope to inspire the innovator in everyone and be the focal point
for visitors,'' said Peter Giles, chief executive of the $96
million museum. ``We're trying to get people excited about
technology.'' He expects 700,000 visitors in the museum's first
year. In one exhibit visitors can go into a ``clean room'' that
looks just like a real working fabrication plant _ or take a
simulated bobsled ride.
</P>
<P>
   Driving away from San Jose, Pansullo was optimistic. He said he
believed that his business would only increase as tourists got to
know how really fascinating Silicon Valley could be. ``I don't know
why it's taken this long,'' he said, ``but San Jose has long been
the poor stepsister of San Francisco. For some reason, it's just
not recognized as a tourist destination.''

GIVING BIRTH TO A WEB BUSINESS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Olga Tereshko became an online entrepreneur because of a fussy
baby.
</P>
<P>
   Before Ms. Tereshko's son, Sasha, was born in 1995, she had
planned to resume her Ph.D. studies in genetics at the University
of Pittsburgh. Then Sasha arrived, changing everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I couldn't do it as soon as he was born,'' she
said. ``He was fussy and had to be held. I knew he needed me to be
in the home. I needed to do something that was more flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a mother who was breast-feeding and using cloth diapers,
she found that many items she wanted to buy were not readily
available. With Sasha in tow, she would drive 30 minutes to a mall
to buy nursing bras. She could not find cotton diapers of the
quality she wanted. She started exploring catalogs, then decided
that she wanted to make it easier for other mothers to find the
supplies they needed. Ms. Tereshko was soon on her way to joining
the ranks of cybermerchants.
</P>
<P>
   About eight months after Sasha was born, she made up a brochure
using Adobe Pagemaker software and began local sales of the mother
and baby products she liked, including nursing bras and several
brands of breast pumps. She picked up about 100 customers through
local hospitals and parent organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Tereshko and her husband, Dr. David Servan-Schreiber, a
psychiatrist, say they saw the business as a way to support other
parents who shared their philosophy about breast-feeding and
``attachment parenting,'' a child-rearing approach that encourages
breast-feeding and letting a baby's needs dictate the schedule for
being held or fed. That approach is advocated by the authors Dr.
William Sears and Martha Sears. ``Most of the business was based on
this philosophy,'' Ms. Tereshko said.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Tereshko was deciding whether to widen her audience
and put her business on the Web, she took a class in online
information design at Carnegie Mellon. She opened Little Koala
(www.littlekoala.com) in April 1996. The name, she said, came from
her habit of holding her son all the time, as a mother koala holds
its cub. As proof, she displays photographs in which she's sitting
with her laptop and holding Sasha, who is asleep, across her chest.
</P>
<P>
   She advertised her catalog and Web site in Mothering magazine
and a journal from La Leche League, a nonprofit group that promotes
breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   While it is certainly true that not every business in cyberspace
makes money, Ms. Tereshko has found herself with a growing
business. In the last two months, she has rented office space for
her inventory and hired two employees (including her mother); she
estimates that she has 8,000 to 9,000 customers. Her orders are
increasing at about 10 percent a month, she said. About half her
orders come through telephone calls and about half come from the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online business is growing each month,'' Ms. Tereshko
said. ``More people are getting used to computers and going on
line. The Web increases your visibility, and business grows
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one has exact numbers on how many businesses use the
Web, experts agree that e-commerce is growing. Web businesses can
have lower start-up costs because they often don't require office
space and staff early on or a lot of expensive printed material.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are coming on line in huge numbers,'' said Cheryl Regan,
a spokeswoman for Network Solutions (www.networksolutions.com) of
Herndon, Va., which registers .com addresses on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 1,000 small businesses, Network Solutions found
that 61 percent did not have a presence on the Web. But more than
half of the businesses that had Internet access but no Web page
said they at least planned to get a Web address in the next year.
Ms. Regan said a small business paid $119 for a domain name for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole marketing effort is the small business market,'' Ms.
Regan said. ``It's really starting to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that about 2.5 million of the nation's 7 million
small businesses have some access to the Internet, she said, but
not necessarily Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   There ``are very few brands that have been built solely on the
Web,'' said Jeff Levy, chief executive of Relevant Knowledge, a
company he started two years ago in Atlanta that tracks Web usage.
``You can market solely on the Web if you are only trying to reach
people on line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web reaches about 25 percent of the people in this country.
Web users tend to be wealthier, younger, more literate and better
educated than the population of the nation as a whole. But those
demographics are changing: the average Web user is starting to look
more and more like the average American.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said that in the last year, the number of people using the
Web had risen to 53.4 million from 44 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting a business is a very difficult thing on the Web or in
the bricks-and-mortar world,'' Levy said. ``At the end of the day,
if you want to sell something, you need to create demand. The
challenge is creating awareness and building your brand. One
advantage of the Web is you have international reach.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Tereshko, who is 30, started using the Web in her
early 20s for school research and word processing, she was never a
regular Web surfer. But in business, she banked on the notion that
other parents were looking for the same kinds of products that she
had sought. She figured that those who were in other parts of the
United States or other countries might find her on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tereshko has found clients in Europe, Japan and throughout
the United States, she said. Quality breast-feeding equipment, like
pumps, she said, and good books about breast-feeding are not always
easy for new mothers to find. ``A customer in Idaho tells me she
can't find anything there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tereshko first went on line with about 15 products, an
e-mail address and a toll-free phone number. Adobe Pagemaker and
Photoshop software allowed her to build her catalog on line. She
did not accept credit cards at first, but she did offer a payment
plan for parents who could not afford to pay in one lump sum. She
also offered a choice of free books promoting attachment parenting
and breast-feeding to anyone who ordered at least $150 worth of
products.
</P>
<P>
   About four months ago, she added a feature that lets a shopper
put items in a ``shopping basket,'' or take things out, while
browsing, then order all the desired items at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do everything at once,'' Ms. Tereshko said. ``I
spaced things out. I started with a black-and-white catalog and
added the color later.''
</P>
<P>
   Printing catalogs costs more than $1 apiece, while the software
to put together a cybercatalog means a onetime cost of about
$1,000. The online catalog has another advantage: it can be
continually updated and edited.

   Ms. Tereshko initially invested about $500 in inventory. She
already had the computer equipment so did not have to invest in
hardware or software.
</P>
<P>
   She does not want to release her sales figures. She has the
advantage of not needing to generate an income herself so she can
afford to put the money she makes back into the business, a luxury
not every entrepreneur can manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept investing enough to grow for the next three months or
so, just to see how products were selling, to get a feel for what
was needed in the catalog,'' she said. ``I do things on an
intuitive basis and don't have a business plan. I don't write
things out on paper. I just tend to get a feel for things and then
just do them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, her Web site has had about 10,000 visitors a
week, she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Tereshko is finding that many women appreciate her
online business, Karen Miller, the owner of a walk-in shop for
mothers and babies, says the problem with ordering on line or by
catalog is that things cannot be tried on. Her shop, Boing Boing,
which she opened in Brooklyn in December 1996, caters to nursing
mothers and their babies with clothing, bras, pumps, slings and
diapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer in seeing the stuff,'' Ms. Miller said. But she
realizes that for mothers who don't live near her store, or a store
like hers, it isn't easy to find all the items they need in one
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere they can find information to help them nurse their
babies is great,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Miller and Ms. Tereshko say the women who are their
customers want to talk and get the support of other women with
breast-feeding experience.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tereshko has begun branching out in her online ventures. In
the spring of 1996, she began Just-So Postcards (www.just-so.com)
as a hobby. Visitors to the site can pick out postcards and send
them over the Internet free.
</P>
<P>
   Just-So combines art and literary sayings, many French and
Russian, reflecting the backgrounds of Ms. Tereshko and her
husband. Ms. Tereshko's parents left the Soviet Union for the
United States when she was 4; she and Sasha speak Russian. Dr.
Servan-Schreiber lived in France until he was 18; Sasha will start
taking French classes this week. The postcards quote authors like
Baudelaire, Dostoyevsky and Lewis Carroll. The sender just has to
pick a card and write a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want Just-So to have commercial or mass appeal,'' Ms.
Tereshko said. About 500 postcards a day are now being sent. Ms.
Tereshko said she believed that people should invest their time in
things they have emotions about, as she is doing with her ventures.
</P>
<P>
   A Little Koala postcard for new mothers that can be reached
through the Just-So main page is of a Picasso painting, ``Mother
and Child,'' which shows a nursing mother gazing calmly down at her
contented baby. ``People have to do something they have knowledge
of and have a strong passion for,'' Ms. Tereshko said. ``Customers
will pick that up. If you have a passion and a commitment, people
pick up on that.''

   HDTV's MIXED SIGNALS: NOTES FROM THE FIRST (AND ONLY?) VIEWER  
 (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ WHD-TV, the broadcast industry's experimental
high-definition television station, doesn't have many regular
viewers. In fact, the actual number is one.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, it first went on the air here in Washington to
give broadcasters and equipment manufacturers a signal they could
use to test their newly designed equipment as they got ready for
digital broadcasting, which begins Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, television manufacturers have been making
clandestine trips into town with their prototype HDTV receivers, to
see how they worked with a real, live broadcast signal. But until
Oct. 1, no one in the Washington area actually had a digital,
high-definition television receiver in his home. None have yet gone
on sale.
</P>
<P>
   But at the start of October, Panasonic Corp., lent me an
advanced prototype of their receiver, a set-top box that will reach
the stores in a few weeks, along with a production model of the
company's high-definition monitor, already on sale nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   With that, in short order, I became WHD-TV's first and only
regular viewer, ``the only civilian in the nation'' with an HDTV,
Panasonic informed me. And I learned what thousands of Americans
will soon discover: Having an HDTV in your home is an experience
both mesmerizing and frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   If you can overcome the sticker shock (the Panasonic equipment
sells for $7,700) the first problem is getting an HDTV into your
house. Every manufacturer but one is making rear-projection sets,
and they are big. The Panasonic monitor, with a 56-inch screen, is
more than four feet tall, four feet wide and two feet deep. It
weighs 251 pounds. And this is hardly the biggest of them. (The
largest Mitsubishi model is more than 6 feet tall and 5 feet wide.)
</P>
<P>
   As a two-man delivery team struggled to get the Panasonic set
off the truck, Preston Padden's description of these
first-generation HDTV's came to mind. When he was president of the
ABC Television network early this year, he remarked: ``You're going
to need a crane to get them into your living room. Why, one of them
I saw was eight feet wide and five feet deep. You'll have to lay a
foundation slab for it and build your house around it.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it turned out that the delivery squad couldn't get
the monitor down the steps to the basement, into the room specially
designed for this purpose. (As the TV sat in the yard, there WAS a
brief discussion of using a crane.) Instead, puffing and groaning,
they heaved it into the ground-floor living room. And as soon as
the set was rolled into place, the room's center of gravity seemed
to shift.
</P>
<P>
   This set, like every HDTV to be sold in the next year, is also
able to receive and display conventional TV broadcasts. That turns
out to be both a blessing and a drawback.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that high-definition programming is generally
broadcast in a new, wide-screen format. As a result, the Panasonic
monitor is shaped more like a movie screen than a convention TV
screen. That's fine for wide-screen programming, but what about all
of the square-framed shows filmed and taped over the last 50 years?
They are shown in a vertical space at the center of the screen,
with broad gray bands on the left and right, in what the industry
calls ``letterbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, television manufacturers are convinced that most Americans
don't like letterboxes; they want their TV shows to fill up all of
the expensive real estate on the screen. So Panasonic has included
a re-sizing feature that allows viewers to stretch the picture so
it fills the screen. It worked well enough but seemed vaguely
dissatisfying, though the exact reason was not clear until a movie
came on featuring Julia Roberts. Walking down a hallway on this
stretched screen, she looked like she needed a few weeks on a thigh
master. Switching back to letterbox immediately solved her weight
problem.
</P>
<P>
   (This is not a criticism of Panasonic's resizing technology,
particularly. Almost every wide-screen set will offer a similar
feature with the same benefits and liabilities.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this issue isn't the real point. This set was not for
watching conventional television. This is a digital,
HIGH-DEFINITION TV.
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up the prototype digital tuner box was simple enough. It
is about the size of a laptop computer and sat comfortably atop the
set, with acres of space to spare. Connected to jacks in the back
of the television and invoked from a remote control, it took over
control of the set and began looking for digital-television
signals.
</P>
<P>
   For the foreseeable future, viewers will be able to receive
high-definition programming only over the air. Cable TV stations
are not interested in carrying it. And while some direct-broadcast
satellite services will offer a few high-definition channels,
viewers will have to buy new dishes and set-top boxes, and those
won't go on sale until next year.
</P>
<P>
   So to get 21st-century TV, it is necessary to use
mid-20th-century technology _ a rooftop TV antenna, preferably with
a rotor. The antenna company that had installed one on the roof a
few weeks earlier had carefully labeled the rotor box with little
stickers showing which way to point the antenna for best reception
of the various TV stations in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   The tower and antenna for WHD-TV, channel 30, are right beside
the tower for WRC-TV, channel 4, the NBC station here. So with the
antenna carefully aimed at WRC, and the digital tuner box turned to
channel 30, the first digital, high-definition television set in a
consumer's home showed _ nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic offered the services, by telephone, of several
engineers on the tuner-box design team, who said they had faced the
same problem on a recent trip to Washington. ``Digital signals are
funny,'' one of them explained. You have to turn the antenna away
from the station by 20 or 30 degrees to get a signal.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, most buyers of this box won't be able to call up the
engineers who designed it. Still, Panasonic says it has advised its
sales force not to sell customers the huge high-definition monitor
before determining whether they can pick up a digital signal.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, sure enough, with the antenna turned about 20
degrees away from straight on, the TV did pick up a signal, of
sorts.
</P>
<P>
   WHD was airing a high-definition tape of a recent Duke-North
Carolina State football game, recorded by cameramen from WRAL-HD,
another model station in Raleigh, N.C. But on the monitor, the Duke
quarterback was caught frozen in the middle of throwing a pass, his
arm jerking spasmodically back and forth like a battery-operated
toy quarterback with a stuck joint.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yes, just as the Panasonic engineer said, digital-television
signals ``are funny.'' On the edge of a clear-reception area, the
signal doesn't simply grow fuzzier and fuzzier with every passing
mile, a phenomenon known in the industry as ``graceful
degradation.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, digital signals seize up and freeze, as the Duke
quarterback had done. Finally, with careful adjustment of the
antenna rotor _ a degree east, two degrees south _ the picture
unfroze, and the game played on.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the difficulties of receiving a signal from what is
still, admittedly, an experimental station, the advantages of
digital HDTV are immediately obvious. It doesn't simply offer a
clearer, sharper picture. Color rendition is vastly improved. So
the players' jerseys, the grass and the sky seemed to sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the clarity was startling, too. For the first time
watching a football game on TV, it was possible to pick out the
faces of individual fans sitting in the distant stands. And players
tangled on the turf after a violent tackle were not just a blurred
lump of bodies. They were individuals with easily distinguishable
arms, fingers, feet _ and anguished looks on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   But as glorious as the picture looked, it was also clear that
this television, like almost every high-definition set going on
sale in the coming weeks, is not capable of displaying
full-resolution HDTV. Panasonic and other manufacturers had to make
several compromises to keep the price just below the ionosphere.
</P>
<P>
   At several points along the signal path inside the set _ from
the red, green and blue cathode ray tubes that create the picture;
through the lenses, past the mirror that redirects the signal and
through the screen, which acts as a filter _ rear projection sets
hold a host of resolution-reducing mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that, over several days, WHD replayed the football
game repeatedly. In between, the station aired various promotional
tapes that television stations around the country have made so they
can demonstrate HDTV to their viewers. In this, the pre-dawn of the
digital age, there isn't much high-definition material available.
</P>
<P>
   None of this programming proved terribly interesting after
awhile, so as WHD's only regular viewer, I called Bruce Miller, the
station manager, and asked if he would mind putting on a movie,
hoping for something like video-on-demand from my TV station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he said. ``It'll be kind of fun; kind of like
operating a real broadcast station.'' And then he listed the five
high-definition films he happened to have on hand.
</P>
<P>
   I selected ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' for the historical symmetry.
It was the first movie ever broadcast in digital high definition,
back in 1986. But it turned out that, at three and one-half hours,
the film was too long. The station shuts down each day at 6 p.m.,
so the staff would have had to stay late to turn everything off.
Instead, Miller played ``Sleepless in Seattle.'' And it looked
splendid _ bright and crystal clear.
</P>
<P>
   But about halfway through the movie, the screen went blank. The
signal was gone. Had the prototype tuner shorted out? Had the
rooftop antenna slipped out of place by a degree or two? Or was
there yet another ``funny'' digital dilemma?
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of minutes, the movie came back. Later, Miller
explained. WHD had only one video player in house. As a result,
midway through the movie, one of the station's technicians had to
change over to the second reel.

   There's very little reason to tour Silicon Valley, but if you do
end up there, you can get a flavor for the place without trying to
sneak into Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Jan English-Lueck, who studies the culture of Silicon Valley as
a San Jose State University anthropology professor, recommended
going to Fry's Electronics. ``You can see real Silicon Valley
people talking about chips,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another place where tourists can spot guys with pocket
protectors getting into their Porsche Boxters: Faultline Brewing
Co., a Sunnyvale-based microbrewery, is an after-work watering hole
for engineers at Amdahl, 3Com, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Laser tag, an activity where you shoot laser beams at your
co-workers, has become the sport of nerds, so you'll find a lot of
software engineers playing the game at the laser tag clubs in the
area. The world's next millionaires eat lunch and make deals at
Buck's in Woodside, an area that is populated with high-tech
executives, sort of the Beverly Hills of high tech.
</P>
<P>
   For dinner the geek chic go to Il Fornaio in Palo Alto. ``It's
fun to watch the waitresses flirt with stock-optioned nerds,'' said
Sally Atkins, a high-tech consultant in Boston who frequently
travels to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   For more conventional looks at technology, try the Intel Museum

   &UR; Birdhouse Gourds &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have some questions about birdhouse gourds. When are they
ready for harvest? Must they age or dry out after harvesting? How
does one make a real birdhouse from the birdhouse gourd? The
picture on the seed packet appealed to me but gave no information
other than how to plant it.
</P>
<P>
   A. Think small birds. Like most hard-shell gourds, bottle gourds
(Lagenaria siceraria), which are used for birdhouses or musical
instruments, prefer a long, hot season to grow and ripen. Start
seeds indoors, about three to four weeks before the last frost,
then plant outside in full sun once the night temperatures remain
above 60 degrees. I know a Northern gardener who helps his
heat-loving vines along by letting them climb and sprawl on an
arbor built over an asphalt driveway. The black asphalt captures
heat during the day and releases it at night, helping the vines to
explode with lush, leafy foliage and fragrant, night-blooming
flowers. It also helps the fruit to mature.
</P>
<P>
   Let them grow as long as they can, until light frost withers the
plants. Harvest the gourds, including a couple of inches of stem.
Hang them up to dry at room temperature, spacing them for good air
circulation. Let the gourds dry until you can hear the seeds rattle
around when you shake them _ anywhere from six months to a year,
depending on the size.
</P>
<P>
   If you want homemade maracas, you are done, except for the fancy
painting. For a birdhouse, cut a hole far enough up from the base
for a bird to feather its nest, but not up into the neck area. You
want the birds to be able to get in without banging their heads
against the back wall. The size of the hole depends on the birds.
Chickadees, for example, need a 1{-inch hole. Larger birds will
need a larger hole, and a larger gourd. Add one or two small
drainage holes in the bottom, clean out the seeds with a spoon and
it's ready. Or don't clean it out and let the birds have the seeds
as a moving-in gift.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quick Cover &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have any information as to which are the
fastest-growing evergreens?
</P>
<P>
   A. It really depends on your needs. Most requests for
fast-growing evergreens come from people who discover that the new
neighbor collects junk cars. If that's the case, then a fast grower
like white pine might not be a good choice. While it grows as much
as 50 feet in 25 years, it eventually loses some lower branches,
letting the glint from those old hubcaps shine through. It is also
sensitive to salt, making it a poor roadside choice if your
community uses salt in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Is your site wet? The tall, slender Atlantic white cedar
(Chamaecyparis thyoides) will do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Are you making a hedge? Canadian hemlock works well, but wooly
adelgid attacks mean a high maintenance obligation.
</P>
<P>
   I know you see it everywhere, but eastern arborvitae (Thuja
occidentalis) does make an effective, quick-growing hedge. A more
handsome version _ the western or great arborvitae (Thuja plicata),
does well from Boston to Cincinnati to Raleigh, N.C., despite the
Western connotation of its common name.
</P>
<P>
   A grouping of three to five tall, pyramidal Japanese cryptomeria
forms a screen, not really a hedge, although it works better as a
single specimen tree. The feathery Leyland cypress (x
Cupressocyparis leylandii) gives a more columnar screen and grows
in coastal areas from Massachusetts to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   For large, single specimens, Norway spruce (Picea abies) and
Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica) grow quickly when young, then slow
down.
</P>
<P>
   Spend a little time looking before you buy. Large evergreens are
a strong presence in the landscape, summer and winter. This is a
great season to go to public arboretums and botanical gardens and
look at mature examples. Do you have the room? Is it as cute at 30
feet, or 80, as it is in a 1-gallon container?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Not Quite Figs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have what appears to be a very healthy fig tree in our
yard in New Jersey, protected on three sides by low structures. In
early September each year, the tree is full of figs, but it never
seems to produce much ripened fruit.
</P>
<P>
   It usually gets trimmed back in late fall and every year comes
back as full as can be, but all we ever get is maybe a dozen
partially ripened figs. Is there anything we can do to get more
fruit?
</P>
<P>
   A. When you are out there in the fall, whacking it back, do you
ever notice those little swellings at the branch nodes? Not the
pointed ones, which are just leaf buds, but the rounded ones, about
the size of a pencil eraser? Some varieties of figs would bear two
crops if the season were long enough, and those buds will become
next year's first crop of figs. If you prune selectively each fall,
leaving the branches that have the most of those small buds, they
will overwinter and will have time to ripen by the following fall,
assuming you protect the tree during winter by wrapping it, burying
it or, if it's in a container, bringing it into an unheated room
(25 to 45 degrees). The year's second crop, which grows on each
summer's new growth, may not have time to ripen because Northern
summers are not hot long enough.
</P>
<P>
   If careful pruning doesn't increase your yield, and your tree is
in full sun, you have one of the many varieties that won't ripen
fruit in a Northern summer. If so, send the tree to California and
buy one that will, such as Brown Turkey (not California Brown
Turkey), Celeste, Magnolia or Petite Negri. When choosing from a
catalog, look for words like cool season, early ripening, or
Northern variety.
</P>

BALANCING ACT: FINDING THE RIGHT ONLINE SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend Liz DeGennaro called the other day to say she was
thinking about going on line for the first time. She figured that
she would liberate her Macintosh Power PC from the closet, where it
has resided in the months since she left graduate school, set up a
family computer station in the corner of an almost-renovated
bedroom and then ``do a little e-mail, some Web surfing, some
research.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what I think she said, because her baby, Emma,
was cooing into the phone receiver and on my end of the line, my
baby was rhythmically hitting my leg with an unplugged surge
protector.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem is I don't know which online provider to
use,'' Ms. DeGennaro shouted. ``I figured you would be able to
recommend one.''
</P>
<P>
   One would think so, especially since I have no fewer than four
online accounts, none of which I am willing to give up. I keep
multiple accounts because my greatest fear is that at any moment, a
system outage will block my access to e-mail. I have even gone so
far as to rummage in my husband's desk to find a password to enable
me to set up one of his online accounts on my computer, as a backup
to the backup's backup.
</P>
<P>
   But since I doubted that Ms. DeGennaro shared that little
anxiety (and since my baby was now trying to eat the surge
protector), I reflexively gave her the same advice I've been
dispensing for years: ``You'll be better off with a small local
provider. Try Panix _ it's the oldest online provider in the New
York area.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as I hung up the phone, however, I started to
doubt my own advice. The conventional wisdom that called for
hooking up with a small local provider might have been sound a few
years back, when there were far fewer choices and the process of
configuring equipment was complicated enough to require hours of
hand-holding from sympathetic technical support workers. But in an
atmosphere where thousands of online providers, both local and
nationwide, compete aggressively for new customers, choosing one
has become trickier.
</P>
<P>
   I got a firsthand lesson in just how tricky when I went on line
to compare features touted on the Web pages of a handful of
providers. Each one offered different levels of service, technical
support and prices _ and none seemed to have it all.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Echo oozed a sense of online community but offered
local dial-up service only in the 212 area code. Mindspring had an
excellent graphical interface, a toll-free number for 24-hour tech
support and a competitive price of $19.95 a month, but it seemed
too generic for a first-time user. GST Whole Earth Networks is
reliable and rarely serves up a busy signal, but a phone call to
the tech support staff, on the West Coast, is a toll call. And
Panix was expensive: $32.50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   America Online came the closest to supplying all the items on my
wish list. But when I called Ms. DeGennaro to describe the service,
she said she would be put off by the cloying user interface, the
relentless advertisements and AOL's annoying habit of disconnecting
idle users.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly confused, I phoned Ruth Chatterton, a consultant for
Telechoice, a telecommunications consultancy that recently surveyed
1,550 readers of Interactive Week for PC Week magazine to ask about
the quality of their online providers. After I explained the
situation, Ms. Chatterton said, ``Hmm, you found out that there is
no easy answer.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because all Internet access is not created equal: phone
lines have quirks, modems can be configured differently and
connection speeds vary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the same online provider as your friend, and she
lives down the street from you and dials into a different phone
number, she could have an entirely different service from you,''
Ms. Chatterton cautioned. That said, the survey's respondents said
the best online providers _ based on reliability, quality of
technical support and price _ were AT&AMP;T Worldnet, GTE
Internetworking, MCI Communications, Sprint Communications and
UUnet Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that choosing a first online provider is as
personal a decision as buying your first car. After hours of
sorting through the fine print of service agreements, options and
price, you might find yourself driving off the car lot in a
convertible just because it's red. That's fine, as long as you
consider these things first:
</P>
<P>
   _ Performance. Ask friends if they are happy with their
providers. When you dial, you should connect on the first or second
try. Repeated busy signals mean that a provider doesn't have enough
phone lines to handle customers' needs. Once connected, you should
stay connected. ``Some providers can disconnect you after as little
as five minutes of inactivity,'' Ms. Chatterton warned. ``They
don't always advertise that feature.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Services. Ask about such features as free storage space for
personal Web pages, toll-free dial-up numbers when you travel, the
availability of an old-fashioned shell account with a Unix
command-line interface, to enable you to telnet in from any
computer and technical support. The first time that a software
upgrade makes it impossible to check e-mail, you'll be thankful if
your provider has a 24-hour, toll-free number.
</P>
<P>
   _ Price. Monthly costs can range from $7.95 to $35, depending on
how much time you will be on line. A rule of thumb: plenty of
nationwide carriers like Mindspring and Earthlink offer good value
for less than $20 a month.
</P>
<P>
   After I phoned Ms. DeGennaro to report, she said she still did
not know which provider to choose and there was no real hurry
because she just found out that the guy who was supposed to finish
the room renovation was too busy. So I gave her a final piece of
advice: go over to a friend's house to take a test drive before
deciding.
</P>
<P>
   Before she gets here with Emma, I will put the surge protector
on a high shelf.

ONE MAN'S LONG LOVE AFFAIR WITH GADGETS PLAIN AND FANCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN CHEEVER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the Little Bighorn, according to the writer Evan S.
Connell, ``one Cheyenne pulled a flat, round object out of a
trooper's pocket.'' ``This thing was made of white metal and glass,
with black marks under the glass,'' he went on, ``and was thought
to be alive because of the noise it made. The Cheyennes decided
this must be the soldiers' medicine, so the warrior kept it. But
the next day it died. He threw it away _ as far as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   I know just how the Cheyenne must have felt. I don't throw away
my broken gadgets, but then the Plains Indians didn't have sock
drawers. There are socks, of course, in my sock drawer; there are
even a red bandanna and a box of 12-gauge shotgun shells
(Extra-Lite Target Load).
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, this is all veneer, the sham of normality. The sock
drawer, a traditional repository of male essentials, is awash in AA
and AAA batteries. There's a Sharp Wizard (electronic organizer 0Z
7000) with a thesaurus card installed; a Psion Seina (16-bit,
multitasking, infrared) with a full meg of RAM; a Freestyle digital
pedometer; a chrome key chain with a built-in flashlight, which is
supposed to find itself when I clap; a Franklin Bookman (with the
entire King James version of the Bible inside), plus a Casio
stopwatch with a compass.
</P>
<P>
   You could have synchronized the landing at Omaha Beach with the
Casio watches I've purchased and then abandoned. I run, so I always
have an excuse to own one stopwatch, but one stopwatch, like one
martini, is not enough. For years I had a parrot, a macaw named
Ned, who was chiefly prized for the fact that when I put him on my
shoulder, he would climb down to my wrist and break my newest
watch. In those years, the early '90s, Casio always introduced
several more desirable models before I could get the battery to run
out on the one I owned. I adored that bird.
</P>
<P>
   I'm of Yankee stock: Use it up, make do, or do without. But what
did my forebears know of gadgets? They had something, I believe,
for crushing apples. In a museum in Newburyport, Mass., I saw an
ugly piece of black metal designed to help ladies with their
high-button shoes and a hoe-like tool for keeping sharks away from
the whale blubber. Where's the fun in that?
</P>
<P>
   Whereas who can resist a shiny new stopwatch with a pulse meter
built right in? I've also had one with a light inside, which could
be set to flash when the alarm went off. I coveted, though never
purchased, a model supposed to chart my biorhythms. I've not yet
owned an altimeter or barometer either, although as recently as
this morning, I ogled the catalog copy for the Casio Pathfinder,
Triple Sensor, which has both and also a compass, which I couldn't
master in its stand-alone manifestation.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not certain if Casio manufactured the unit with the
databank, but that watch did add thrills to car rides because I
often removed hands from the wheel and eyes from the road to enter
names and phone numbers. That was done through a complicated
process in which I had to select each letter and number
individually, moving up or down the alphabet, by working tiny
buttons on the body of the instrument. You could see the time and
also the data, which were suspended by magic in the glass of the
watch face. This gem I loved not wisely, but too well. In a
yearlong ecstasy of erratic driving, I entered so many names and
numbers that I exhausted the battery, at which point the little
darling forgot everything, even the time.
</P>
<P>
   I've never had a talking watch, or one that woke me soundlessly
with vibrations, but I did buy a talking alarm for my eldest son.
(When you can't justify purchasing the newest gadget for yourself,
you can give it away, which is almost as gratifying.) This clock
could be programmed to make the sound of a rooster in agony. John
played with it for a week or two, then let the clock settle into
the detritus of soiled laundry, stuffed animals, cartoon
collections and discarded CDs with which he has furnished his room
and stocked his closet.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably responding to some inner prompting, it used to go off
sometimes on a quiet afternoon, sounding for all the world like a
billionaire rooster being audited and sending the father of its
owner on a fevered search through toy bins and under the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Unless swimming or sleeping, I always have a Walkman on my belt
or attached with a plastic flange to my right front pocket. When
not actually conversing with another live human being _ this rarely
happens _ I'm listening to a recorded book. The new, electronically
enhanced Ben not only peeps twice on the hour but also fills the
chambers of his inferior consciousness with the words of Gilbert K.
Chesterton or William Makepeace Thackery. The creature's wires lead
from ears to belt and catch often on opened drawers or door
handles, yanking the stoppers from its ears and hurling the little
instrument to the ground. Not wishing to alarm my wife with the
spectacle of my profligacy, I buy the replacement in a similar
style and color.
</P>
<P>
   I've had Day Runners and Franklin Planners but now carry the
record of my life and loves in a personal digital assistant (PDA),
a Psion Series 3c. (The Siena is for backup.) The Psion has the
immense advantage of being easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   I hope you haven't made the mistake of concluding that my
passion for electronic baubles means that I'm at all good at using
them. If I buy a device with seven functions, I'm lucky to master
three. The Psion has 10 functions; I can handle 8. I feel naked
without it.
</P>
<P>
   When I'm in the city, one of my favorite recreations is to stop
_ while listening to a book, with my watch humming and my Psion 3c
holding a thousand names and phone numbers _ and peer into the
windows of an electronics store, gaping at the miniature cameras
and competitive PDAs. I feel almost as if I have my ear to the
great microprocessing heart of the world. Is this love, or only
cupidity?
</P>
<P>
   Why do I adore gadgets? Some simply look and sound the part. The
Psion, for instance, is handsome, as were the early G-Shock Casios.
I share with the magpie the desire to possess foreign objects. A
stranger to clothing of any sort, the bird is drawn to shiny
buttons, while the man who flunked calculus is fascinated by the
products of high engineering. The intricacy of even the simplest
device is so far beyond my comprehension as to be entirely
miraculous.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's always the hope that the gadget will be of use. No
task is so mundane or so ethereal as to rule out the possibility of
an assist from a little gizmo with a battery on board. For
instance, take nasal hair and nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   Nasal hair: I've had two electronic clippers, both of which made
marvelous sounds, but neither of which could cut the barbed wire
that pours out of my old nose and ears. The Sharper Image is now
marketing a more expensive version with a light in it. I might be
tempted, but in this case I really don't want to see what I'm
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Nirvana: I've read a good deal about meditation. Who could grow
up in the '60s and fail to do so? I'm bitterly disappointed, both
in my ability to control involuntary muscles _ which any decent
yogi can do _ and in my slow passage toward satori. It could be
that I haven't worked hard enough at meditation, but maybe not.
Perhaps I simply lack the proper equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The gadget I settled on was a piece of plastic, shaped much like
a computer mouse, with a metal strip and rudimentary earplug. You
hold the instrument so the metal strip can measure the tension on
the skin of your fingers. The findings are translated into a
buzzing sound heard through the plug. When I lay on the bed,
dreaming of a Caribbean vacation, I could change the buzzing from a
weee, weee, to a waaaa, waaaa, and eventually to a whoooooa. As
soon as the phone rang, I was back to wee, wee, wee again.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the signal faded altogether. I changed the battery, but
the instrument was dead.
</P>
<P>
   I was sad, of course, as I'm sure that Cheyenne warrior was when
the watch proved short-lived. But I still adore gadgets. Even with
a dead one, I can always recall the moment, full of hope, when I
first tear it from its wrapper, grasp it in my hands and stuff the
plug in the wall or my ear. ``It works,'' I always think. ``It
lives!''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   DEWEY, Ariz. _ Dale Dunivin got a little misty-eyed as he
remembered the first time he hauled his fighting cock, Ol' Blue, to
the pits in Quartzsite three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Seems that Ol' Blue was paying way too much attention to loving
and not enough to fighting, when a rather effeminate-looking
``henny cock'' took to the center of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he had himself a new girlfriend,'' Dunivin said.
``But that other cock got on top of him and cut down through his
back, cutting his ribs loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were going to lose him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ol' Blue rallied, put some moves on his foe, and managed to
dig his spurs into the heart of the other fowl. It was all over but
the shouting as the bleeding enemy slumped to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as usual, Ol' Blue, who actually is reddish brown, pecked
off the downed cock's head.
</P>
<P>
   After three months on the mend, Dunivin's fighting rooster went
on to six more wins and retired to stud service.
</P>
<P>
   It's fond memories like those that make Dunivin downright angry
about what the ``city people'' are trying to do to him and his kind
with the anti-cockfighting Proposition 201 on Arizona's Nov. 3
election ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The proposition would make even attending a cockfight a
misdemeanor, and it would leave only four states where the blood
sport is legal _ Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Dunivin, 51, a retired heavy-equipment operator, calls it a
``full-scale attack on rural America by people who have only seen
trees in parks.''
</P>
<P>
   If the proposition passes, he vows, he'll sell his 70 acres in
this small ranching community east of Prescott and move to western
New Mexico, where he can legally continue the much-maligned sport.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was a way of life handed down to Dale Dunivin when
he was 12 by his miner father, Roy. Dale's son, 20-year-old Gabe,
has continued the tradition, raising fighting cocks in his spare
time while managing a Prescott Valley sandwich shop.
</P>
<P>
   The Dunivins definitely aren't in it for the money, Dale says.
In a good year, he barely covers the cost of feed. When
cockfighters get together on the weekends, he says, they normally
don't bet more than $20 on their birds.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is his a large operation, Dunivin says. He has 50 cocks, and
he fights about eight of them a year. About 100 hens are fenced in
against the area's large population of coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Dunivin says he doesn't understand what all the fuss is about;
roosters, after all, are ``way down there on the food chain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, these are primitive birds that come from the jungle,''
said Dunivin, a man with a full belly; brown, leathery face; and
tightly braided ponytail snaking down his back. ``No one ever said
they saw a smart rooster. They don't do tricks, crow when the house
is on fire or walk the kids to the school bus.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing they do well is explode into an orgy of
violence when they see another rooster. Fighting cocks are paired
off in the ring when they weigh 4 to 6 pounds, and they battle to
the death, which usually comes well within the 20-minute time
limit.
</P>
<P>
   Tactics are few, Dunivin said. Some birds will do a feint and
sidestep an aggressive rooster flying in at them. Others, called
shufflers, are especially effective because they throw their legs
out in front of them, with the razor-sharp blades attached to their
claws.
</P>
<P>
   Dunivin said it's a struggle to keep them from killing one
another even when the blades are removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen them peck one another to death through knotholes,''
Dunivin said, watching two roosters try to go at it in his pen,
ropes taut as their necks strained toward the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been bred for this for hundreds of years.''
</P>
<P>
   They sure aren't much for eating, Dunivin says. After fights,
dead roosters are generally just thrown in the trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are just a big chunk of muscle, like boxers after
road training,'' he said. ``You could put them in a Crock Pot for
hours and they wouldn't be tender enough to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which means _ to him _ that a rooster biting the dust in
battle is no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   True, fighting birds may eventually die in the ring, but
meanwhile, some of them may enjoy something approaching a life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this one ol' cock, you could pick him up and pet him and
he would purr like a baby,'' Dunivin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died of a heart attack at 10 years old.'' &QL;

GOODWILL STORES HAVE BECOME HIP SHOPPING DESTINATIONS FOR GEN-XERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM ROGERS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ We can assume that the Rev. Edgar Helms of
Boston _ who, in 1910, founded what would become Goodwill
Industries _ was not hip. Neither was the good reverend, most
likely, groovy. He certainly didn't know that gray would become the
new black.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, hip is how a new breed of Goodwill shoppers has
come to consider the retail stores. Due in part to Generation X's
preternatural nostalgia for all things from the '70s (and '80s and
even early '90s, it seems) and thanks to image-building efforts
from the organization itself, Goodwill isn't just for people with
``special needs'' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was Goodwill before Goodwill was cool,'' says local
twentysomething bohemian Bret McCabe. ``I've been going there for
about a decade. My shopping technique, wherever I've lived, is to
find the poorest neighborhood and to go there. You avoid places
where hipsters go because they'll sift through everything and get
the good stuff. They won't go to the poor neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most Goodwillers, McCabe speaks lovingly of a favorite
find. ``It was an early '70s-era purple, shiny three-piece suit,
with, like, huge lapels. It had a sheen to it,'' he says. ``I paid
about $1.50 or $2. But I gave it to a friend because it looked
better on him. He had an Afro.''
</P>
<P>
   McCabe does admit to having ``special needs,'' but not the sort
that Goodwill has strived to meet for almost a century. The
nonprofit organization uses revenues from its stores to fund
community-based training and job-placement programs for people who
otherwise might slip through the cracks. Last year, Goodwill
Industries served more than 200,000 people through training and job
placement and sold nearly $690 million in donated goods.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Quillian, the director of sales for Goodwill Industries of
Fort Worth, says her organization got its groove back by focusing
on retail display in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it really has to do with changing our image
and the way we present ourselves,'' she says. ``We're not what
people typically think a thrift store is. It's surprising to a lot
of people, when they first come in, that we look just like any
other store.''
</P>
<P>
   Quillian says the national trend within Goodwill is to recruit
store managers who have retail experience, people who ``really know
how to set up a store and really create some excitement in it.''
Quillian herself worked at Ross Dress For Less and Dillard's before
coming to Goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most surprising thing about Goodwill is not that
bohemian hipsters snatch up the retro threads hanging on its
well-displayed racks, but that the decidedly downscale shop founded
by a Methodist minister is actually shaping the future of upscale
fashion. Doubters need look no further than the Dallas-based design
firm William Reid.
</P>
<P>
   William Reid's fall line graces such high-end shops as Stanley
Korshak, Takashimaya and Saks Fifth Avenue. Reid is so hip that
sources say he knows what the new gray is _ or at least has a good
idea. And, as it turns out, he shops Goodwill for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a fashion library,'' Reid says. ``I go in
there just looking for things that are very unusual, whether it's
details or fabrics or certain silhouettes that you can't explain to
someone. We find a lot of old ties, and we'll take a pattern of
that tie and put it in the computer and play with it a little bit
and make it into shirts and all sorts of things.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Reid has found clothes at Goodwill whose sartorial
splendor has stymied the finest craftsmen of Italy. Only a few
weeks ago, he bought a jacket for $15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a leather jacket that had this braiding stitched around
the cuff,'' he remembers fondly. ``It was so unusual. We
immediately sent it over to our manufacturers and said, `How
difficult is it to do this?' They laughed and said they couldn't
touch it. The machinery to do some of those things just isn't
around anymore.''

COCKFIGHTERS MOUNT NOVEL DEFENSE  
 (ADV: WITH COCKFIGHT AND PHOTO) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE MCCLOY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Trailing 3-1 in the polls, Arizona cockfighters are
huddling behind a ``Mount Rushmore defense'' against a proposed ban
on their sport.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln all were
cockfighters, David Harris says in a publicity pamphlet for the
Nov. 3 general election. Proposition 201 would be a slap in the
face of the nation's founders, Harris, a cockfighter, claims.
</P>
<P>
   James Massey, head of Citizens Against Cockfighting, was
skeptical of Harris' claims. But just to be sure, he asked an ally,
the Humane Society of the United States, to put an investigator on
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, a check with historical agencies in the home states
of all four presidents found no chicken blood in the background of
Jefferson or Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington and Jackson? That was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's correspondence mentions that the future president
attended a cockfight when he was 19.
</P>
<P>
   Cockfighting was the least scurrilous of the accusations hurled
against Jackson in the 1828 presidential campaign, and it had some
substance. To defend himself, Jackson had scrawled a handwritten
message at some point during the campaign protesting that he had
not been to a cockfight ``for the last 13 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The sport was banned in Jackson's home state of Tennessee in
1881. In fact, 31 states outlawed cockfighting by the beginning of
the 20th century. Going into the next millennium, only Arizona,
Oklahoma, Louisiana, Missouri and New Mexico still allow it.
</P>
<P>
   After two dozen defeats in the Arizona Legislature, Massey's
group gathered more than 150,000 signatures of voters for the
initiative. The Arizona Game Fowl Breeders Association lost a court
challenge to keep the measure off the ballot last month.
</P>
<P>
   Of 811 voters polled statewide Oct. 3-6 by ``The Arizona
Republic,'' 59 percent said they definitely would vote for the ban
and 8 percent said they probably would. Thirteen percent were
definitely against the ban, and 8 percent said they probably would
vote against it. Twelve
</P>
<P>
   percent could not decide.
</P>
<P>
   Association members are providing most of the money for
television commercials and bumper stickers that call for a ``no''
vote on Prop. 201, proclaiming that cockfighting is not a felony.
</P>
<P>
   It would be if the ban is approved. Anyone who even raises a
rooster with intentions of entering him in a fight could face a
two-year prison term. Fans caught in a cockfighting pit could be
put in the pokey for six months on a misdemeanor charge.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming the sport is no worse than commercial butchering of
chickens, cockfighters say steel blades attached to a fighting
rooster's legs speed up death in the pit, making it more humane
than battling with bare claws.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview, Warren Glick, president of the association,
did not deny that cockfighting is cruel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't like, it, you don't have to attend,'' he said.
``We just want to be left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Massey said he is not a meddler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in civil liberties as much as the next guy,'' he
said. ``I just don't believe animal abuse is their right.''
</P>
<P>
   While 10 Arizona sheriffs endorse the ban and claim a link
between cockfighting and homicide, rape, gambling and drug
possession, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office reports no such
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not illegal, therefore we don't have a code for it,''
Maricopa County Sheriff's spokesman Dave Trombi said. ``So there's
no way to check the computer. It's a non-issue unless the law
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 40 cockfighting pits and 18,000 breeders in the
state, Glick estimates that law enforcement could cost more than $1
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Proposition 201 says police could arrest only those who
raise roosters for fighting, ``we're scared that they're going to
come onto our place like the Gestapo and take our property,'' Glick
said. ``We're looking at a lot of litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   If cockfighting goes, Arizona's economy will suffer, Glick
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, there's a lot of tourism involved,'' he
said. ``People come here from states where it's not legal.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimated 18,000 Arizonans are raising about 100 fighting
roosters each, feeding each one a pound of grain a day. ``The
economic impact is probably several million dollars,'' Glick said.
</P>
<P>
   Massey was not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cockfighting boosts the economy?'' he questioned. ``If we
don't win, will that help Arizona's image?'' &QL;

`DO THE MATH?' SURE, WITH HELP ONLINE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Do your homework first!'' Prof. Ellen Freedman of Camden
County College in New Jersey implores students from a rolling
banner across her virtual classroom, which was designed to provide
``information about basic math and algebra.''
</P>
<P>
   But following the professor's admonition might require great
will power: while often informative, her site (www.mathpower.com)
also serves up hours of indulgent distractions, with a menu of
electronic games, not all related to math.
</P>
<P>
   Under the heading of ``fun stuff,'' which is accessible with a
browser that supports Java, there's a three-dimensional Rubik's
cube, a chance to challenge the computer at checkers and even a
version of the kids' game hangman.
</P>
<P>
   And showing that she really has a sense of humor, Professor
Freedman provides her students the chance to take out their anxiety
on her. In a ``morph the professor,'' area, anyone can enjoy
stretching a photograph of her face, grafted onto a cartoon body,
into various superhuman shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Professor Freedman's serious side has compiled an
exhaustive list of more than three dozen links to math-related
sites that offer invaluable help to students of all ages and
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Those sites, including at least three electronic tutoring
services that promise free help, are reached by clicking first on
``classroom and math info,'' and then scrolling down to
``Freedman's suggested math-related links.''
</P>
<P>
   One site, Algebra Online (www.algebra-online.com) offers an
e-mail form on which students can seek help with a vexing math
question, as long as they can ``be specific'' and don't tax the the
tutors with questions like ``teach me how to factor.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar site, the Math Tutor (www.fliegler.com/mathman.htm),
boasts ``years of experience'' and will try to answer any question
on any level, ``from arithmetic to calculus,'' in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all may be ``Ask Dr. Math''
(www.forum.swarthmore.edu/dr.math/dr-math.html), in which the
``doctors'' are college math students and the ``patients'' can be
anyone in kindergarten through grade 12. In addition to questions
answered via e-mail, there is also an archive of past responses
searchable by topic.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the professor's home page, the viewer should beware:
some icons, like ``The Math Teacher's Ten Commandments,'' promise
more than they deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful, also, in the games section, to avoid ``Paint with
Color'' and ``Basketball,'' which seem to have script errors and
easily freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a site that offers any number of resources to
even the casual math student. And besides, who can resist the
chance to indulge in ``Mad Libs,'' in which the computer blindly
asks the viewer for the first words that come to mind and then
combines them into a story.
</P>
<P>
   When a recent visitor to the site played, as a way to avoid
writing an article's final sentence, the computer spat back the
following passage: ``She immediately jumped on the armoire and
knocked over the editor.''

SNOWBIRD FLOCK THINS, WORRYING ARIZONA BUSINESSES  
 (ART ADV: PHOTO IS BEING SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS)

 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. - Silent autumn. Where are the snowbirds?
</P>
<P>
   A recreational-vehicle park in Mesa that usually comes alive by
mid-October looks like a ghost town. Bridge tables remain empty in
nearby Leisure World.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians, traditionally the first snowbirds to arrive, are
missing from Arizona's mobile-home parks, condos, restaurants and
roadways.
</P>
<P>
   Like miners who suddenly notice the silence of their safety
canaries, or botanists who can't find frogs in the streams, Arizona
migration experts are worried: Dwindling snowbirds could indicate
serious peril for small businesses that rely on the seasonal influx
of retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Canadian and U.S.-citizen retirees didn't return in
the numbers economists have come to expect, and this year the
economists fear the seasonal flocks will be even thinner.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 350,000 winter visitors pump $1 billion into
Arizona cash registers, according to Arizona State University's
Center for Business Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, even though the economy was booming, the numbers of
visitors were down _ I am worried about this year,'' said economist
Timothy Hogan, an expert on snowbird migration and director of the
research center.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Arizona winter visitors declined 6 percent last
season _ the first drop since the recession of the early 1990s,
according to a survey by the ASU business center. That's an
estimated 20,000 to 25,000 people who didn't make the Valley of the
Sun, as the metropolitan Phoenix area is called, their home last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   But growth continues in smaller, more rural areas such as Lake
Havasu, Benson, Willcox, Douglas and Casa Grande, where new parks
are being built and where living costs are lower, Hogan said. Yuma,
which has become a big Southwest retirement destination in recent
years, also gained 500 part-time households.
</P>
<P>
   At the Golden Vista RV park in Apache Junction, property manager
Jay Burland is worried. By this time of year, his park normally has
as many as 200 residents, building to more than 2,000 by January.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the place is still looking like a ghost town,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, Joe Stofsick, 76, and his bridge pals at
Leisure World in Mesa can usually count on having 10 or 11 tables
of bridge players as the Canadians start rolling in for the season.
This year they have only had enough people for six or seven tables.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the growth of winter visitor facilities in rural
Arizona, the net number of Arizona visitors is down.
</P>
<P>
   If fewer snowbirds come to the Phoenix area, it is more a
reflection of economic conditions elsewhere, said Hogan, whose
center has tracked annual visitor patterns since the mid-1980s. The
problem was masked last year in Phoenix because the rest of the
economy was doing so well.
</P>
<P>
   The whole farm economy is down, he said. Many winter visitors
are from small agricultural towns in the Midwest and Upper Plains.
Other snowbirds are from Oregon and Washington where economies are
feeling the effects of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the world economy, Canadians have some problems of
their own, Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's dollar, now worth only 64 U.S. cents, is causing some
Canadians to cancel or shorten their U.S. winter visits. Canada's
national insurance program, which penalizes extended residency
outside of Canada, is keeping many at home. And some Canadians are
choosing to retire in resort areas in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Canadians represented 15 to 20 percent of Arizona's
snowbirds, said Tom Rex, research manager for the ASU center.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Burland, property manager of Golden Vista RV resort, hopes
the jittery stock market doesn't change the plans of his U.S.
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the generation from the Great Depression. They know
the value of a dollar and are very conscious of changes in the
economy,'' he said. ``If the economy continues in the direction
that it is going, it might put a little scare in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't know until January _ the peak season _ how badly we
will be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also when Hogan will begin doing calculations for this
year's season. The number of winter visitors in metropolitan
Phoenix is calculated largely from mobile-home and RV park
populations, estimating two people in each household. An estimated
50 percent of seasonal visitors traditionally stay in mobile-home
and RV parks. But Hogan admits it is an imperfect system because
many visitors live in apartments and hotels or with family. Other
factors may also be skewing the visitor statistics, especially in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Many Phoenix-area parks have been full this past year, but not
with winter visitors. Arizona's strong economy, which is attracting
young workers into the state, may be soaking up affordable
apartments, mobile homes and even RV spaces in metropolitan areas,
preventing winter visitors from finding suitable quarters.
</P>
<P>
   New mobile-home parks are rare in the Phoenix metropolitan area
and many older ones have been demolished and replaced with other
development.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to mobile home spaces, a significant number of
condominiums, townhomes and single-family homes are owned by
part-time residents, including many of the homes in developments
such as Leisure World and Sun Lakes. But if Stofsick's experience
with his missing bridge players at Leisure World is any indication,
even those who own more expensive homes are staying away longer.
</P>
<P>
   One of Stofsick's Canadian neighbors at Leisure World is Phyllis
Hallatt of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. One of her Canadian friends in
Arizona sold his Leisure World home after he had a heart attack and
couldn't get health insurance in Canada for more than 61 days away
from home. She knows of others who will be wintering in Victoria,
British Columbia, instead of Arizona. It's not as warm, but they
will be covered by the Canadian medical plan and will be spending
Canadian dollars at full value.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian health care system has undergone severe cuts this
decade. Winter visitors, who used to have full health care coverage
even when in the United States, now must pay big money for
travelers' policies that cover little more than emergency
procedures. A five- or six-month supplemental travelers' insurance
policy can cost $1,000 to $4,000, depending on age and previous
health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians also are asked to reside in their home provinces at
least 182 days a year or forfeit health benefits for three months.
That rule is being more stringently enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Rex believes it would be a mistake to blame the decline in
winter visitors only on the changes in Canada. The Phoenix area's
sprawl, traffic and pollution could be taking their toll, not only
on travel plans of Canadians, but also on snowbirds from small,
clean and quiet Midwestern towns, who account for almost 70 percent
of traditional Valley winter visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The East Valley is also suffering from congestion and crime, and
has changed its urban form and pace dramatically during the past 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of snowbirds were down on the west and east sides of
the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the East Valley, including Mesa and Apache Junction, 43,000
RV and mobile-home spaces were filled by snowbirds last year, a
drop of 4,000 from the previous year. In the West Valley, which
includes Surprise, Peoria, Goodyear and Buckeye, there were 6,000
RV spaces occupied by snowbirds, down from 8,000 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in snowbirds was twice as severe in the Tucson area
as it was in Phoenix. In 1997, Pima County passed an RV tax of 50
cents per space per night to finance new baseball spring training
facilities. According to Hogan, word of the tax spread through the
ranks of retirees, many of whom chose other destinations. The tax
that was expected to generate $800,000 per year fizzled at
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Weather may have played a role in last year's drop. Rain in
Phoenix meant some U.S. retirees stayed a shorter time, Hogan said.
Last year's mildest Canadian winter on record may be a significant
reason why many Canadians stayed home. The forecast for this
winter, however, is a return to deep-freeze conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A harsh winter and old habits will keep many Canadians coming to
Arizona, said Chris Rydall, Arizona's Canadian tourism
representative stationed in Toronto. They won't be spending as much
money, however, he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of going out to eat four times a week, they will go
out three times. They are looking for whatever ways they can cut
corners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To attract more Canadians this winter, a major incentive program
has been launched in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal by the Arizona
Office of Tourism, Rydall said. The ``Canadian Cactus Days discount
program'' offers discounts at 350 Arizona businesses, from RV parks
to dude ranches to five-star resorts. Participating car-rental
agencies, restaurants, Jeep tours and retailers are offering 5 to
50 percent discounts, and some are accepting Canadian dollars at
face value.
</P>
<P>
   For Valley residents who have long been tested by snowbirds'
driving, the change in migratory habits may be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   But for others, the snowbirds' fading song, like the silence of
the miners' canary, may be cause to worry. &QL;

<P>
   Deliriously happy but a bit overwhelmed? Jumping for joy and
compulsively biting your nails? You must be a bride-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Planning a wedding can be a trying experience. In the five
months since our engagement, my fiance and I have made it a
priority to keep a positive attitude.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most determined couple can fall victim to the
pressures and oddities involved with putting a wedding together.
Already our apartment has become crowded with engagement
paraphernalia. What do we do with the cards, the pattern catalogs
and the catering menus? How should I organize the guest lists,
transportation requirements and hotel reservations?
</P>
<P>
   I realized I would need some help the day my fiance and I stood
staring blankly at seemingly indistinguishable forks as we tried to
choose our flatware pattern. A fork is a fork is a fork until you
consider eating with it for the rest of your lives. It was then
that we decided to seek a higher authority.
</P>
<P>
   I first tried some wedding planner books that I received as
gifts. If you take this route, there are some wonderful
possibilities: books that offer advice on every aspect of your
wedding and specially designed albums and journals to document your
event planning. There are even a few that offer a combination of
organizational tools and etiquette and planning advice. These books
have areas for writing information and ideas and keeping lists.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-copy album is great as a memory of the event, but it did
not accommodate the constant need to edit the written information.
I then turned to my trusty computer and compiled lists and notes in
my word-processing and spreadsheet programs. Although that was an
improvement, I was still searching for a better way.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of different types of software available to help
plan a wedding. While some are little more than spruced up or
preformatted spreadsheets, others provide guidance and ideas for
planning. I searched for a combination that would help me plan the
event and avoid etiquette missteps and would prevent me from
forgetting anything important.
</P>
<P>
   All the programs reviewed here helped with the guest lists and
budgeting, and all three helped me accomplish more than I could
have done on my own.I looked for programs that would take some of
the worry out of the planning, would help keep track of all the
details I was sure I would forget and would be fun to use. Above
all, I looked for programs that would keep the happiness and
romance in the planning. That's a lot to ask of any piece of
software.
</P>

<P>
   EMILY POST'S COMPLETE GUIDE TO WEDDINGS
</P>
<P>
   (Multimedia 2000; $19.95; Windows 3.1 and later.)
</P>
<P>
   This software is the answer for the traditional yet
technologically adept bride. It balances planning tools and
worksheets with helpful and reliable etiquette lessons. Within a
week of my engagement, I had received a copy of the book ``Emily
Post on Weddings.'' The book provided more than enough information
about how to proceed with plans but lacked the organizational
details of the CD-ROM to help me with the actual planning.
</P>
<P>
   The guide is set up as a visit to a professional wedding
consultant. The opening screen has a video welcome from Elizabeth
and Peggy Post, relatives of Emily and etiquette experts in their
own right. In the Planning Center, at the top of the screen is a
section for personal wedding information and links to different
worksheets and note cards, which change in each section of the
program. On the left of the screen is a list of topics on which
video or written advice is offered. At the top of the list is
always advice from Elizabeth Post. Most of the other information is
presented by Peggy Post.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the screen offers a basic utilities list that
remains constant throughout the program. There is a planning
calendar and notepad, and buttons leading to file management,
printing, help and exit. The most important button on the utilities
bar is marked Places to Go. That navigational tool links to the
program's 12 main sections, which include such topics as the
budget, guest list, photography and music.
</P>
<P>
   The true gems of the program are the sections on style. For the
botanically ignorant, the flower section provides pictures and
descriptions of many popular flowers as well as advice on
purchasing, decorating and choosing a bouquet style. The music area
has audio clips of traditional music for the ceremony. There are
also worksheets for both the ceremony and the reception.
</P>
<P>
   Creating your invitation is a breeze with the Posts' help. There
is guidance on grammar, timing, paper and font choice and
invaluable detail about how to handle nontraditional couples.
Throughout the program, there is concise advice on etiquette. If a
bride is in the military or from a split family, or if the groom's
family is serving as host of the wedding, the Post women have the
answers.
</P>
<P>
   There are some cosmetic downsides to this program. The Places to
Go menu appears on top of the screen and blocks the list of options
behind it. While the user can close the menu easily, it becomes
tedious when jumping from screen to screen. The spreadsheet and
information storage areas of the program are elegantly laid out but
a bit difficult to get used to. I also found that some of the
spreadsheets did not cross-reference each other as easily as I
would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   The strengths of the Emily Post program easily outweigh the
downsides, and the program is beautifully designed and fun to use.
It maintains an air of elegance and excitement through such
stressful topics as whom to invite and how to budget. But grooms
should take heed: while the information in this software is
valuable to both of you, the language and tone is directed toward
your future wife.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   THE ESSENTIAL WEDDING PLANNER
</P>
<P>
   (The Learning Co; $14.95, discontinued by manufacturer; Windows
3.1 and later.)
</P>
<P>
   Are you tied to your Franklin Planner or glued to your
Week-at-a-Glance? Then this program should feel like home. The
Essential Wedding Planner is designed to look like a six-ring
organizer. This organizer, however, has spreadsheets and worksheets
that go far beyond what can easily be achieved with paper and pen.
</P>
<P>
   The first section, with a pink tab, is a yearlong checklist of
what a couple should accomplish by certain dates. The to-do dates
can be altered by hand if a couple wishes to set their own
schedule. The checklist breaks up the tasks into 12 manageable
steps. The software provides an additional page, preformatted as a
checklist, for adding items specific to your wedding. The
announcements section, marked with a blue tab, gives you the option
of either writing an original announcement of your forthcoming
marriage or filling in the blanks on a preformatted announcement.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   After years of being tolerated with a mixture of apathy,
cynicism and denial, corruption is becoming a target of serious
international action.
</P>
<P>
   Where once they looked the other way, the World Bank,
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other global organizations
are now seeking to curb bribery and other corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
   These expanding efforts add up to a reform movement whose most
significant achievement to date is the Convention on Combating
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
   The convention, signed in 1997 and now undergoing ratification
by the legislatures of 34 nations, will end the competitively
damaging isolation of the United States, which banned bribing
foreign public officials in 1977. Bribery scandals in half a dozen
countries led the United States to pass the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act in hopes that other countries would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the act was derided as misguided American moralism, and
foreign competitors remained free to use bribes to win commercial
orders. Many countries, including Germany and France, even allowed
their deduction as business expenses. The United States also
promoted a U.N. treaty to ban bribery, but that effort fizzled. The
developing world saw the proposed treaty merely as an opportunity
to bash multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom saw corruption as a chronic characteristic
of human behavior that, in any event, was not of debilitating
proportions in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Although admittedly widespread in the Third World, endemic
corruption was not seen as impeding rapid growth in countries such
as Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. Some economists
even saw bribery as grease for the wheels of progress in
overregulated societies.
</P>
<P>
   During the last six years, however, there has been a dramatic
change in the tolerance of corruption. A wave of bribery scandals
hit all parts of the world. In Asia, the downfall of Indonesian
President Suharto followed swelling protests against his refusal to
undertake reforms, especially regarding his family's ill-gotten
billions from state-connected enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption charges played a critical role in the defeat of Prime
Ministers P.V. Narasimha Rao of India and Benazir Bhutto of
Pakistan. In South Korea, former Presidents Roh Tae Woo and Chun
Doo Hwan were jailed following disclosures that they had received
enormous bribes from Korean companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, numerous top-level government and business leaders
have resigned in the wake of corruption scandals. In Latin America,
bribery charges resulted in the impeachments of Presidents Fernando
Collor de Mello of Brazil and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, as
well as the resignation of President Abdala Bucaram of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was tarnished by
his brother's illicit accumulation of huge sums. President Ernesto
Samper of Colombia avoided impeachment over his acceptance of money
from the Cali drug cartel, but his political authority was eroded
and his party lost the recent presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the bribery charges brought by Milanese magistrates
have overthrown the entire leadership that ruled Italy for more
than four decades. The defeat of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of
Spain was partly due to bribery scandals involving members of his
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Bribery charges also caused the resignation of NATO
Secretary-General Willy Claes, a former Belgian defense minister,
and of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's overthrow of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko was
fueled by popular resentment of his multibillion-dollar corruption.
In China, a member of the Politburo resigned in a massive
corruption scandal. The foregoing, while far from complete,
demonstrates a worldwide phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The growing intolerance of corruption stems from the convergence
of several political and economic pressures. The post-Cold War era
has brought an opening up of governmental processes, freer news
coverage and increased independence of prosecutors and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is harder to hide, as the wave of bribery scandals
involving high-level officials in Europe, Asia and South America
demonstrates. On the economic front, impediments to investment and
other dysfunctions due to corruption are vividly displayed in
Russia, Africa and Eastern Europe. With the growth of the global
economy, international business leaders are increasingly
recognizing that common, morally defensible rules are essential.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, people have recognized that corruption is a
major obstacle to democratic transitions, market economies and
development. Citizens are using protests, elections and agencies of
civil society to press for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the World Bank and other international financing
agencies paid little heed to corruption, apparently considering it
a political matter outside their purview. At the bank, this
attitude began to change with the appointment of James Wolfensohn
as president in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His speech at that year's annual meeting included the first
reference to corruption in a presidential address. At the 1996
meeting, Wolfensohn made combating bribery a top priority. He
invited Transparency International _ an anticorruption organization
that in five years has established chapters in more than 70
countries and publishes an annual index rating corruption country
by country _ to help develop the bank's anticorruption strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the bank adopted a comprehensive program, including
strong controls to prevent bribery on World Bank-financed projects
and assistance to governments to promote reforms. Similar changes
are taking place at other international financing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, going beyond its traditional focus on monetary and
fiscal policy, is emphasizing the need for transparency and other
steps to curb corruption. The Inter-American, European and Asian
Development Banks are following the World Bank's lead in adopting
stricter controls over projects they finance. And the Global
Coalition for Africa has made combating corruption its most
important priority for 1998.
</P>

   The Inter-American Convention Against Corruption was adopted in
March 1996. It has been signed by 26 countries, but ratified by
only 10. Momentum behind this convention lessened as efforts to
create a hemispheric free-trade area stalled. Congressional renewal
of the fast-track authority needed by the executive branch to
negotiate trade treaties could reignite interest.
</P>
<P>
   Establishment by the Organization of American States of a body
similar to the OECD's Anti-Bribery Working Group to provide
professional support and monitor progress by Western hemisphere
governments would also be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The International Chamber of Commerce in Paris is playing an
important role in encouraging the global business community to
become active in fighting corruption. The chamber's focus is on
improving corporate self-regulation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Strong ``Rules of Conduct to Combat Extortion and Bribery,''
prepared by a group of lawyers, managers, and scholars from over a
dozen countries, were issued in 1996. The rules deal forthrightly
with such issues as payments to sales agents and other
intermediaries, business entertainment and gifts, and political
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   They cover not only bribery of public officials but bribery
within the private sector as well. The chamber is preparing a
manual to assist companies in complying with the rules and with the
OECD principles.
</P>
<P>
   This, along with greater use of corporate rules of conduct, will
reduce the supply side of international corruption. The demand side
_ extortion and other forms of corruption by public officials _ is
more difficult to target effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Every country has laws prohibiting its officials from taking
bribes, but such laws are unlikely to be enforced when top
officials are corrupt. The World Bank, IMF, Transparency
International and others are working on programs to promote greater
transparency in government operations and other measures to combat
demand-side abuses.
</P>
<P>
   By curbing foreign bribery, industrialized countries will
increase the credibility in the developing world of their proposals
for combating demand-side corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The developments of the last five years, although remarkable,
are only the start of a long, difficult effort. Although there is
widespread support for action against corruption, entrenched groups
oppose reforms. Corruption has powerful beneficiaries: officials in
high places, companies with large resources and a legion of
influential middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever corruption has become a way of life, wholesale change
is necessary. Tossing out a few rotten apples will not be enough.
During the last five years, the argument that the costs of
corruption are intolerable has been winning. The biggest challenge
for the next five years is to assure continued public support by
showing tangible results.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors contribute to the pressure for accountability in
the post-Cold War world: the spread of investigative journalism,
opposition parties anxious to expose corrupt ruling parties, more
independent prosecutors and judges, whistle-blower protection, the
growth of the corporate governance movement and the expansion of
the global economy with increased demand for international
accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
   These developments bolster the movement to curb corruption and
enhance the prospects for achieving lasting reforms.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   After years of being tolerated with a mixture of apathy,
cynicism and denial, corruption is becoming a target of serious
international action.
</P>
<P>
   Where once they looked the other way, the World Bank,
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other global organizations
are now seeking to curb bribery and other corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
   These expanding efforts add up to a reform movement whose most
significant achievement to date is the Convention on Combating
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
   The convention, signed in 1997 and now undergoing ratification
by the legislatures of 34 nations, will end the competitively
damaging isolation of the United States, which banned bribing
foreign public officials in 1977. Bribery scandals in half a dozen
countries led the United States to pass the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act in hopes that other countries would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the act was derided as misguided American moralism, and
foreign competitors remained free to use bribes to win commercial
orders. Many countries, including Germany and France, even allowed
their deduction as business expenses. The United States also
promoted a U.N. treaty to ban bribery, but that effort fizzled. The
developing world saw the proposed treaty merely as an opportunity
to bash multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom saw corruption as a chronic characteristic
of human behavior that, in any event, was not of debilitating
proportions in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Although admittedly widespread in the Third World, endemic
corruption was not seen as impeding rapid growth in countries such
as Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. Some economists
even saw bribery as grease for the wheels of progress in
overregulated societies.
</P>
<P>
   During the last six years, however, there has been a dramatic
change in the tolerance of corruption. A wave of bribery scandals
hit all parts of the world. In Asia, the downfall of Indonesian
President Suharto followed swelling protests against his refusal to
undertake reforms, especially regarding his family's ill-gotten
billions from state-connected enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption charges played a critical role in the defeat of Prime
Ministers P.V. Narasimha Rao of India and Benazir Bhutto of
Pakistan. In South Korea, former Presidents Roh Tae Woo and Chun
Doo Hwan were jailed following disclosures that they had received
enormous bribes from Korean companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, numerous top-level government and business leaders
have resigned in the wake of corruption scandals. In Latin America,
bribery charges resulted in the impeachments of Presidents Fernando
Collor de Mello of Brazil and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, as
well as the resignation of President Abdala Bucaram of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was tarnished by
his brother's illicit accumulation of huge sums. President Ernesto
Samper of Colombia avoided impeachment over his acceptance of money
from the Cali drug cartel, but his political authority was eroded
and his party lost the recent presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the bribery charges brought by Milanese magistrates
have overthrown the entire leadership that ruled Italy for more
than four decades. The defeat of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of
Spain was partly due to bribery scandals involving members of his
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Bribery charges also caused the resignation of NATO
Secretary-General Willy Claes, a former Belgian defense minister,
and of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's overthrow of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko was
fueled by popular resentment of his multibillion-dollar corruption.
In China, a member of the Politburo resigned in a massive
corruption scandal. The foregoing, while far from complete,
demonstrates a worldwide phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The growing intolerance of corruption stems from the convergence
of several political and economic pressures. The post-Cold War era
has brought an opening up of governmental processes, freer news
coverage and increased independence of prosecutors and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is harder to hide, as the wave of bribery scandals
involving high-level officials in Europe, Asia and South America
demonstrates. On the economic front, impediments to investment and
other dysfunctions due to corruption are vividly displayed in
Russia, Africa and Eastern Europe. With the growth of the global
economy, international business leaders are increasingly
recognizing that common, morally defensible rules are essential.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, people have recognized that corruption is a
major obstacle to democratic transitions, market economies and
development. Citizens are using protests, elections and agencies of
civil society to press for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the World Bank and other international financing
agencies paid little heed to corruption, apparently considering it
a political matter outside their purview. At the bank, this
attitude began to change with the appointment of James Wolfensohn
as president in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His speech at that year's annual meeting included the first
reference to corruption in a presidential address. At the 1996
meeting, Wolfensohn made combating bribery a top priority. He
invited Transparency International _ an anticorruption organization
that in five years has established chapters in more than 70
countries and publishes an annual index rating corruption country
by country _ to help develop the bank's anticorruption strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the bank adopted a comprehensive program, including
strong controls to prevent bribery on World Bank-financed projects
and assistance to governments to promote reforms. Similar changes
are taking place at other international financing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, going beyond its traditional focus on monetary and
fiscal policy, is emphasizing the need for transparency and other
steps to curb corruption. The Inter-American, European and Asian
Development Banks are following the World Bank's lead in adopting
stricter controls over projects they finance. And the Global
Coalition for Africa has made combating corruption its most
important priority for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Inter-American Convention Against Corruption was adopted in
March 1996. It has been signed by 26 countries, but ratified by
only 10. Momentum behind this convention lessened as efforts to
create a hemispheric free-trade area stalled. Congressional renewal

<P>
   The way the Japanese bureaucracy is now tackling _ or, rather,
not tackling _ the Japanese banking system's crisis is commonly
seen by Westerners as mere political cowardice, especially by
official Washington: the U.S. Treasury, the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But to Tokyo's ruling coterie, procrastination and delay appear
the only rational policies.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows yet how much Japanese financial institutions have
suffered from the bursting of the bubble of their prior financial
boom. On top of their domestic losses now loom huge additional
losses inflicted by the economic crisis in other Asian countries _
South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia _ where Japan's banks
were by far the heaviest lenders, as they have also been to China.
</P>
<P>
   Japan faces the largest financial crisis of any developed
country since World War II. According to an estimate last May in
Business Week, the Japanese banking system will eventually have to
write off domestic losses of about $1 trillion, not including
losses on loans and investment elsewhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   This sum handily tops even the highest estimate of the losses
incurred in the U.S. savings and loan debacle 15 years ago, and
this in an economy barely half the size of America's. It amounts to
a stunning 12 percent or so of the funds of all Japanese financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Even more serious _ and much harder to handle _ are the banking
crisis' social threats. The entire Japanese financial system is
already being radically downsized. Japan is grossly overbanked, not
so much in the number of institutions as in the number of bank
branches, which are both ubiquitous and heavily overstaffed.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese and American financial experts estimate that Japan's
commercial banks employ three to five times as many people per
thousand transactions as do American or European banks. This has
made the banking system one of Japan's largest employers, as well
as its highest-paying.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the redundant though well-paid employees are middle-age
people with limited skills who would find it hard to get other jobs
if laid off. Unemployment in Japan has already risen to the highest
levels in 40 years _ above 4 percent by the official count. If
Japan used American or European definitions of unemployment, it
would be 7 or 8 percent. Only two years ago the official
unemployment rate was still below 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even graver than the threat of unemployment is the threat to the
country's social contract, especially the job security of lifetime
employment. If the banks laid off large numbers of people, the
social contract would shatter. The seriousness with which the
Japanese view the social aspects of the crisis is shown by the
lengths to which they will go to preserve a few jobs.
</P>
<P>
   They took the virtually unthinkable step of allowing (indeed,
probably inviting) an American financial firm, Merrill Lynch, to
take over the main branches of Yamaichi, Japan's fourth-largest
brokerage house, when it failed in 1997 simply because Merrill
Lynch promised to keep on about a sixth of Yamaichi's employees _ a
few thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   Only six weeks earlier senior officials in the Ministry of
Finance, which oversees brokerage firms, had still loudly insisted
that they would never let a foreigner do domestic Japanese
securities business.
</P>
<P>
   The bank crisis undermines the structure of Japanese business
and society. It may dissolve Japan's most distinctive economic
organization: the ``keiretsu,'' the cluster of businesses around a
major bank. Contrary to common belief in the West, the keiretsu
does not primarily serve business purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Its first function is to act as the real board of directors for
the member companies, since the official board of each individual
company is just an internal management committee. The keiretsu
quietly removes incompetent top management and checks out proposed
promotions into the top echelons of member companies.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, the keiretsu is a mutual support association. The
members of a component company collectively hold enough of each
other's shares to give the keiretsu effective ownership control. It
thus protects each member against outsiders and hostile takeover
bids.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is the ultimate guarantor of lifetime employment.
If a keiretsu member gets into such serious trouble that it has to
lay off people, the other keiretsu companies will provide jobs for
them. This lets the fellow keiretsu member cut costs and still
fulfill its commitment to permanent job security.
</P>
<P>
   Can the keiretsu survive the financial crisis? The banks at the
core of the typical keiretsu have begun to sell off their holdings
in the group in order to offset their losses. More keiretsu members
are, in turn, selling off their shares in other keiretsu members to
get cash to shore up their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   But, quite apart from the threat to lifetime employment and job
security, what will replace the keiretsu as the organizing
principle of the Japanese economy?
</P>
<P>
   There are no answers to these questions. Thus, the only rational
course for the Japanese bureaucracy may indeed be to have no
policy. That delay will whittle the banking problem down to a
manageable size is probably wishful thinking. But surely the West,
especially the United States, can only hope that the
procrastination strategy will work again.
</P>
<P>
   Social unrest in Japan would be a far more serious threat to
U.S. political, strategic and economic interests than anything that
U.S. businesses or the U.S. economy could possibly gain through the
actions, such as rapid deregulation of the financial sector, which
Washington is now pressing on Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the most important key to understanding how the
Japanese bureaucracy thinks, works and behaves is understanding
Japan's priorities. Americans assume that the economy takes primacy
in political decisions, unless national security is seriously
threatened. The Japanese _ and by no means the bureaucracy alone _
accord primacy to society.
</P>
<P>
   Again the United States is the exception and Japan more nearly
the rule. In most developed countries other than the United States,
the economy is considered a restraint on policies rather than their
major, let alone sole, determinant. Ideology and, above all, the
impact on society come first.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the United States, the primacy of economics in public
life and policy is fairly recent, dating no further back than World
War II. Until then, the United States too tended to consider
society first. Despite the Great Depression, the New Deal put
social reform well ahead of economic recovery. America's voters
overwhelmingly approved.
</P>
<P>
   But while hardly uniquely Japanese, giving pride of place to
society is more important to the Japanese than to most other
developed countries, save perhaps France. To the outsider, Japan
appears to have extraordinary social strength and cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   No other society in history has successfully met such extreme
challenges and dislocations. For example, as a result of the
180-degree turn forced on Japan by Commodore Perry's black ships in
the 1860s, the world's most isolated country, hermetically sealed
for more than two centuries, opened itself to modernity overnight
and became Westernized. Or, equally traumatic, after its defeat in
1945 Japan endured a radical social turnaround and the long years
of foreign occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, however, see their society as fragile. They know
how close to collapse and civil war their country came both times.
Hence the extreme importance, for instance, of lifetime employment
as Japan's social glue.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Japanese society is hardy or delicate is beside the
point. What matters is that the Japanese take its primacy for
granted. If Americans understood this, especially in dealing with a
Japan in trouble, they might cling less to myths about the
uselessness of the Japanese bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the bureaucrats is still heresy, of course, but heresy
is often closer to the truth than conventional wisdom.

 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR 1: WHAT'S TRUE ABOUT JAPAN? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Peter Drucker &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   American policy on Japan, especially during Asia's economic
crisis, is based on five assumptions that have become articles of
faith for most American policymakers, Japan scholars and even a
good many business executives.
</P>
<P>
   But all of them are either plain wrong or, at best, highly
dubious:
</P>
<P>
   1. The government bureaucracy's dominance is assumed to be
unique to Japan, like its near-monopoly on policymaking and its
control of business and the economy through ``administrative
guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Reducing the bureaucracy's role to what it should be _ ``the
experts on tap but not on top'' _ would not be that difficult. All
that is needed is political will.
</P>
<P>
   3. A ruling elite like the Japanese bureaucracy is both
unnecessary in a modern developed society and undesirable in a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Japanese bureaucracy's resistance to ``deregulation,''
especially now in the financial sector, is nothing but a selfish
clinging to power that will do severe damage. By delaying the
inevitable, it can only make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   5. Finally, the Japanese _ they are intelligent people, after
all _ put the economy first, as we do.
</P>
<P>
   The right assumptions about Japan, however, are:
</P>
<P>
   1. Bureaucracies dominate almost all developed countries. The
United States and a few less populous English-speaking countries
such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada are the exceptions rather
than the rule. Indeed, the Japanese bureaucracy is a good deal less
overbearing than that of some other developed countries,
particularly France.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bureaucratic elites have far greater staying power than we
are willing to concede. They manage to keep power for decades
despite scandals and proven incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   3. This is because developed countries _ with the sole exception
of the United States _ are convinced that they need a ruling elite,
without which they fear social disintegration. As such, they cling
to the old elite unless there is a universally accepted
replacement, and no such replacement is in sight in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   4. Their experience has proven to the Japanese that
procrastination works. Twice during the last 40 years, Japan has
overcome major and apparently insoluble social problems not by
``solving'' them but by delaying until, in the end, the problems
evaporated. The procrastination strategy will probably fail this
time, considering the shaky structure and solvency of Japan's
financial system. Given Japan's earlier experiences, however,
procrastination is not an irrational strategy.
</P>
<P>
   5. In fact, it is the logical strategy since for the Japanese
policymaker _ whether politician, civil servant or leading business
executive _ society comes first, not the economy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR 2: IS `DESCENT FROM HEAVEN' STRICTLY JAPANESE? &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Drucker &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Descent from heaven'' _ the Japanese term for the practice
whereby senior civil servants, having reached their terminal
government position around age 45 to 55, become ``counselors'' to
big companies _ is seen in the United States as uniquely Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is considered the most visible manifestation of the
dominance, power and privilege of the Japanese bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is actually a universal custom in all developed
countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To use a personal example, my father was the civil service head
of the Austrian Ministry of Commerce just after World War I. When
he retired in 1923, not yet 50, he was promptly appointed chairman
and CEO of a big bank, as were his predecessor and his successor.
So were their counterparts in the Ministry of Finance. Senior
Austrian civil servants in key ministries ``descend from heaven''
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese counselors who descend from heaven are well paid, but
the job is a sinecure. They are usually not even expected to show
up at the company's office except to collect their paychecks once a
month. By contrast, in most European countries these ``retiring''
civil servants move into real jobs, as did the Austrian civil
servants who became bank CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this is wise or foolish is beside the point. Such
practices are universal.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany the second-tier civil servant who will not make it
into a top position in a ministry becomes secretary-general of an
industry association, a job that not only pays well but has real
power. Membership in such associations is compulsory in Germany,
and all but the very largest companies must conduct their relations
with both government and labor unions through them. If the civil
servant is a Social Democrat he gets a similar job _ equally well
paid and powerful _ as chief economist or secretary-general of a
labor union.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the civil servant who has reached the exalted
position of inspecteur de finance, usually around age 40 or 45,
moves into a top position in industry or finance. Almost every
power position in the French economy and society is filled by a
former inspecteur de finance. Even in the United Kingdom, it
remains customary for the top civil servant in a major ministry to
chair a big bank or insurance company after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States too ``descending from heaven'' is anything
but unknown. Scores of generals and admirals have, upon retirement,
taken senior executive positions in defense and aerospace
companies.
</P>
<P>
   An even larger number of congressional staffers and political
appointees in the upper and middle levels of executive agencies _
together, Washington's ruling elite _ routinely come from on high
to become well-paid lobbyists or partners in Washington law firms.

<P>
   The way the Japanese bureaucracy is now tackling _ or, rather,
not tackling _ the Japanese banking system's crisis is commonly
seen by Westerners as mere political cowardice, especially by
official Washington: the U.S. Treasury, the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But to Tokyo's ruling coterie, procrastination and delay appear
the only rational policies.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows yet how much Japanese financial institutions have
suffered from the bursting of the bubble of their prior financial
boom. On top of their domestic losses now loom huge additional
losses inflicted by the economic crisis in other Asian countries _
South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia _ where Japan's banks
were by far the heaviest lenders, as they have also been to China.
</P>
<P>
   Japan faces the largest financial crisis of any developed
country since World War II. According to an estimate last May in
Business Week, the Japanese banking system will eventually have to
write off domestic losses of about $1 trillion, not including
losses on loans and investment elsewhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   This sum handily tops even the highest estimate of the losses
incurred in the U.S. savings and loan debacle 15 years ago, and
this in an economy barely half the size of America's. It amounts to
a stunning 12 percent or so of the funds of all Japanese financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Even more serious _ and much harder to handle _ are the banking
crisis' social threats. The entire Japanese financial system is
already being radically downsized. Japan is grossly overbanked, not
so much in the number of institutions as in the number of bank
branches, which are both ubiquitous and heavily overstaffed.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese and American financial experts estimate that Japan's
commercial banks employ three to five times as many people per
thousand transactions as do American or European banks. This has
made the banking system one of Japan's largest employers, as well
as its highest-paying.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the redundant though well-paid employees are middle-age
people with limited skills who would find it hard to get other jobs
if laid off. Unemployment in Japan has already risen to the highest
levels in 40 years _ above 4 percent by the official count. If
Japan used American or European definitions of unemployment, it
would be 7 or 8 percent. Only two years ago the official
unemployment rate was still below 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even graver than the threat of unemployment is the threat to the
country's social contract, especially the job security of lifetime
employment. If the banks laid off large numbers of people, the
social contract would shatter. The seriousness with which the
Japanese view the social aspects of the crisis is shown by the
lengths to which they will go to preserve a few jobs.
</P>
<P>
   They took the virtually unthinkable step of allowing (indeed,
probably inviting) an American financial firm, Merrill Lynch, to
take over the main branches of Yamaichi, Japan's fourth-largest
brokerage house, when it failed in 1997 simply because Merrill
Lynch promised to keep on about a sixth of Yamaichi's employees _ a
few thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   Only six weeks earlier senior officials in the Ministry of
Finance, which oversees brokerage firms, had still loudly insisted
that they would never let a foreigner do domestic Japanese
securities business.
</P>
<P>
   The bank crisis undermines the structure of Japanese business
and society. It may dissolve Japan's most distinctive economic
organization: the ``keiretsu,'' the cluster of businesses around a
major bank. Contrary to common belief in the West, the keiretsu
does not primarily serve business purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Its first function is to act as the real board of directors for
the member companies, since the official board of each individual
company is just an internal management committee. The keiretsu
quietly removes incompetent top management and checks out proposed
promotions into the top echelons of member companies.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, the keiretsu is a mutual support association. The
members of a component company collectively hold enough of each
other's shares to give the keiretsu effective ownership control. It
thus protects each member against outsiders and hostile takeover
bids.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is the ultimate guarantor of lifetime employment.
If a keiretsu member gets into such serious trouble that it has to
lay off people, the other keiretsu companies will provide jobs for
them. This lets the fellow keiretsu member cut costs and still
fulfill its commitment to permanent job security.
</P>
<P>
   Can the keiretsu survive the financial crisis? The banks at the
core of the typical keiretsu have begun to sell off their holdings
in the group in order to offset their losses. More keiretsu members
are, in turn, selling off their shares in other keiretsu members to
get cash to shore up their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   But, quite apart from the threat to lifetime employment and job
security, what will replace the keiretsu as the organizing
principle of the Japanese economy?
</P>
<P>
   There are no answers to these questions. Thus, the only rational
course for the Japanese bureaucracy may indeed be to have no
policy. That delay will whittle the banking problem down to a
manageable size is probably wishful thinking. But surely the West,
especially the United States, can only hope that the
procrastination strategy will work again.
</P>
<P>
   Social unrest in Japan would be a far more serious threat to
U.S. political, strategic and economic interests than anything that
U.S. businesses or the U.S. economy could possibly gain through the
actions, such as rapid deregulation of the financial sector, which
Washington is now pressing on Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the most important key to understanding how the
Japanese bureaucracy thinks, works and behaves is understanding
Japan's priorities. Americans assume that the economy takes primacy
in political decisions, unless national security is seriously
threatened. The Japanese _ and by no means the bureaucracy alone _
accord primacy to society.
</P>
<P>
   Again the United States is the exception and Japan more nearly
the rule. In most developed countries other than the United States,
the economy is considered a restraint on policies rather than their
major, let alone sole, determinant. Ideology and, above all, the
impact on society come first.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the United States, the primacy of economics in public
life and policy is fairly recent, dating no further back than World
War II. Until then, the United States too tended to consider
society first. Despite the Great Depression, the New Deal put
social reform well ahead of economic recovery. America's voters
overwhelmingly approved.
</P>
<P>
   But while hardly uniquely Japanese, giving pride of place to
society is more important to the Japanese than to most other
developed countries, save perhaps France. To the outsider, Japan
appears to have extraordinary social strength and cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   No other society in history has successfully met such extreme
challenges and dislocations. For example, as a result of the
180-degree turn forced on Japan by Commodore Perry's black ships in
the 1860s, the world's most isolated country, hermetically sealed
for more than two centuries, opened itself to modernity overnight
and became Westernized. Or, equally traumatic, after its defeat in
1945 Japan endured a radical social turnaround and the long years
of foreign occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, however, see their society as fragile. They know
how close to collapse and civil war their country came both times.
Hence the extreme importance, for instance, of lifetime employment
as Japan's social glue.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Japanese society is hardy or delicate is beside the
point. What matters is that the Japanese take its primacy for
granted. If Americans understood this, especially in dealing with a
Japan in trouble, they might cling less to myths about the
uselessness of the Japanese bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the bureaucrats is still heresy, of course, but heresy
is often closer to the truth than conventional wisdom.

 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR 1: WHAT'S TRUE ABOUT JAPAN? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Peter Drucker &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   American policy on Japan, especially during Asia's economic
crisis, is based on five assumptions that have become articles of
faith for most American policymakers, Japan scholars and even a
good many business executives.
</P>
<P>
   But all of them are either plain wrong or, at best, highly
dubious:
</P>
<P>
   1. The government bureaucracy's dominance is assumed to be
unique to Japan, like its near-monopoly on policymaking and its
control of business and the economy through ``administrative
guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Reducing the bureaucracy's role to what it should be _ ``the
experts on tap but not on top'' _ would not be that difficult. All
that is needed is political will.
</P>
<P>
   3. A ruling elite like the Japanese bureaucracy is both
unnecessary in a modern developed society and undesirable in a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Japanese bureaucracy's resistance to ``deregulation,''
especially now in the financial sector, is nothing but a selfish
clinging to power that will do severe damage. By delaying the
inevitable, it can only make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   5. Finally, the Japanese _ they are intelligent people, after
all _ put the economy first, as we do.
</P>
<P>
   The right assumptions about Japan, however, are:
</P>
<P>
   1. Bureaucracies dominate almost all developed countries. The
United States and a few less populous English-speaking countries
such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada are the exceptions rather
than the rule. Indeed, the Japanese bureaucracy is a good deal less
overbearing than that of some other developed countries,
particularly France.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bureaucratic elites have far greater staying power than we
are willing to concede. They manage to keep power for decades
despite scandals and proven incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   3. This is because developed countries _ with the sole exception
of the United States _ are convinced that they need a ruling elite,
without which they fear social disintegration. As such, they cling
to the old elite unless there is a universally accepted
replacement, and no such replacement is in sight in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   4. Their experience has proven to the Japanese that
procrastination works. Twice during the last 40 years, Japan has
overcome major and apparently insoluble social problems not by
``solving'' them but by delaying until, in the end, the problems
evaporated. The procrastination strategy will probably fail this
time, considering the shaky structure and solvency of Japan's
financial system. Given Japan's earlier experiences, however,
procrastination is not an irrational strategy.
</P>
<P>
   5. In fact, it is the logical strategy since for the Japanese
policymaker _ whether politician, civil servant or leading business
executive _ society comes first, not the economy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR 2: IS `DESCENT FROM HEAVEN' STRICTLY JAPANESE? &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Drucker &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Descent from heaven'' _ the Japanese term for the practice
whereby senior civil servants, having reached their terminal
government position around age 45 to 55, become ``counselors'' to
big companies _ is seen in the United States as uniquely Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is considered the most visible manifestation of the
dominance, power and privilege of the Japanese bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is actually a universal custom in all developed
countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To use a personal example, my father was the civil service head
of the Austrian Ministry of Commerce just after World War I. When
he retired in 1923, not yet 50, he was promptly appointed chairman
and CEO of a big bank, as were his predecessor and his successor.
So were their counterparts in the Ministry of Finance. Senior
Austrian civil servants in key ministries ``descend from heaven''
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese counselors who descend from heaven are well paid, but
the job is a sinecure. They are usually not even expected to show
up at the company's office except to collect their paychecks once a
month. By contrast, in most European countries these ``retiring''
civil servants move into real jobs, as did the Austrian civil
servants who became bank CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this is wise or foolish is beside the point. Such
practices are universal.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany the second-tier civil servant who will not make it
into a top position in a ministry becomes secretary-general of an
industry association, a job that not only pays well but has real
power. Membership in such associations is compulsory in Germany,
and all but the very largest companies must conduct their relations
with both government and labor unions through them. If the civil
servant is a Social Democrat he gets a similar job _ equally well
paid and powerful _ as chief economist or secretary-general of a
labor union.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the civil servant who has reached the exalted
position of inspecteur de finance, usually around age 40 or 45,
moves into a top position in industry or finance. Almost every
power position in the French economy and society is filled by a
former inspecteur de finance. Even in the United Kingdom, it
remains customary for the top civil servant in a major ministry to
chair a big bank or insurance company after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States too ``descending from heaven'' is anything
but unknown. Scores of generals and admirals have, upon retirement,
taken senior executive positions in defense and aerospace
companies.
</P>
<P>
   An even larger number of congressional staffers and political
appointees in the upper and middle levels of executive agencies _
together, Washington's ruling elite _ routinely come from on high
to become well-paid lobbyists or partners in Washington law firms.

 UNDATED: preformatted announcement.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The yellow-tabbed event schedule acts as a calendar, with spaces
to enter the dates of wedding-related events like showers and
engagement parties. The next four tabbed sections offer an area for
guest information and the tracking of invitations, RSVP's, gifts
and travel needs. These well-designed pages have fields for all the
necessary information and display just one guest (or party) per
page. The invitation-tracking links to the guest information and
allows you to record which events the guest will or will not
attend. It does not, however, keep a running total.
</P>
<P>
   The gift area takes a step beyond many of the available programs
and provides a place to record up to four gifts per guest (for
shower, engagement and wedding gifts and one other gift). It also
provides a check box for gifts that need to be returned and an area
to record when you sent a thank-you note. All four of these
sections cross-reference the guestinformation, so you need to
enter data only once.
</P>
<P>
   The final two sections, table assignments and expenses, are
thoughtfully designed and comprehensive. While the table
assignments area does not take the pain out of deciding whom to
seat next to that dreadful great-aunt, it provides a useful
tracking tool. The program graphically shows an area for each
table, allowing you to better envision your seating decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The expense area provides a page for each expense, including
fields to enter vendor names and phone numbers as well as cost.
There is a section for writing notes about each expense, which is
valuable when you are trying to lower the cost of some items. A
spreadsheet links to this page and can be called up at any time to
view the overall budget.
</P>
<P>
   While the simplicity of this program is its greatest strength,
it is at times also a weakness. The program fails to provide
consistent, adequate detail. I found that it was easy to draft and
print out an announcement, but difficult to go back and edit it.
The guest section allows you to view one guest per page but not the
entire list at once. One more caveat: the Learning Company recently
discontinued this title, but it may still be available through many
vendors.

   WEDDING WORKSHOP
</P>
<P>
   (Micro Precision; $29.99, Macinotsh and Windows 3.1 and later.)
</P>
<P>
   Wedding Workshop is a wonderful combination of planning tools
and helpful, entertaining advice. It is also graphically appealing
and extremely thorough. It covered all the topics, concerns and
areas of potential stress that a couple are likely to encounter
while planning their special event.
</P>
<P>
   The main screen, the Planning Center, offers a traditional menu
bar along the top. It is here that the user enters most financial
information. The pop-up menus have areas for estimates and expenses
for everything from jewelry to the wedding cake and the honeymoon.
Included on this menu bar are links for guest information, a help
menu and to-do lists. Unlike the to-do list in other programs,
these are created by the couple themselves _ a helpul
organizational lesson in itself. While the manual states that the
program provides an initial list of tasks, my list was empty.
</P>
<P>
   The to-do lists include fields for entering each project, the
person in charge, the timing and the date completed. The menu bar
also includes individual reports on the many occasions leading to a
wedding. The status of guests, gifts received, expenses and
projects to be completed can be printed from this menu bar as well.
While I would have liked to have been able to have viewed these
reports on the screen, the printed reports came in handy for times
when I was away from the computer and for permanent records.
</P>
<P>
   The Planning Center screen is filled with 10 buttons, each
leading to a different section, either organizational or
informational. There is a utilitarian button for the guest list and
for attendant worksheets and the overall budget.
</P>
<P>
   The attention to detail is impressive. Every linked screen
offers all the information relevant to the topic. There is no need
to flip from section to section to find information on budgeting,
head counts or contacts because the program cross-references all
details for the wedding couple. For example, the guest list window
shows a list of all invited guests and a count of how many
invitations have been sent and how many RSVP's received. Any name
can be highlighted from the list and details retrieved about that
specific guest. There is space to list the children invited, and
the wording for both the inner and outer envelopes, accommodations
and the guest's special needs.
</P>
<P>
   Gift information is available with the click of a mouse,
providing fields to record gifts for engagement, shower, wedding
and other gifts. There are check boxes for thank-you's sent and
gift descriptions. Details about every guest can be found without
backtracking to the main menu.
</P>
<P>
   Another outstanding feature of this program is the availability
of reference materials on the central screen. While clicking on the
user's menu was helpful, I was more impressed by the Tips and
Etiquette and Romantic Ideas buttons.
</P>
<P>
   The Tips and Etiquette section consists of a 79-page book, which
is read using Adobe Acrobat Reader, that offers advice on how to
plan a wedding and a lot of wonderful tips on how to survive the
whole experience gracefully. The tips range from how to buy a
diamond to how to estimate how many guests will actually attend.
</P>
<P>
   The Romantic Ideas button leads to a copy (Acrobat reader again)
of Gregory J.P. Godek's book ``1001 Ways to Be Romantic.'' It is
refreshing that Wedding Workshop remembers why people marry in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some Web sites devoted to wedding planning. While I
would not recommend these as your only planning tools, they provide
useful contacts and often invaluable supplementary advice.
</P>
<P>
   THE KNOT: www.theknot.com _ If you decide not to use planning
software, this comprehensive and extensive site is the best
substitute. The Knot has many useful, high-quality components,
including fashion information, a searchable bridal gown database, a
gift registry, beauty and etiquette tips, and planning and
budgeting tools. The planning area is personalized, and the
budgeting pages keep track of expenses and help you understand what
factors into each cost. Features include cost information for the
average American wedding, 56 Ways to Save and a Groom's Section.
The articles for men are interesting, but the site is not aimed at
the couple planning their wedding together.
</P>
<P>
   WEDDING CHANNEL: www.weddingchannel.com _ This provides a wealth
of information and links to pages where you can make many of your
wedding purchases and purchasing decisions. You can browse your way
through fashion, gifts, accessories and many other wedding products
and services. The site includes an online registry, a virtual store
and even a travel agency for honeymoon arrangements. The impressive
vendor list and business directory are useful both for large urban
areas and rural areas. The Groom's Section is a nice idea but
unimpressive.
</P>
<P>
   WEDDING BELLS: www.weddingbells.com _ This has a simple,
easy-to-follow layout and offers links to topics like fashion,
etiquette, planning, wedding services and travel ideas. The Strange
but True section provides interesting historical trivia. The Trends
and Traditions section contains personal anecdotes and traditions
and trends from around the world.

 (ATTN: Md.)  (js) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FULTON, Md. _ About a month ago, I stopped by Dr. Jim Duke's
garden to check out the little six-acre spread he calls Herbal
Village. Fulton is one of those little burgs off the interstate,
where the farms have given over to ranch houses, with guys out on
their power mowers every Saturday, riding herd on their lawns.
</P>
<P>
   But Duke's place is as different as the man himself, who looks
more like a 69-year-old hippie, standing barefoot by his kudzu
vine, than an eminent botanist, with 20 books and 200 scientific
papers under his belt (if he wore one with his cutoffs).
</P>
<P>
   ``My neighbors think I'm crazy for putting in kudzu, but it has
more genistein than soy,'' said Duke, who is a doctor of botany, as
he stood in the plot labeled Aphrodisia. ``Genistein is what
everybody's promoting soy for, to help prevent breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Last August, with the help of a few friends, Duke planted about
200 medicinal herbs, in 80 plots, each devoted to some disease or
ailment. I had a hard time not making a beeline for the Wrinkles
garden, but Aphrodisia wasn't bad. Since when is this an ailment?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we didn't like the word impotence, and nobody liked the
word frigidity,'' Duke said in the slow, easy voice of a
Southerner, fingering the big leaves of the vine that ate Alabama,
his home state.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department imported kudzu from China years ago,
for erosion control, and it has since climbed over cars and houses
all over the South. It's purple blossoms, which smell like grape
soda, strike fear into the hearts of agricultural extension agents.
But both men and women may want to graze on it, since studies
indicate that genistein may help guard against prostate as well as
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make tempura with the leaves, and it tastes like deep-fried
anything,'' he said. He makes Jell-O out of them, too. (Dr. Norman
Cragg of the National Cancer Institute, however, cautions, ``People
should be very careful before going into their yards and harvesting
plants for which there is no toxicity data.'') The same vine is
helping alcoholic hamsters at Harvard University. When the research
scientist Dr. Wing-Ming Keung gave boozer rodents an extract of the
Chinese herb, it cut their drinking in half.
</P>
<P>
   Epimedium, known as horny goat weed in the folk literature,
grows in Aphrodisia, too. ``I'm not responsible for that
nomenclature,'' he said. ``But the people looking for herbal Viagra
like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke recently retired from 30 years of researching plants for
the Agriculture Department. Over the years, he has roamed the
jungles of Central and South America, learning from folk healers
and collaborating with the National Cancer Institute to identify
plants that could prevent or treat cancer and other diseases.

   ``He's a genius,'' said Michael Balick, the director of the
Institute of Economic Botany at the New York Botanical Garden in
the Bronx. ``He maintains the highest levels of scholarly research.
To top it off, he writes poetry and composes music. And he's a hell
of a nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Duke isn't sampling vines in the Peruvian jungles, he's
lecturing about the plants that are the origins of drugs. Or
weeding his herbal ``farmacy,'' which is open to the public by
appointment (301 498-1175). Nothing is for sale; the plants are
there to educate.
</P>
<P>
   The plantsman spent years compiling ``Dr. Duke's Phytochemical
and Ethnobotanical Databases'' for the Agricultural Research
Service (www.ars-grin.gov/duke/), where you can surf for everything
from folklore to scientific studies to the chemical compounds of a
particular plant. And his latest book, ``The Green Pharmacy''
(Rodale Press, now a St. Martin's paperback), is a chatty guide to
natural remedies.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks to an eager audience. Last year, sales of dietary
supplements and herbal products totaled $3.6 billion. Sales of
echinacea were $310 million; ginseng, $270 million; gingko, $240
million; and St. John's wort, $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who take an herb for an ailment never see the
herb growing,'' Duke said, moving on to a giant ginger plant,
thriving in the Arthritis garden. ``But if they do a little weeding
or pruning, they can bond with their plants.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Long before doctors came along, there were folk healers who
knew, from their elders, who had learned from their elders, which
plants were good for you and which could kill. But somewhere along
the way, we forgot that drugs come from plants. Now, you have to
have a double-blind study to believe your grandmother when she
tells you ginger tea eases the pain of her arthritis. But ginger
contains anti-inflammatory compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Another age-old treatment for aching joints is stinging nettles,
and it grows wild all over Maryland in the spring. Duke, who plays
bass fiddle in a bluegrass band, says some of his fellow musicians
gather the stuff (with gloves) and flog their aching fingers with
it. You can also steam the greens, which are full of boron, and
they lose their sting, by the way, with the cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Duke talks in a rambling way that harks back to the Alabama
hills. ``By 5,'' he said, ``I knew where my temple was _ the
forest.'' He led the way to a shady little ravine full of maples,
oaks, black gum and ash. A lone ginseng was growing beneath a giant
tulip poplar. In spring, May apples carpet these woods. The May
apple is the source of a compound called etoposide, which has been
isolated and synthesized to treat lung cancer. Wild yam grows here,
as well, and its tuber is the source of diosgenin, a compound used
to produce synthetic steroids and hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the healing powers in the Peruvian rain forest, which
has 50 times the diversity of this Eastern deciduous forest.
``These are the plants we've co-evolved with for 25,000 years,''
Duke said, meaning that's how long people have grazed on plants in
the New World, which is an eye blink, compared to Africa, where
humans have been grazing for 3.5 million years.
</P>
<P>
   Back up the hill, in the Depression garden, we stared at a
floppy little wildflower, called St. John's wort. ``A lot of times,
to my surprise, my lectures are to doctors,'' he said. ``Most of
them hate it, but their patients are taking these things, so
they've got to learn. But if I can get 10 physicians I can usually
get one to say: `You're right, Duke. I don't know for sure that
Prozac is better than St. John's wort.' Then I can say, `Well, if
you're not sure, who is?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Duke would love to see controlled studies of these herbs. As a
botanist, he believes that the whole plant is better than a
``silver bullet'' from one of its compounds. ``Through our
co-evolution with these natural compounds, your body has learned to
exclude the bad and grab the good,'' he said. ``When you give it a
silver bullet, you don't give it a menu of things. When you give it
a whole herb, you're giving it thousands of compounds, which it
already knows and has mechanisms for utilizing or excluding.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this botanist and gardener trusts St. John's wort
more than Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   So do you make a tea with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't depressed,'' Duke said, sounding as peaceful as an
Alabama woods. Then he allowed as how friends steep the flowers in
cheap vodka or white wine. Which would cheer me right up.

THE MEDIUM AS MESSAGE, AS WELL AS THE PUNCH LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to A.C. Nielsen, kids are watching less television.
That could be because they're playing video games that laugh at
television. Witness Gex: Enter the Gecko, a ``Simpsons''-style
send-up of Hollywood played out by a wisecracking lizard with
encyclopedic knowledge of 1970s sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   Gex is introduced as the ultimate couch potato, content to begin
every day ``sharing a cup of coffee with kung fu theater, a
doughnut with his favorite cartoons and a bag of chips with `His
Majesty's Secret Service.' Days, then weeks, blurred into one long
television marathon.'' The remote control idyll is, alas,
interrupted by secret agents who kidnap the happily complacent
lizard and send him on a mission to defeat Rez, a robotic fiend who
is out to steal all the world's television shows.
</P>
<P>
   So, as they say on ``Masterpiece Theater,'' we find young Gex in
the Media Dimension, a temple-like complex where gigantic
televisions stand like monoliths and function as portals into
different game levels, all parodies of various film and television
genres. There's the Pre-History Channel; Scream TV, which gleefully
skewers B-grade horror flicks; Gexzilla (the dinosaur is purple,
for some mysterious reason); the Rocket Channel, which lampoons 30
years of television science fiction; Kung Fu Theater; Gilligex
Island, and Toon TV, which lovingly roasts Warner Brothers
cartoons. The list, as they say, goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of navigating these environments, collecting
power-ups and fighting monsters, Gex mimics everyone from Austin
Powers (``Judo chop, baby!''), James Bond and Maxwell Smart to
George Jetson, Al Pacino (``Hoo-ha!''), Robert De Niro, Richard
Simmons, Charlton Heston, Bruce Lee, Forrest Gump and the entire
cast of ``Star Trek'' and the Star Wars trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   Every video game has a final showdown. But this is the only one
where the archvillain's voice booms, ``I'm your father, Gex!''
shortly before he expires. And it's one of the few that laugh at
video games themselves (``Oooh, ahh, this is how it always starts.
Then there's the running and jumping and screaming and
power-ups.'')
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, Gex is the video game equivalent of ``The
Simpsons'' or ``Mystery Science Theater 3000'': pop culture that
comments on pop culture. And it raises a couple of interesting
questions about literacy.
</P>
<P>
   The first is a generational question because this is a product
for the second generation of video game kids, who are now between
the ages of 8 and 15. But it was produced by the first generation
of video game kids, the ones who grew up watching 1970s television.
So when Gex whizzes through a bonus round singing, ``Lolly Lolly
Lolly get your adverbs here!'' or picks up hockey mask power-ups in
the haunted house or leaves the kung fu level growling, ``C'mon,
Jake, it's Chinatown,'' it may not mean anything to the current
crop of grade-schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe, with all the Nickelodeon flashbacks and meta-media
floating around, we have reached a point when, ``Who loves ya,
baby,'' can mean something to kids who have never seen ``Kojak.''
It meant something to me, and I never saw ``Kojak.'' I've never
seen a Jerry Lewis movie, but I laughed when Gex yelled, ``Hey,
lady!'' while pummeling a poltergeist. And I knew why.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cliche that pop culture is ephemeral. But bits and pieces
of it are actually quite durable, if not indestructible. After
enough recycling, any piece of Hollywood or Madison Avenue flotsam
becomes a part of the cultural landscape (or landfill, depending on
your politics), and the ability to thrive on that landscape
requires a certain kind of literacy.
</P>
<P>
   The digital landscape also requires a kind of literacy. There
are people who don't play video games who could catch every
reference Gex drops while traversing the Media Dimension. But they
would be hard pressed to traverse it themselves because they don't
know how a video game controller works. They can't navigate. They
don't know how to uncover the useful things and avoid the traps and
solve the puzzles. They can't perceive the leaping points. The
signs don't make sense to them. They get stuck because they can't
read. But they'd probably get a kick out of watching someone else
play _ this is a game that even the console-illiterate can enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason it's fun to watch is the camera angles, which
are largely controllable. And somehow, being able to control the
video game camera throws television and movie camera conventions
into high relief.
</P>
<P>
   If you do nothing, the camera will act like the camera in an
action movie or a sitcom or whatever genre you happen to be
visiting. One scene from the Looney Tune level, for instance, is
viewed from high above, as if you're staring down into Wile E.
Coyote's canyon. And you realize, aha, that's a Warner Brothers
cartoon camera angle. In the middle of a classic B-grade horror
scene, you recognize that this is how screamers are shot. And then
you can change it because you need the camera looking over your
shoulder to set up the sight line for a tricky series of leaps.
It's a power trip, controlling the camera in an environment so
suffused with television.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, the relationship between video games and television
is tense and complicated here. Gex takes plenty of shots at
Hollywood _ the junkyard bonus round has him sneering, ``Ladies and
gentlemen, the new fall TV season.'' But without television, Gex
would lose most of the one-liners that fuel the game's fun
quotient. Gex earns extra lives by smashing televisions. But he's
also trying to save television from the cyborg villain who's trying
to steal it (paging Bill Gates . . . ).
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gex isn't a television character, this whole
experience plays out on a television screen. It's a console game,
and consoles are viable only because televisions are everywhere.
Video games have always had a parasitic relationship with
television. The tube has given them a warm body in which to breed.
And after 25 years, they are beginning to impinge on the host.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Gex would say, ``I'll take New Levels for 20, Alex.''

SUPREME COURT REVIEWS COLORADO REGULATIONS ON BALLOT INITIATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Colorado law regulating the circulation of
petitions to put voter initiatives on the state ballot came under
tough scrutiny Wednesday by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which allows only registered voters to circulate the
petitions, violates the First Amendment right to free speech,
according to the American Constitutional Law Foundation, a public
interest group that filed suit against the state seeking to
overturn the statute.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the states allow voter-initiated ballot questions,
and voters increasingly are bypassing their legislatures and making
law through such grass-roots efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision, expected by July, could help determine how
rigorously states are allowed to regulate that process.
</P>
<P>
   In oral arguments before the high court, Colorado state Attorney
General Gale A. Norton told the justices Wednesday that the state's
law is needed to fight fraud by petition circulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know who these people are and to be able to find
them later if we discover voter fraud has taken place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But several justices seemed unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it easier to deal with fraud better with registered
voters?'' asked Justice Antonin Scalia, adding sarcastically, ``Do
you think Coloradans are more honest than non-Coloradans?''
</P>
<P>
   Norton insisted that permitting only registered voters to be
circulators allowed the state to keep track of them in case fraud
charges arose after the election.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia then asked how many people the state has prosecuted for
voter fraud in the last few years. No one recently, Norton
answered.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens asked why the state could not just
require circulators to give their names and addresses to a state
election office.
</P>
<P>
   Norton answered that allowing only registered voters to
circulate petitions ensured that they were residents of Colorado,
which meant they could be subpoenaed in the event of a fraud case.
If a petition circulator were allowed to be a resident of another
state, she explained, Colorado officials could not enforce the
subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Stevens and Scalia, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David H. Souter each raised concerns about
Colorado's regulations.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said she failed to understand why a person who is not a
registered voter couldn't circulate petitions ``just as well as a
registered voter.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg questioned why the state didn't just ask the companies
that hired the petition circulators to supply their names and
addresses when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Souter questioned whether the Colorado law didn't violate a
previous Supreme Court decision.
</P>
<P>
   The state adopted the law in 1993, a year after 10 initiatives,
a record number, were placed on Colorado's ballot. Besides
requiring petition circulators to be registered voters, the law
says they must wear badges identifying themselves as paid or
volunteer workers. It also says initiative backers must file
reports with the state identifying all paid petition circulators
and the amounts they were paid.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, after the law foundation and a group of state residents
challenged the law, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck
it down.
</P>
<P>
   Neil O'Toole, a Denver lawyer representing the challengers, said
the state law attacked the ``very core of free political speech.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those regulations had a chilling effect on the state's
political process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said, ``Having a person wearing a
badge saying they are paid or unpaid is something that I believe
promotes free speech because it gives the voter more information.''
</P>
<P>
   To get a measure on the Colorado ballot, supporters must collect
the signatures of at least 5 percent of the total votes cast in the
most recent race for secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's appeal is supported in a friend-of-the-court brief
submitted by the Council of State Governments and 13 other states _
Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine,
Mississippi, Oklahoma, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota and Washington.

 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Virtually all feminists who study international politics seek
the laudable goal of greater female participation in all aspects of
foreign relations, from executive mansions and foreign ministries
to militaries and universities.
</P>
<P>
   They disagree as to whether women should get ahead in politics
by demonstrating traditional masculine virtues of toughness,
aggression, competitiveness and the willingness to use force when
necessary _ or whether they should move the agenda of politics away
from male preoccupations with hierarchy and domination.
</P>
<P>
   This ambivalence was demonstrated in the feminist reaction to
Margaret Thatcher, who by any account was far tougher and more
determined than any of the male politicians she came up against.
Thatcher's conservative politics did not endear her to most
feminists, who much prefer a Mary Robinson or Gro Harlem Brundtland
as their model of a female leader, despite _ or because of _ the
fact that Thatcher had beaten men at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent findings and research in genetics and new
biology, it would seem that there is something to the contention of
many feminists that phenomena such as aggression, violence, war and
intense competition for dominance in a status hierarchy are more
closely associated with men than women.
</P>
<P>
   Theories of international relations that see global politics as
a remorseless struggle for power are in fact what feminists call a
gendered perspective, describing the behavior of states controlled
by men. A world run by women would follow different rules, it would
appear, and it is toward that sort of world that all postindustrial
or Western societies are moving. As women gain power in these
countries, the latter should become less aggressive, adventurous,
competitive and violent.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the feminist view is that it sees these
attitudes toward violence, power and status as wholly the products
of a patriarchal culture, whereas in fact it appears they are
rooted in biology. This makes these attitudes harder to change in
men and consequently in societies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rise of women, men will continue to play a major, if
not dominant, part in the governance of postindustrial countries,
not to mention less-developed ones. The realms of war and
international politics in particular will remain controlled by men
for longer than many feminists would like.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the task of resocializing men to be more like
women _ that is, less violent _ will run into limits. What is bred
in the bone cannot be altered easily by changes in culture and
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   While some gender roles are indeed socially constructed,
virtually all reputable evolutionary biologists today think there
are profound differences between the sexes that are genetically
rather than culturally rooted, and that these differences extend
beyond the body into the realm of the mind. In no area is
sex-related difference clearer than with respect to violence and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the feminist agenda for international politics seems
fundamentally correct: The violent and aggressive tendencies of men
have to be controlled, not simply by redirecting them to external
aggression but by constraining those impulses through a web of
norms, laws, agreements, contracts and the like.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, more women need to be brought into the domain of
international politics as leaders, officials, soldiers and voters.
Only by participating fully in global politics can women both
defend their own interests and shift the underlying male agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The feminization of world politics has, of course, been taking
place gradually over the past hundred years, with very positive
effects. Women have won the right to vote and participate in
politics in all developed countries, as well as in many developing
countries, and have exercised that right with increasing energy.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and other rich countries, a pronounced
gender gap with regard to foreign policy and national security
issues endures. American women have always been less supportive
than American men of U.S. involvement in war, including World War
II, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War, by an average margin
of 7 percent to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They are also consistently less supportive of defense spending
and the use of force abroad. In a 1995 Roper survey conducted for
the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, men favored U.S.
intervention in Korea in the event of a North Korean attack by a
margin of 49 percent to 40 percent, while women were opposed by a
margin of 30 percent to 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, U.S. military action against Iraq in the event it
invaded Saudi Arabia was supported by men by a margin of 62 percent
to 31 percent and opposed by women by 43 percent to 45 percent.
While 54 percent of men felt it important to maintain superior
worldwide military power, only 45 percent of women agreed. Women,
moreover, are less likely than men to see force as a legitimate
tool for resolving conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know how to account for this gender gap.
Observers have suggested various reasons why women are less willing
to use military force than men, including their role as mothers,
the fact that many women are feminists (that is, committed to a
left-of-center agenda that is generally hostile to U.S.
intervention), and partisan affiliation (more women vote Democratic
than men).
</P>
<P>
   It is unnecessary to know the reason for the correlation between
gender and antimilitarism, however, to predict that increasing
female political participation will probably make the United States
and other democracies less inclined to use power around the world
as freely as they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Will this shift toward a less status- and
military-power-oriented world be a good thing? For relations
between states in the so-called democratic zone of peace, the
answer is yes. Consideration of gender adds a great deal to the
vigorous and interesting debate over the correlation between
democracy and peace that has taken place in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The ``democratic peace'' argument, which underlies the foreign
policy of the Clinton administration as well as its predecessors,
is that democracies tend not to fight one another. While the
empirical claim has been contested, the correlation between the
degree of consolidation of liberal democratic institutions and
interdemocratic peace would seem to be one of the few nontrivial
generalizations one can make about world politics.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic peace theorists have been less persuasive about the
reasons democracies are pacific toward one another. The reasons
usually cited _ the rule of law, respect for individual rights, the
commercial nature of most democracies and the like _ are
undoubtedly correct.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another factor that has generally not been taken
into account. Developed democracies also tend to be more feminized
than authoritarian states, in terms of expansion of female
franchise and participation in political decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   It should therefore surprise no one that the historically
unprecedented shift in the sexual basis of politics should lead to
a change in international relations.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if gender roles are not simply socially
constructed but rooted in genetics, there will be limits to how
much international politics can change. In anything but a totally
feminized world, feminized policies could be a liability.
</P>
<P>
   Some feminists talk as if gender identities can be discarded
like an old sweater, perhaps by putting young men through mandatory
gender-studies courses when they are college freshmen. Male
attitudes on a host of issues, from child-rearing and housework to
``getting in touch with your feelings,'' have changed dramatically
in the past couple of generations because of social pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But socialization can accomplish only so much, and efforts to
fully feminize young men will probably be no more successful than
the Soviet Union's efforts to persuade its people to work on
Saturdays on behalf of the heroic Cuban and Vietnamese people.
</P>
<P>
   Male tendencies to band together for competitive purposes, seek
to dominate status hierarchies, and act out aggressive fantasies
toward one another can be rechanneled but never eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Even if we can assume peaceful relations between democracies,
the broader world scene will still be populated by states led by
the occasional Mobutu, Milosevic or Saddam. Even if the democratic,
feminized, postindustrial world has evolved into a zone of peace
where struggles are more economic than military, it will still have
to deal with those parts of the world run by young, ambitious,
unconstrained men.

 By FRANCIS FUKUYAMA  
 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Virtually all feminists who study international politics seek
the laudable goal of greater female participation in all aspects of
foreign relations, from executive mansions and foreign ministries
to militaries and universities.
</P>
<P>
   They disagree as to whether women should get ahead in politics
by demonstrating traditional masculine virtues of toughness,
aggression, competitiveness and the willingness to use force when
necessary _ or whether they should move the agenda of politics away
from male preoccupations with hierarchy and domination.
</P>
<P>
   This ambivalence was demonstrated in the feminist reaction to
Margaret Thatcher, who by any account was far tougher and more
determined than any of the male politicians she came up against.
Thatcher's conservative politics did not endear her to most
feminists, who much prefer a Mary Robinson or Gro Harlem Brundtland
as their model of a female leader, despite _ or because of _ the
fact that Thatcher had beaten men at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent findings and research in genetics and new
biology, it would seem that there is something to the contention of
many feminists that phenomena such as aggression, violence, war and
intense competition for dominance in a status hierarchy are more
closely associated with men than women.
</P>
<P>
   Theories of international relations that see global politics as
a remorseless struggle for power are in fact what feminists call a
gendered perspective, describing the behavior of states controlled
by men. A world run by women would follow different rules, it would
appear, and it is toward that sort of world that all postindustrial
or Western societies are moving. As women gain power in these
countries, the latter should become less aggressive, adventurous,
competitive and violent.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the feminist view is that it sees these
attitudes toward violence, power and status as wholly the products
of a patriarchal culture, whereas in fact it appears they are
rooted in biology. This makes these attitudes harder to change in
men and consequently in societies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rise of women, men will continue to play a major, if
not dominant, part in the governance of postindustrial countries,
not to mention less-developed ones. The realms of war and
international politics in particular will remain controlled by men
for longer than many feminists would like.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the task of resocializing men to be more like
women _ that is, less violent _ will run into limits. What is bred
in the bone cannot be altered easily by changes in culture and
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   While some gender roles are indeed socially constructed,
virtually all reputable evolutionary biologists today think there
are profound differences between the sexes that are genetically
rather than culturally rooted, and that these differences extend
beyond the body into the realm of the mind. In no area is
sex-related difference clearer than with respect to violence and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the feminist agenda for international politics seems
fundamentally correct: The violent and aggressive tendencies of men
have to be controlled, not simply by redirecting them to external
aggression but by constraining those impulses through a web of
norms, laws, agreements, contracts and the like.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, more women need to be brought into the domain of
international politics as leaders, officials, soldiers and voters.
Only by participating fully in global politics can women both
defend their own interests and shift the underlying male agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The feminization of world politics has, of course, been taking
place gradually over the past hundred years, with very positive
effects. Women have won the right to vote and participate in
politics in all developed countries, as well as in many developing
countries, and have exercised that right with increasing energy.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and other rich countries, a pronounced
gender gap with regard to foreign policy and national security
issues endures. American women have always been less supportive
than American men of U.S. involvement in war, including World War
II, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War, by an average margin
of 7 percent to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They are also consistently less supportive of defense spending
and the use of force abroad. In a 1995 Roper survey conducted for
the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, men favored U.S.
intervention in Korea in the event of a North Korean attack by a
margin of 49 percent to 40 percent, while women were opposed by a
margin of 30 percent to 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, U.S. military action against Iraq in the event it
invaded Saudi Arabia was supported by men by a margin of 62 percent
to 31 percent and opposed by women by 43 percent to 45 percent.
While 54 percent of men felt it important to maintain superior
worldwide military power, only 45 percent of women agreed. Women,
moreover, are less likely than men to see force as a legitimate
tool for resolving conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know how to account for this gender gap.
Observers have suggested various reasons why women are less willing
to use military force than men, including their role as mothers,
the fact that many women are feminists (that is, committed to a
left-of-center agenda that is generally hostile to U.S.
intervention), and partisan affiliation (more women vote Democratic
than men).
</P>
<P>
   It is unnecessary to know the reason for the correlation between
gender and antimilitarism, however, to predict that increasing
female political participation will probably make the United States
and other democracies less inclined to use power around the world
as freely as they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Will this shift toward a less status- and
military-power-oriented world be a good thing? For relations
between states in the so-called democratic zone of peace, the
answer is yes. Consideration of gender adds a great deal to the
vigorous and interesting debate over the correlation between
democracy and peace that has taken place in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The ``democratic peace'' argument, which underlies the foreign
policy of the Clinton administration as well as its predecessors,
is that democracies tend not to fight one another. While the
empirical claim has been contested, the correlation between the
degree of consolidation of liberal democratic institutions and
interdemocratic peace would seem to be one of the few nontrivial
generalizations one can make about world politics.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic peace theorists have been less persuasive about the
reasons democracies are pacific toward one another. The reasons
usually cited _ the rule of law, respect for individual rights, the
commercial nature of most democracies and the like _ are

</P>
<P>
   But there is another factor that has generally not been taken

HOOKED BY THE Y2K BUG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON GARFINKLE   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newspapers and magazines have spilled a lot of ink lately about
the impending ``Year 2000'' crisis _ so much that it's hard to
avoid getting caught up in it. The problem, as you've probably
heard by now, is that many programmers used only six digits to
represent dates in their programs: two digits for the day, two
digits for the month, and two digits for the year. All over the
world there are thousands of computers that think today's date is
981008. Although these programs will work great today and tomorrow,
many of them will mysteriously fail 449 days from now, when the
calendar rolls over to 000101.
</P>
<P>
   Is Y2K a real problem, or is this just another case of
millennial hysteria? When I wrote about the Y2K on Jan. 1 of this
year, I said that the problem was real, but that many businesses
and most home computer users would probably pull through okay.
</P>
<P>
   That column generated a torrent of e-mail from Y2K evangelists _
people who said that I was being irresponsible by failing to sound
the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's not much of a problem for the average home PC
user,'' wrote Ed Yourdon, a well-known Y2K consultant, in an e-mail
message to me. ``After all, if the lights are out, the phones are
dead, and the banks are closed, most people won't have time to
worry about whether their PC is compliant or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Yourdon isn't an unbiased observer: he's made a lot
of money in recent years writing and speaking about the Year 2000
issue, so he has a reason to play up the potential dangers. On the
other hand, the dangers could very well be real, and Yourdon could
be doing his honest best to try to bring attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Yourdon's analysis is pretty straightforward: If there are
sporadic problems, such as a failed power plant here, or a bank
that's gone belly-up over there, then things will probably be okay.
But if problems are widespread or sustained, it could take the
economy a while to get going again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's only one or two banks, the FDIC will have no problem
handling it; if it's a couple thousand banks, then it's much more
problematic,'' he says. ``Again, I look at this from a statistical
perspective, and from my experience as a software engineering
consultant. There are 11,000 banks in the US, and they all have a
Y2K project with the same deadline. What percentage of them can we
reasonably expect to be finished in time? Many of these projects
are enormous _ Bank of America, for example, has 1,000 programmers
on its Y2K project. When is the last time you heard of a
thousand-person software project finishing on time? (You can read
more of what Yourdon has to say at http://www.yourdon.com/.)
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, I telephoned Boston Edison and spoke with Jim
Ashkar, the company's Y2K coordinator. Ashkar said that many of
Boston Edison's systems are ``Y2K compliant'' now _ the company's
IBM mainframe computer was recently replaced with a new system that
can handle dates into the next century _ and those systems that
aren't will be up to snuff by July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, one of the most difficult systems to
upgrade was Edison's billing system, hence the need for the new
mainframe. ``We started back in 1993 working on this,'' says
Ashkar. ``We also started restructuring our contracts with our
major business suppliers _ making (Y2K compliance) a condition of
maintenance contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Boston Edison is assuring that its systems will be
Year 2000 compliant by requiring that it suppliers make them Year
2000 complaint. It's then asking the companies to test the systems
and provide the test results as proof that the systems will operate
as expected when the witching hour comes.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Edison will have extra engineers standing by, if needed,
to man the stations on the night of Dec. 31 ``in the event that we
need to take some additional action,'' says Mike Monahan, a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not instead of being ready,'' Monahan stresses. ``And
I would add that, for all of our critical systems, we have made a
commitment not to accept anyone's word for readiness: we will do
(our own) physical testing.''
</P>
<P>
   More information about the region's electrical outlook for the
Year 2000 can be found on the home page of the New England Power
Pool, at http://www.nepool.com/.
</P>
<P>
   The devilish thing about this Year 2000 business, though, is
that what happens over the next 14 months will depend upon people's
perceptions just as much as on the underlying physical reality. If
large numbers of people think that the Year 2000 problem will make
banks fail, and if they withdraw their money as a preventative
measure, then banks will suffer _ no matter whether there is a Year
2000 problem or not. People's reaction to the potential crisis
might cause as many problems as the crisis itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are entering the era of unpredictability,'' says Peter G.
Neumann, a scientist at SRI who has made a carrier studying the
Year 2000 problem and other computer-related risks. ``The folks who
say everything is under control, trust us, don't worry, are likely
to have egg on their collective faces. The doomsayers also. There
will be lots of problems.... Railroads are reportedly in trouble
because there is no manual backup system and all automatic control
is centralized in a single system.... Air traffic control could
have problems _ (there's) lots of very old legacy software.''
</P>
<P>
   Neumann thinks that most banks will probably survive ``because
money is at stake, and money talks.'' But we are in for surprises,
he says, as various Y2K projects are completed and people discover
that different strategies for dealing with the problem don't work
in concert. ``Things that work locally often don't work when they
are linked together with other systems,'' he says.

   Do Internet users watch less TV? The jury's still out. Indeed, a
new Nielsen survey claims to show that Internetters actually spend
more time staring at the box. Hard to believe _ I've certainly cut
down on set time these past few years.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind the Nielsens. The Internet's impact on
broadcasting is far greater than mere ratings points. For one
thing, it's given us a glimpse of the long-promised nirvana,
video-on-demand. Sure, it's lousy video, but that'll change.
Meanwhile, the Internet has spawned a new kind of broadcasting
network that can offer a variety of video and audio programming
unimaginable just a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Internet users already have obtained free copies of
Real Networks Inc.'s RealPlayer or Microsoft Corp.'s Windows Media
Player, the two best programs for tapping into Internet broadcasts.
And soon you'll be able to pave your driveway with copies of
RealPlayer. You guessed it: the software will be included on those
free America Online disks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only thing keeping the Internet from overwhelming
traditional broadcast outlets is lack of bandwidth. Even today's
``high-speed'' 'Net connections aren't fast enough to transmit
sounds and images as good as those on a TV set. Those who used the
Web to watch Bill Clinton prevaricate before a grand jury only
logged on for the novelty of it, or because they didn't have a TV
set in the office.
</P>
<P>
   But in many other respects, Internet broadcasting already has
the edge. There's the on-demand part, for instance. A bunch of Web
sites still have the Clinton video available for viewing; some have
even prepared a ``greatest hits'' collection of the most
interesting parts. No waiting for a rerun or scrolling through a
videotape. Just click and view.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're sick of scandal, the amount of alternative
programming on the Web is approaching infinity. There's live news
from the BBC or CNN, play-by-play audio from college football
games, even on-line jukeboxes where you can punch up a favorite
tune.
</P>
<P>
   Serving it all up are a number of computer networks devoted to
audio and video broadcasting. They're minor players now. But they
could be worthy competitors to the media giants in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the networks you'll have never heard about is San
Diego-based InterVU Inc., 10 percent owned by NBC. InterVU serves
up Internet video, but they don't slap their own brand on the
product. Instead, they provide the videos you can get on Web sites
owned by CNN and NBC, among others. Rather than set up their own
Internet video system, traditional media companies hire InterVU to
handle the messy details.
</P>
<P>
   There is one good reason for lowly consumers to visit the
InterVU site at http://www.intervu.com. They've posted a nice
program that'll automatically download and install nine popular
multimedia players for your PC or Mac, including RealPlayer and,
for PC users, Windows Media Player.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Houston, Broadcast.com Inc. has taken aim at the
consumer market. Unlike traditional broadcast networks,
Broadcast.com doesn't produce its own programming. Instead, it
provides a central location (http://www.broadcast.com) where
consumers can connect for free to live news and sports reports, as
well as dozens of radio stations located across the country.
Broadcasters pay Broadcast.com to pump their message to Internet
users worldwide. Lonesome for your favorite Los Angeles radio
station? Broadcast.com has six L.A. stations to choose from, as
well as live police radio chatter for the truly homesick.
</P>
<P>
   So are our PCs about to become home entertainment centers?
Hardly. Instead, we'll see Internet technologies starting to appear
in our TV sets and stereos. Products like WebTV, high-speed
Internet cable modems, and next-generation set-top boxes are
pointing us toward devices that'll have audio and video quality far
better than any PC, while also having the PC's access to limitless
quantities of programming.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, that means we'll have so much more to watch and
listen to than the Big 3 networks or the local radio stations. The
same thing happened in the 1980s, when cable TV took off, and the
broadcast networks have never recovered. How will they cope when
people can watch whatever they want, whenever they want? Stay
tuned.

HACKERS HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: You really blew it with that reader hearing
door noises, Bombay! Hackers have a program called Back Orifice
that lets them control anybody's computer, including making weird
noises.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know It All
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ALL: Dial the paranoia down a notch, OK? Back Orifice is a
remote administration tool released by the self-aggrandizing hacker
group Cult of the Dead Cow. For BO to work, you have to install a
host program on the computer under ``attack.'' True, hackers can
disguise the host or tack it onto a real program, but anybody
stupid enough to run unknown software from an untrusted source
pretty much deserves what they get.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the host is installed, the hacker still has to find
where, precisely, the computer is attached to the Internet, and a
bunch of other stuff has to be in sync before anything can happen.
Do you really think a true hacker is going to waste time just
playing a stupid sound file after all that?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I had to laugh when I read the letter from
Haunted II. I thought anybody with half a peanut for a brain knew
that America Online plays sounds when anybody on your Buddy List
signs on or off. A creaky door opens when they sign on, then slams
when they sign off.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hearing Things
</P>
<P>
   DEAR THINGS: That certainly makes more sense than a rampaging
band of wild-eyed hackers terrorizing complete strangers. I'd
really like to thank the hundreds of AOLers who wrote in to point
out what a pinhead I am for not knowing the answer immediately. You
folks can now go back to hanging around chat rooms posing as
teen-age nymphomaniacs.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Following your description of how to launch the
Excel 97 ``flight simulator,'' I am unable to achieve the results
described in your article. Will you please send me the routine to
follow in case there was a misprint in my paper?
</P>
<P>
   _ No Luck Yet
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NO: Don't start blaming copy editors. Sure, their jobs seem
duller than anyone could possibly describe, but I don't think even
they would stoop to snipping out random bits of information or
arbitrarily changing the odd word here or there solely for their
own amusement.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these tricks are for specific versions of software.
Maybe you don't have the right one, or you got a step wrong. It
happens. Don't make yourself crazy if they don't work. Go on to the
next one. Speaking of which ...
</P>
<P>
   STUPID SOFTWARE TRICK: A tip o' the sombrero to Dorothy for this
Word 97 time-waster.
</P>
<P>
   Open a new document, type in ``Blue'' (without the quotes) and
highlight it. Click on the Format menu, then Font. Choose bold for
the font style and blue for the color, then click OK. Put a space
after the word, then click on the Help menu and pick About
Microsoft Word.
</P>
<P>
   In the splash screen that appears, there's a vertical graphic on
the left. Hold down Control and Shift while you left-click on it.
Yes, that really is a pinball game next to the scrolling list of
Word developers. Use Z and M to control the flippers.
</P>
<P>
   I hear that Word 95 contains the same surprise, minus the
pinball. Aren't you glad you spent all that money to upgrade?

DIRECT BUYING PUTS PC MAKERS ON ALERT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying a PC for the home used to be so simple. You walked into
an overcrowded electronics or computer store, dealt with a
salesperson who may or may not know more than you about computers,
settled for what's in stock and then hoped you could get it home in
the back seat of your compact car.
</P>
<P>
   Today, you can still have that _ ahem! _ thrilling shopping
experience, or you can buy your PC direct from the manufacturer: by
phone or over the Internet. Increasingly, those who've owned their
first or second PCs are buying direct, a trend that has alarmed
computer makers who push their goods through retailers.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the traditional PC manufacturers _ Compaq, IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, NEC/Packard Bell _ are adopting the tricks of the
direct trade. You can buy some of their systems online, and in some
cases they've set up kiosks in stores for direct ordering. Buyers
pick the features they want and the custom-built PCs are shipped
directly to their homes. No more cramming 17-inch monitors into the
back seat of a Chevy Cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at two high-end PCs, each sold using some form of
direct marketing. One's from a traditional PC company, and the
other's from the most non-traditional computer maker around.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Enthusiast 2 _ $2,863, iDot.com.
</P>
<P>
   You knew this was destined to happen. With the success of
businesses like CDNow and Amazon.com _ which sell music and books
on the Web, respectively _ someone was bound to start a Web-only
PC-sales operation. And iDot.com is it, at www.idot.com.
</P>
<P>
   Austin-based iDot sells PCs built out of brand-name components
and aims them at knowledgeable computer users. The company targets
gamers, computing enthusiasts, home/- &QL; 
small office buyers and students. It offers base configurations for
each of these niches, which a buyer can tweak online at will.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the Enthusiast 2 model, which comes with a 450-megahertz
Pentium II chip, 128 megabytes of memory, a 10-gigabyte hard drive,
a 40X CD-ROM drive, a 56K fax modem, 3-D audio, Advent speakers
with a subwoofer, a 19-inch monitor and an Intel i740 AGP graphics
card. I upgraded the video by replacing that with an 8-MB Matrox
Millenium G200 card, and added a 12-MB Voodoo2 graphics card for
3-D games.
</P>
<P>
   The iDot system arrived with some problems, some of which were
easily solved. Others I'm still living with.
</P>
<P>
   The video card, for example, was not seated properly so the
system wouldn't even boot up when I first turned it on. At first I
thought the system was dead on arrival, but reinserting the card
was the easy fix.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I discovered that if connected to America Online via
dial-up, the computer rebooted when I signed off. I downloaded new
modem drivers, but now I'm having difficulty dialing in to my
Internet provider. I can get through, but it takes several tries
before the Lucent fax modem connects.
</P>
<P>
   (In general, I've had problems with Lucent modems, which are
used in other brands of computers. iDot offers a 3Com 56K fax modem
as an option, and it's one worth taking.)
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, this is a slick, fast machine. Its zippiness has a
lot to do with its massive amount of high-speed memory and its
snappy hard drive, which spins at 7,200 revolutions per minute.
Like most systems sold direct, there is very little in the way of
glitzy add-ons to slow it down. It comes with Windows 98, some
games on CD _ you install 'em yourself _ and that's about it. It's
an excellent game system, particularly with the Voodoo2 card
installed.
</P>
<P>
   If you want top speed, want to be able to design your own system
and already have the software you need to be productive _ or have
fun _ then iDot's PCs are worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Presario 5600 _ $2,499, Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy this high-powered Presario, which just bristles with
bells and whistles, either at Compaq's Web site or in a store. At
those retailers who are participating in Compaq's Built-for-You
program, you can configure one and have it shipped to your door.
</P>
<P>
   The 5600 series is Compaq's attempt to compete with direct PC
sellers. Many of its components, such as the modem and the video
card, can be easily replaced, and the internal design is greatly
simplified. When you open it up, there's lots of room to work
inside and plenty of free expansion slots.
</P>
<P>
   The 5600 I tried had a 450-Mhz Pentium II chip, 128 MB of
memory, a 16.8-GB hard drive, 3-D sound, a 56K Rockwell fax modem,
a DVD-ROM drive, a built-in Ethernet connection, an ATI Rage Pro LT
video card and an internal Iomega Zip drive. The price quoted here
doesn't include a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Presarios, it comes with a keyboard with four buttons
that take you to various Web sites. While the software that
configures the buttons is easier to use than its initial version,
it's still not quite simple enough.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a speedy computer, but it lags behind the iDot
because its hard drive is not as fast. I added a 12-MB Voodoo2 card
to this system, and it ran demanding 3D games without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Presario is a good choice if you're interested in working
with digital video. It includes a Firewire connector _ also known
as IEEE 1394 _ which lets it link up with newer video and audio
components. It also has video-out jacks so you can plug it into a
TV set _ particularly handy given that this computer has a DVD
drive.
</P>
<P>
   While the hardware in this system may be streamlined, Compaq
continues to make the software environment a messy place. There are
too many programs that run in the background, including one that
checks an Internet server for software upgrades and the
Internet-button controller. Fortunately, if you want a cleaner
system, you can disable these. In computing, simpler is almost
always better.
