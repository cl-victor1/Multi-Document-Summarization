MORE CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ENTERING RANKS OF RICH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ More Californians are joining the ranks of the
rich, according to a study released Wednesday, including in Los
Angeles and Ventura counties where the percentage of six-figure
households is among the highest in California.
</P>
<P>
   More than 915,000 households in the state have annual incomes of
$100,000 or more, an increase of 21.9 percent since 1990, according
to the report from Acxiom Corp., a Conway, Ark.,-based data
analysis service. And by decade's end, the number is expected to
swell to more than 1 million households.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles County, 9.5 percent of households were at or
above the $100,000 mark, compared with 7.8 percent in 1990. Ventura
County's six-figure households are at 10.4 percent, up from 9.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that there's a significant segment of the
population whose income is growing more rapidly than others _
specifically, those who are already wealthy and whose pay includes
equity in the companies that employ them, said John Karevoll, an
analyst in Acxiom's La Jolla office.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, they get stock options; they get a piece of
the action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 9 percent of the state's households are at or above
$100,000, compared with 6 percent for the nation as a whole, the
study said. That's up for the state from 1990's 7 percent, when the
nationwide average was 4.4 percent that year.
</P>
<P>
   Northern California had four of the top 10 counties, with three
heading the list: Marin (18.4 percent), north of San Francisco;
Santa Clara (13.6 percent), home of the Silicon Valley; and San
Mateo (13.5 percent), which is wedged between San Francisco and the
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Orange (13 percent) and Northern California's Contra Costa (12.1
percent) counties separated Los Angeles and Ventura from the top
five.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' ranking didn't surprise Jack Kyser, chief economist
for the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp., who said the county
did ``very well'' when compared with the disproportionately
represented Silicon Valley counties, where jobs tend to be more
lucrative _ and where compensation is largely in the form of stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's going on in the Silicon Valley, that is one of
the major currencies in that whole technology sector there,'' he
said. ``You have to say Orange County (also) has a major technology
sector.''
</P>
<P>
   But the recent stock market turmoil that has sent share prices
spiraling downward in recent months could change that. ``The air
has gone out of that bubble a little bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, people in the six-figure income group are likely
to be in the entertainment, technology and financial services
industries, as well as in more ``mundane'' sectors like the apparel
industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of discussion about the shrinking middle
class in terms of upper income households,'' he said. ``We have a
lot of industries that could yield a lot of newcomers to that
(upper income) roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, it might be better to consider absolute numbers rather
than percentages.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Marin County's population of 246,000 is barely a
dot compared with Los Angeles's 9.5 million _ a number that would
give the county the nation's ninth-largest population were it a
separate state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relatively speaking, you have to keep in mind the size of the
universe you're dealing with,'' Kyser said. ``For a large county,
I'd say Los Angeles is doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the rate of growth within that six-figure income segment
of the population, Los Angeles is somewhere in the middle _ a
result of the recession of the early 1990s, which hit the county
particularly hard, Karevoll said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most current data indicates that the growth rate is
catching up,'' he said. ``We expect household income and job
generation to grow at a faster rate, only because Los Angeles was
coming up from a worse situation and (had) more of a recovery to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The county lost about 200,000 aerospace jobs, all of them high
paying, as a result of the recession, said Rajeev Dhawan, director
of econometric forecasting in The Anderson School at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the county has regained only 80,000 to 100,000 jobs,
though very few are high-paying, he said. Among the industries that
filled the gap was the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with entertainment is that very few people make
the top dollar,'' Dhawan said. ``The rest of the people are working
for survival wages.''
</P>
<P>
   The county has pockets of high-tech jobs, most of them in the
western part of the San Fernando Valley, and a number of the health
maintenance organizations in the Valley pay higher wages as well,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you still haven't made it up in terms of high paying
jobs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the engine of California's economic growth has been in
Northern California, which is filled with what Dhawan called
``fancy growth'' industries that are now getting hit by the stock
market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Given the roiling market, Los Angeles in a sense could count
itself fortunate for having less of that. ``The good side of not
having a lot of fancy growth is that we don't suffer too much when
it goes away,'' he said.

TWENTY YEARS LATER, ZIMMER CLEARLY REMEMBERS DENT'S PLAYOFF HOME
RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees celebrated the 20th anniversary of their
1978 World Series championship by having Bucky Dent, Chris
Chambliss and Willie Randolph, three stars from that team, throw
out the first pitches before Game 1 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dent thought Yankees coach Don Zimmer should participate in the
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dent asked me to catch him,'' Zimmer said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer declined, preferring not to dwell on the events of long
ago when Dent, now a coach with the Rangers, brought ruin to the
best team he ever managed. Tomorrow marks the 20th anniversary of
the day Dent hit his three-run home run off pitcher Mike Torrez and
helped the Yankees defeat the Boston Red Sox in their classic
one-game playoff at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like 20 years,'' Zimmer said last night,
recalling that spectacular autumn afternoon in Boston. ``I first
realized it a couple of weeks ago. We were in Boston and they
brought \RDennis\S Eckersley in to relieve and I started thinking,
that son of a ... it's been 20 years since Eckersley pitched for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer, celebrating his 50th year in baseball, said he doesn't
think about that day unless somebody asks about it. But he
remembers it well, perhaps his most disappointing day in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was painful going into the clubhouse and seeing grown men
cry,'' Zimmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Did he cry?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably,'' Zimmer said. ``There wasn't a whole lot to say. We
blew a 12- or 14 game-lead, the Yankees led us by 31/2 games, then
we came back. We won eight straight at the end of the season. I
told them I couldn't be more proud of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Guidry, a Cy Young Award winner that season, started for the
Yankees, but the Red Sox scored a couple runs early and led 2-0
into the seventh. Then the Yankees put a couple of runners on base
and Dent came to the plate. He lofted a high fly ball toward the
Green Monster, the 34-foot wall in left.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in Fenway Park, you know probably 95 percent of
the time when it's going out, when it's against the wall or in the
net,'' Zimmer said. ``It was 75 degrees that day, cool enough so
that the wind should be blowing in. But the wind was drifting out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he hit the ball, I said, `Good that's an out.' I see
\RCarl Yastrzemski\S go back, then turn around and I said, `Well
that's not the worst, it's off the wall.' Then it was in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer insisted 20 years later that that wasn't the biggest play
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest one is the one nobody ever talks about,'' Zimmer
said. ``Guidry's pitching, we have a one or two-run lead and a
couple men on base with two outs. In Fenway, your outfielders give
the \Rfoul\S line and bunch in the gaps. Fred Lynn hits one down
the right-field line for extra bases. My first thought was don't
bounce in the seats, because I wanted both runners to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou Piniella caught the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Yankees came over to the Red Sox clubhouse to
shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Piniella, `How could you catch that ball,' '' Zimmer
said. ``How could you play a left-handed hitter to pull the ball
off Guidry? He said, `I'll tell you, I thought Guidry had lost a
lot of velocity, so I cheated three or four steps to my left.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tremendous answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer managed for 13 years in the majors and that was his best
team ever, even better than his two Rangers juggernauts in 1980-81.
The Red Sox won 99 games but, because of Dent, did not make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it anymore,'' Zimmer said. ``It was
painful the next day when I was driving home. But there's nothing I
would have done differently. If you're going to be in this game a
long time, you've got to take that kind of stuff because it's going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer later did get revenge. Dent was traded to the Rangers in
1983 and Zimmer had been hired by the Yankees as a coach. With no
place to live, he rented Dent's house in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk in that house and there's a picture of Dent hitting
that home run in every room,'' Zimmer said. ``Bathroom, living
room, it didn't matter, there was a picture of him hitting that
home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The living room also had one of those nice white shag carpets.
You know, like a shaggy dog. So after a couple of months, I called
Dent up. I said, `I couldn't stand it anymore so I turned every one
of those pictures around and spit tobacco on your shag carpet.' ''

CREW TOP METROSTARS, 5-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Bora Milutinovic's success as coach in the
World Cup failed to rub off on the MetroStars in his first playoff
game in Major League Soccer tonight. Milutinovic's newest team
suffered a 5-3 loss to the Columbus Crew at Ohio Stadium to fall
behind in their first playoff series in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The two-of-three-game series will resume Saturday night at
Giants Stadium, and if a third game is necessary it will be played
here next Wednesday night. A third game will not be necessary,
however, if the MetroStars and Milutinovic do not find a formula to
mark tighter on defense.
</P>
<P>
   That aspect of the MetroStars' game was so loose on Wednesday
night that the Crew paraded at will inside the penalty area and
found ample room to operate once they got near Tony Meola, the
goalkeeper. He had little chance on any of the goals, which came in
rapid succession: two three minutes apart and two others five
minutes apart, all before the game was 38 minutes old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little bit lackadaisical,'' said Mike Sorber, who
scored the second goal for the MetroStars. ``We just didn't have
the intensity and they came at us pretty good. Their transition
game was better, but we corrected some things and we did well in
the second half. We proved that we can score goals on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the MetroStars staged a good rally in the second half
after Milutinovic put Miles Joseph and Billy Walsh into the game in
place of Jim Rooney and Brian Kelly. The MetroStars got goals from
Eduardo Hurtado, Sorber on a penalty kick and Joseph. But they only
made the score more respectable after the Crew had jumped to a 4-0
lead by intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McBride scored the first two goals in the first 12 minutes
to stun the MetroStars. Rob Smith and Jason Farrell scored the next
two and Stern John got the fifth one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came very fast in the first half,'' Milutinovic said of
the Crew's forwards, who steadily got behind his defenders before
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you receive goals like that,'' Milutinovic said of
McBride's two early goals, ``it's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The two early goals by McBride, who scored the only goal for the
United States in the World Cup last summer, appeared to awaken the
MetroStars. They took control of the game for the next 20 minutes,
but came up empty despite some sloppy goalkeeping by Juergen
Sommer. Three consecutive shots from the MetroStars bounced off the
Crew's goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the MetroStars' failure to get at least one goal
during their 20-minute domination, the Crew regained the initiative
and capitalized on two chances that were created after mistakes by
MetroStar defenders.
</P>
<P>
   The four-goal burst set a league playoff record for goals in a
half. It also put the MetroStars in a hole that even a coach as
successful as Milutinovic could not get them out of. &QL;

DODGERS RESHUFFLE
</HEADLINE>
 (CORRECTS SPELLING OF HOFFMAN IN LEAD) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ New Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone truly
likes Glenn Hoffman and his coaching staff. But he wasn't going to
put the future of the team in the hands of six guys he met just
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   So with his attention still focused on getting Montreal manager
Felipe Alou, Malone announced the reassignment of Hoffman and his
coaches Wednesday, giving Hoffman a spot on the major-league staff
and the rest a place in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance the coaching staff of Joe Amalfitano, Mike
Scioscia, Mickey Hatcher, Charlie Hough and John Shelby could
remain in some form with the Dodgers in Los Angeles. But Malone
wants the new manager to play a critical role in forming the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the organization needed to make a change, create a
new direction,'' Malone said. ``I just needed my guy, to get a guy
who is a proven manager who I trust will be on the same page with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he hopes to have a new manager in place by the
annual organization meetings, which will be held Oct. 28-Nov. 1 at
the Dodgers spring-training base in Vero Beach, Fla. Actually, he
would like it well before then, but several candidates remain under
contract with other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have contacted the Expos about Alou, who worked in
Montreal when Malone was general manager (1993-94). Alou, 63, has a
year left on his Expos contract, worth $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal president Claude Brochu said Monday he would not stand
in Alou's way of taking the Dodgers job, but so far has not granted
Malone permission.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos are expected to learn next Wednesday whether citizens
of Quebec will agree to fund a new stadium. If the measure fails,
which is likely, the club probably will be sold and leave Canada.
But since Alou is the most popular Expos figure since Gary Carter
in the early 1980s, Montreal does not want him to walk away just
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have interest in Felipe because he is a friend and an
excellent baseball mind,'' Malone said. ``We have not gotten
permission to talk so everything is hypothetical.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou would be a popular choice among the reassigned coaches. In
Montreal, Alou only has ties to first-base coach Luis Pujols.
Third-base coach Pete Mackanin and pitching coach Bobby Cuellar
were brought in by Expos general manager Jim Beattie. Mackanin has
indicated he would like to be considered for the manager's spot if
Alou leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he also is considering former New York Mets,
Cincinnati Reds and Baltimore Orioles manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate is Kevin Kennedy, the Taft High product who
lives in Tarzana. Kennedy previously managed in Texas and Boston
and was a minor-league manager in the Dodgers organization for many
years. He worked in the Montreal farm system under Malone and is
now a baseball analyst for ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, who lives with his wife and five children in Anaheim
Hills, left Wednesday for a two-week family vacation and was
unavailable for comment. He was 47-41 after taking over for
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Because positions will not be assigned until a new manager is in
place, Hoffman's actual spot on the new staff is uncertain. At
Triple-A Albuquerque, where he was manager before taking over June
22 from fired Bill Russell, Hoffman also was the third-base coach.
</P>
<P>
   Amalfitano has been the Dodgers third-base coach the past 16
years and Malone and Alou are fans.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, Hoffman's bench coach, was the longtime Dodgers
catcher who also played with Texas and San Diego at the end of his
career. He was a candidate last year for the manager's job with the
expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Hough and Hatcher were promoted from Class-A San Bernardino a
week after Hoffman was named manager.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hough was offered the pitching coach's job but
declined because of personal differences with Russell, his longtime
teammate. In June, he replaced Goose Gregson and got high marks
from most of the pitchers. Hoffman said players responded to
Hough's low-key approach and respected his 25 years as a
major-league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby, the center fielder on the Dodgers' 1988 World Series
championship team, made an unexpected rise to the major-league
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two seasons, Shelby was demoted as manager at
Double-A San Antonio and manager for Class-A Savannah, Ga. The
Dodgers eliminated the Savannah club and sent Shelby to coach at
Class-A Vero Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Dodgers' September minor-league callups said
Shelby was the best manager in the organization. He also was the
only African-American coach in the Dodgers farm system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't fired anyone,'' Malone said. ``Most organizations
would have fired the coaching staff. There is a lot of talent there
and I still want to use it.''

 EUGENE L. McCABE, 61, FOUNDER OF HARLEM COMMUNITY HOSPITAL   
 By BARBARA STEWART  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eugene L. McCabe, a management consultant who founded
and was president of North General Hospital, a thriving,
minority-operated community hospital in Harlem, died there on
Wednesday. He was 61.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was breast cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was indefatigable in putting it together,'' said Mario
Cuomo, who, as governor, approved many of the grants and loans to
build North General. ``His strength was his will and his total
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   North General, a 200-bed hospital on 121st Street and Madison
Avenue, is the only minority-operated hospital in the state. Most
of its trustees are black. The hospital specializes in treatment
for diabetes, cancer and hypertension, which occur widely among
low-income blacks. It recently built 300 units of condominium
housing for low- and middle-income residents of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a wonderful hospital,'' said Kenneth Raske, president of
the Greater New York Hospital Association. ``And Gene did it
through sheer dogged persistence and sharp business acumen.''
</P>
<P>
   When another specialized hospital moved out of Harlem in the
late 1970s, McCabe, along with Randolph Guggenheimer, a lawyer,
developed the idea for North General: a community hospital to serve
the impoverished, medically deprived area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became his passion, his life work,'' said Livingston
Francis, chairman of the board of North General.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, who described the hospital's creation as ``a miracle,''
said it took all of McCabe's persuasive powers to talk him and
others into approving the necessary loans. At the time, many small
community hospitals, overwhelmed with the unexpected demands of
AIDS patients and crack addicts, were being closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't make financial sense,'' Cuomo said. ``But he made a
case for that hospital. He was always entreating. He was never
offensively pushy, but he was insistent.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of McCabe's entreaties in Albany, Washington and New
York City, the state appropriated $150 million to build the
hospital. From the start, it was rooted in the community. At one
early point, the union asked the hospital workers to continue
working despite a missed pay period, Mrs. Gugggenheimer said. With
the help of banks, local businesses and politicians, it pulled
through several financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the new hospital, McCabe drew on the resources
of the staff in unexpected ways, Francis said. Nurses helped choose
color schemes, and engineers installed lighting and laid floors _
tasks that would ordinarily be done by outside workers. The process
was repeated seven years ago, when North General moved into its
current facility, a modern brick building on 121st Street and
Madison Avenue, with a bright interior decorated with art selected
by staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hospital,'' Cuomo said, ``was his.''
</P>
<P>
   McCabe, who grew up in New Haven, Conn., graduated from Southern
Connecticut State University.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Elsie Crum, who is the
president of the Museum for African Art in the SoHo section of
Manhattan; their 1-year-old twins, Eugene and Erin, and a son,
Kevin, from a previous marriage.

EVERETT'S BAT SILENT, BUT HIS MOUTH KEEPS RUNNING
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Carl Everett's bat was quiet Tuesday, but his mouth
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Before Game 1, the Astros outfielder called Padres pitcher Kevin
Brown a ``nobody.'' That rip preceded Brown's 16-strikeout
domination of Houston and promoted terse retorts from the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes an ignorant person to say something like that,''
Padres pitching coach Dave Stewart said. ``Guys who say stuff like
that don't belong in the big leagues. I never knew Carl was that
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who said Brown ``was nobody until he's done
something,'' went 0-for-2 against Brown with a strikeout. Brown
said he was unaware of Everett's statement, but Stewart sure
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess (Brown's) done something now, huh?,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   While teammate Jeff Bagwell suggested that Everett ``let a
sleeping giant lay,'' the former Mets player did just the opposite
when asked about Thursday's starting pitcher, Andy Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown did his job,'' Everett said, ``but Andy hasn't done
anything yet until he goes out and proves it.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Padres owner John Moores is expected to attend Thursday's game
after missing Game 1 to be with his mother, who suffered a stroke
last week. Moores, a Houston philanthropist, has built athletic
facilities for his alma mater, the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   _ Playoff fever isn't exactly gripping Houston. After
approximately 4,000 seats were empty for Game 1, about 8,000
tickets remain for Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tuesday's victory was San Diego's first in the postseason in
almost 14 years, since Game 2 of the 1984 World Series. The Astros'
last playoff triumph came on Oct. 12, 1986 in Game 4 of the NLCS
against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moises Alou, who hit 38 home runs in the regular season, is
homerless in his past 104 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Padres have had fewer than 10 hits in their past 18 games.

RANGERS' HELLING DISCOVERS NO ROOM FOR ERROR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rick Helling discovered last night what Todd
Stottlemyre found out in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   There's no margin for error when the New York Yankees' pitchers
have your offense completely snuffed out. Helling held the Yankees
to three runs in six innings, but that's two more than the Rangers
scored, and Helling's first postseason start turned into a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I threw the ball good enough to win,'' Helling said
after the Rangers' 3-1 loss. ``But, the same as Todd, you have to
give the other pitcher credit. They outpitched us two days in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling's downfall was two home runs, a solo shot by Shane
Spencer in the second inning and two-run homer by Scott Brosius in
the fourth. Both came on fastballs, which was still Helling's best
pitch, producing nine strikeouts in six innings. But he conceded
that he relied on it too much, especially to Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw it well to some good fastball hitters _ Derek Jeter,
Bernie Williams, Tino Martinez,'' Helling said. ``They either took
it or fouled it off. That told me it was moving good. When that
happens, I stick with it until they prove they can hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, a good fastball hitter, did just that. Helling worked
the count to 2-2, then came with one too many fastballs. Spencer
hit it high and deep over the left-center-field fence for a home
run and a 1-0 Yankees lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a mental mistake,'' Helling said. ``I've got to make
him hit a breaking ball. He's a good fastball hitter, that's what
the scouting reports say. But I felt so good with my fastball, I
thought I could hit my spot. But I missed it by a couple of inches,
and he hit it pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The fastball was also the culprit again in the fourth after
Spencer singled with one out. Helling tried to get a fastball down
with the first pitch but got it up instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed so bad with that pitch I'm surprised he hit it,''
Helling said. ``It was up in his eyes but I guess it came back over
the middle of the plate and he just tomahawked it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was all the Yankees got but all they needed. Two mistakes
were too many considering what Andy Pettitte was doing to the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'm disappointed, but I felt I threw pretty good,''
Helling said. ``Most nights I win that game, but we're not worried
about our offense. I'm sure Friday they'll come out swinging the
bats well. We just ran into some good pitching here.''

ATHLETES, JOBS MAKE FOR VIOLATION IN WAITING
</HEADLINE>
 12 REPORT-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When dealing with the various factions of the Big 12, achieving
a unanimous or lasting opinion on any subject is rare. This is the
only conference in America where produce items enjoy a longer shelf
life than the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet amid all the diverse viewpoints, football coaches have found
ironclad commonality. They agree on two things:
</P>
<P>
   None of their players is holding a part-time job despite an NCAA
rule enacted Aug. 1 permitting athletes to earn up to $2,000 above
the value of their scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring this new rule, which allows athletes to work for
school boosters, will trigger more headaches on college campuses
than the morning after a Metallica concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really playing with fire on this one ... and I'm quite
sure some people will get burned,'' Missouri coach Larry Smith
said. ``Putting boosters in contact with players more than raises
temptations. That turns temptation into opportunity for people who
want to cross the line. I think this will jump up there with
gambling in terms of being as big a concern as there is in college
athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   Because none of the Big 12 coaches has actually dealt with a
player holding a part-time job, it would be easy to dismiss such
bluster as premature. But not in this case.
</P>
<P>
   This rule, passed by the NCAA with the intent of allowing pocket
change for scholarship athletes, might work in non-revenue sports.
But it will never work in a sport that was overrun with infractions
cases detailing $100 handshakes and booster-financed slush funds
throughout the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the NCAA banned boosters from the recruiting process.
Allegations of improper payments to players did not disappear, but
the numbers have dwindled in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the NCAA has approved booster involvement with part-time
jobs. Iowa State coach Dan McCarney already knows what happens
next: Jim Bob Studmuffin, coveted recruit, wants to weigh one
school's job program against another before signing a letter of
intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what scares me the most,'' McCarney said. ``It becomes
a factor in recruiting. And there's no question that's a
disadvantage for us. We don't have a big job market in Ames,
Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum issued the same lament about College
Station. A similar case could be made in most Big 12 cities, where
Austin is the only one with a population in excess of 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the 1990s have been marked by the NCAA's 20-hour
rule, a mandate that limits practice time to preserve study time
for overburdened athletes. Suddenly, these athletes now have time
to study, play ``and'' work?
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so. Neither does Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the worst rule in the world,'' Dykes said.
``It's an absolute joke. After all we've heard about time
constraints, and they come up with this? Tell it to the Marines.
I'm not buying that.''
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative solution, Dykes suggests returning to the days
when athletes received a monthly spending stipend as part of their
scholarship. It happened in the 1960s and the cost fit nicely into
athletic department budgets before schools landed the largesse from
corporate sponsors, stadium suites and television contracts worth
multimillions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   If it could work then, it can work now. Devise a dollar figure,
draft the legislation and put it in place. It will certainly beat
the impending chaos NCAA administrators will soon experience from
their most recent tweaking of the rules.
QUICK HITS
TV DECISION DELAYED
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives have exercised their right to wait until Sunday
before deciding whether to show Nebraska-Texas A&AMP;M or
Colorado-Kansas State as the network's 2:30 p.m. game Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The unselected contest, associate commissioner Tim Allen said,
will move to 6 p.m. and will be televised by Fox Sports Southwest
or FX. Also, the Texas Tech-Oklahoma State game will be a 6 p.m.
telecast on Fox Sports Southwest or FX.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas-Oklahoma game will be televised at 11:30 a.m. by
KXTX/Ch. 39, giving the league a season-high four telecasts on Oct.
10. Alfred earns opportunity Because he drove the team to a
go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter of last week's 18-16 loss
to No. 15 Colorado, Baylor backup quarterback Jermaine Alfred will
receive more playing time in Saturday's game at Texas Tech, said
coach Dave Roberts. But Odell James, who has completed 16 of 37
passes (43.2 percent) with three interceptions and no touchdowns,
will remain the Bears' starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Odell's our quarterback, but Jermaine may play a little more
this week than he has been,'' said Roberts, who watched Alfred
complete nine of 16 passes for 58 yards, including two third-down
connections on the fourth-quarter scoring drive. ``We've got to
improve our quarterback play.'' FRETS ABOUT FUMBLES
</P>
<P>
   The yards still come in bunches for Texas Tech tailback Ricky
Williams, who leads the nation in rushing with 192.5 yards per
game. But so have the fumbles. In the past two weeks, Williams has
lost the ball three times inside the opponent's 5-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe Ricky is trying too hard and we've got to
address that,'' Tech coach Spike Dykes said. ``Once it gets to be
habit-forming, you've got to address it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Williams' two fumbles in last week's 31-24 victory against
Iowa State, Dykes said both were the result of improper
ball-handling rather than jarring hits by Cyclones' defenders.
EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State officials will receive $1.3 million for moving
Saturday's home game against Nebraska from Stillwater, Okla., to
Kansas City, Mo., where most of the 70,000 at Arrowhead Stadium
figure to be Cornhuskers fans. Cowboys coach Bob Simmons said he
agrees with the decision to move the game and maximize the money.
Players say location shouldn't matter. ``Either place you play,
it's tough to beat Nebraska,'' linebacker Kenyatta Wright said.
``If you're not assignment perfect, you're going to lose.'' ...
Mike McGee, athletic director at South Carolina, has confirmed that
he has been contacted about the vacant Big 12 commissioner's job,
joining a list that includes Dan Beebe, Ohio Valley Conference
commissioner, and Karl Benson, Western Athletic Conference
commissioner. The Big 12 search committee is expected to meet with
candidates next week. ... Texas joins No. 1 Ohio State, No. 17
Oregon and Indiana on the short list of Division I-A teams ranked
among the nation's top 20 in the four major offensive categories:
rushing, passing, scoring and total offense. The Longhorns are 2-2.
The others are a combined 9-1. ... Baylor coach Dave Roberts,
explaining the evolution of an offensive line dotted with
junior-college transfers: ``Our first game, the offensive line hit
the wrong people. Last week against Colorado, they hit the right
people. They just didn't stay blocked. So we're making progress,
but we've got a long way to go.'' The Bears' average of 3.5 yards
per rush ranks 10th among Big 12 schools. ... Oklahoma coach John
Blake, on the influence of former Cowboys coach Barry Switzer, a
frequent visitor to Sooners practices: ``He gives me his opinions,
which I'd rather keep between him and I. But he knows we have
potential and thinks we're on the verge of making things happen.''
Blake said he is not concerned about an option-based offense that
produces 249 of its 330 yards each week on the ground, yet has more
passing touchdowns (4) than rushing touchdowns (3). ... Blake will
have Matt Reeves, a walk-on, handle kicking duties Saturday against
Colorado. Reeves, who hit two field goals in a 13-12 loss to
California Sept. 19, replaces Jeff Ferguson, who missed two
field-goal attempts and an extra-point attempt against the Golden
Bears.

FRIED POTATOES FATTEN UP AMERICAN DIET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Americans are eating more fruits and vegetables
than they did 25 years ago but the increase is mostly in potatoes _
fried potatoes, according to a national study.
</P>
<P>
   And that is a problem because a fried potato a day won't keep
the doctor away, the researchers said in the study released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I count french fries as a vegetable,'' said Dr. Susan M.
Krebs-Smith, author of the report that appears today in the
American Cancer Society's journal Cancer. ``Some people laugh at
that, but we fry a lot of vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   Too many, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Potatoes account for half of all vegetables Americans are
eating, and half of the potatoes end up being eaten as french
fries, Krebs-Smith said. She said it shows just how fast-food
dependent the nation has become.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes are the second most popular vegetable and, especially
when cooked, are valuable in preventing prostate cancer in men.
</P>
<P>
   While frying vegetables doesn't necessarily diminish nutritional
benefits, it adds grease to diets that already are too laden with
fat, she said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the potato is not the best vegetable in terms of
nutrition or cancer prevention. In fact, Krebs-Smith said the
American Institute of Cancer Research has even suggested that the
potato lose its designation as a vegetable because it contains so
much starch.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rosalez, a who works for Disney in nearby Glendale, said
he'd like to lose weight but frequently finds himself eating fast
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quick and easy, especially when you only have half an
hour for lunch,'' said Rosalez, 33. ``Fruits and vegetables just
aren't as accessible as french fries. On most people's work
schedules, I think the government's goals are hard to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Americans are barely meeting government recommendations
for eating fruits and vegetables daily, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made some progress, but we're certainly not there yet,''
said Gloria Stables, director of the Five a Day For Better Health
program sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that between 1970 and 1995, Americans consumed
19 percent more vegetables, 22 percent more fruit and 47 percent
more grain products.
</P>
<P>
   Government guidelines call for at least three to five servings
of vegetables a day and two to four servings of fruit. The study
said that in 1994 _ the latest year for which figures are available
_ Americans averaged 3.6 servings of vegetables and 1.5 servings of
fruit a day.
</P>
<P>
   Krebs-Smith, a researcher for the National Cancer Institute,
notes that these are minimum recommendations for reducing cancer
risk.
</P>
<P>
   She said the recommendation to eat five servings of fruits and
vegetables daily is for people who consume only small quantities of
food on low-calorie diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most people, the recommendations would be higher than
that,'' Krebs-Smith said, noting that most people should be eating
seven or eight servings of vegetables and fruits a day to reduce
the risk for colon, rectal, breast and prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While fruit and vegetable consumption may be up nationwide, the
state's Department of Health Services reported that it has slipped
among adults in California _ back to 1989 levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think people are buying fruits and vegetables, but they're
not eating them,'' said Jennifer Gregson, a senior research
associate for the department's Research and Nutrition Section.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they don't have time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely a fast-food society,'' said Ummat Muhammad,
22, who was dining at McDonald's in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad said he and his family have tried to eat more fruits,
vegetables and grains since his father, although a nonsmoker, died
of lung cancer seven years ago at the age of 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors said it had a lot to do with his eating habits,''
Muhammad said.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad eats most of his fruits and vegetables at dinner and
usually avoids eating meat. Still he says there is definitely room
for improvement _ as at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cheating right now,'' Muhammad said as he ate the last of
his french fries.

PETTITTE STRUGGLING? NOT AGAINST RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andy Pettitte's woeful September boiled down to major
failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had good stuff my last three or four times out,
but I wasn't able to stay out of the big innings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte had good stuff last night at Yankee Stadium. The
Yankees' left-hander retired the first 12 Rangers he faced.
</P>
<P>
   But when Juan Gonzalez led off the fifth with a double down the
left-field line, one of those big innings loomed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Pettitte escaped without major damage. Will Clark flied
out to deep center field to move Gonzalez to third, and Ivan
Rodriguez followed with a single to drive in the run. Pettitte then
got Todd Zeile to pop out to short and induced an inning-ending
groundout from Mike Simms.
</P>
<P>
   That inning, Pettitte said, was the key to beating the Rangers
in Game 2 of the American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big inning for me to hold them to one run,''
Pettitte said. ``When Gonzalez hit the double, I didn't give up two
or three runs. That was the big inning.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the only damage the Rangers inflicted upon Pettitte in
seven innings, as he pitched his team to a 3-1 victory, giving the
Yankees a commanding 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series. He
allowed the one run on three hits, walked none and struck out
eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the old Andy,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   The old Andy was the ace of the Yankees' staff. The new,
definitely not improved Andy struggled in the final couple of
months. He was 2-2 with a 5.71 earned-run average in August, and
1-3 with a 6.75 ERA in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having a lot of trouble with everything,'' he said.
``Mechanically, I was out of sync. Then I gave up hits, and my
confidence started to go.''
</P>
<P>
   There was even speculation Pettitte would be left off the
postseason roster. Torre, though, didn't consider it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never even entered my mind,'' he said. ``Andy has done so much
in the three years I've been here. Just because you get in a little
bit of a slump you don't lose faith in somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte rewarded that faith by being at the top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to get my changeup going, I was able to throw my
curveball for strikes and I had good control of my two-seam
fastball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That control might have been his best asset. He took advantage
of plate umpire Durwood Merrill's extra wide strike zone, spotting
his fastball off the plate and either getting called strikes or
forcing the Rangers to swing.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte didn't just dominate the Rangers, he shredded their
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   The key for the Rangers to pull off the upset in this series was
to beat the left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the best laid plans of would-be giant killers.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells, the first Yankees left-hander, pitched eight
shutout innings as New York won Game 1, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte almost matched him last night.

YANKEES FIND BONUS IN SPENCER 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shane Spencer quickly squashed a suggestion that he
is living out a fairy tale. After all, fairy tales end with
``happily ever after,'' and the Yankees outfielder isn't to that
point yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be a storybook until this is all over,'' Spencer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' when you play for the Yankees this season, refers to
the entire postseason, up to and including winning the World
Series. They are a long way from that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have eight or nine wins to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, they are one win away from dispatching the Rangers in
the first round, thanks largely to Spencer's magic wand.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer homered off Rick Helling in the second inning and
singled ahead of Scott Brosius' homer in the fourth as the Yankees
won, 3-1, to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's saga might not be a fairy tale, but the story of the
late-blooming, 26-year-old phenom still reads like something off
the fiction shelves.
</P>
<P>
   He was a minor-league slugger seemingly destined to stay in the
bush leagues because of a lack of opportunity on the talent-rich
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer finally made the team this year because of injuries, but
didn't see much playing time. He spent the season bouncing back and
forth between Triple-A Columbus and the Yankees' bench.
</P>
<P>
   He finally got a chance in September and began swatting balls
over the fence at an amazing rate. Spencer batted .421 with a
team-leading eight homers and 21 runs batted in in the final month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it worked out it seems like this year I was ready, and
I'm glad I stayed with the Yankees so I can say I made it with the
best organization ever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The afterthought for most of his career earned his first
postseason start yesterday, playing left field against the Rangers.
He made it a game to remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get cheated,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
``He knows what to do with that piece of wood, and it's not
cleaning his shoes. My only question is, where's he been all
year?''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer was on the bench for Game 1 because Torre opted for the
better defense of Chad Curtis. With Joe Girardi replacing Jorge
Posada behind the plate for Game 2, Torre needed something else out
of his left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Spencer will be hard to put on the bench again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected the kid to do what he did,'' Torre said.
``It's going to be tough to get him out of there.''

HEART OF RANGERS' LINEUP ANEMIC DURING THIS POSTSEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is the first of October, Rangers fans. Do you know
where your ``Se$or Octubre'' is?
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez, who put on one of the most awesome hitting
exhibitions in baseball postseason history two years ago, has
vanished, and he has taken the rest of the Rangers' offense with
him.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Rangers, dismal 3-1 losers to the Yankees last
night in Game 2 of the American League Division Series, face the
almost insurmountable task of winning three consecutive games in
order to advance to the AL Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: Do not hold your breath waiting for this to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Missing persons reports have been filed with the New York City
police, and Rangers manager Johnny Oates has inquired about putting
the faces of Gonzalez, Will Clark, Rusty Greer and Pudge Rodriguez
on milk cartons.
</P>
<P>
   Posters will be available at convenience stores and post offices
sometime this afternoon as the Rangers take the day off to
contemplate how precarious their situation has become.
</P>
<P>
   Finding their heart again is first on their list of things to
do.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of their once powerful batting order, that is.
</P>
<P>
   When Oates predicted that starting pitching would be the key to
this best-of-five series against the Yankees, he didn't expect the
Rangers' vaunted offense, which carried this team to its second
division title in three years, to produce a total of one run and 10
hits in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the regular season, starting a left-hander against
Texas was like dropping a goldfish into a tank of piranhas. But
it's the Rangers who have gone into the tank against the Yankees'
David Wells and Andy Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did not collect a hit of any kind in the first three
innings of either game and have had just one single in the first
four innings of both games.
</P>
<P>
   And while the sudden hush from Rangers bats has been basically
universal, it is the Fading Four _ Greer, Gonzalez, Clark and
Rodriguez _ the group that produced 105 home runs and drove in 458
runs this season, whose disappearance is most critical.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, their performance has been abysmal, a combined
4-for-31, 1 run, 1 run batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, they have been merely pathetic: Greer: 1-for-8;
Gonzalez, 1-for-8; Clark 1-for-8; Rodriguez, 1-for-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we need,'' Oates said, ``is to swing the bats like we did
all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard to do that when you're trying to swallow the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is no more to blame than anyone in the lineup, it's
just that much is expected of the man who drove in 157
regular-season runs and who will likely win his second American
League most valuable player award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying the best I can, but I'm human,'' a depressed
Gonzalez said in the gloom of the Rangers' clubhouse. ``I go to
home plate and I try hard for my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez did produce the Rangers' only extra base hit of the
night, a double down the left-field line leading off the fifth. He
scored the Rangers' only run in two games here on Rodriguez's
two-out single to left.
</P>
<P>
   That, folks, was the Rangers' offense.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez struck out leading off the seventh against Pettitte in
one of his most frustrating at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a couple of pitches to hit, but I missed them,'' he
said, shaking his head. ``Our offense is one of the best in
baseball, and we scored one run here. That surprises everyone in
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, has stepped forward to trigger the offense. Two
Octobers ago, Gonzalez was the Rangers' only hot hitter. In the
final two days of September 1998, they had none.
</P>
<P>
   There was a chance for redemption in the ninth. Tom Goodwin led
off with a pinch-single off Yankees closer Mariano Rivera. But
Greer, swinging at the first pitch, finished a futile 0-for-4 night
with a weak roller to second.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had a chance to rekindle 1996 glory but bounced
harmlessly to third. And Clark, who cut his teeth on clutch
situations like this early in his career, struck out swinging on a
chin-high fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees fans danced into the streets, the Rangers trudged off to
their clubhouse and a flight home and September faded away.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first of October.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Se$or Octubre'' is going to make an appearance, it had had
better be soon.

PETTITTE PITCHES YANKEES WITHIN GAME OF SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once again, the starting pitcher dominated. Once
again, the bottom of the order produced the runs. Once again, a
little was more than enough for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   New York put the Texas Rangers on life support Tuesday night,
taking a 2-0 lead in this best-of-five Division Series with a 3-1
victory before 57,360 fans at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees can
finish off the Rangers  &UR; tomorrow &LR;  night at The Ballpark in
Arlington, Texas, with David Cone going against the Pattonesque
Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   New York got a terrific outing from lefthander Andy Pettitte,
who allowed three baserunners and a gift run in seven innings. He
struck out eight, didn't walk a soul, and, like David Wells in a
2-0 win the night before, kept the big guns quiet. The Rangers came
into the postseason batting .316 against lefties, but they managed
only 8 hits in 53 at-bats (.151) against Wells and Pettitte while
scoring one run.
</P>
<P>
   New York, meanwhile, was again opportunistic at the plate. It
had no other choice. Rookie phenom Shane Spencer, a k a Joe Hardy,
rewarded manager Joe Torre for starting him by drilling a solo
homer in his first playoff at-bat in the second inning. In his
second at-bat, Spencer singled and came home on Scott Brosius's
first playoff dinger, making it 3-0 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be a storybook until it's over,'' said Spencer, who
is fast making left field his permanent domain. ``I'm happy just to
be out there. I'm riding it now, cherishing every moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Spencer to an already loaded Yankees team almost
seems like overkill, as if Bill Gates discovered he had been left a
huge inheritance by some unknown rich aunt. Spencer was sent back
to the minors three times this season, came up for good in
September, then hit .421 in the month, with eight homers (three
grand slams) and 21 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get cheated,'' Texas manager Johnny Oates said.
``He knows what that piece of wood is for, and it's not to clean
his shoes. My only question is, where has he been all year?''
</P>
<P>
   Torre started Spencer because Darryl Strawberry is ailing, the
manager wanted an extra bat in the lineup, and he felt gimpy-kneed
Tim Raines would have trouble with the slippery turf. Torre never
told Spencer; he simply posted the lineup. ``I started him
hopefully to do what he did,'' Torre said. ``But I never expected
him to come in and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's first at-bat was an amazing moment. He drilled a 2-2
Helling fastball over the 399-foot sign in left-center. He was
summoned out of the dugout for the obligatory curtain call and got
another big hand when he went back to the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Spencer singled to center with one out. On the
next pitch, Brosius drilled a line shot into the right-field seats.
That was it for the Yankees, who were hardly dominating. Their
first five hitters combined for one hit in 19 at-bats against
20-game winner Rick Helling, another Texas tough-luck loser, like
Todd Stottlemyre the night before. Batting champ Bernie Williams
and Derek Jeter are hitless in the first two games, and Tino
Martinez has one hit.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte yielded a run in the fifth, but how he handled the
situation spoke volumes about the night. His one weakness this
season has been to allow the dreaded big inning. On this occasion,
Juan Gonzalez (1 for 8) hit a bullet down the third base line,
breaking up Pettitte's perfect game. He tried for a double, but
Spencer's throw was in time. Gonzalez, however, avoided the out by
kicking the ball out of second baseman Chuck Knoblauch's glove. He
scored two batters later, but Pettitte avoided further damage by
getting Todd Zeile (pop to shortstop) and Mike Simms (grounder to
third).
</P>
<P>
   ``That was key for me,'' Pettitte said. ``It was a big inning
for me because I was able to hold them to that one run.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not in danger again.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson got the first two outs of the eighth, and Mariano
Rivera came on to get his second straight save. For the second
straight game, the Rangers managed only five hits.
</P>
<P>
   Oates has to be wondering what is going on here. Prior to the
series, he said he liked his team's chances if his starting
pitchers performed well. They have. What he could not have
envisioned was his league-leading offense (.298) going south. In
two games, Yankee pitchers have yielded one walk and struck out 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can swing the bats better than we did here,'' Oates
said. ``Hopefully, when we get home, we can get the bats going.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It has happened again and again over the course of baseball
history.
</P>
<P>
   When you least expect it, somebody comes out of nowhere in the
postseason to make the big play, score the big run or deliver the
big hit. Or even have the big series.
</P>
<P>
   And it's usually somebody whom nobody would ever expect to make
such a huge impact in a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the local comedians would name Craig Biggio, Derek
Bell or Jeff Bagwell as those least likely to come up with the big
hit in the playoffs considering their efforts in last year's
first-round sweep by the Atlanta Braves and Tuesday's Game 1 of the
National League Division Series against the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   They have combined to go 2-for-47 in those four games, all
losses, but that's not what we're talking about here.
</P>
<P>
   No, we mean unheralded guys like Dusty Rhodes of the New York
Giants, who hit a game-winning three-run homer in the 10th inning
of Game 1 in the 1954 World Series, and then went on to hit another
homer to help lead the Giants over heavily favored Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times in the postseason there are guys, lesser
lights, who come along and become stars,'' said Astros manager
Larry Dierker. ``That can happen in this series, as it can in any
other series.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Astros are still searching for such a hero.
</P>
<P>
   While so much attention has been focused on the struggles
Biggio, Bagwell and Bell have endured, none of the other Astros
have really been able to come through with much offense at all.
</P>
<P>
   There has been nobody like New York's Brian Doyle, who came off
the Yankees' bench when Willie Randolph got hurt and batted .438 in
the 1978 World Series. Doyle, who helped the Yankees beat Los
Angeles in six games, didn't even make the roster the next spring.
</P>
<P>
   But the other Astros have been just as impotent as the big guns.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez, who hit .125 (1-for-8) against the Braves last
season, went 0-for-3, striking out all three times, against San
Diego on Tuesday. Bill Spiers was 0-for-11 against Atlanta in '97
but scratched out one of the Astros' four hits off Kevin Brown in
Game 1 against the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are still waiting, which is funny since this a team
that had several players emerge from the shadows of their more
high-profile teammates to make key plays. The Astros could not have
amassed 49 come-from-behind victories, including 27 on their last
at-bat, without contributions from everyone, not just the Killer
B's and Moises Alou.
</P>
<P>
   ``All season long, when someone was in a funk or something,
everybody picked one another up,'' Carl Everett said. ``It's been a
team game all season long. To me, there's no reason to shift the
focus on them (Bagwell, Biggio, Bell and Alou) now. Right now,
everybody just has to do their job individually, and it will become
a team game.''
</P>
<P>
   You would probably be safe in betting on either Sean Berry or
Everett to be the guy who does come through for the Astros. In many
of the Astros' come-from-behind victories, it was Everett who kept
things going with a big hit. And it was Berry who was the hero in
the Astros' last-at-bat victories, winning three with homers and
another with a bases-loaded single.
</P>
<P>
   With the offensive talent the Astros have from top to bottom of
their lineup, they probably don't need someone like Oakland's Gene
Tenace, who, after hitting just five home runs all season, hit four
homers in the 1972 World Series, helping the A's beat the favored
Cincinnati Reds in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   No, what they needed Tuesday was someone like Atlanta's
Francisco Cabrera, who came off the bench to deliver a two-out,
two-run single off Doug Drabek to beat Pittsburgh in the National
League Championship Series and send the Braves to their second
straight World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the character of this team,'' Spiers said.
``It's been that way all year. We've had people picking each other
up all year. The only thing we can do is keep doing what we've been
doing all summer. Things will take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros aren't about to panic. Instead, they will just keep
plugging along, the same way they piled up a franchise-record 102
victories this season. They way they see things, even with Brown's
overpowering performance, the Astros were right there at the end,
just one key hit away from either tying the game or winning.
</P>
<P>
   And they figure that sooner or later, someone, not necessarily
one of the Killer B's or Alou, is going to deliver that key hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to press,'' Berry said. ``If you press in this
game, especially in the playoffs you don't have time to do that
because before you know it you'll be going home.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's just one game. Everybody tried to make a big deal
out of who won or lost that game. Every game is so important in a
five-game series. (Today's) game is just as important as
(Tuesday's). We just have to go out and win.''

RANGERS ON VERGE OF LEARNING HOW NASTY A WORD IS `SWEEP'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All is meek for the Rangers. Quietly, they fell again
last night, which meant there is now a confirmed date tomorrow with
the Grim Sweeper.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into Yankee Stadium to open the playoffs, the Rangers
counted heavily upon the huff-and-puff of a dangerous batting
order. And they prayed for pitching guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Score one for prayer. What has been received is the surprising
luxury of pitching _ winnable pitching _ for two games, only to
have the bats go to the devil.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, maybe David Wells really wasn't that good for
the Yankees in Game 1. Not after Andy Pettitte basically matched
him in Game 2 in everything except total shutout innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte debuted last night in the 1998 postseason, having gone
2-5 with a massive ERA just under 7-point for his last seven
regular-season starts. It was questionable of manager Joe Torre
giving him this key assignment. But the Rangers took both Torre and
Pettitte off the hook, looking clueless at the plate in a 3-1 New
York victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sweep is such a nasty word in any postseason competition. Guess
who will be attempting to avoid ol' Nasty in Game 3 tomorrow night
at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is a Game 4, also blame the boredom of the Rangers'
bats for removing this series from the No. 1 prime-time slot on
Saturday. That would now be a noon start, due to a sudden network
shift last night after the Yankees went up two games to zip.
</P>
<P>
   This series, of course, is over, it's just a matter of when.
Winning three straight from the Yankees is as likely as a weekend
snowstorm in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   From the Dept. of You-Never-Know, the Rangers' pitching staff
allowed five runs in the two games at Yankees Stadium, and still
had L's hung on starters Rick Helling last night and Todd
Stottlemyre in Game 1. Coming in as long-odds underdogs, the
Rangers had to think they could have allowed five runs per game and
still had a shot at winning both. Being outscored, 5-1, over 18
innings eliminated that theory.
</P>
<P>
   Helling had to bulldog his way through six innings, throwing a
massive 119 pitches, but the right-hander kept a win available. His
downfall was a pair of home-run balls, one being a solo from
Yankees rookie monster Shane Spencer, and the other a two-run shot
by Scott Brosius, the bottom-of-the order bomber.
</P>
<P>
   But all Helling and the Rangers' bullpen lacked was run support,
the same as Stottlemyre the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the positive pitching, if these two losses didn't
qualify as a bitter disappointment, then...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bitter,'' disagreed manager Johnny Oates, strongly.
``This is baseball. We got outpitched. I'd like for us to swing the
bats better, to take better swings, to score runs. But what are you
gonna do? We have pitched well, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Pettitte, the Rangers' order appeared to have a bigger
problem last night with composure. Basically, the only noise coming
from the batter's box was verbal barking at the strike zone of
plate umpire Durwood Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   What's this _ some kind of sudden discovery that Merrill has a
wide strike zone? He's been umpiring the same way for 21 years.
When Durwood is behind the plate, you'd best be hacking. Instead,
the Rangers took called strike after called strike, making it easy
for Pettitte. Way too easy.
</P>
<P>
   Less mouth and more cuts might have served the Rangers better,
but instead, the frustration piled up.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, pitching coach Dick Bosman figured to be under the
same fire in this series as he was for most of the season. Instead,
Bosman dressed quietly again last night in the visitor's clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have responded to the challenge,'' he said of
Helling and Stottlemyre. ``Everyone knows this is a tough place to
pitch, and a tough club to get outs off of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helling didn't give them much to hit, despite the fact they
\Rthe Yankees\S made him work hard, fouling off all those pitches.
The two \Rhome runs\S were the only time he missed, and that's
great considering all the pitches he threw.''
</P>
<P>
   A questionable rotation for most of the season has certainly met
the September challenge, including the two games here and the five
divisional showdown contests with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of our guys,'' said Bosman. ``Pressure pitching is
what September and October are all about.''
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, is pressure hitting. But for the two games here,
the Rangers didn't qualify in that area.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ACCORDING to America's leading baseball authorities, there's only
one way for the Astros to escape this postseason malaise of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   They must hit.
</P>
<P>
   Hit, hit, hit.
</P>
<P>
   Then hit some more.
</P>
<P>
   They must treat Andy Ashby today as though he were Andy
Griffith. They must tear into the baseballs that Andy Ashby will be
throwing as though they have Osama bin Laden's mug on them.
</P>
<P>
   In short, to finally whiff a little playoff success, they've got
to stop whiffing. Either the Astros' bats stand up and be counted,
or the walk back to the dugout is going to take them directly into
the Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find a way to break the ice,'' Craig Biggio said.
</P>
<P>
   And to break Ashby's heart. I mean, this is a guy who hasn't
been able to get anybody out since about July. Of late, after a
rousing start to his season, Ashby has been more like Andy Griffith
than Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Against that particular Fab Four, the Astros are 0-4 over two
Division Series, spanning the 1997-98 playoffs. They have managed a
mere 20 hits in 126 at-bats, which computes to a .159 average.
Their ``slugging'' percentage is all of .198, since only three of
those 20 hits have gone for extra bases, one of them an accidental
Chuckie Carr homer.
</P>
<P>
   They have scored six runs, Carr's dinger included. And they have
struck out 41 times, practically once in every three plate
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Appalling.
</P>
<P>
   But what to do? Gerry Hunsicker, the general manager, joked that
he was going to bring in a sports psychologist, or perhaps a
hypnotist.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting coach Tom McCraw, who needs to try something by virtue
of his job description, said he was going to call a meeting after
Wednesday's optional workout. Mack's not ordinarily a fan of
group-therapy sessions, but these straits are beyond dire. It was
to be just Mack and his boys, circling their wagons.
</P>
<P>
   His message? In 25 words or less, relax and hit the &AMP;%! ball.
More specifically, drive it to all fields. Stop trying to yank
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might suspect the Astros are choking, and maybe they
are. Biggio, to his credit, accepted the mounting heat regarding
the Astros' offensive anemia as intrinsic to the lofty territory
they occupy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were winning anyway,'' he said, ``it wouldn't be a
story. But we're losing, so it's the story. We need to refocus and
change our results. In the playoffs, it's a different game. You
only face the other teams' horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there's no debating the merits of the opposing arms
they've been up against, and Brown, in particular, was even better
than he's supposed to be. As Larry Dierker mused: ``As good as his
stuff is, I've never seen it as good as it was (Tuesday).''
</P>
<P>
   Brown struck out 16 Astros over eight innings, the most ever by
a pitcher in a Division Series. Along about the fifth, the Astros
were whipped, whimpering puppies. Hunsicker swears he could see
their early confidence literally drain, inch by painful inch, from
their peaked personages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were OK when the game started,'' he said, ``but as it wore
on and we saw what kind of stuff Brown had, we became afraid to go
deep into the count against him. By swinging at bad pitches early,
we expanded his strike zone, and he definitely didn't need the
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker suggested a drastic change in attitude is in order for
the Astros to resume being the club they're supposed to be, a club
worthy of its 102-60 regular-season record.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take the next step beyond just winning the division
championship,'' he said, ``we've got to be able to handle the top
pitchers in the game. That's what the postseason is all about _
beating the great pitchers. Because you don't see many bad ones
this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's doing it. Hey, the Braves don't go to the World
Series every year.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Florida went last season instead, propelled in part by the
big stick of soft-walking Moises Alou. Alou the Astro, alas, also
brought balsa with him to the Astrodome instead of hardwood against
Brown, although he did slap a ninth-inning infield single off
Trevor Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently buoyed by that small success, Alou exercised his
option Wednesday and passed on batting practice. But, present in
street clothes, he did convene with McCraw afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, for his part, was keeping his trap shut. What does an
old pitcher know about slump-busting, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball's not a sport where you can give supercharged pep
talks,'' he said. ``You're better off if you're not too fired up.
The key is staying patient. So I haven't said anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Biggio, designated leader of the so-called Killer B's,
whose production shortfall has been most conspicuous, he made a
simple suggestion before parting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be aggressive,'' he said. ``And remember to have
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Astros have failed spectacularly on both fronts.
Come October, which comes today, to hit is to live, and they're
dying.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The 1998 FedEx championship was decided two races ago when Alex
Zanardi clinched the PPG Cup and the $1 million bonus faster than
any driver in Championship Auto Racing Teams history.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might take a little luster off the inaugural Texaco Grand
Prix of Houston on Sunday and the other two races left on the
schedule, but it's still a race to the finish for a handful of
drivers who remain in contention for second place.
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up status might not sound like such a glamorous deal, but
$500,000 is on the line for the driver who can finish No. 2 in the
points standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say what it means to everybody else, but I can tell
you that second place is very important to us,'' said Scotland's
Dario Franchitti, who drives the Team Kool Green Reynard/Honda.
``We had such a slow start this year that we knew early on we were
out of the hunt for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to have the chance now to finish second really says a lot
about this team and what we've done in the second half. It would
mean a lot to get the money, but it would mean more to us just to
say we were No. 2 for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti ranks fourth in the CART standings with 122 points,
but he is only four points behind third-place Adrian Fernandez. The
man in the No. 2 spot is Jimmy Vasser, the 1996 champion. Vasser
has 136 points, but five drivers are within 30 points of Vasser _
Fernandez, Franchitti, Greg Moore (118), Michael Andretti (112) and
Scott Pruett (106).
</P>
<P>
   Pruett is the only one of those contenders who has not won at
least one race this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every race is critical the rest of the way,'' Vasser said. ``I
think we have the tools to put the Target car second, but there are
five other guys who have a legitimate shot at it. They're all good
drivers with good equipment, too, so there's a lot at stake in the
last three races. It should be fun for the fans to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   A maximum of 22 points is available at each race for the winner.
Finishing first is worth 20 points, but a driver can earn one bonus
point for being the top qualifier and one point for leading the
most laps.
</P>
<P>
   Only the top 12 finishers in the 28-car field receive points, so
it's not out of the question for any of the drivers who rank No. 2
through No. 7 to end &UR;  &LR; up as the runner-up to Zanardi this year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if Vasser finished 13th on Sunday and Moore won the
event, Moore would have at least 138 points and Vasser would have
136. Another scenario could have Andretti winning the last three
events while Vasser finishes with two fourth-place finishes and one
fifth. Andretti would have at least 172 points, and Vasser would
have 170.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are endless for how the standings will shake
out in the last three events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with all the bad things that have happened to us, it's
amazing we still have a shot at finishing second in the points,''
said Andretti, who has finished second in four races this year.
``It's a lot of money to shoot for. Plus, there's a million bucks
waiting for the winner of the last race, and that's a nice
incentive as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The CART Championship Series 500 at California Speedway on Nov.
1 will have a record winner's purse of $1 million. It could be a
$2.5 million payday for Chip Ganassi's Target team that day if
Vasser wins the race and finishes second in the points
championship, because Zanardi has clinched the $1 million prize for
the title.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi and Vasser have combined to win the past three
championships. If they end up first and second in the standings
this year, it would be the first time team members finished at the
top of the points chase since 1994, when Al Unser Jr. and Emerson
Fittipaldi were first and second, respectively, for Team Penske.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really want to do this for Chip,'' Vasser said. ``It would
say a lot about this organization if we are one and two this year
after winning the last three titles.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasser believes Sunday's race will be the toughest test of the
remaining three events because the 1.68-mile, 10-turn course
downtown is an unknown for all the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A brand-new course makes things more difficult for us but not
insurmountable,'' Vasser said. ``We're all in the same boat, so
it's just a matter of which team can get its cars set up the best.
One of our goals is to have a good car coming off the trailer so we
can pick up the track a little more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti has done a good job of picking up the track nuances
at street and road courses this season. He won back-to-back at Road
America in Wisconsin on Aug. 16 and the Vancouver street race in
Canada on Sept. 6. But Franchitti also was on the pole at the
street race in Toronto on July 19 and led 76 of the first 79 laps
before his day ended with a spin caused by faulty brakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very confident of our chances on these type of courses,
so this should be a good place for us,'' Franchitti said. ``But you
never know for sure until you get out there. I do know that it's
going to be one heck of a fight between the guys battling for the
No. 2 spot in the championship.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
It was the offseason of 1995, and Gerry Hunsicker and Kevin Towers
were trying to secure their first jobs as major-league general
managers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As fate would have it, they were candidates for the same
position, only neither knew it. Towers, the Padres' assistant GM at
the time, even sat in on interviews while the franchise's brain
trust quizzed candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Padres surprised everyone, including Towers, by
removing the ``assistant'' from his title. Hunsicker didn't get
that job, but a promising challenge awaited him in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Both men laugh about the irony of the situation now as their
teams battle for the right to advance to the National League
Championship Series. That alone is proof it could not have worked
out better for either of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I interviewed for the job, Kevin seemed to be
promoting me,'' Hunsicker said. ``I remember talking to him and
feeling like we could really work well together. He has a great
personality and great people skills. He's one of those guys that
everyone likes five minutes after they meet him. It's ironic how
our paths crossed. A week later I was being interviewed for (the
Astros) job and the Padres were deciding on Kevin.''
</P>
<P>
   They both took jobs that didn't allow the GM to be on equal
financial footing with most of their counterparts, and they both
excelled by getting the most out of their limited resources.
Hunsicker built a team that is competing in the playoffs for the
second year in a row; the Padres also have reached the postseason
twice during Towers' three-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a minute that their deep backgrounds in scouting
and player development have nothing to do with the shrewd decisions
that went into building their championship-caliber clubs.
Hunsicker, in particular, has developed a reputation for being on
the right side of lopsided deals.
</P>
<P>
   He acquired starting center fielder Carl Everett for John Hudek,
a reliever the team didn't think it had a place for on the roster.
Righthanded reliever Jay Powell came to the Astros for minor-league
catcher Ramon Castro, who most believe never would have reached
starter status.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications are that Hunsicker got the best of Towers in
the Sean Bergman-for-James Mouton swap. Bergman won 12 games for
the Astros this season; Mouton struggled with the Padres and was
left off the playoff roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember telling (Padres president) Larry (Lucchino) that he
couldn't go wrong with Gerry, and I really meant that,'' Towers
said. ``Gerry has done a really good job of putting this team
together. I don't think you could find many moves that he made this
year that worked out in a negative way. It's been all positive. I
can't say enough about the job he's done here. This is a very good
ballclub he's put together.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's the big deals that seem to define a GM, and both
pulled off at least one major coup for 1998. Towers traded for
Kevin Brown, who had 16 strikeouts and beat the Astros 2-1 in Game
1 of the Division Series; Hunsicker added star-quality players in
Moises Alou and Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us have shown that we're not afraid to pull he trigger
and make some big deals,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of acting in such a manner is high when you oversee a
small-market club without the financial resources to outspend
mistakes. But mistakes have been few and far between for Hunsicker
and Towers, and that's the main reason they are the leading
candidates for NL Executive of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't like talking about awards,'' said Hunsicker,
who shared Towers' opinion on the subject. ``I will say that it's
meaningful from the standpoint that your peers are doing the
voting, and everyone wants to be respected by their peers. But
that's really secondary to what the organization accomplishes. I
can assure you it will be a bigger disappointment if our ballclub
doesn't progress in the postseason than rather I get an award or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. has the Padres to thank for
selecting Towers over Hunsicker. Otherwise, Hunsicker would not
have been available when the Astros came calling. Although McLane
is partial to Hunsicker for obvious reasons, he believes both men
deserve consideration for the NL's top award for an executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them have done truly outstanding jobs,'' McLane said.
``Neither team is the Braves, the Mets, the Dodgers, the Orioles,
the Yankees or even the Rangers. Neither one of us has financial
resources like that. For every investment we make in salary, we
have to make it pay off or we won't be a championship team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money doesn't buy success. There are a lot of teams that spend
more money, but never win. Spending a lot of money doesn't
guarantee a lot of success, and that's why I think you have to
respect what Gerry and Kevin have done. We're proud to have Gerry
as our general manager. He really got us some bargains with some of
these guys, and you have to have that on a club like ours. I think
both of them deserve a great deal of credit and recognition, but
particularly Gerry.''
</P>
<P>
   When the award winner is announced, we'll find out who GMs
around the league chose to receive the ultimate recognition.
Hunsicker or Towers? Towers or Hunsicker?
</P>
<P>
   Either way, they can't go wrong.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Being down 0-1 in a five-game series doesn't exactly send up a red
flag for a team that claimed 49 come-from-behind victories and won
27 games in its last at-bat.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Projections of gloom and doom quietly hovered over the Astros as
they went through an optional workout Wednesday at the Astrodome.
But not surprisingly, the whispers weren't coming from anyone
wearing an Astros uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else might be saying those things, but we're not,''
Astros right fielder Derek Bell said. ``I don't read the papers or
listen to you guys talk trash on TV. Do you guys want to pick up a
bat and try to hit Kevin Brown, John Smoltz, Greg Maddux or Tom
Glavine (the four pitchers against whom the Astros have lost their
last four playoff games)?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our situation isn't dangerous. What's dangerous is when you
walk out in front of a semi truck on the interstate. That's
dangerous. Pressure is when you have to wake up in the morning
knowing you can't pay your bills. That's pressure. This isn't
pressure. If you win, you keep playing; if you lose, you go home.
It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's too early to start helping the Astros pack for an
early winter vacation, but a loss today would knock a little dust
off their suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   No National League team has won a Division Series after losing
the first two games. Randy Johnson led Seattle from an 0-2 deficit
for an improbable victory over the Yankees in a 1995 American
League Division Series, but that's obviously not the preferred way
of getting to the League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has been determined,'' Astros center fielder Carl
Everett said. ``The goal is to win three out of five games, and we
lost the first one. Now, we have to concentrate on winning three
out of four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked to have won the first game, but it's not
like we haven't won three out of four before. No one in this
clubhouse thinks it's over. The way this team is, we always think
we're capable of winning. That's the only way you win 102 games in
a season.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Everett is fond of pointing out, the regular season is
meaningless at this time of year. During the regular season, the
Astros had the most potent offense in the NL. But in Game 1, Padres
ace Kevin Brown ripped their bats to shreds with a 16-strikeout
performance that was the best in the four-year history of the
Division Series. Brown won a 2-1 pitchers' duel against Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Things don't figure to get any easier for the Astros today when
they try to even the best-of-five series against 17-game winner
Andy Ashby. Then again, it probably can't get much worse than in
Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we took their best shot,'' Astros shortstop Ricky
Gutierrez said. ``Ashby's a great pitcher, too. But it will be
tough for anyone to pitch as well as Brown did (Tuesday). It would
even be tough for Brown to come back and do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Now would be a good time for the Astros to break a funky pattern
that popped up more than a few times during the regular season.
There were nine times during the course of the season when the
Astros scored one run or none in a loss and also lost the following
game. On six of those occasions, they scored two or fewer runs in
the second game.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have shut down our offense before, but we usually don't
stay down for too long,'' Gutierrez said. ``This team has a lot of
offensive capabilities, and we're not going to let one game bother
us too much. We know we can score runs; it's just a matter of going
out there and doing it, and I think we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything is possible, but as for getting swept, the Astros'
regular-season performance suggests that's not likely. Their
longest losing streak this season was four games, and they lost
three in a row on only two other occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Righthander Shane Reynolds, who won 19 games during the regular
season, will try to stop the current losing streak at one when he
takes the mound for the Astros today. If the Astros go down 0-2 in
the series, they can get ready to be reminded of last year's
Division Series sweep at the hands of the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can play with your mind if you let it,'' Astros third
baseman Bill Spiers said. ``But I don't think that's going to
happen with us. We all know what happened last year, but we've only
lost one game, so we're not making a big deal out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got dominated in Game 1, but we believe we have what it
takes to come back from that. That's just the character of this
team. We never say die. From what I can gather in the clubhouse, no
one is dwelling on what happened (Tuesday). The only thing we're
concerned about is trying to get a win (today). Right now, that's
the only thing that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Astros haven't won a playoff game since 1986,
securing one victory is a good place to start for now.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until he arrived in San Diego, packing had come to mean more for
pitcher Andy Ashby than simply preparing for a road trip during the
baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   He had traveled some rather rocky roads that led to brief stops
in Philadelphia and Colorado. Speculation abounded over whether
Ashby might ever unpack his bags for an appreciable time in any one
major-league city.
</P>
<P>
   His talent was solid, but there was one big question about an
intangible that has kept more than a few would-be major-leaguers
from achieving their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitchers, sometimes it's hard to tell when they're going to
mature,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said Wednesday. ``And I think
Ashby is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, you hear how great a guy's arm is, how great
of stuff he has. But he just has trouble getting over the hump and
you don't know if he will or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (former Padres general manager) Randy Smith made a
great deal (in 1993 to get Ashby from Colorado). Then, Ashby comes
over to us and continues to develop. He started pitching with
confidence, and he's just come into his own now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, 31, will be on the mound at the Astrodome today when the
Padres try to take a 2-0 lead over the Astros in their best-of-five
National League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   While the 6-5 righthander is throwing with far more confidence
than earlier in his career, he's coming back from tendinitis in his
left hip that derailed a 1998 season that early on was filled with
victories and potential.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby became the National League's first 16-game winner Aug. 12.
He had earned his first appearance in the All-Star Game at
midseason and was in the midst of what would become his best season
in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   But the tendinitis began to surface over the second half of the
season. And Ashby's last seven starts resulted in a 1-3 record and
7.75 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   The tendinitis, said Bochy, ``was affecting his landing with the
left foot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that was causing him to elevate the ball a little
bit,'' he said. ``He's not the kind of guy to make excuses. He kept
trying to pitch through it. So we finally skipped him a start to
let that clear up. Once that cleared up, he's been pitching the way
he did the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of his first-half performance, Ashby finished
the regular season with career highs of 17 victories, 151
strikeouts, 226 innings pitched, 33 starts and five complete games.
</P>
<P>
   His 3.34 ERA was 11th-best in the National League. The Padres
were 23-10 in Ashby's 33 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was acquired from Colorado as the player to be named in a
July 1993 trade that sent righthanded pitcher Greg W. Harris and
lefthander Bruce Hurst to the Rockies in exchange for catcher Brad
Ausmus and pitcher Doug Boechter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were, at the time of the trade,'' said Bochy, ``making some
moves to unload some salaries and get some prospects, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ash had pitched in the big leagues, so you could consider him
more than a prospect. But with us being a smaller-market club,
(management) was going to let go of some salaries, go for some
prospects, start building. It was a very good move, because (Ashby)
is a good guy to start building a team with, along with Ausmus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus, of course, would eventually wind up in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, meanwhile, dug roots deep into the soil around San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Kevin Brown, who beat the Astros 2-1 Tuesday, Ashby
makes for a Padres one-two punch that gave Astros manager Larry
Dierker cause for concern long before the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said before the series started that the Padres pose a
particular problem for us in the sense that they have righthanded
power pitchers,'' he said. ``And those are the kind of pitchers
that match up best against our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby is optimistic about his turn on the mound today. The
tendinitis apparently is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fine,'' he said. ``I threw on the sideline Monday for
about 20 minutes, and I think the big thing was the last two starts
that I had. Before the last two starts, I hadn't been able to do
any side work. So it was a big plus being able to throw without any
pain at all.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one more bit of pain Ashby would like to overcome. It
is one all of the Padres have felt since 1996, when they advanced
to the playoffs and were swept by St. Louis in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a different attitude this year,'' Ashby said. ``I
think everyone's got a little taste of (playoff experience), and we
know how disappointing it was in '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played three games and went home. I know everyone in this
clubhouse, that's something we don't want to have happen again.''

FEWER L.A. HOMICIDES MEAN MORE TIME TO WORK ON CASES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Los Angeles' homicide rate dropping to a
level not seen since 1970, detectives have lighter caseloads, are
solving more murders and getting more time to crack years-old
cases, police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Bernard Parks said this week that Los Angeles has
logged 307 homicides so far this year, putting the city on a record
pace toward fewer than 400 murders by the year's end, since more
occur in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, there were 1,077 homicides in Los Angeles and
detectives solved, or ``cleared'' in police terms, 60.8 percent of
the cases. By comparison, last year there were 569 homicides, and
the clearance rate was 70.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``With lower caseloads, detectives have more time to work on
cases so they should have a higher clearance rate,'' said Capt. Jim
Tatreau, commanding officer of the LAPD's Robbery-Homicide
Division, which handles many of the most complex and high-profile
homicides. ``We are seeing a higher clearance rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Parks issued a report that attributed the
decline in the rate of serious crimes to a variety of factors,
chiefly: the ``three strikes, you're out'' sentencing law; more
police on the streets; and demographics _ the decline in the number
of young males who, statistically, are most likely to be involved
in crime.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD officials are so encouraged by the trend that they have
ordered police divisions to audit unsolved cases going back five
years and to send promising cases to the Robbery-Homicide Division
for fresh looks.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles still does not have as high a clearance rate as
other major cities.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, which has twice the population and three times as
many officers, had 767 homicides last year with a clearance rate of
88.8 percent, said Lt. Stephen Biegel.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD officials also say that clearance rates must be viewed with
caution because they count all homicides solved in a year,
including crimes committed in previous years, against the number of
homicides committed that year. As a result, some divisions,
including the LAPD's West Valley Division, have had clearance rates
above 100 percent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the actual number of homicides solved can drop even with
higher clearance rates.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, LAPD officials say the drop in homicides this year has
given them a significant chance to spend more time on each case,
allowing for higher success rates in putting killers behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the city is that more apparent than in the South
Bureau, which has traditionally had the largest number of homicides
of any area of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau, which covers an area from the harbor to South
Central Los Angeles, had 428 homicides in 1993 _ nearly half of all
killings in the city _ which meant each detective handled 12 to 20
new cases that year, according to Lt. John Dunkin, who heads the
homicide unit in South Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with 106 homicides so far, detectives are handling
about five cases each, Dunkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The clearance rate in South Bureau has risen from 55
percent in 1993 to 90 percent today, the lieutenant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, one of the significant factors is that detectives
have more time to work their cases, to chase down leads,'' Dunkin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police in the San Fernando Valley are also being freed up to
chase old cases and boost clearance rates.
</P>
<P>
   While some valley divisions are bettering the citywide clearance
rate, North Hollywood and others are not seeing dips in the number
of homicides and thus have had lower clearance rates.
</P>
<P>
   In North Hollywood, the clearance rate is 62 percent this year,
down from 70 percent last year and 94 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The valleywide rate so far this year is 68 percent, while in
1995, the earliest year available, the rate was 81 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Van Nuys Division has a clearance rate of 87 percent this
year _ higher than the citywide rate.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 homicides this year, all but two have been cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the 15 homicides last year in Van Nuys Division
remains unsolved, Fisk said.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Before they were managers, Larry Dierker made his living talking a
good game, and Bruce Bochy could call a good one.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dierker won 139 games during a 14-year major league pitching
career, 13 of those with the Astros. Bochy spent parts of nine
seasons as a catcher with San Diego, Houston and the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker never thought about a return to the playing field as a
manager. Bochy dreamed of the very notion.
</P>
<P>
   Once his playing days were completed, Dierker traded his jersey
and glove for a Hawaiian shirt, a cigar and a spot in the broadcast
booth. Bochy made three different stops as a minor-league manager,
winning three league championships and compiling a .507 winning
percentage in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Both have taken distinctly different routes to big-league
managerial positions, but the results have been similar.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, 52, is 186-138 with two National League Central titles
in two tries. Bochy, 43, is 335-295 in four seasons, guiding the
Padres to NL West crowns in two of the last three. Both are strong
candidates for NL Manager of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the wins and losses, both are also considered
players' coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to be doing something right,'' said San Diego
general manager Kevin Towers, a teammate of Bochy in the Padres'
farm system in 1988. ``It sounds like the players are responding to
(Dierker), as do our players with Bruce. I think to be a manager
these days you have to have the right personality, somebody that
can deal with the players of the 1990s. The game hasn't changed,
but the players have. It has to be somebody that is a good
communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Dierker was the right man for the job. The Astros
shocked the baseball world on Oct. 4, 1996, when they announced
Dierker would replace Terry Collins, who was fired after three
straight second-place finishes. With no previous coaching
experience, Dierker labeled his hiring as ``unconventional, risky
and adventuresome.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew his every decision _ pitching moves, strategies,
lineups, you name it _ would be under close scrutiny from critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we break out of the gate with a 10-game losing streak, I
might be worried about (doubters),'' Dierker said at the time of
the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   While some waited for Dierker to fail, it hasn't happened. Under
Dierker, the Astros have been below .500 for only 43 days during
the last two seasons. This season, the Astros moved into first
place in the NL Central April 29 and never relinquished the spot
for the remaining 135 games. They won a franchise-record 102 games
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because somebody hasn't managed doesn't mean he can't
manage,'' said Bill Virdon, the winningest manager in Astros
history with 544 victories from 1975-82. ``It's not common; there's
no question about that. It's happened. Jerry Coleman did it (going
from the broadcast booth to the dugout), but he wasn't successful
doing it. I think the critics have backed off.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman served as the Padres' manager in 1980, when San Diego
finished last in the NL West at 73-89, before returning to his
broadcasting career.
</P>
<P>
   As Dierker looks back on the last two seasons, he is amazed at
how well things have gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've done pretty well,'' Dierker said. ``I'm not the
most experienced manager. I don't think I'm as good as I can be,
but I think I have helped create an atmosphere that winning is an
expectation and not necessarily a pressure-packed, frenzied
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker's philosophy has remained simple as he has strayed away
from long, drawn-out strategies. He has shown the ability to make
on-the-spot decisions, but for the most part he has assumed a
no-nonsense, laid-back approach to managing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the big impact he's had. He's let his older
players and every-day guys go out and do their jobs and didn't
really mess around with them,'' second baseman Craig Biggio said.
``At certain times he's going to intervene and do what he has to do
as a manger and make certain moves, but for the most part he leaves
us alone to do our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker still remains pitching-oriented. He holds five franchise
pitching records, and his 137 wins with the Astros are second only
to Joe Niekro's 144. When he hired his assistants, Dierker included
former hurler Vern Ruhle to head the pitching staff. Together,
despite losing 60 percent of the rotation from a year ago, they
have molded a 1998 staff that is second only to the Atlanta Braves
in ERA (3.50) and fewest runs allowed (620).
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives us a chance to work out of jams that a lot other
managers might not give us a chance to work out of,'' lefthander
Mike Hampton said. ``I think it only makes us better. If we get
into some tight situations, we don't have to be looking over our
shoulder for some help.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochy's ascension up the managerial ladder hasn't been as much
of a fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy began his playing career with the Astros in 1978 and spent
three seasons in Houston. He played one season for the Mets before
spending his final five seasons with the Padres. In his first
managerial position, Bochy won the Northwest League (Class A)
championship in 1989. He won two more titles during the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   He also served as San Diego's third-base coach from 1993-94
before being named the 15th manager in team history the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I always wanted to manage,'' Bochy said. ``As a
catcher, you sit and watch a lot of games. I knew when I was
getting toward the end (of my playing career) this is what I wanted
to do. When I went down to the minor leagues, I fell in love with
managing, worked my way through the minor leagues and got a great
opportunity. It couldn't have come at a better time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochy replaced Jim Riggleman and in his first season went 70-74
in 1995, the best record for a first-year Padres manager since his
mentor, Jack McKeon (67-48), in 1988. In 1996, Bochy was named NL
Manager of the Year after guiding the Padres to their first
postseason berth since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In just four seasons, Bochy is three wins shy of becoming the
winningest manager in Padres history.
</P>
<P>
   And as is the case with Dierker, Bochy's success begins in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a terrific personality,'' Towers said. ``He has some
great one-liners to keep the guys loose. He's not afraid to kick
them in the rear end when they need to be jump-started sometimes.
He just has a great demeanor. He certainly knows the game. I think
he's one of the best in the game, but I'm biased since I'm with
him. I wouldn't want to say he's underrated, but I think he used to
be. People are starting to realize how good he really is.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ They came tumbling out of the B train at 161st and
River, just as they have for generations, tawk-ing like diss and
singing the same reverberating verse over and over again: ``Let's
go, Yankees let's go, Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   They sang it loud, long and slow, as they have for generations,
enough to get the Yankees party rolling and more than enough to get
under the skin of anyone else. It's a Yankees tradition.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, tradition means something. They expect the
remarkable and the perfect. Ruth and Gehrig. Mickey and Reggie.
</P>
<P>
   They want the unforgettable and the incomprehensible. They got
Shane Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday's memorable night at Yankee Stadium, the most
remarkable thing about these record-setting 1998 Yankees was that
their historic 114-win season came with everything but someone who
could capture the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Who cared if the guy would prove to be the real thing or not? Or
last even one day into next season? Yankees fans always reserve the
right to tear down a hero anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But this Yankees team and this season needed a budding hero, a
captivating figure, and got one in the 26-year-old Spencer, who
once was introduced to Mickey Mantle and swore he saw ``a glow
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Top to bottom, the Yanks' roster was one of very good players
having great seasons and making for a truly great year. Without
Spencer, the Yankees likely still would win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   How many teams can put such formidable sticks out there every
night as those belonging to Bernie Williams, Tino Martinez, Paul
O'Neill, Chuck Knoblauch, Derek Jeter and Scott Brosius?
</P>
<P>
   The word depth came to mind when talking about this great team.
But with Spencer, this team might now win it the traditional
Yankees way. Now, the name Shane is right there, staring at the
world with that freckled face.
</P>
<P>
   Into the Bronx jungle strode Spencer, a big, wide-eyed kid from
the Florida Keys, yessir-ing his way along, holding the keys to
57,360 hearts, and on the verge of becoming the latest
too-remarkable Yankees phenom to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in Yankee Stadium, I feel it,'' Spencer said of the
aura, expectations and demands of the tradition. ``It's always a
feeling of wow out there. There's a buzz in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was all his Wednesday night. And by the time Yankees
3, Rangers 1 was done, the final ingredient to this great team _
the nearly mythical hero _ was earning the ultimate honor from the
Yankees' fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane Spencer,'' they chanted as Spencer stepped to the plate
in his final at-bat. They continued the chant into the night and on
their way back onto the B train, marveling at the thick-legged kid
with a powerful swing who might just make October his.
</P>
<P>
   Already, September is going to be hard to top.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Spencer rocketed the towering center-field home run
that opened the scoring in the second inning, he already had been
drawing wild, mythical comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   It was two years ago when the general manager of Spencer's
minor-league team invited Mantle to meet the new kid, reportedly
saying, ``He's really got a chance to make it, Mick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in awe of meeting him,'' Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the September call-up, a move Yanks skipper Joe
Torre made because the division pennant already was secured and
Torre was looking to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we wanted to do was just take a look at him,'' Torre said.
``But what he did was pretty remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer walked among the greats, hammering eight home runs in
the month, knocking in 21 runs and batting .421. Three of his home
runs were grand slams, breaking the Yankees rookie record of two
set by Yogi Berra.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me 17 years to hit three grand slams,'' Torre said.
``This guy gets three in a couple of weeks. Amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre had no choice but to give the rookie a postseason start.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the heroic, mythical nature of it all when
Spencer stepped to the plate for the first time in the playoffs. He
took two strikes and shrugged, stepping out to take a few practice
swings. He then worked the count to 2-2 against Rangers 20-game
winner Rick Helling. He then hammered the next pitch to the deepest
part of the park.
</P>
<P>
   As the ball left his bat, Spencer's mouth dropped open as if to
say, ``Ohmigosh.'' He skipped down the line clenching one fist in
the air. And the booming shot landed in Monument Park behind the
center-field wall, literally bouncing off the plaque that honors
Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Too remarkable to believe. But it's what these Yankees fans
demanded. It was tradition.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
With the arrival of Randy Johnson, the title of ``ace'' _ and the
heavy burden it carries _ was lifted off the right shoulder of
Shane Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody forgot to tell Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Since the July 31 trade that brought Johnson to the Astros,
Reynolds is 7-1 with a 3.24 earned run average. The Astros won nine
of his final 11 starts over the last two months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought it was good to pick the ace after the season
was over,'' said Reynolds, the Astros' starting pitcher today for
Game 2 of the National League Division Series against San Diego at
the Astrodome. ``He's the guy that you always look forward to
getting out there after a losing streak, the guy that maybe pitched
the most innings not so much had the most wins but pitched the
clutch games. That would be your ace.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Reynolds stacks up with some of the NL's No. 1
starters _ minusthe fanfare and headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Only one pitcher, Atlanta righthander Tom Glavine, won more
games than Reynolds, whose career-high 19 victories tied Chicago's
Kevin Tapani for second in the league. Reynolds' 209 strikeouts
ranked fourth, and his 233 innings pitched tied teammate Jose Lima
for sixth overall. Reynolds made 35 starts, tying for the league
high.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere, though, is Reynolds mentioned among NL Cy Young Award
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being here, especially when Randy came over, he's gotten
overshadowed,'' said lefthander Mike Hampton, a teammate of
Reynolds for the past five seasons. ``Then you have the Kevin
Browns and the Braves' staff. He's one of the top pitchers in the
league and in the game, as far as I'm concerned. I've played with
him for five years now, and he keeps getting better and keeps
improving on his pitches and location. Eventually, he has a great
chance to win 20 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds had a shot at becoming just the fifth Astros pitcher _
and the first since Mike Scott in 1989 _ to reach the 20-win
plateau in his last start Sept. 26 vs. the Chicago Cubs. He allowed
one run and struck out 11 in seven innings but received a
no-decision in the Astros' 3-2 loss. It was the first time the
Astros lost in one of Reynolds' starts since Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   With the Astros lacking a clear-cut No. 1 starter out of spring
training after the departure of free agent Darryl Kile, the burden
fell on Reynolds. Still trying to find consistency and control,
Reynolds struggled to a 1-2 record the first month. He won eight of
his next 11 decisions, including five straight from June 23 to July
14.
</P>
<P>
   How much of a boost was Johnson to the starting rotation?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we had that leader-type ace that we needed,''
said Reynolds, 30. ``He's a classic ace, a No. 1 guy that I think
we really needed and I think the statistics and stuff shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, hampered last season by injuries to his right knee
that required surgery, enters the playoffs with a 2-0 record and
2.53 ERA over the season's final month, a span in which he didn't
give up more than two earned runs in his last four outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people that play in Houston don't get much credit for
things that they do,'' first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``I think
if you ask anybody around the league, they know Shane is a pretty
solid pitcher. That's all that matters to the pitchers, that your
peers respect your game. I think everybody respects the way Shane
Reynolds goes about pitching and winning ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the defining moments for Reynolds this season came in a
four-hit shutout of the Minnesota Twins. The night before the game,
Reynolds got a case of food poisoning that sent him to the hospital
and left his status for the game in doubt until two hours before
the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a gamer; he's out there to win,'' Bagwell said. ``Every
year, he puts up great win-loss totals. Basically, he goes out and
wins. You can't ask for anything more from a pitcher, as a player,
than from a guy that goes out, keeps you in the game and wins. What
else would you want?''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds finds himself in a familiar spot today _ down in the
playoffs with the Astros' hopes riding on his performance. Last
year against Atlanta, Reynolds pitched six strong innings, allowing
only two runs, but picked up the loss that eliminated the Astros
from the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to make his second playoff start more memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good. Everything feels good. The last start, I
thought I threw very well,'' Reynolds said. ``The postseason is
totally different. There's more out there. Not to say that the
regular season isn't a have-to-win situation, but you play 162
games. Here, you have a five-game series and whoever wins first,
the others have to go home. It's a different scenario and different
situation.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Diego's Greg Vaughn may appear on the surface to be the sort
of villain Astros fans can love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   He mashed an eighth-inning home run in Game 1 of the San
Diego-Houston National League Division Series on Tuesday, a shot
that ended up being the difference in the Padres' 2-1 victory. Six
of Vaughn's eight hits against the Astros during the regular season
were home runs. With his 50 homers and 119 RBIs this year, he would
have been a cinch to be named Most Valuable Player of his team if
not for the outrageous year closer Trevor Hoffman had.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how much Astros backers may root against Vaughn,
it won't faze him. Not in the least. Padres fans, after all, sank
their teeth into him with far more disdain in the past than any
outsider could now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it got bad; it got real bad,'' Vaughn said Wednesday of
the treatment he received from San Diegans last season. ``But it
really doesn't matter. I really didn't care. It doesn't make a
difference if the guy behind the screen is screaming at me. He
doesn't have a big influence in my life. He has none. So I really
don't worry about that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easy to say now. Vaughn had a huge season, and the cheers
returned for him. Now, he's at least partly responsible for the
Padres' 1-0 lead in the series.
</P>
<P>
   For Vaughn, getting the chance to contribute in the postseason
is even more exhilarating because of what he went through in his
first full season with the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   He was acquired from Milwaukee in a trade on July 31, 1996. The
Padres went on to the playoffs that season, getting swept by St.
Louis. Vaughn got only three at-bats in that series as a pinch
hitter. That officially ended whatever honeymoon Vaughn may have
had with the fans in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was pure misery. He labored through a season in which
fans were unrelenting in their displeasure with his .216 batting
average and his 110 strikeouts, which far outnumbered his hits
(78). He was booed any time he failed to supply the pop for which
he was acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the low points came when he booted not one but two fly
balls into inside-the-park home runs.
</P>
<P>
   In Vaughn's defense, he was splitting time with Rickey Henderson
in left field, which didn't make things any easier for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a chance to play every day,'' Vaughn said. ``That
was it. All I asked was to get a chance to play every day. I would
play Monday and Friday and pinch hit. That was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got a chance to go at it every day. You can make a lot
of adjustments when you're out there every day. But there was
myself and Rickey Henderson. We had too many players for one
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Vaughn tried to stay as upbeat as possible. And
now, after a monstrous comeback season, Vaughn has regained his
confidence and the fans' faith. He also has made management look
good for the trade that brought him to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gets down to him being out there every day,'' Padres
manager Bruce Bochy said. ``It was a difficult situation the last
year and a half when he was here, because Rickey was here and we
had two or three other major-league players who were used to being
out there every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with that, though, I think he came into spring training
very determined. He came there in great shape. He had a personal
trainer, and it was obvious he put in a lot of work. He was
determined to show what kind of player he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handled it very well. It was a tough situation; sure, there
were some fans who got down on Greg Vaughn. But in reality, it
takes someone to be mentally tough through that. And he was. It
takes a tough skin to get through what he did last year and to come
back and do what he's done for us. And I can't say enough about
what he's done and the way he's done it. I'd hate to think where
we'd be without him. And it says a lot about Greg Vaughn. He
handled the whole thing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Vaughn would be justified to view this season and this
playoff appearance as redemption, he doesn't necessarily look at it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not out here to redeem myself,'' he said. ``I don't feel I
have to apologize for anything that happened. My numbers have
always spoken for themselves before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big to come back and have the chance to play. That's all
I've ever asked for. The whole bottom line is that everything
doesn't work out the way you want it to all the time. But if it
works out for the team, that's all that matters. It's a team game.
Of course everybody wants to hit .360 and hit 50 or 60 home runs
and 120 RBIs. But it doesn't always work out that way. You just do
whatever you can to help your team win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers came back. And that's how I approached it. If I
don't do anything one day, I'm still going to be playing the next
day. That makes all the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's home run off Randy Johnson on Tuesday was a majestic
shot that easily cleared the left-field wall. It was one of three
hits in four at-bats Vaughn had against Johnson. But it wasn't
because Johnson didn't have good stuff, Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always tough,'' Vaughn said of Johnson. ``It always looks
easy when you're not standing up there. He's throwing 97 miles an
hour with the slider breaking down and in on you. I didn't even get
a swing in my first at-bat. I just carried the bat back with me to
the dugout. I didn't want that to happen the rest of the day. I
just told myself to take a swing.''
</P>
<P>
   When he did, good things happened. But that has been the rule
this season for Vaughn, as he established career bests for average
(.272), hits (156), runs (112), slugging percentage (.597), RBIs
and homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sweet because we won the first game of the series,''
Vaughn said of his home run. ``But that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the series shifts to San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium after
Game 2 today at the Astrodome, Vaughn will return home as a beloved
Padre instead of the one who used to get all of the fans' angry
barbs.

RANGERS NEAR ELIMINATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once upon a time ...
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers hit balls hard, scored runs often and instilled
consternation in those who stepped on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' rotation might not inspire fairy tales by the
Brothers Grimm, but another of its members _ this time left-hander
Andy Pettitte _ produced another grim evening for the Rangers in
this best-of-five American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte surrendered one run on three hits through seven
innings, pitching New York to a 3-1 victory in Game 2 last night at
Yankee Stadium. The victory gave the Yankees a 2-0 lead in this
series and placed the Rangers on the brink of elimination with Game
3 scheduled tomorrow night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the two most potent offensive teams in the American
League, and we've scored six runs in two ballgames,'' said Rangers
manager Johnny Oates, whose lineup produced only one of those runs.
``I don't think we've swung the bats very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Home runs from rookie Shane Spencer and Scott Brosius provided
all the Yankees' offense, and it was all they needed. Pettitte
retired the first 12 batters the Rangers sent to the plate en route
to his 94-pitch, nine-strikeout performance.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte's counterpart, right-hander Rick Helling, provided the
Rangers a quality start in his first postseason appearance, but the
20-game winner fell victim to a lack of run support. Right-hander
Todd Stottlemyre suffered a similar fate during Tuesday's 2-0 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers collected 10 hits and drew only one walk throughout
their 18-inning stay in New York and departed without a victory
despite surrendering five runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have told you that you're crazy,'' Helling said of the
odds on that happening.
</P>
<P>
   Helling recorded nine strikeouts and issued only one walk during
his 119-pitch, six-inning appearance, but Brosius' fourth-inning
home run would be more than the Rangers' gone-fishing lineup could
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we're not worried about,'' Helling said.
``Our bats have been there all year, and I'm sure they'll be there
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow?
</P>
<P>
   February?
</P>
<P>
   Brosius' two-run drive scored Spencer, who reached on a one-out
single, and gave the Yankees what proved to be an insurmountable,
three-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Helling retired three of the first five Yankees batters on
strikes during the first two innings, but his two-out, 2-2 fastball
to Spencer caught too much of the plate. Spencer, the rookie cult
hero whose eight home runs and 21 runs batted in during September
led the Yankees, deposited the pitch above and beyond the 399-foot
sign in left-center field and produced the game's first run.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's tale did produce two happily-ever-after moments for
the Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   Their lineup advanced a runner beyond second base after 13 1/3
innings of this series. Right fielder Juan Gonzalez led off the
fifth inning with a double and advanced 90 feet on a deep fly ball
off the bat of first baseman Will Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers actually scored when Gonzalez crossed the plate with
their lone run in this series on catcher Ivan Rodriguez's single to
left field later in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Explanations?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flat-out plain and simple: Pitching,'' Clark said. ``Good
pitching beats good hitting most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, though, will hit again, said the first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done it all year long,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers better or this story will conclude like this: The
End.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council on Wednesday scheduled an
emergency meeting for Thursday to condemn the massacres of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo that witnesses attributed to Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, meanwhile, completed planning for possible air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be no impunity for such an act of ethnic hatred,''
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain said at a news conference
in Blackpool, England, where he was attending a conference of his
Labor Party. ``This was not an act of war. This was plain, cold
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain, which takes over the rotating presidency of the
Security Council on Thursday, called for the urgent special
session, which the United States backed.
</P>
<P>
   The Council, which last week demanded an immediate end to
attacks on civilians by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army, is
expected to condemn President Slobodan Milosevic's forces in even
stronger terms than it did then, although the Council, with no
troops at its disposal, remains divided on what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO, however, Britain's defense secretary, George Robertson,
told reporters that the organization was proposing sharply targeted
military strikes on Serbian forces, not random bombing, which would
endanger civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Some NATO officials say military action could begin as soon as
next week, after Secretary-General Kofi Annan reports to the
Security Council on Yugoslav compliance with its demands. It is far
from clear that this link is essential, since the United States has
already stated that NATO has the authority now to strike the
Yugoslav forces attacking civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But any ultimate action would depend on support from the Clinton
administration. A spokesman for the State Department, James Foley,
said Wednesday, ``Military action is a live and real prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is uncertain whether the administration, preoccupied by
the Lewinsky scandal and facing November elections, will determine
to strike at the Serbs. And even if it does, Milosevic appears so
defiant of world opinion that he might be willing to withstand an
air strike in order to crush the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, top foreign policy officials, including Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen and
the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, plan to visit Capitol
Hill to brief senators on events in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's Security Council resolution was passed under a
provision of the U.N. charter that makes it enforceable by military
means. But there is dissent on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and France are very reluctant to condone the use of force
against Yugoslavia at this stage, and would argue that further
Security Council action is needed before it can be seen to be
condoning NATO action. In the Security Council, China could not
even be persuaded last week to join the warning to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations Wednesday, diplomats and officials reacted
with shock not only to the horrific killings of civilians _ women,
children and elderly men shot through the head, mutilated or burned
to death in their homes _ but also to the audacity that Milosevic
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats have watched the Yugoslav leader flout world opinion
before through years of fighting in the Balkans, but not as boldly
as he has in recent weeks, as he continues his ruthless suppression
of the ethnic Albanians, a majority in the province where an ethnic
Albanian rebel force, the Kosovo Liberation Army, has been battling
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   That rebellion, Annan said Wednesday, ``can never justify the
pattern of terror, including the burning of houses, looting,
killing of livestock and wanton killing that have been reported in
these last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Such actions are totally unacceptable to the international
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was described as ``outraged'' by the descriptions of the
massacres published Wednesday since he had met only on Tuesday with
Yugoslavia's foreign minister and delivered a sharp message to him
after hearing reports of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reports are particularly shocking to the secretary-general
in light of denials received from the foreign minister that such
actions were taking place,'' said Fred Eckhard, the
secretary-general's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International said Wednesday that the massacres in
Kosovo underline the urgent need for human rights monitors in the
area. Last week, the Security Council made that one of its demands.
The European Union and other organizations have volunteered to
monitor Kosovo, but have been rebuffed by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Cook, the foreign secretary, said he had been in
touch with the War Crimes Tribunal for the Balkans in The Hague,
Netherlands, and had asked its prosecutor, Louise Arbour of Canada,
to investigate the massacres in recent days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cook also called a meeting in London on Friday of senior
officials from nations that call themselves the contact group on
the former Yugoslavia _ Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Russia and
the United States _ to discuss how to settle the problem
peacefully. In Washington, Albright spoke with her British
counterpart by telephone several times Wednesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Solana, NATO's secretary-general, did not rule out the
use of force under the existing Security Council resolution. On a
visit to Azerbaijan, Solana said NATO's reaction would be
determined by ``what happens on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of Milosevic should be judged by his deeds, not
by his words,'' he said. ``Too many words have not been complied
with by Milosevic.''

BRUINS CAN THANK LOSS IN PULLMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the UCLA football team, it was an excruciating
experience. A lead blown. A prime opportunity wasted. A game lost.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't even Labor Day yet.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, as the Bruins prepare to face Washington State at the
Rose Bowl on Saturday, they can't look back on last year's opener
in Pullman, Wash., without a sense of anguish.
</P>
<P>
   But mixed in there is another sentiment, one which emerged only
with time: the realization that UCLA's prowess of late _ a
school-record win streak of 12 games _ is unmistakably rooted in
that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no fun falling off a bike when you're learning how to
ride it,'' offensive guard Andy Meyers said this week. ``Your dad
pushes you downhill and all of a sudden you fall into a planter.
That's not fun. But it's fun once you learn how to ride it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins careened through a series of spectacular crack-ups on
that late-August day.
</P>
<P>
   The most vivid memory has running back Skip Hicks ``chillin'''
on the sideline at the finish because he was tired and lost track
of the down, coach Bob Toledo failing to call a timeout because he
didn't want to give Washington State opportunity for a comeback,
and redshirt freshman Jermaine Lewis squirming toward the wrong
hole on fourth-and-goal from the 1 and getting knocked to Palouse
Falls.
</P>
<P>
   But to dwell on that single incident is to wear blinders. In the
37-34 loss, UCLA was also penalized 10 times, had a pooch punt
blocked, lost a fumble on a bungled snap and gave up two Ryan Leaf
touchdown bombs over the top of the defense. In all, a thorough _
and thoroughly distressing _ defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In football, it's not unusual for such an outcome to send the
two participants spinning crazily in opposite directions. However,
a bizarre occurrence resulted from this one. Washington State and
UCLA followed roughly the same trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars set off toward their first Rose Bowl appearance in
67 years. ``It just kind of became the rallying point for the rest
of the year,'' coach Mike Price said of the stirring victory over
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   And the Bruins, after suffering an equally devastating loss at
home to No.3 Tennessee the next week, went to school on the two
defeats and promptly embarked on a mission of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo can be chiefly credited with the salvage operation. He
kept his cool, apparently, and resisted the temptation to turn game
plans and lineups upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was a turning point,'' said center Shawn Stuart. ``It
was for us to say, `We made crucial mistakes and we didn't play to
the level that was expected of us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember after that game, coach Toledo turned on the film;
it was the special-teams film. And he said, `This is not a great
effort. This is not a great effort. This is not a great effort.' It
wasn't something he was mad at. It was more, like, `This is what we
need to do.' He used it as a teaching tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo also headed off internal discord before it could
germinate, a common condition when breakdowns have been so
widespread. ``All of a sudden,'' the coach said, ``It's, `I confess
... the other guy did it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers nodded knowingly. ``There was an intrinsic thing that
happened on this team. A coming together,'' the senior lineman
said. ``We could have said, `Hey, (forget) the defense. If you
can't hold them to less than 34, we can't win.' Or the defense
could have said, `Hey, you guys let us down through the whole
second quarter. You stuttered and fumbled and flopped around.' Or
we could say, `Our special teams stink. We had a punt blocked.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing more on our team could have gone wrong that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Toledo: ``I think one of the worst things that happens to a
football team is people finger-point.... That's the one thing I
didn't allow.''
</P>
<P>
   But the team-wide emphasis on sharper concentration,
more-diligent effort and keener practice habits did not sink in
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Players tell of the third week of the season, before a trip to
Texas, when a practice session was particularly lethargic. Toledo,
in barely contained disgust, stopped practice, called the players
together and said, ``Forget it. We're done. Go inside.''
</P>
<P>
   A players' meeting was shortly convened. Finger-pointing? Well,
not technically. ``We did call certain individuals up to a higher
standard,'' Meyers said. ``They were definitely encouraged to pick
it up or get out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have since drawn on the unpleasant Washington State
experience to pull them out of trouble in other games, notably a
come-from-behind win last year at Oregon. ``The kids talked about
it all the time: Remember Washington State,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   The unpleasant memory has also curbed any inclination toward
overconfidence against opponents perceived as inferior _ which, uh,
could come into play this week against a Washington State team that
lost to Cal last week and appears headed back to its customary
positioning in the Pacific-10's second division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a slap in the face,'' said Lewis, the former
Antelope Valley High back who has spent an entire week of
interviews revisiting last year's game. ``It could have been the
best thing that ever happened to the program. Sort of like a wakeup
call.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 12 games that followed the fateful first two weekends of
'97, UCLA, indeed, hasn't nodded off once.

NEXT MANAGER HAS WORK CUT OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's no truth to the rumor Glenn Hoffman was
sent to the Los Angeles Dodgers in June from Central Casting
because Kurt Russell wasn't available. The Dodgers, in need of
somebody to fill out the lineup card and spout cliches and act like
a big-league manager for just a few months, looked to Albuquerque,
not Hollywood, to fill the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Summoned from the franchise's Triple-A team to play the role of
consummate company man, Hoffman delivered a creditable performance.
He didn't botch any of his lines. Indeed, he played it straight
even when everyone around him seemed bent on turning the 1998
season into a farce.
</P>
<P>
   The former major-league shortstop deserved better than to be
hired in late June so he could be fired on the penultimate day of
September. But then, coaches Mark Cresse, Mike Scioscia, Manny
Mota, Joe Amalfitano, Charlie Hough, Mickey Hatcher, John Shelby
and Glenn Gregson also merited more than being treated like two-bit
extras in this ``Waterworld'' of a season.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman was relieved of his managerial duties Tuesday, after
being given all of 98 days to prove himself. That's called a
probationary period in the real world. Most bosses would have been
hard-pressed to quibble over Hoffman's results; the Dodgers went
47-41 under his direction to finish four games above the mediocrity
line at 83-79.
</P>
<P>
   But it says here his performance was largely beside the point.
Hoffman was hired to be a stand-in for his big-name successor. He
wasn't meant to be anything more than a warm body to occupy the hot
seat until the season ended and bigger names such as Felipe Alou
and Kevin Kennedy and Davey Johnson became available for the
pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been intriguing to see what the Dodgers would have
done had the team somehow rallied behind Hoffman and wrested the
wild-card berth from the Chicago Cubs. His reassignment would have
been considerably messier then, but we suspect no less unavoidable.
You don't, after all, hold on to Russell when a Will Smith or a
Leonardo DiCaprio or a Matt Damon is at your disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his nine-year playing stint in the majors,
Hoffman readily accepted his role as a backup. In signing on to
replace the deposed Bill Russell at midseason, the 40-year-old
Hoffman was being similarly pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got someone who would toe the party line in Hoffman,
and Hoffman got a ticket out of the minor leagues. He has been
offered a position on the new coaching staff, which is not a bad
place for someone who came to the majors with only two years of
managerial experience at the Triple-A level.
</P>
<P>
   So pity not Hoffman. Save your sympathy for his successor.
Regardless of who it is _ Montreal's Alou, former Boston and Texas
skipper Kennedy or ex-Orioles/Reds manager Johnson _ the task
facing him will be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers that Hoffman babysat were last in the league in
on-base percentage and finished well out of the top 10 in fielding
percentage, hitting, runs scored, slugging percentage, total bases
and walks.
</P>
<P>
   If you're general manager Kevin Malone, your first impulse is to
call the studios and see if the Cincinnati suburb of Washington
Court House can be re-created on a soundstage somewhere, the better
to make closer Jeff Shaw and his family feel at home in SoCal.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five of Shaw's 48 saves this season came after he was
traded to the Dodgers from the Reds. Because he had a multiyear
contract, Shaw can demand a trade. He isn't enamored of L.A., but
the Dodgers desperately need him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The simple act of keeping the Dodgers' core players will cost
roughly $75 million, which surpasses by $5 million the payroll of
Baltimore, the winner this year of the bulging bankroll and not
much else. And even at that, the Dodgers won't have a leader in the
bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla? Puhleeze. He could have been a stabilizing
influence in the roiling seas but instead was the first to cast
about for excuses.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield? Agreeing to move to left field would be a start.

   Raul Mondesi? A leader trapped in the body of a party animal.

   The bottom line is, players have come and gone for a decade now
and the Dodgers haven't done diddly. Enough already with the
improvisational players. Malone's mandate is to assemble a
collaborative cast that's in it for the long haul and the curtain
calls.

BOTTOM OF ORDER DELIVERS ONCE MORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In taking a 2-0 lead in their division series with
the Texas Rangers, the New York Yankees seem to be using two
different batting orders: their top six are hitting only .125 (5
for 40) while the bottom three, notably Scott Brosius and the
rookie Shane Spencer, have a .529 average (9 for 17) with two
homers, all five runs batted in and all six runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a short series,'' said Chris Chambliss, the Yankees'
batting coach, ``you don't know who the heroes are going to be.
Sometimes the opposing pitcher is concentrating on the top of the
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Yankees, that can be a dangerous mistake. Brosius,
whose two-run homer provided the margin in Wednesday night's 3-1
victory over the Rangers, has two singles as well as his homer in
six at-bats. He batted eighth on Wednesday night, after batting
ninth in Tuesday's opener when he had a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   In Spencer's post-season debut on Wednesday night as the No. 7
hitter, the rookie left fielder had a homer in his first at-bat and
a single, and scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of two pitches,'' Brosius said, alluding
to the homers he and Spencer hit off Rick Helling, a 20-game
winner. ``We know we have a balanced lineup. Sometimes it's the top
of the order, sometimes the middle, sometimes the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the Yankee batters worked deep into the count
against Helling, especially in the early innings, Spencer's single
and Brosius's homer in the fourth inning occurred back to back on
Helling's first pitch to each batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tries to get Strike 1 on you,'' Brosius said. ``He's going
to throw a lot of fastballs. Sometimes that first pitch is the best
one you'll get.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the first four innings, the Yankee batters' patience forced
Helling to throw 91 pitches, including 33 in the second inning. In
those four innings, the Yankee batters fouled off 28 pitches.
Before Derek Jeter struck out in the third, he fouled off 8 of 12
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helling's got a good fastball and when he gets it up in the
zone, you get a lot of foul balls,'' Chambliss said.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, whose .374 average with runners in scoring position led
the American League, has now driven in 101 runs, including 98
during the regular season. ``Scott shortens his stride and puts the
bat on the ball,'' Chambliss said. ``He's the big reason there's no
rest through the bottom of the order.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, who doubled in each game, admired Spencer's
production. ``It's fun to see,'' he said. ``Especially somebody
who's paid his dues in the minor leagues. You need stories like
this in baseball. At this time of year, it doesn't matter how you
win or who does it.'' &QL;

Taylor plots waiver strategy &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ The Kings and the NHL's 26 other teams will submit
lists to the league today of the 18 skaters and two goalies they
plan to protect in Monday's waiver draft.
</P>
<P>
   Kings general manager Dave Taylor said Wednesday night he'd just
about settled on his protected list, which he would not reveal. The
league will release the lists Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we weren't vulnerable,'' Taylor said. ``This year,
we're vulnerable. We'll have five or six players exposed. It just
means we're getting a little older and have a little more depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, player movement in the waiver draft has been
minimal. Last year, the Kings neither lost nor added players in the
waiver draft. The Kings will choose 17th Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the most difficult decision he faced in compiling
the list was whether or not to protect rookie defenseman Mark
Visheau, who has been a pleasant surprise in training camp but is
sidelined indefinitely with a dislocated left thumb.
</P>
<P>
   __ Talking but no action: The update is that there is no update
on unsigned defenseman Aki Berg, who is playing in Finland while
his agent and Taylor try to work out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he spoke Tuesday to agent Larry Kelly, who is
vacationing in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of progress to report, other than that both
sides reiterated their positions,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly earlier had said there was a clause in Berg's contract in
Finland that would prevent him from signing with the Kings after
Sept. 30, but Taylor said Kelly made no mention of the clause
during their conversation and negotiations will proceed up until
the start of the NHL season on Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   If Berg is not signed by then, he won't be because once the
regular season starts, he would have to clear waivers before
rejoining the Kings, and it is almost a certainty that he would be
claimed by another team.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have been granted an exclusion for Berg in the waiver
draft, meaning they don't have to protect him. However, if he signs
after the draft but before the season starts, the Kings would have
to waive one of the 18 skaters they plan to protect in the waiver
draft.
</P>
<P>
   __ Exhibition game: The Kings held a 3-2 lead Wednesday night
with 10 minutes remaining in their exhibition game against the
holdout-depleted Sharks at the San Jose Arena. Rookie Josh Green
had one goal and Glen Murray the other two for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Matteau and Bob Rouse had scored San Jose's goals in
the third period. Kings goalie Jamie Storr, in his first exhibition
appearance, had faced only eight shots in the game's first two
periods.

RANGERS' BATS FALL SILENT FOR HELLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Only a few folks outside of Texas and his hometown of
Fargo, N.D., could have matched Rick Helling's round face with his
feat this season. The Rangers' uncelebrated 20-game winner did not
have to be as dominant as Toronto's Roger Clemens or as fine as
Atlanta's Tom Glavine or even as dramatic as the Yankees' David
Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Helling joined the 20-victory club despite his 4.41 earned run
average for a reason: He always had the Rangers' offense there as a
safety net when his stuff went slightly awry. But as Todd
Stottlemyre discovered in Game 1 of the division series against the
Yankees, and as Helling found out in Game 2 on Wednesday night, a
fine performance is not enough when the glamorous bats of the
Rangers fail to hold up their end of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   What was true in the Yankees' 2-0 shutout of the Rangers in Game
1 on Tuesday night was also evident in the 3-1 loss Texas took in
Game 2. The Rangers' celebrity lineup _ including Juan Gonzalez,
Will Clark and Ivan Rodriguez _ has been put under hypnosis by the
Yankees' pitching staff, first David Wells and on Wednesday night
Andy Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone would have said to me, this staff would give up
five runs in two games to the Yankees and still not have a win, I
would have said they were crazy,'' said Helling, who gave up three
runs, eight hits and struck out nine in six innings. ``I felt that,
like Todd, I pitched good enough to win on a normal night.''
</P>
<P>
   On a normal night, Gonzalez, Rodriguez and Clark would not go a
combined 1 for 11. In Games 1 and 2, that threesome has hit just 3
for 23. The Rangers' silence on offense has let the pitching staff
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've swung the bats very well,'' Manager Johnny
Oates said. ``We've got our backs to the wall. This year, we have
hit better in our own park. Hopefully we can get our bats going
against David Cone, but that's no walk in the park, either.'' Cone
will start for the Yankees against the Rangers' Aaron Sele on
Friday night at the Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Helling was not exactly going for a stroll around Yankee
Stadium. He worked and worked hard against the imposing Yankees
standing before him. They found a sweet spot on just enough of
Helling's pitches early on. This has been the rap on Helling: get
him before he settles in. After the seventh inning, he allowed
opposing batters to hit just .200 during the regular season. So the
Yankees seized their opportunity, starting in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Although Derek Jeter was one of many to foul off repeated
fastballs by Helling _ a fact that sent his pitch count to 91
before the fourth inning was over _ it was the bottom of the order
that hurt the Rangers' starter the most.
</P>
<P>
   It was the home run-happy Shane Spencer, who unleashed a homer
in the second inning to give the Yankees a 1-0 lead. In the fourth,
Spencer led off with a single and scored when the Yankees' No. 8
batter, Scott Brosius, hit a home run. Helling eventually found a
groove and set down six out of seven batters in the fifth and sixth
innings before leaving the game, but his pitch count was at 119,
and it was time to give way to a good relief effort from Tim
Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was throwing strikes and staying aggressive,'' Helling said.
``I was ready for them. I didn't let the crowd get to me.''
</P>
<P>
   This was his first playoff experience at Yankee Stadium, an
unreal moment for a kid who grew up in the hometown of Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   This was also his chance to stand in the national spotlight and
let everyone know that he was one of just four pitchers to hit the
20-victory magic number this year. Helling did his part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made two mistakes, and they hit two home runs,'' Helling
said. ``I'm not sure that Pettitte made any mistakes. I was out
there, still being aggressive, wanting to keep us in it until we
scored some runs. Usually, that's not something we've had to worry
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the end, with one out and a runner in scoring position,
the offense dissolved beneath the Yankee Stadium lights. Gonzalez
bounced out to third, and Clark struck out to end the game. This is
not what many, including the pitching staff, had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried,'' said Gonzalez, who came up with his first and only
hit of the series in the fifth, when he kicked loose a tag at
second for a double. ``I'm only human. I'm trying hard for my team.
It's hard. Our pitching's been good. It's just their pitching has
been impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling did not achieve 20 victories with the Rangers' failing
him at the plate. Before the season began, no one would have placed
Helling in the middle of the mayhem at Yankee Stadium last night.
He was a stubborn pitcher in love with the high fastball. For
several years he bounced up and down, from the minors to majors. As
he entered spring training, he was slated as the Rangers' No. 6
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be the first to tell you that if someone had told me I'd
be 20-7 at the end of the year, I'd have said they were crazy,''
Helling said. ``It just goes to show you that the team I play on
scores a lot of runs and the defense has played well behind me all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Those runs were not there for him last night. Stottlemyre could
sympathize. &QL;

L.A. AND THE NFL: THE CIRCUS GOES ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Later this month, just before Halloween, the groups interested
in acquiring the 32nd franchise in the National Football League
will be allowed to genuflect in front of the other 31 owners and
kiss the ring of commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   The media will not be allowed into the inner sanctum, but it
will have a good view if any smoke rises from Tagliabue's portable
Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there is no process in sports more twisted than the
NFL's fleecing of cities and millionaires. Cleveland, which once
had a franchise it dearly loved, was informed last month that the
cost of a new one would be $530 million.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, this was received as good news by Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is no less perverse. The New Coliseum project and
Michael Ovitz's Carson proposal, along with a group from another
disenfranchised city, Houston, will put on a show at the league
meetings in Kansas City in hopes that Tagliabue puts the winning
wafer in their mouth.
</P>
<P>
   This is pressure, unlike what you usually see in sports. A final
decision on Team 32 is likely a year away, but any group getting
sacked this October is looking at fourth and several years to go.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone responds to this pressure differently.
</P>
<P>
   The Ovitz group rolled out Shaquille O'Neal this week as a new
frontman. It certainly doesn't hurt having the Lakers' star on your
side, but frankly he doesn't help. Unless he commits to playing
tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the Ovitz group has been longer on style than details.
It says it has the money to back a package that might hit $1
billion in costs from building the stadium to franchise fee to
buying the land. But no one has seen anything in the form of game
plans or even a formal press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Carson has been told what it will cost to do
business with Ovitz and the NFL: $100 million, in the form of bond
sales. But it hasn't seen any bottom line financial details,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the bonds underwritten will not be a problem, says
Carson city councilman Daryl Sweeney. Bank of America, which has
extended Ovitz a line of credit large enough to buy the Ukraine, is
working with Carson and its consultants on this end. Sweeney also
said the NFL has bought off on any of the environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be until Oct. 20 before Carson's council gets a
chance to approve anything related to the bid, and the NFL meetings
begin Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've received bits and pieces of information,'' said mayor
Peter Fajardo. ``What we haven't seen is what our revenue streams
will be, and what Ovitz and the NFL expects of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed, but we have to have something to show the
public that explains how we'll cover the debt service and how the
city will profit. We have concerns about parking, and what we can
tax, and what administrative costs there will be (police,
traffic).''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond giving Carson a clue, Ovitz needs to know the NFL has
little regard for gaps in proposals. When Carolina owner Jerry
Richardson, who runs the NFL's franchise committee, was in town
this summer, he said Houston was 95 percent of the way to having a
complete proposal in hand.
</P>
<P>
   That meant Houston had an answer and commitment for every
question. If Ovitz goes to K.C. without a land agreement in hand or
without Carson as a signed-and-sealed teammate, he could be asked
to run a down-and-out pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The New Coliseum project, spearheaded by Kings' owner Ed Roski,
has also been busy lately. Within the last month, it had to hire a
new architect (L.A.-based NBBJ, the architect for the new Staples
Center) to put together a new blueprint and model. Why? Because the
NFL had informed Coliseum backers that the existing model was too
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   It basically was the same model the league had seen for several
years, dating back to proposed Coliseum renovation for the Raiders.
It had too much baggage. The New Coliseum didn't need another hint.
A public unveiling of the newer Coliseum is expected before
everyone heads for Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The New Coliseum group has also firmed up its financial package
with Merrill Lynch, has detailed all of its financial advantages in
relation to already-completed infrastructure around the Coliseum,
and rerouted redevelopment money as a way to fulfill the league's
requirement for public investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Coliseum will be more private than ever before,'' said
John Semcken, the groups' executive vice-president. ``But the
investment by the public is already in place, through the things
we've already done as far as parking and traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, of course, could care less that the New Coliseum can
bring its stadium in cheaper than Ovitz. It's trite but true: Show
Me the Money is the motto of all NFL owners.
</P>
<P>
   Semcken believes the New Coliseum offers the NFL one other
attractive thing: Franchise flexibility. Should Houston get Team
32, the New Coliseum project is willing to adapt its game plan and
offer itself as the new home to an existing NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners in Denver, Chicago, New England, Buffalo and Arizona
have expressed the need or desire for new stadiums. Voters in
Denver will go to the polls in November on a stadium referendum
issue. If Bob Kraft or Bill Bidwill can't get what they want from
Boston or Phoenix, the New Coliseum is willing to step up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like a new team,'' said Semcken. ``But if someone cares
to relocate, Ed and the group would be willing to step back as a
minority owner, or as a local owner for someone else. We'd go that
way for any team.''
</P>
<P>
   Except one. The Raiders. Too much bad history, too much bad
blood, and too much litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have a suit pending against the league regarding its
territorial rights to Los Angeles. Legal types say Al Davis doesn't
have a case, but that doesn't mean the league wants to rush a team
into L.A. before the case is tossed. Only one man may believe he
owns the rights to L.A., but if that man happens to be Davis, the
league will tread lightly.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the bottom line. The league's in no rush to name No.
32, but pity the poor bidder who isn't ready for the October
summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About 100 letters addressing Andy Pettitte's slump
have landed in the locker of Mel Stottlemyre, the New York Yankees'
pitching coach. Stottlemyre reads them all and dismisses them all,
believing Pettitte has always possessed his own antidote.
</P>
<P>
   A chronic self-doubter who slumped in the last two months of the
regular season, Pettitte finally ignored the pressure he usually
inflicts on himself. He concentrated solely on the glove of his
catcher Wednesday night and pitched seven strong innings as the
Yankees defeated the Texas Rangers, 3-1, in Game 2 of the American
League division series at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a belly full of guts,'' Manager Joe Torre said of
Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes for the Yankees: The juggernaut is one victory
away from sweeping the first-round series in three games. David
Cone will pitch Game 3 on Friday night, in Texas, against the
Rangers' Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie Shane Spencer, a late insertion into Yankees' lineup
as the No. 7 hitter, hammered a home run last night and Scott
Brosius, batting eighth, slammed a two-run shot, spurring the crowd
of 57,360. The bottom third of the Yankee lineup has batted .529 in
accounting for all five runs in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who led the American League in hitting during the
regular season, have mustered only 10 hits and a walk in the first
two games of the series, the apparent victims of perceptive advance
scouting by the Yankees that aided David Wells in Game 1 and
Pettitte on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte often talks to himself on the mound, his catcher Joe
Girardi has said, in words of self-criticism understood only by
Pettitte himself. But the constant harping drove him into a slump
in August, and it wasn't until the season's final week that
Pettitte emerged from his funk _ at about the same time Torre told
Pettitte he would be part of the team's post-season rotation, which
seemed to give the left-hander peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' Pettitte said on Wednesday night, ``because
obviously there were a lot of people questioning Joe for starting
me in Game 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Pettitte warmed up for Wednesday night's game,
Stottlemyre felt Pettitte was much different, much more confident,
in deep concentration. Once on the mound, Pettitte seemed to be
communicating only with Girardi's glove; see the glove, hit the
glove.
</P>
<P>
   Before each pitch, he stood at the top of the mound, staring at
the ground, a moment of mental preparation before staring in for
Girardi's sign. Girardi would signal and, like a robot, Pettitte
would draw his hands in front of him, his eyes locked on Girardi's
glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``His focus,'' Stottlemyre said, ``was as good as it can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte had the advantage of knowing that the Yankees' scouting
report on the Rangers _ compiled by a team of seven scouts _ seemed
to be right on the mark. He watched in Game 1 as Wells, his fellow
left-hander, constantly got ahead on the count by throwing a
first-pitch strike, then used the aggressive approach of the
Rangers' hitters against them. The Rangers would look for hard
stuff and swing hard, but Wells would throw changeups, and the
Texas batters would flail at pitches out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot,'' Pettitte said.
</P>
<P>
   He took the same tack as Wells. He threw strikes, got ahead in
the count with sinking fastballs, then went to his off-speed pitch.
Girardi estimated that of the 94 pitches Pettitte threw, 25 were
changeups. Pettitte usually likes to pitch inside to right-handed
batters, but on Wednesday night he stayed outside, and the Rangers
never adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   The first three Texas batters grounded out. Pettitte needed only
eight pitches in the first inning, his confidence growing. The
Rangers went down in order in the second inning, again in the
third, and so on. He retired the first 12 batters before allowing
the first Texas hit.
</P>
<P>
   During 32 starts in the regular season, Pettitte never retired
more than 11 batters consecutively. On Wednesday night, he threw
only 44 pitches in the first four innings, in direct contrast to
the Rangers' starter, Rick Helling.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali invented the the rope-a-dope boxing style. Lay
back, take your opponent's best shots, let him tire himself out _
and then pounce. The Yankee hitters have been playing rope-a-dope
against opposing starters all season, patiently taking pitches,
waiting out walks, reaching to foul off two-strike fastballs and
breaking balls. Helling needed 91 pitches in the first four innings
on Wednesday night _ and then the Yankees pounced.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer put the Yankees up in the second inning, smashing a
thigh-high fastball over the left-center field wall, beyond the
399-foot sign. It was his eighth home run in 28 at-bats, dating to
the last days of the regular season. He returned to the dugout
grinning broadly, but the crowd would not let him sit until he
acknowledged the cheers once more. Spencer emerged with a practiced
and exulted wave.
</P>
<P>
   On his next at-bat, with one out in the fourth inning, Spencer
skipped a hard grounder through the middle. Brosius then launched
Helling's 79th pitch of the game beyond the fence in right field, a
two-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored their first run of the series in the fifth
inning. Juan Gonzalez pulled a grounder down the third-base line
for a double, tagged up and moved to third on a fly ball, then
scored on Ivan Rodriguez's line single.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza began warming in the Yankee bullpen, a strong
indication that despite Torre's confident public backing of
Pettitte, the manager was prepared to pull him immediately, rather
than permit the left-hander any margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte finished off the fifth by retiring Todd Zeile and
Mike Simms _ the turning point of his outing, he said later.
Pettitte then struck out three in the sixth inning, Girardi
encouraging him along the way, pointing at him every time Pettitte
made a good pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte retired the Rangers in order in the seventh, and his
night was over. He had allowed three hits in seven innings, no
walks, eight strikeouts. Pettitte smiled widely afterward. This is
what he needed, and Stottlemyre has known it all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really important for us,'' Stottlemyre said, ``because
we're going to rely on him as one of our main pitchers the rest of
the way.'' &QL;

J.R. DOESN'T WORRY ABOUT HEISMAN SHOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Trophies have never been important to J.R.
Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started playing football at the age of 8 and it's always
been for pure fun,'' said Redmond. ``It was never for a big trophy
to put on my table at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, a junior at Arizona State, is now playing college
football. And there's no bigger trophy in college football than the
Heisman Trophy. Redmond knows exactly what it represents the best
player in college football, a free trip to New York City and the
opportunity to strike the pose.
</P>
<P>
   And, care about it or not, Redmond, who entered the season with
designs on playing full-time tailback and kick returner and
part-time defensive back, was a member of the relatively short
Heisman candidate list. Could he find a spot on his table now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Means nothing to me,'' Redmond insists. ``I never really think
about it until somebody brings it up. I went to a party (recently)
and all this one kid wanted to talk about was the Heisman. He kept
following me around talking about the Heisman. I had to make
something up to tell him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Redmond, a 1995 Carson High graduate, showed up at Arizona
State he carried a load of talent and plenty versatility. But he
didn't bring with him a preferred position.
</P>
<P>
   The sturdy 6-foot, 215-pounder with a time of 4.41 in the
40-yard dash was a tailback with the hands to play receiver. He
had, in fact, played both in high school while piling up 2,469
yards, 23 touchdowns and a 1993 L.A. City 4-A championship.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, he was a safety with the coverage skills of a
cornerback with experience at both. And he could break a game open
at any time on a kickoff or punt return.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put J.R. out there anywhere,'' Arizona State receiver
Lenzie Jackson said. ``You put him at running back, cornerback,
safety or receiver, he's going to go out there and make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State coach Bruce Snyder remembers the precise moment
Redmond became a tailback. It was about the time Redmond first
grabbed the football in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell a runner pretty fast and it was after one run I
said `He is going to stay there for awhile','' Snyder said. ``There
was some staff room bartering and negotiating going on about where
he should be. I said we were going to look at him at tailback and
it never changed from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, with 2,431 all-purpose yards, 12 touchdowns and
only one start on his collegiate resume, Redmond, who added 10
pounds during the summer in the weight room and at the dinner
table, took the lead for a team expected to challenge for a Pac-10
title and possibly play at its home stadium in the Jan. 4 national
championship Fiesta Bowl game .
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a better (offensive) player in the conference than
J.R. Redmond,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   There are, as it turns out, better teams than the Sun Devils.
Arizona State opened the season with a heartbreaking, 42-38, loss
to visiting Washington and followed with an uninspired 26-6 setback
at BYU. Suddenly, the lofty dreams had turned into an 0-2
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a bit of a struggle,'' Snyder said. ``After the
BYU loss, which I hope is the low point for the season, we decided
as a staff to go back as it were training camp, rebuild the team,
and get them focused in on every game we were to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who had been sensational against Washington (254
all-purpose yards) and shut down against BYU (62 yards all-purpose
yards), accepted the new approach as did his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living week by week for the games and day by day at
practice,'' said Redmond, whose only defensive duty thus far has
been two snaps against Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   The past two weeks haven't been perfect but they have been more
pleasant. The Sun Devils beat North Texas, 34-15, and knocked off
Oregon State, 24-3. Redmond had 201 yards on 19 touches against
North Texas and played through the pain of an injured toe to gain
168 all-purpose yards in the victory over the Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   The next weekly assignment comes on Saturday in the L.A.
Coliseum against Hackett's USC team and Redmond, being the
versatile guy he is, had to take on the role of ticket broker. He's
had to beg, borrow and purchase tickets for more than 30 family
members and friends so they can see him fulfill a lifetime dream of
playing in the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, I would daydream about playing for the
Raiders in the Coliseum,'' said Redmond, who regularly has about 15
family members travel to Tempe for Sun Devil home games.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who appears headed to the NFL when he chooses,
considered attending USC or UCLA. But he said the Bruins dropped
out of the running after he didn't obtain a qualifying score on the
SAT and USC stopped pursuing him after Redmond broke his clavicle
as a senior at Carson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona State is the only school which stuck with me,'' said
Redmond, who spent a semester at Long Beach City College before
reaching a qualifying score on the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Sun Devils are trying to get back on track and Snyder
doesn't mind riding his star tailback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a real special player and really a neat young
person,'' Snyder said. ``In a lot of ways, he exemplifies what we
want from work habits and carrying yourself as a person.''

SYMINGTON'S TALKS WITH TOBACCO QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 MICHAEL MURPHY AND CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attorney General Grant Woods has asked the Justice Department to
investigate whether former Gov. Fife Symington got tobacco
companies to create a public relations fund in exchange for
opposing Arizona's $500 million tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Woods referred the question to U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
on Sept. 16, after he uncovered a gubernatorial aide's handwritten
notes from a 1996 meeting between Symington, his top aides and a
key tobacco attorney. The meeting occurred less than three weeks
after Woods sued the nation's top cigarettemakers, seeking
reimbursement of health care costs from smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Symington on Wednesday denied that any fund was established, or
that he sought any benefit from Big Tobacco in exchange for trying
to kill the lawsuit. He said his position was based on principle.
</P>
<P>
   The notes of the meeting suggest that Symington sought a written
commitment by the tobacco companies to provide him with a ``public
relations fund'' to help him battle any negative public opinion for
his opposition to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The notes also suggest that William Maledon, a Philip Morris
attorney who attended the Sept. 9, 1996, meeting, drafted a
Symington letter of Oct. 15, 1996, that ordered Woods to drop the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said Wednesday that the documents point to a possible
violation of the Hobbs Act, a federal law that prohibits
officeholders from receiving a benefit for the public actions they
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty clear what the facts are pertaining to the
meeting, but what happened prior or subsequent to that meeting, we
don't know,'' Woods said. ``We do know that Symington took the
action that was the subject of the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington lashed out at Woods, calling his actions a
``disgusting'' effort to criminalize his ``principled position''
against Arizona's tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just ridiculous,'' Symington said of the referral. ``I
would expect no less from Grant. I'm not worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington said he encouraged the tobacco companies to ``make a
public stand'' against state tobacco lawsuits. But he said they
never established a public relations fund on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that my position was going to be kind of an unpopular
position . . . a voice in the wilderness,'' Symington said. ``I
knew I was going to get beaten up, but I also felt it would be
great if the tobacco companies would stand and fight and launch
their own public counteroffensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with encouraging an industry to defend
itself when it's under attack for the wrong reasons,'' the former
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   While ``that obviously costs money,'' Symington added, that,
``as I remember, they really didn't do anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' office conducted a preliminary investigation of the
matter, interviewing Nancy Baehre, then Symington's assistant
legislative director, about the notes she took of the 1996 meeting
between Symington, his top aides and Maledon.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he decided to refer the matter because the Justice
Department already is pursuing similar allegations against the
tobacco industry from other states. He also feared a potential
conflict because Maledon is a key player in the tobacco industry's
counteroffensive against Arizona's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman John Russell said Arizona's
information will be turned over to the department's tobacco task
force, which is looking into whether the industry committed fraud,
perjury or other wrongdoing. The task force began its work after
tobacco executives swore to both the Food and Drug Administration
and Congress that nicotine was not addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Symington ordered Woods to drop the lawsuit, based on the
possibility that taxpayer money could be lost. At the time,
Symington said his decision had nothing to do with the tobacco
industry's opposition.
</P>
<P>
   While the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System withdrew
from the state's lawsuit, Woods defied Symington and continued the
litigation. After Symington left office last year upon his
conviction on multiple felony bank- and wire-fraud counts, Gov.
Jane Hull ordered that AHCCCS be reinstated to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Woods uncovered the 1996 notes during discovery in the lawsuit,
which is scheduled to go to trial March 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In the notes, Baehre wrote that Symington asked Maledon about a
``public relations fund.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they going to do?'' about it, she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Maledon answered that he will ``support Gov,'' she wrote, and
added, ``Gov wants to know in writing what they will do.''
</P>
<P>
   The next section of her notes reveals that Maledon was to draft
the letter ordering Woods to drop the lawsuit: ``Gov. _ take
highroad letter to A.G. outlining reasons for AHCCCS to be taken
off lawsuit _ Maledon to draft letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Baehre, through a governor's office spokeswoman, declined to
comment Wednesday, citing her involvement in a deposition.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition, Baehre said she remembers little of the
meeting, but confirmed that the notes were hers.
</P>
<P>
   Maledon said he did not set up a public relations fund and has
never heard of such a fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never contributed anything to anything and I do not
know what that (Baehre's notation) refers to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maledon also said he did not draft Symington's letter to Woods,
and said no other tobacco attorney ``to his knowledge'' wrote it.
</P>
<P>
   But Symington's letter informing Woods that AHCCCS would be
dropped from the lawsuit closely follows a 12-page memo faxed
months earlier from Maledon's law office to the Governor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The memo offers arguments that Woods' suit is baseless, illegal,
and bad public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Symington argued in his letter that 66 percent of any settlement
would have to be paid to the federal government. John Kelly, then
the acting director of AHCCCS, made a similar point in a letter to
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Maledon's memo states that ``approximately 66 percent of any
monetary recovery . . . would go to the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, Symington argued that the tobacco
litigation would open up claims against ``beef growers, liquor
distillers, wineries, dairy farmers . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The Maledon memo cites dangers to ``the beef industry, the oil
and gas industry, and alcoholic beverage manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Heiler, Symington's former chief of staff, said Wednesday
that there was no deal in which Big Tobacco would provide
advertising support to help Symington deal with public outcry over
his decision to nix the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew he was going to take a pounding for it, which, of
course, he got. I think he was asking, `What are you all going to
be doing about standing up for your position?' '' Heiler, who
attended the 1996 meeting, recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Fife Symington were a man looking for cover, he simply
never would have made the decision he made in the first place. The
easier cover was to not do what he did. He did what he did out of
the philosophical belief it was the right thing to do,'' Heiler
added.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Heiler said, asking Woods to withdraw from the
lawsuit was a mistake. He alleged that Maledon made a false
statement in the meeting when he reassured Symington that the
tobacco companies would not settle the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona evidence may bolster contentions that Big Tobacco
provided advertising protection for key senators in exchange for
their votes against U.S. Sen. John McCain's legislation to enforce
a national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials are probing those allegations after a July
referral from Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks to me like another quid pro quo just like the one
the tobacco industry offered up to kill the McCain bill,'' said
William Novelli, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
``This is pretty egregious if proved.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-tobacco group filed a complaint on June 29 with the
Federal Elections Commission alleging that the nation's tobacco
companies provided illegal campaign contributions, in the form of
millions of dollars in supportive television ads in their states,
to senators who opposed the tobacco-settlement bill.
</P>
<P>
   These ads, the group argued, were not legal ``issues'' ads but
illegal corporate-campaign contributions designed to provide cover
for favorably disposed senators.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle then took the information developed by the campaign and
referred it to Reno, alleging further violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco companies' actions reveal the desperate lengths to
which they were willing to go in order to kill teen smoking
legislation,'' Daschle said in a July 2 letter to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, Reno wrote back that the Justice Department's
criminal division is examining the case, and said, ``The allegation
that tobacco companies may have promised favorable political
advertising in exchange for a senator's vote on specific
legislation raises separate concerns under the bribery and gratuity
statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Parriott, regional advocacy manager for the American Cancer
Society, said she wasn't surprised by the interest Big Tobacco
showed in the Arizona lawsuit. Tobacco has had a tight hold on
Arizona policymakers for years, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a defendant in a lawsuit and getting to write your own
dismissal _ it's awfully sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known the tobacco industry has claimed these suits were
without merit. It now comes out that they were so desperate and
frightened by this suit that they felt the need to go to a totally
different branch of government to get it dismissed.'' &QL;

t AID TARGETS SOFTWARE SELLERS  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDI VILLA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, Microsoft officials received complaints about some
of its computer software being substandard.
</P>
<P>
   Then they found out that hundreds of units of its software and
end user license agreements were pirated and distributed
nationwide, and possibly worldwide, out of a Valley home-based
business.
</P>
<P>
   Now authorities think they've identified two key culprits _ a
Chandler woman, who happens to be a neighborhood Block Watch
captain, and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities raided Microzon Inc. on Wednesday and accused the
company of manufacturing and distributing counterfeit Microsoft
Windows 95 and Office 97 Professional software for at least the
past 14 months, selling them for ``pennies on the dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The labels looked identical to the ones that come with
legitimate Microsoft products,'' said Chandler police Sgt. Ken
Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they suspect Aaron Duhon, 27, the president and
co-owner of the company, and his wife, Jennifer, the other owner,
also installed fake Windows 95 software into computers that they
then sold cheaply to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Duhons, whose home serves as their business headquarters,
are under investigation, although neither was arrested Wednesday,
Phillips said. Jennifer Duhon, 26, the company's vice president, is
a Block Watch captain in the couple's neighborhood in the 1200
block of West Boston Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know till this morning that they were actually
producing this,'' Phillips said. ``It was a little bit of a
surprise to us. We thought they were getting the product from Japan
or China or Los Angeles. Usually, they'll get the product from
somewhere else and set up these homes as the middleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Microzon caught the attention of authorities in July 1997 when a
customer sent 10 units of Windows 95 to Microsoft Corp., along with
a note inquiring if the products were counterfeit, according to a
police search warrant affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   The product, which was bought for $69 a piece, was analyzed by
Microsoft and found to be fake.
</P>
<P>
   In August, another customer told Microsoft he purchased 600 End
User License Agreements from Microzon and suspected they were
counterfeit. He also bought 21 copies of Microsoft Office 97
Professional from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft analyzed the software and six copies of the
agreements, plus four ordered by its own investigator in September,
and determined that all were fake.
</P>
<P>
   Microzon was founded in 1990 as Computer Solutions, then changed
its name to Microzon Computer Co. in 1995. In February 1996, the
company incorporated in Arizona and changed its name again to
Microzon Inc. Its Web site bills the company as ``your premier
source for quality computer components on the Web'' and boasts that
the business sells ``top quality computer products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you had a license to do this,'' Jennifer Duhon
reportedly said to her husband when police arrived Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Duhons referred all questions to their attorney, Marc
Victor, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Piracy and counterfeiting have become rampant in the software
industry, costing $11.2 billion in lost revenue last year alone,
according to the Business Software Alliance. Worldwide, more than
40 percent of all software in use is illegally copied. This
translates into fewer jobs, less innovation and higher costs to
consumers, the alliance says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is apparent that counterfeiters now understand that the
value of software is in the license,'' Microsoft attorney Anne
Murphy said in a press release. ``We applaud the efforts of Arizona
and specifically the Chandler Police Department for protecting
intellectual property and ensuring a level playing field for honest
resellers.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said it's too early for police to determine the extent
of Microzon's business. Detectives also seized a bank account,
computer equipment and business records.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a man arrested last month in Troy, N.Y., for
selling 100 units of counterfeit Microsoft Office 97 Professional
software, implicated Microzon as his supplier. The man called
Microzon when he was confronted by police and was assured that the
software, bought at $22.50 each, was not pirated.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said that Microzon very likely bought floppy disks in
mass quantity, then copied the programs onto them, manufactured the
fake license agreements and sold the units en masse to other
distributors, who in turn passed them along to other consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Floppies for both software programs cost Microzon less than $1
to produce, Phillips said. Windows 95 has been replaced at local
computer stores by Windows 98, which sells for around $180. Office
97 Professional costs about $300 wholesale and nearly $600 retail.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making almost 100 percent profit,'' Phillips said.
``The potential was limitless here.'' &QL;

STRAWBERRY LEAVES TEAM TO HAVE TESTS ON COLON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 4th and 5th grafs with remarks by George
Steinbrenner.)  (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Darryl Strawberry, the Yankees' designated hitter,
left the team Wednesday afternoon for further testing related to
pain in his lower abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said earlier in the week that he had been feeling
pains for about two months, but did not alert the Yankees'
physicians until the last few days, after his concern grew.
Strawberry had a CAT scan Wednesday, and Yankees Manager Joe Torre
said that based on what was found, further testing would be done;
Strawberry will have a colonoscopy Thursday and should know the
results of that test Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry told a teammate that doctors believe he is suffering
from an infection, but want to rule out anything more serious.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, said on
Wednesday night: ``I do know what it is, but I'm not going to talk
about it. It's not my place.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if it was a serious problem, Steinbrenner said,
``We're all praying for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, 35, met with Torre on Wednesday to tell him he would
not be available to play in Game 2 of the American League division
series on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry could rejoin the team in Texas Thursday, for Game 3,
although there is a chance, Torre acknowledged, that Strawberry,
who hit 24 homers this season, would not be able to play for the
remainder of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a secondary issue to Torre. ``We just want him to
be healthy,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was concerned, Torre said. ``He's tense,'' Torre
said. ``Especially because he's been feeling bad for five or six
weeks. You'd like to believe something is going to go away, but
when it doesn't, it affects everything else about you.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Strawberry's playing time had been reduced since Chili Davis
rejoined the team in mid-August, and Torre said he sensed something
was bothering Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what it was,'' Torre said. ``I didn't know if
his leg was bothering him, or what it was. Evidently, this has been
on his mind for a long time, and he was hoping it would go away by
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I say, we're not really concerned about the baseball end of
it _ we'll make do. The more important thing is to solve and
resolve everything that can be attended to.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry spoke with several teammates Wednesday, including
Davis. ``The good thing is it's not supposed to be real bad,''
Davis said. ``Apparently, the doctor said it was smart of him to
come in. If it was anything really, really wrong, there would've
been a severe amount of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   What Strawberry has felt is discomfort. ``We don't want to think
it's anything that bad,'' Davis said. ``He's more than a teammate,
he's a good friend and I'm concerned about him.''

BROOKS BRINGS AN ABLE STABLE OF HORSES TO LONE STAR PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ As stable hands hustled around Lone Star
Park's Barn 6 to finish chores, three white-faced horses were
traveling in circles outside while tethered to the walking wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The scene could have been from any barn. Those could have been
any horses. But they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   One was Falling In Loveagain, the top-earning quarter horse in
the country this year after her victory Labor Day in the
All-American Futurity. Next to her was Dashing Perfection, last
year's horse of the meeting at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie. The
third horse isn't as well-known. Four Six Dash hasn't lived up to
expectations, but he won the Retama Challenge Derby.
</P>
<P>
   All are trained by legendary Jack Brooks, whose stable looks
more powerful than ever for Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie's
second quarter-horse season. The Fall Meeting of Champions begins
at 6:35 p.m. Friday with 11 quarter-horse races each Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday and Saturday through Nov. 28 except for
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star's 33-day season features 24 stakes races, including
the Nov. 14 MBNA Challenge Championships, which have been compared
to thoroughbred racing's Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if Brooks, who leads the nation in 1998
earnings, has a say in quite a few of the big events. Brooks'
runners have earned $2,022,424 this year, far ahead of runner-up
Rodney Reed's $845,024; even without the $1 million from the
All-American Futurity, he would be in front.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had good horses in the past, but I don't think I've ever
had as many big runners in one barn,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old native of Blanchard, Okla., started training
quarter horses in the 1950s, when the livestock company he was
working for closed his sheep department. Because he was unemployed,
he decided to try his luck at quarter horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a poor country boy, and everything has gone right
for me in this game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, that 40-year-long trend should continue this
fall. Brooks trains Dashin Is Easy, which has won three derbies
this year and is No. 1 in the latest American Quarter Horse
Association poll. Another of his stars is Heza Ramblin Man, also
among the top 10 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Dashing Perfection had a sensational four-race run last fall at
Lone Star but has only a dead-heat win in four starts. He won a
coin flip to qualify for the $300,000 MBNA America Challenge
Championship and probably will have a local race before that,
Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he could outrun a jet airplane last year,'' Brooks
said. ``But we had some problems with his feet, and he hasn't been
quite up to par this year. He seems to love Lone Star, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Dashing Is Easy, owned by Jim Pitts of Wichita Falls, is
expected to follow the same path Brooks took with Dashing
Perfection a year ago: the Dash For Cash Derby on Oct. 23 and Texas
Classic Derby on Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Heza Ramblin Man is stabled at Los Alamitos near Los Angeles and
is to be brought to Lone Star for the MBNA America Challenge
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The goals for Falling In Loveagain, Brooks said, are the Dash
For Cash Futurity on Oct. 24 and the Texas Classic Futurity on Nov.
28. The Dash For Cash Futurity and Texas Classic Derby and Futurity
are rated as Grade I stakes by the AQHA, as are the four major
Challenge Championship races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, everything looks good and you can't get any luck,''
Brooks said. ``But I was leading trainer at Ruidoso Downs \Rthis
summer\S, and it looks better now than it did then. I've got a
2-year-old that's probably going to be world champion, a 3-year-old
that's world champion, and an older horse that's got a shot at
being world champion. That's hard to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   It also defies belief that Falling In Loveagain gave Brooks his
seventh victory in Ruidoso Downs' All-American Futurity, a race
perhaps as tough to win as thoroughbred racing's Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream was to win one,'' he said. ``But the seventh was just
as exciting as any of them, maybe more.''

IMF WARNS OF SLOWING GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund predicted Wednesday
that world economic growth will be more than halved this year _
prompting a U.S. economic slowdown _ in a forecast filled with
unusually grim warnings that things might turn out much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing its ``World Economic Outlook'' at its annual meeting
now taking place in Washington, the IMF said world growth is
expected to drop from 4.1 percent last year to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The decrease in growth will cost the global economy $800 billion
in expected income, more than the annual output of the entire
Canadian economy.
</P>
<P>
   The decrease is concentrated in Asia and Russia, where severe
economic contractions have reduced millions of people to poverty
and now threaten to spread to South America.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF expects the U.S. economy to ``slow markedly'' but skirt
a recession as it absorbs spillover effects from the turmoil
abroad. The powerful U.S. expansion, now in its seventh year, has
generated the first federal budget surplus in three decades,
although a downturn could quickly reverse that progress.
</P>
<P>
   IMF chief economist Michael Mussa welcomed the Federal Reserve
Board's decision Tuesday to lower interest rates to help avert a
worldwide recession. However, the report warned that chances for
recovery next year have diminished, ``and the risks of a deeper,
wider and more prolonged downturn have escalated.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF said a global recession remains unlikely, but that
forecast rests on a series of uncertain assumptions:
</P>
<P>
   --Investor confidence will rebound in Asia's devastated
economies.
</P>
<P>
   --Japan will take ``decisive action'' to climb out of its worst
recession in 50 years and restore solvency to its banks, now
burdened with an estimated $1 trillion in bad debt.
</P>
<P>
   --Investor capital will return to Latin America and Central
Europe, avoiding new financial crises there.
</P>
<P>
   --Europe and the United States will avoid recessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significantly worse outcome is clearly possible,'' the IMF
said, calling the world economy ``unusually fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   If global investors and banks continue to flee developing
countries, the IMF said, more financial crises could follow,
accompanied by disruptions in world trade, further stock market
plunges and deeper economic contractions.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF is a 182-member nation agency designed to maintain the
global financial system. The IMF has assembled an unprecedented
$100 billion in emergency loans since last year for Thailand,
Indonesia, Korea and Russia. It stands ready to make heavy loans to
Brazil if conditions worsen there.
</P>
<P>
   Mussa said Russia's default in August sent shock waves through
all emerging markets, particularly in Latin America and Central
Europe, frightening investors who fled to a haven in U.S. Treasury
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, credit flows to emerging markets had begun to
recover from the initial stages of the Asian crisis, which broke
out in Thailand 14 months ago. U.S. and European stock markets were
even hitting all-time peaks, with the Dow Jones industrial average
topping 9,300 on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian devaluation ``triggered a kind of sea change in
world financial markets,'' Mussa said. Capital flows to developing
countries, which by July had recovered to $20 billion a month,
``fell to $2.5 billion, and since the middle of August they've
effectively been zero,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Mussa called such a reversal ``a millennial event,'' the kind of
thing that the odds say ``will happen once in a thousand years _
and it happened in the middle of August.''
</P>
<P>
   Net private capital flows to emerging markets peaked at a record
$215 billion in 1996; the IMF expects them to shrivel to just $57
billion this year, a drop of nearly 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As developing economies contract and their currencies devalue,
U.S. and European exports shrink and cheaper imports surge,
undermining corporate earnings and slowing the economy. U.S.
farmers have been especially hard hit by the drop-off in Asian
buying power.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF report said the strong U.S. economy has provided a vital
buffer to Asian economies by absorbing their exports. But the
result is a U.S. trade deficit that is expected to climb from $155
billion last year to $299 billion in 1999, a level the fund calls
unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   If the crisis spreads to South America, which buys 20 percent of
U.S. exports, the U.S. economy will be hit even harder.
</P>
<P>
   There are bright spots, the report noted. South Korea and
Thailand have undertaken sweeping reforms to clean up their
debt-ridden corporations and banks. But they face a precarious
uphill climb unless Japan, the world's second-largest economy and
their biggest trading partner, recovers. The IMF said Japan ``bears
a particular responsibility to support recovery in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Mussa vehemently defended the IMF rescue packages for Asia,
which have come under fierce attack by critics who charge that the
fund blundered by forcing countries to raise interest rates at the
onset of their financial panics.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's goal was to prevent local currencies from collapsing.
If currencies had been allowed to go into free-fall, given the huge
short-term, dollar-denominated debts held by banks and businesses,
widespread bankruptcies, bank failures and even deeper economic
contractions could have resulted, the IMF maintains.
</P>
<P>
   But critics contend it was the interest rate increases that
plunged the economies into depressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those who argue that monetary policy should have been
eased rather than tightened in those economies are smoking
something that is not entirely legal,'' Mussa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression seems to have developed that the fund staff has
nothing to recommend but tighter monetary and fiscal policies, the
tighter the better, everywhere, and always. This quite simply is
nonsense.''

BILLION-YEAR-OLD WORM TRACKS FOUND IN INDIA, SCIENTISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team of fossil-hunting biologists say they have discovered
traces of worms that burrowed through the sands of an ancient
storm-tossed sea more than a billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the scientists are right, their find could change the
scientific world's thinking about the earliest eons of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Until the startling and controversial claim was announced
Wednesday, virtually all scientists had held that the evolution of
life more complex than single-celled organisms really began during
the ``Cambrian Explosion.'' This occurred about 540 million years
ago, when a marvelously varied menagerie of creatures started
evolving to become the ancestors of us all _ from snakes and sharks
to puffins and people.
</P>
<P>
   During that explosive burst of evolution, animals began to
develop feet and fins, stomachs and lungs, hard shells for
protection and sharp teeth for predation _ all clearly preserved
today in the fossil record.
</P>
<P>
   But before that, all life, beginning nearly 4 billion years ago,
was merely single-celled and slimy: blue-green cyanobacteria,
protists, and the even more ancient archaea. None of them left
fossils to testify to their existence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, comes a claim from Adolf Seilacher of Yale
University and Germany's University of Tubingen that draws a very
different picture:
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Wednesday and a report to be published Thursday in
the journal Science, Seilacher said he and his colleagues in
Germany and India have found ``trace fossils'' of long, sinuous
burrows that the worms dug in the wet sand of a shallow sea that
covered much of Central India more than a billion years ago _ twice
as long ago as the beginning of the Cambrian period.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the spineless creatures, Seilacher said, were too
soft to leave their own fossils. But their meandering wormy burrows
no thicker than a soda straw _ often branched and sometimes
suggesting that they could back away from dead ends _ show that
they must already have developed senses, nervous systems and
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists found the burrows in ancient sandstones along a
modern but poorly paved road that passes through the village of
Chorhat, about 10 miles south of the city of Allahabad in central
India, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The worms apparently lived beneath a thick mat of single-celled
organisms whose decaying bodies provided food while the mat itself
gave them oxygen, Seilacher said.
</P>
<P>
   And so the worms thrived with virtually no evolutionary change
for half a billion years before the Cambrian Explosion, Seilacher
said in a telephone interview from Germany, where he was attending
a conference.
</P>
<P>
   But how could evolution remain so stagnant during all that time?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there was no competition, no Darwinian fight for
survival,'' Seilacher replied. ``A billion years ago, the world was
a much more peaceful place because there were only the one-celled
organisms and the worms, and they were not eating each other. So in
such a peaceful world there was no need for creatures to develop
weapons to fight for survival, or hard armor to defend themselves.
And thus they left no fossils, and evolution could proceed very
slowly for millions of millions of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, however, several teams of molecular geneticists
developed what they called a genetic clock to calculate the
estimated rate of evolutionary change in animal life. They
concluded that multicelled animals might have arisen as long ago as
500 million years before the Cambrian Explosion, but they knew no
fossils existed.
</P>
<P>
   And still they remain unconvinced. At the University of
California at Davis, for example, evolutionary biologist Geerat J.
Vermeij was one of the clock-makers, and in an interview Wednesday
he said of Seilacher's claim:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would surely like to believe it, but it's all incredibly
early. It's quite consistent with theories, but it isn't
necessarily true, so I'm somewhat skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeij said he sees no problem with the idea that multicelled
animals evolved long before the Cambrian period, because they could
well have begun diversifying millions of years before the time when
skeletons and shells evolved to leave fossil evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But it would take more than a few eroded tracks that look like
the remains of burrows to convince him, Vermeij said.

ABANDONED PHONE CABLE ON OCEAN FLOOR MONITORS QUAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An old telephone cable, left for dead on the
bottom of the Pacific Ocean, is humming once again as the
computer-driven lifeline of the world's first deep-sea earthquake
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T donated the 35-year-old ``Hawaii 2'' cable after
fiber-optic technology rendered the twisted strands of steel and
copper obsolete. It fell into disuse in 1989, after fishing boats
had shredded some sections beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 12 years of design and construction work, the cable
has been transformed into a 1,000-mile-long power cord and
communications link for the new Hawaii 2 Observatory,
affectionately known to its builders as ``H2O.''
</P>
<P>
   The instruments are anchored 16,000 feet below the surface to a
novel titanium junction box located 1,200 miles west of the
California coast. Besides hookups for incoming power and a
data-feed back to Oahu, there are enough connections for eight sets
of instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an open system,'' said Alan Chave, senior scientist at
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, which
did the design work and will administer the program.
</P>
<P>
   It already serves as Station No. 108 in the Global Seismic
Network, used to track earthquakes around the world. Seismologist
Rhett Butler, who manages the system for a consortium of 90
research institutions known as IRIS, said the new undersea station
patches a gaping hole in what had been an entirely land-based
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make a big difference,'' he said. ``If you are
in California and you are interested in earthquakes, as soon as you
step off the coast, there's been nothing to monitor what's
happening until all the way to Hawaii or Alaska.''
</P>
<P>
   The deep-sea seismic instruments offer a new way to take
readings while quakes are happening, perhaps leading to detection
of previously unknown faults and more accurate predictions of
aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
   By gauging ocean currents, the system may also sound early
warnings for devastating tsunami waves long before they reach land.
All the data is automatically fed over the cable back to a relay
system that will soon be connected to the University of Hawaii and
eventually made available worldwide via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The seagoing work involved bringing the cable to the surface
through a difficult series of maneuvers using a remote diving
vessel dubbed Jason, a larger version of the vehicle used to
explore the wreckage of the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster nearly struck when a supporting chain _ rated for
30,000 pounds and holding up just 8,000 pounds _ inexplicably
snapped midway through the installation, sending the whole array to
the bottom of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists were able to recover the device undamaged, succeeding
after another try.
</P>
<P>
   ``It landed upright perfectly,'' Butler said. ``It sort of flew
down to the seafloor like a kite.''
</P>
<P>
   Project engineers fashioned the junction box entirely of
titanium so it could withstand the harsh seafloor. It hooks up
instruments that include a broadband seismometer, hydrophones for
listening to marine life and detecting the pressure of waves
passing above, and devices for tracking local sea currents and
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists hope to install a magnetic sensor to gauge pulses
from the Earth's core. Other possibilities include more
sophisticated sensors for spying on the deep-sea biology.
</P>
<P>
   A 400-watt power source drives it all from Hawaii. Old-fashioned
vacuum tube repeaters every 20 miles _ the original equipment
installed by AT&AMP;T has never failed _ help keep the information from
decaying before it reaches land.
</P>
<P>
   The project was financed in part by a $2.4 million National
Science Foundation grant. But getting hold of the old transoceanic
cable was the real key.
</P>
<P>
   It was all but worthless in the modern phone system, capable of
handling only 138 phone calls at a time, a tiny fraction of the
capacity on new digital circuits. But it was more than adequate as
a 1,000-mile extension cord to the middle of the Pacific.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Slow to change, but not a habitual offender
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Oct. 4, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man began the telephone conversation by giving his name,
which I failed to take note of. (Of which I failed to take note?
Hmm.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, he wanted to talk about my use in a column of the
indefinite article ``an'' before the word ``historic.'' He asked
why I used ``an.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taught it somewhere along the line,'' I responded almost
sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where? What school? I want to know where you were taught
that!'' he demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a quiz?'' I asked my interrogator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am astonished that a journalist would use such horrible
English,'' he said. ``Goodbye!'' And he hung up.
</P>
<P>
   That was disturbing for several reasons. I don't like it when
people hang up on me. Second, was my usage of ``an'' really wrong?
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to understand about the English language is that
it is not like the Ten Commandments; there are no rules sent down
by a higher authority. Prescriptive rules of the English language
are based on usage. Dictionaries and language usage publications
are put together and constantly revised by juries of mortal men and
women. Often, the reference books and the jurors do not agree with
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously I am bothered about being scolded for writing ``an
historic'' instead of ``a historic,'' but is it such horrible
English as my caller contends? Yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fowler's ``A Dictionary of Modern English Usage,''
I am not as guilty of using improper English as much as I am slow
to accept trends in our language.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler's, which is considered more British than American in its
orientation, says: ``A'' is used before all consonants except
silent ``h'' (a history, an hour); ``an'' was formerly usual before
an unaccented syllable beginning with ``h'' and is still often seen
and heard (an historian, an hotel, an hysterical scene, an
hereditary title, an habitual offender). But now that the ``h'' in
such words is pronounced, the distinction has become anomalous and
will no doubt disappear in time. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The book attaches no time limit. Therefore I must assume that no
matter how anomalous ``an historic'' might be, it is not yet
officially extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Harper's English Grammar, an American effort, also leaves a gray
area. It gives the preferred use of ``a'' and ``an'' based on
consonants and vowels, but also leaves a caveat: ``There once was a
strict rule, still observed in England but generally disregarded in
the United States, to the effect that ``an'' should be used before
unaccented ``h,'' as ``an hotel'' and ``an historian.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally disregarded does not mean totally disregarded.
</P>
<P>
   American-produced Barron's ``Essentials of English'' also leaves
options open. ``In some instances,'' it says of the usage, ``when
there are different pronunciations of the same word, the
pronunciation used by the speaker or writer determines the form of
the article.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, I now shall cease to use anything but an ``a'' in
front of historic to avoid telephone calls such as the one I
received and to underscore the study programs of countless English
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   We all err in our language at times, but there is a question
about who (whom?) sets the official rules for linguistic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter on usage in the 1975 American Heritage Dictionary,
Morris Bishop _ professor emeritus of Romance languages at Cornell
University _ said of the distinguished 125-member usage panel
assembled by the American Heritage Publishing Co.: ``It is
significant that on specific questions, the usage panel disagreed
more than they agreed, revealing a fact often conveniently ignored
_ that among those best qualified to know, there is a very
considerable diversity of usage.''
</P>
<P>
   At times the most perfect English usage can be its most awkward.
</P>
<P>
   It is now a part of lore that when someone once challenged
Winston Churchill on the grammatical construction of one of his
sentences, he retorted: ``This is the sort of English up with which
I will not put.''
</P>
<P>
   A historic response, Winnie!

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Contrast the bipartisanship of 1974
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The disturbing partisanship of the House impeachment process so
far stands in dramatic contrast to Congress's sober management of
the impeachment inquiry into the Nixon presidency. The signs are
few that procedures even approximating bipartisanship are likely to
evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Political folk memory has been encouraged to misremember the
impeachment of Richard Nixon as the work of roughhouse Democrats
ganging up on the Republican president. The record is very
different.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the key decisions were made with overwhelming bipartisan
support, and even the few split votes drew substantial GOP support.
In the end, the decision for impeachment was unanimous on the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to create the Senate Watergate Committee was 77-0, and
the decision of the committee to subpoena Nixon's tape recordings
was unanimous, too. Ditto a House subcommittee finding a few weeks
later that the White House had misused the CIA in the Watergate
coverup.
</P>
<P>
   There were only four dissenting votes when the House gave its
Judiciary Committee power for a formal impeachment inquiry, and the
Senate's decision soon after to end its hearings was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee voted 33-3 to subpoena White House tapes,
and earlier in the week six GOP Senate leaders had warned Nixon
that if he didn't provide Watergate materials, he would be in
contempt of Congress and could be impeached on that charge alone.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief partisan split in Judiciary over whether to
accept White House transcripts of the tapes or to require the tapes
themselves, but within two weeks the committee was voting 37-1 to
subpoena additional tapes. Only four votes were cast against still
further subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   When push came to shove on the impeachment charges, Republicans
split, with 10 or more in opposition but, depending upon which
charge, six or seven concurring.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, the ``smoking gun'' tape was found, showing Nixon
had ordered the illegal coverup and subverted federal agencies for
it. All the Judiciary Republicans who had hung back announced they
would vote for impeachment. The committee's final report was
adopted by the House 412-3.
</P>
<P>
   This Congress's process opened with a hard partisan right to the
chops _ a straight party-line vote to violate grand-jury secrecy
and publicize the president's videotaped testimony. The following
flood of prosecutorial raw material compares poorly to the
carefully limited demands and screened releases of material by the
1974 committees.
</P>
<P>
   With crucial votes imminent on whether to conduct formal
impeachment hearings and if so how, Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde did make some procedural concessions to Democrats last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he was doing that, the politicizing of the process
was intensified by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's declaration
that, forget the Constitution's criteria, ``bad behavior'' is
enough to warrant impeachment. ``Bad behavior,'' of course, is
whatever the opposition party says it is.
</P>
<P>
   An impeachment process should be advanced only by careful
bipartisan steps. This pony is off to a lurching and wobbly start.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: ACCESSING THE BIG PICTURE ON TV
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Oct. 4.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Now we add sight to sound,'' electronics pioneer
Robert Sarnoff said at the 1939 New York World's Fair as he
announced the advent of commercial television broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   TV sets can now be found in 99.7 percent of U.S. homes,
capturing over-the-air, cable and satellite signals. The images we
watch are sharper, usually in color and larger than they were six
decades ago. But basic transmission standards, which impose a limit
on overall quality, are the same as in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   That is about to change in November with the rollout of digital
television, or DTV. Were Sarnoff alive today, he might say: ``Now
we can look out the window and back at DTV sets without telling the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   DTV offers about five times more picture data than current sets
do. It also offers a wide-screen format and surround sound, as in
movie theaters. With DTV, you either get a breathtakingly clear
picture _ or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Industry tycoons are about to make multibillion-dollar bets that
DTV will catch on just like CD players and VCRs. The feds have
decreed that DTV must be available to every American household by
May 2002, and that the current-standard signals will be turned off
for good in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the public responds to the new big picture with a
big yawn? And what if people come down with a collective case of
sticker shock, thereby keeping set prices from coming down through
high-volume sales?
</P>
<P>
   Official Washington, you can be sure, will then get the message.
Deadlines will be allowed to slip, because politicians know that
you don't mess around with TV access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of the government is not to supply the business plan
for digital TV or to put artificial limits on the industry's
business plan,'' Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill
Kennard recently told a clutch of broadcasting honchos. ``The
transition to digital TV is inevitable, but the pace of the
transition will be set by the private sector,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for the best, 26 stations will begin to offer DTV next
month in Atlanta; Boston; Chicago; Dallas; Detroit; Los Angeles;
Manchester, N.H.; New York; Philadelphia; San Francisco, and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians will be watching: Manchester is a must stop for
virtually any White House hopeful. And Vice President Al Gore wants
the 2000 Democratic National Convention to be held in Philadelphia,
the city that inaugurated political telecasts in the summer of
1948.
</P>
<P>
   The next tier of DTV cities are also likely battlegrounds in the
next presidential race: Baltimore; Charlotte, N.C.; Cincinnati:
Cleveland: Denver: Hartford/New Haven, Conn.; Houston;
Indianapolis; Miami/Fort Lauderdale; Minneapolis/St. Paul;
Orlando/Daytona Beach; Phoenix; Pittsburgh; Portland, Ore.;
Raleigh/Durham, N.C.; Sacramento/Stockton; San Diego; Seattle; St.
Louis, and Tampa/St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   By the time TV stations in those cities go digital in November
1999, the main elements of the 2000 campaign should be coming into
DTV-like focus. Issues that Sarnoff could have hardly envisioned _
such as whether cable outlets should be made to carry DTV
broadcasts _ could well intrude into that contest.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Set between the silverware and plates of eggs
benedict are tape recorders, which the diners dutifully punch into
action when the genial host, Godfrey ``Budge'' Sperling, announces
as always: ``The only ground rule here is that we're on the
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a national newsmaker will barely find time for a sip
of coffee while answering questions at a Sperling Breakfast _ a
Washington institution that celebrates its 3,000th session Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Cal Ripkin of breakfasts,'' observed Jim Perry, a
retired Wall Street Journal reporter, in a congratulatory note to
Sperling. The 83-year-old former Christian Science Monitor bureau
chief has presided over the gatherings since they began on Feb. 8,
1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first guest was Charles Percy, a Republican senator from
Illinois. He was a red-hot presidential prospect back then,''
recalled Sperling, who was nicknamed ``Budge'' in his boyhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I thought that would be the end of it,'' he said. ``I had
no idea we were going to do 3,000. I didn't come to Washington to
preside over breakfasts. This wasn't one of my ambitions in life,
but in many ways it's been one of the most fulfilling things I've
done in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is difficult to find a political figure of national
significance in the past three decades who has not sat down for
``breakfast with Budge.'' Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush
all attended Sperling Breakfasts, and other guests have made major
news.
</P>
<P>
   It was at a Sperling Breakfast that House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., created ``cry baby'' headlines by complaining that President
Clinton had relegated him to the back of Air Force One on an
overseas flight.
</P>
<P>
   And it was here that Republican campaign strategist Ed Rollins
boasted that he had paid ``street money'' to African American
ministers to hold down the black vote when Christine Whitman was
elected governor of New Jersey in 1993. He later admitted that this
was a false boast intended to inflate his own importance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a Democratic presidential hopeful named Bill Clinton
brought his wife, Hillary, and both talked about having dealt with
difficulties in their marriage and having put those troubles behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a rehearsal for what they said later on '60
Minutes','' said Warren Rogers, a syndicated columnist and former
Washington bureau chief of Look magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The breakfast ``was set up originally to kind of size up these
public figures,'' said Sperling, describing how he began getting
together a politician and his journalistic colleagues from the
campaign trail. ``But it turned out to be a good place for news to
be generated.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the tense news conferences familiar to television
viewers, the breakfasts are marked by a relaxed tone of inquiry and
a dearth of attention beyond the Beltway. The reason is a rule
Sperling established at the beginning: no electronic media allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is all about civility,'' said Rogers, a regular
since the early 1970s. ``We don't have any TV cameras, so nobody is
trying to become a news media celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're full of good humor as a rule,'' said Sperling, who
always asks the first question and then calls on other reporters
who raise their hands like schoolchildren. ``I think guests are
more likely to be forthcoming when they're not being hammered on
the head. I think our questions are awfully good. We're just not
hostile about it. This is not adversary journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Washington press corps has changed dramatically since the
first Sperling guest was served up. Newspaper bureau chiefs and
columnists dominated the media then. Legendary journalists such as
Peter Lisagor of the Chicago Daily News and Washington Post
columnist Joseph Kraft were among the initial breakfast group.
(Actually, the first session was an off-the-record luncheon, but
the meal and rules were soon altered.)
</P>
<P>
   A changing capital has forced other adjustments as lines blurred
in a multimedia world. The faces of many regulars _ columnists and
commentators such as Bob Novak and David Broder _ are perhaps as
familiar to television viewers as to newspaper readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been a group from the print media, although, as
time has gone on, some people in the group also do television,''
Sperling explained.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning promptly at 8 a.m., the symbiotic breakfasts bring
together political figures who want to be in the news and political
reporters who can put them there. It's ``lazy'' journalism,
conceded Rogers. ``Budge brings the guy to you.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past couple of decades, most of the breakfasts have been
served on china and crystal in the subdued splendor of private
dining rooms of the Sheraton Carlton Hotel, a few blocks from the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The tab per person has risen from about $1 to about $20 over
nearly 33 years. Although eggs and fried potatoes are always
available, recent decades have also found a buffet table with
fruit, bagels, juice and cereal for the cholesterol-conscious. The
number of journalists who attend usually ranges from 20 to 50,
depending on the prominence of the guest.
</P>
<P>
   Although the earliest breakfasts were attended only by men,
women have long had a place at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``My breakfast group has always mirrored the bureaus and what
was happening there,'' said Sperling. ``When the bureaus started
bringing in women, we started having them at breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories have always been the staple of the menu, of course, and
Sperling has a plateful to tell. Perhaps his most memorable
breakfast came in 1968 when the guest was Robert Kennedy, then a
Democratic senator from New York, and the nation was split over the
Vietnam War. Asked about his presidential aspirations, Kennedy at
first said it was ``inconceivable'' that he would enter the race.
But during the breakfast, news of the Tet offensive reached the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Before that breakfast was over, ``inconceivable'' had been
softened considerably, Sperling said, and the reporters left
convinced that Kennedy was running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as memorable but considerably less historic,
then-California Sen. S.I. Hayakawa asked for and ate a breakfast of
canned sardines on lettuce, Sperling recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The guest for the 3,000th gathering will be Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a key player should
the House vote to impeach Clinton and set up a trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Some former regulars who have since retired will attend. There
will likely be a few nostalgic words, but the event promises to be
more typical than climactic. Sperling is hardly ready to turn over
his coffee cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking each breakfast as it comes,'' he said, describing
how he rises at 5 a.m. on the two or three mornings a week that he
hosts breakfasts. He reads the morning papers and arrives at the
hotel early to check the room and menu. ``I have the energy for it
and I still enjoy doing it. I'm an early bird anyway, so I'll keep
going.''

   WASHINGTON _ Set between the silverware and plates of eggs
benedict are tape recorders, which the diners dutifully punch into
action when the genial host, Godfrey ``Budge'' Sperling, announces
as always: ``The only ground rule here is that we're on the
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a national newsmaker will barely find time for a sip
of coffee while answering questions at a Sperling Breakfast _ a
Washington institution that celebrates its 3,000th session Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Cal Ripkin of breakfasts,'' observed Jim Perry, a
retired Wall Street Journal reporter, in a congratulatory note to
Sperling. The 83-year-old former Christian Science Monitor bureau
chief has presided over the gatherings since they began on Feb. 8,
1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first guest was Charles Percy, a Republican senator from
Illinois. He was a red-hot presidential prospect back then,''
recalled Sperling, who was nicknamed ``Budge'' in his boyhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I thought that would be the end of it,'' he said. ``I had
no idea we were going to do 3,000. I didn't come to Washington to
preside over breakfasts. This wasn't one of my ambitions in life,
but in many ways it's been one of the most fulfilling things I've
done in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is difficult to find a political figure of national
significance in the past three decades who has not sat down for
``breakfast with Budge.'' Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush
all attended Sperling Breakfasts, and other guests have made major
news.
</P>
<P>
   It was at a Sperling Breakfast that House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., created ``cry baby'' headlines by complaining that President
Clinton had relegated him to the back of Air Force One on an
overseas flight.
</P>
<P>
   And it was here that Republican campaign strategist Ed Rollins
boasted that he had paid ``street money'' to African American
ministers to hold down the black vote when Christine Whitman was
elected governor of New Jersey in 1993. He later admitted that this
was a false boast intended to inflate his own importance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a Democratic presidential hopeful named Bill Clinton
brought his wife, Hillary, and both talked about having dealt with
difficulties in their marriage and having put those troubles behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a rehearsal for what they said later on '60
Minutes','' said Warren Rogers, a syndicated columnist and former
Washington bureau chief of Look magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The breakfast ``was set up originally to kind of size up these
public figures,'' said Sperling, describing how he began getting
together a politician and his journalistic colleagues from the
campaign trail. ``But it turned out to be a good place for news to
be generated.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the tense news conferences familiar to television
viewers, the breakfasts are marked by a relaxed tone of inquiry and
a dearth of attention beyond the Beltway. The reason is a rule
Sperling established at the beginning: no electronic media allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is all about civility,'' said Rogers, a regular
since the early 1970s. ``We don't have any TV cameras, so nobody is
trying to become a news media celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're full of good humor as a rule,'' said Sperling, who
always asks the first question and then calls on other reporters
who raise their hands like schoolchildren. ``I think guests are
more likely to be forthcoming when they're not being hammered on
the head. I think our questions are awfully good. We're just not
hostile about it. This is not adversary journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Washington press corps has changed dramatically since the
first Sperling guest was served up. Newspaper bureau chiefs and
columnists dominated the media then. Legendary journalists such as
Peter Lisagor of the Chicago Daily News and Washington Post
columnist Joseph Kraft were among the initial breakfast group.
(Actually, the first session was an off-the-record luncheon, but
the meal and rules were soon altered.)
</P>
<P>
   A changing capital has forced other adjustments as lines blurred
in a multimedia world. The faces of many regulars _ columnists and
commentators such as Bob Novak and David Broder _ are perhaps as
familiar to television viewers as to newspaper readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been a group from the print media, although, as
time has gone on, some people in the group also do television,''
Sperling explained.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning promptly at 8 a.m., the symbiotic breakfasts bring
together political figures who want to be in the news and political
reporters who can put them there. It's ``lazy'' journalism,
conceded Rogers. ``Budge brings the guy to you.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past couple of decades, most of the breakfasts have been
served on china and crystal in the subdued splendor of private
dining rooms of the Sheraton Carlton Hotel, a few blocks from the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The tab per person has risen from about $1 to about $20 over
nearly 33 years. Although eggs and fried potatoes are always
available, recent decades have also found a buffet table with
fruit, bagels, juice and cereal for the cholesterol-conscious. The
number of journalists who attend usually ranges from 20 to 50,
depending on the prominence of the guest.
</P>
<P>
   Although the earliest breakfasts were attended only by men,
women have long had a place at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``My breakfast group has always mirrored the bureaus and what
was happening there,'' said Sperling. ``When the bureaus started
bringing in women, we started having them at breakfast.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Texas' First Lady to lead annual Memory Walk
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Before he began the rapid descent so common
among people suffering from Alzheimer's Disease, Laura Bush's
father would joke that he could see the dreaded disease coming,
although he wasn't sure what to call it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father used to say, 'I think I've got that old-timers
disease,''' said Bush, wife of Gov. George W. Bush. ``Everyone
fears it I because they know what a burden they will be to their
families.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady's father, Midland developer Harold B. Welch, died
in 1995 after a two-year struggle with Alzheimer's. Watching her
mother shoulder the burden of caring for him took a toll on Bush,
one reason she has become involved with the local Alzheimer's
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of frustration with taking care of Alzheimer's
patients,'' Bush says. ``That's why it's so important for
caregivers to get support.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 people in the Austin area suffer from
Alzheimer's or care for someone who has the degenerative disease,
which attacks the brain and frequently causes memory loss,
disorientation and impaired behavior. Because of the aging of the
baby boom population, the association expects the number of
Alzheimer's patients locally to grow to more than 325,000 by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's patients often wander off or forget where they are,
have problems speaking and writing, and can need help with basic
activities such as bathing, dressing, eating and going to the
bathroom. The emotional and physical stress of caring for
Alzheimer's patients is difficult and damaging, and patients
frequently outlive their caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Alzheimer's progresses, it becomes impossible for one
family member to care for another family member,'' says Julie
Parker Johnson, executive director for Alzheimer's Association's
Greater Austin Chapter, which serves 11 counties in Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration drives many caregivers to enlist the help of other
family members or to hand over care to nursing homes. Those who go
it alone can expect that care will cost more than $40,000 per year
and should seek out day care centers that can offer them a break
from having to give constant care, the association says.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, a World War II veteran who built houses and developed
subdivisions in Midland, was so ill by early 1995 that he did not
attend the governor's inauguration. Bush says her mother was lucky
to have the time and money to take care of him as his health
declined and ``50 years worth of friends in Midland'' to depend on
for help.
</P>

   He sometimes goes by the name Shane Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   By Kirk Bohls
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The balance of this hotly contested National
League division series between Houston and San Diego _ two teams
that couldn't be any more evenly matched if they swapped dugouts
and very nearly did in that mega-12-player trade four years ago _
could rest on the squared-off shoulders of . . . uh . . . it'll
come to me . . . oh yeah, ol' whatzisname.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, Shane Reynolds will be referred to as savior if
he can somehow restore order to this best-of-five first round and
even the series at one win apiece. The bet here is he does. But
until then, the 30-year-old right-hander will largely be
remembered, so to speak, at least by casual fans, as the forgotten
man, even though he is widely respected inside the game. A case
could be made, in fact, that he is the best No. 2 pitcher in
baseball. That is, baseball west of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A quick quiz, however. How many playoff games has Reynolds won,
going back to his college days at tiny Faulkner University in
Alabama and the University of Texas? Answer: zero. How many has he
pitched in? One.
</P>
<P>
   He was a mediocre 12-10 in two years at Faulkner and, although
he was 7-0 in his lone season as a Longhorn, he had a 6.04 ERA and
was unceremoniously and deservingly left off Texas' College World
Series roster in 1989 even though the team was pitching-poor after
Kirk Dressendorfer and Brian Dare that season. This, after a fall
in which he was given Roger Clemens' No. 21 uniform. Of course,
Reynolds has always been chasing excessive expectations, whether
it's as the next Clemens or as the beneficiary of a three-year,
$10.5 million contract after 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clemens, Reynolds was a late bloomer who didn't mature
until after he left UT. Clemens never even made all-conference in
two Longhorns seasons. But Reynolds, with a cotton farmer's work
ethic, has since developed into one of the game's elite pitchers
and would now fit into an all-time UT starting rotation with
Clemens, Burt Hooton and Greg Swindell, if pro careers were
included.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds has won 63 major-league games in just five full seasons
and, but for a knee injury that sidelined him for a month last
year, has steadily improved each season. Except for a final-game
start in which he had a no-decision despite a strong game against
the Cubs last Saturday, he would have joined Atlanta's Tom Glavine
as the only two 20-game winners in the National League and been one
of only five in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, few outsiders would place him in the company of Clemens,
Glavine or any of the other marquee pitchers, although Reynolds
undeniably should be on the list of the game's top 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most players who play in Houston don't get much credit,''
slugger Jeff Bagwell noted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly would apply to Reynolds, a control pitcher who
has a nasty, split-fingered pitch to go with an above-average
fastball and a curve and slider he now throws more often and
earlier in games to show hitters all his pitches. If he were
getting his due, certainly his name would be mentioned in the Cy
Young chase, a race that's been limited to San Diego's Trevor
Hoffman and Kevin Brown and Atlanta's Glavine and Greg Maddux. Even
teammate Randy Johnson received consideration, and he made only 11
NL starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other guys have more wins and lower ERAs,'' Astros Manager
Larry Dierker explained. ``But you could be the fifth or sixth-best
pitcher in the league and not get mentioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have forgotten that Reynolds has been Houston's opening day
pitcher the last two Aprils. He almost duplicated departed free
agent Darryl Kile's numbers from a year ago with an identical 19
wins and 233 innings, just 22 fewer than Kile's in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds does give up more hits than innings pitched but walks
few and gets as many ground balls as he does strikeouts. The
arrival of Johnson took much of the pressure off Reynolds and
helped him in another way because the Big Unit completed four of
his starts and kept the bullpen fresh for Reynolds, who finished
only three of his 35 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we had that leader-type ace guy that we
needed,'' Reynolds conceded. ``He's a classic ace.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be a major surprise if Reynolds doesn't throw as well
today as he did in last year's playoff start against the Braves
(two runs in six innings) and an even bigger surprise if his
teammates fail to provide some of the offense that has been lacking
in the Astros' last four playoff games. Houston has eked out just
six runs over that span, including the three-game sweep by Atlanta
last season, but those four losses have come against Maddux,
Glavine, John Smoltz and Brown/Hoffman, pitchers who can claim
SEVEN Cy Youngs among them after this year.
</P>
<P>
   But look for Houston to score more against Andy Ashby, a strong
No. 2 pitcher himself but one with tendinitis in his hip and a poor
finish in which he won one of his last seven starts. In the event
it doesn't, Dierker is already making noises about coming back with
Johnson in game three on three days' rest, in which case No. 3
starter Mike Hampton adopts the role of forgotten man.

 &HT;    Offensive line making adjustment to UT power game
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ricky Williams is just ahead of schedule on his
quest to break Tony Dorsett's rushing record. And the University of
Texas' star tailback is already well beyond his rushing total at
this time last year, 736 to 519.
</P>
<P>
   What most people don't know is that the counter trey, which
historically had been Williams' most prolific play, has been
scrapped this season by a staff that is emphasizing power blocking
over finesse. And he's gaining all those yards running behind an
offensive line that has had an uneasy time this season making the
transition in blocking philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   In his first three years at UT, Williams was nearly unstoppable
running the counter trey, a finesse play that had a guard and a
tackle, together, pulling away from the line of scrimmage and
taking out a defensive lineman or a linebacker to give Williams a
massive, upfield block.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got a whole bunch of my yards on the counter trey, that and
the isolation play,'' Williams said. ''We talked about that before
the game. I know it's been really hard for the offensive linemen.
They played in one system for three years, and now they have to
learn another one. I know the tackles, especially, loved to pull.
For me, it's the best feeling in the world is coming around (the
line of scrimmage) with no one but the safety to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams still is beating safeties with his stiff-arm,
especially those who played Saturday for the Rice Owls. But he's
getting past the linemen and linebackers with a blocking scheme
that relies less on finesse and trickery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even know what finesse is,'' UT offensive line coach
Tim Nunez said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting more one-on-one individual blocks,'' right guard
Ben Adams said. ''Coach Nunez stresses the first two steps. . . .
You've also got to get a low pad level, to get under your man,
because whoever gets the lower body level leads.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Williams gained 318 yards, second-best single-game
total in UT history, mostly on off-tackle runs, sweeps and draws,
but with a sprinkling of misdirection. The offense also broke the
school record for total yards with 692. It's interesting that the
offense and Williams put up those numbers just a week after its
woeful performance against Kansas State. That's when Williams
gained only 43 yards and the team scored only seven points.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the line said they got together before the Rice game
and had their own pre-game pep talk. The most vocal was center
Russell Gaskamp. However, the whole line, with three of its members
destined for the NFL next year, took the words to heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came together before the game,'' Adams said. ''We decided
we had to play for ourselves. We couldn't play for Ricky or for the
fans or for our parents. We had to prove to people that we are the
ones who make things run in this offense.'' Jay Humphrey, a
three-year starter at right tackle, said he was stung by the
criticism that was generated by UT's performance in a 48-7 loss to
Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see how anybody could have said that the offensive
line has played badly,'' said Humphrey, who was listed in a mock
draft this week by CNN/Sports Illustrated as a late first-round NFL
pick. ''The offensive line didn't play horribly against Kansas
State, it was just one guy breaking down on any one play.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the Rice game, everybody talks about how well we played.
We went from the outhouse to the penthouse in a matter of a week.
It makes me go mad when people say we haven't been playing well. It
makes you want to go out and hit somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   What the line showed against Rice and what they didn't show
against Kansas State and at times UCLA and New Mexico State, was
that it had grasped the new power scheme employed by Nunez. In this
system, the offensive linemen worries most about overpowering the
defensive guy crouched directly in front of them rather than trying
to use technique to keep the defender off-balanced and off his
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're getting better,'' Nunez said. ''I don't think we
were as good as we should have been against Kansas State. I thought
we were pretty good against Rice. When you don't win, you're pretty
hard on yourself.

 &HT;    Henry Flagler Museum cats causing ruckus
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH _ The curator, the cat lady, the trapper and the good
lieutenant all agree on one thing: The insanity must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how, they're not sure.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that a social crisis is nearing critical mass
here, and it involves wild cats.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the feral Pulitzers or Kennedys again. This time it's
the street felines at the Henry Flagler Museum.
</P>
<P>
   For three decades, a colony of cats has roamed the 8 acres
around the stately mansion, oblivious to the fact that the great
architect was a dog lover. They were given charming names _ Peanut
Butter, Champagne, Fluffy and Fluffy Jr., Zipper, Nutmeg, John
Wayne and Marmalade _ and led charming lives.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1995, John Blades took over as the museum's curator. He
wants the cats to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not belong here,'' he says. ``They have infested the
carpets with fleas. They have caused damage. They are a health and
safety nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, a security guard stepped on a cat and turned
his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a workers comp claim,'' Blades says. ``I'm hoping and
praying no visitor is injured or gets cat-scratch fever.''
</P>
<P>
   The new curator's position infuriates Catherine Bradley, known
throughout the island as the ``Cat Lady.'' Each day for the last 13
years, she has taken a wooden box full of food to the side gate at
the Flagler Museum to ensure that the cats have full bellies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know each of the cats at the museum,'' she says. ``I have a
photographic memory.''
</P>
<P>
   This comes in handy because Bradley admits to caring for 300 of
the island's feral cats, the names she has given them being too
numerous to recount here. In another life, Bradley used her
sophisticated, British bearing to strike real estate deals. She
sold John Lennon's mansion, among others. Now she runs her Palm
Beach Cat Rescue league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work 100 hours a week,'' she says. ``I'm weary. It's
laborious work. The cats are heavy. I don't need another battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely what she got recently when Blades decided to
take bold action against his purring squatters. This brings us to
Robert Freeman, the trapper, owner of Grizzly's Wild Animal
Service. Blades hired him to trap the cats _ humanely, of course _
and remove them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love cats,'' Freeman says. ``I am an animal lover. When I'm
called in, there's already a problem. But that woman (Bradley) is
creating a monster. Someone will have to stop her. I'm just trying
to curb her form of insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Grizzly's has trapped five cats and taken them to shelters,
including the Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control Division.
Which is where Lt. Gina DiPace enforces the law _ or tries to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under our new ordinance, the person who is the feral cat
care-giver is responsible to see that they are all spayed,
tattooed, and gotten their microchip and their shots,'' DiPace
says.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``feral cat care-giver'' is new to the county's
lexicon. It was born in June when Bradley convinced Palm Beach
County commissioners that people should be allowed to look after
wild cat colonies, so long as the care-givers register with animal
control officers and follow their rules.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat unclear exactly what the rules are, however.
</P>
<P>
   As it now stands, Freeman traps the cats and takes them to a
shelter, where Bradley retrieves them, spends up to $200 in fees,
then returns them to the museum _ much to the horror of the
curator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is outrageous and irresponsible,'' Blades says. ``I'm
tired of being cast as the bad guy. She is expecting to pursue her
obsession on people's private property.''
</P>
<P>
   The cat lady believes the conflict is mostly a human thing:
``It's become a personal thing. Some people aren't used to having
their authority challenged. He's always putting down my program.''
</P>
<P>
   Blades says the cats absolutely will not stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's taking them back there?'' asked an incredulous Lt.
DiPace. ``Unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Freeman, the trapper: ``Help me. I'm losing my mind.''

 &HT;    La Nin(tilde)a v. El Nin(tilde)o: Winter is the prize
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Thanks to September's heavy rains, grass is
greener these days in the Austin area than it's been since April.
But it could turn brown again and stay that way until late spring,
if dueling areas of cold and warm water in the eastern equatorial
Pacific Ocean reach a cold conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will influence the global climate for months,
affecting rainfall, temperature and wind patterns across Texas and
everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service expects a strengthening La
Nin(tilde)a effect (the cold water) to be victorious, extending
into the winter and spring, which for the Southwest generally means
mild and dry weather. In other words, the region should experience
the opposite of the cool and wet El Nin(tilde)o (the warm water)
conditions that Texas saw last winter and early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Central Texas farmers lost millions of dollars this year when
last winter's El Nin(tilde)o rains perversely stopped in April and
unusually dry conditions settled in for the late spring and summer.
Farmers could see the same troubles happen all over again if La
Nin(tilde)a prevails in the Pacific and stifles the normal rains of
winter and spring. Last summer's potential for wildfires, quashed
by this month's heavy rains, also might return.
</P>
<P>
   But for months now, the areas of cold and warm water in the
equatorial Pacific that represent a strengthening La Nin(tilde)a
and a waning El Nin(tilde)o have been alternating, keeping
scientists guessing as to which one will be dominant in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
   El Nin(tilde)o, Spanish for the Christ child, got its name
centuries ago when Peruvian fishermen noticed that the recurring
cycles of warm water that disrupted fishing were most apparent
around Christmastime. Scientists in this century gave the name La
Nin(tilde)a to the opposite effect of colder-than-normal water
there.
</P>
<P>
   Things seemed much clearer for climate prediction in June when
University of Texas space researchers monitoring satellite sensor
data on the Pacific saw the sea level of the eastern Pacific
dropping below normal, a situation that roughly correlates with
colder water temperatures. This observation allowed them to predict
a coming La Nin(tilde)a period, although one of uncertain duration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be pretty sure there's going to be some La
Nin(tilde)a,'' Don Chambers, an aerospace engineer at UT's Center
for Space Research, said in June. Chambers monitors sea level data
from an American-French radar satellite called TOPEX/Poseidon,
which the weather service uses for long-range climate predictions.
</P>
<P>
   But by late August, after the weather service had confirmed UT
researchers' June observations and predicted a coming La
Nin(tilde)a winter and spring, the phenomena shifted.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers then said the satellite was recording a return to near
normal sea level in the eastern Pacific, while an area of cold
water in the central ocean that had been moving eastward seemed to
be holding stationary.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, however, the cold water has begun moving
eastward again, meaning La Nin(tilde)a is regaining her supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we can't estimate how large (the cold effect) will be
or how long it will last,'' Chambers said last week. ``And the
(climate) computer models all disagree on the size and duration as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation has perplexed some climate researchers, who once
thought their discovery of the El Nin(tilde)o and La Nin(tilde)a
phenomena had given them a key to global forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Peterson, a meteorology researcher at Texas Tech
University in Lubbock, said even if the La Nin(tilde)a conditions
continue to prevail, there's no guarantee the Southwest will get a
dry winter and spring.
</P>
<P>
   A La Nin(tilde)a winter followed the major El Nin(tilde)o winter
of 1982-83, and that La Nin(tilde)a period, in 1983-84, was
supposed to make Texas mild and dry. Instead, West Texas had a
record cold and snowy winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a lot of these things,'' Peterson said, ``there's average
conditions, but each one has many local variations and
idiosyncracies. A single event, like Tropical Storm Charlie
settling over Del Rio (in August), completely alters what looked
like a horrible drought. We'll just have to wait and see what
happens.''

 &HT;    Architects to showcase their vision for downtown
 &HT;    By Chuck Lindell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At the beginning of the decade, the Warehouse
District was a forgotten part of Austin's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Today, this area is one of downtown's most dramatic
redevelopment efforts. Dilapidated buildings and empty warehouses
are now restaurants, nightclubs, stores and offices. Soon, housing
will join the mix.
</P>
<P>
   To capture this dynamic atmosphere, a group of local architects
will unveil a display showing what is happening and what could
happen in the Warehouse District and nearby downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
   To date, most of the changes in the Warehouse District have
occurred in old buildings. That is about to change with a spate of
new construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're about to see now is a major change,'' said Sinclair
Black, an Austin architect who helped organize the exhibit. ``We're
going to get back to some fairly serious building.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting because it's not all office space,'' Black
said. ``There is housing and retail mixed in, and there are smarter
strategies about parking.''
</P>
<P>
   Black is working with Page Southerland Page to design a $56
million apartment cluster at Second and Colorado streets. The
project, by Chicago-based AMLI Residential, will include
underground parking and rows of ground-floor shops to improve the
project's pedestrian accessibility. The City of Austin is
negotiating with AMLI to build a sister project on city-owned land
a block south.
</P>
<P>
   Black also designed the headquarters for the Schlotzsky's
sandwich chain at Fourth and Colorado streets, which has received
design awards from the International Interior Design Association,
the American Institute of Architects' Austin chapter and the
Associated General Contractors of America's Austin chapter.
</P>
<P>
   The display _ Urban by Design: Architecture in Downtown Austin _
is designed to give the public a better idea how architects
contribute to the urban environment, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   It also should stimulate public debate on such projects as the
decommissioned Seaholm Power Plant, which has been mentioned as a
future museum or aquarium, and the design of the Lamar Boulevard
pedestrian bridge over Town Lake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Six architectural firms and several civic organizations are
contributing plans, models and drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Participants include Susman Tisdale Gayle, Steinbomer &AMP;
Associates, architect Dick Clark, DMJM of Los Angeles, Page
Southerland Page and Sinclair Black &AMP; Andrew Vernooy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the buildings to be highlighted will be Mezzaluna, Bitter
End, GSD&AMP;M Idea City, Cedar Street and the Schlotzsky's
headquarters. Residential projects will include the AMLI project
and the Brown Building, a historic office building on Eighth and
Colorado streets that has been converted into lofts.

 &HT;    Panel designs anti-gang program
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Warning that Texas faces a growing threat from
organized crime gangs, a special Texas Senate committee is poised
to recommend creation of a statewide Violent Gang Task Force to
better coordinate gang enforcement and monitoring efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In a report expected to be made public, a five-member Texas
Senate committee that has been studying gangs and juvenile justice
issues will recommend the task force be made up of representatives
from the prison system, police agencies and prosecutors _ to better
coordinate gang enforcement and monitoring efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Other recommendations include creation of a statewide computer
network to track gang members, stricter parole rules for imprisoned
gang members and a new 211 telephone help line for parents,
teachers and police.
</P>
<P>
   The 116-page report represents the most comprehensive look at
the growing gang-crime problem that the Legislature has undertaken
in several years. It also is a first step in what legislative
leaders have said they expect will be several new laws to crack
down on teen-aged street gangs and gang members in prisons when
lawmakers convene in January.
</P>
<P>
   In recommending the statewide computer database on gang members,
the report suggests police agencies across Texas should consider
standardizing gang data. It also suggests the Legislature consider
whether parents should be notified when their children are
designated as gang members, whether files on juveniles should be
purged as they grow older and stay out of trouble and whether
access to the gang database should be limited because of
constitutional privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Creation of a special three-digit phone number, patterned after
Atlanta's successful 211 system, would allow parents, police,
teachers and others to quickly and easily access information about
gang intervention, counseling and assistance programs. The
projected cost: $574,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the recommendations could carry a pricetag of more than
$49 million. More than $41 million of that is expected to be sought
by the Texas Youth Commission to expand juvenile lockups. The
state's current two-year budget is about $87 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Other recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   -Require the Texas Department of Public Safety to begin noting
on its computer files whether a crime was gang-related or a
criminal is a confirmed member of a prison gang, a move that could
help improve safety for street cops.
</P>
<P>
   -Require parole officials to more closely supervise gang members
who are released from prison, including tougher restrictions on
their movements and whom they associate with. Parole officials said
Wednesday they already are working on such new rules.
</P>
<P>
   -Require the Texas Education Agency, local public school
officials and Prairie View A&AMP;M University's Juvenile Crime
Prevention Institute to better train school personnel to identify
and report gang membership and gang behavior.
</P>
<P>
   -Bolster with additional money existing state programs for
at-risk youths, as a way to thwart what has become prison gangs'
biggest pool of new recruits. State Sen. Royce West, a Dallas
Democrat who heads the special committee, did not return a phone
call for comment Wednesday. But in a letter to Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock
accompanying the report, West urged ``a stronger commitment to
prevention and intervention services for our youth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to reducing juvenile delinquency lies in providing
at-risk youth with healthy alternatives such as after-school and
weekend programs, as well as offering more prevention and
intervention services for those children who show a need.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimating there could be more than 145,000 gang members in
Texas _ at least 5,000 of those in prisons _ the report says most
are members of teen-aged street gangs. But those in spray-painting
and vandalism gangs, who police say are increasingly working with
the more violent prison gangs, are part of a growing crime problem
all across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the report estimates Texas has 3,276 active youth gangs
_ second only to California. But despite the growth in numbers of
gang members, police in several major Texas cities estimate
gang-related crimes have dropped in the past two years _ 28 percent
in Austin alone.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, police say, is that more gang members are being
arrested and sent to prison at the same time as gangs are refining
the way they do business _ becoming more selective, oftentimes more
violent, in the types of crimes their members are involved in.

 &HT;    Burba becomes beacon of light in second playoff game
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND, Ohio _ Nearly an hour after the game, a crowd outside
the gates of Jacobs Field, far down the left field line, stood
chanting, ``Bur-ba, Bur-ba, Bur-ba.''
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, Dave Burba shouldn't have been anywhere near
Cleveland that afternoon. He should have been in a boat somewhere
in the Alaskan wilds baiting a hook.
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, Burba shouldn't have been anywhere near the
pitching mound Wednesday at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   He should have been relaxing in the Cleveland Indians bullpen,
cracking jokes and spitting sunflower seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Burba was thrust into the spotlight by some bizarre
events and was the day's stand-in star as the Indians crushed the
Boston Red Sox, 9-5, in Game 2 of the American League Division
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Burba not only saved the day, maybe he saved the series for the
Tribe, which drew even at a game apiece with the Red Sox in the
best-of-five, with the next two games in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's starter was Doc Gooden, who became embroiled in
combat with plate umpire Joe Brinkman three pitches into the game.
Four hitters into the game, the Red Sox led, 2-0, and Gooden was
gone _ ejected by Brinkman.
</P>
<P>
   Burba, a 15-game winner as a starter this year, but pushed to
the bullpen because of his experience there, was summoned to quell
the Gooden-Brinkman mess.
</P>
<P>
   Burba retired the two batters he faced in the bottom of the
first with no further damage and went on to pitch 5 1/3 innings of
three-run, four-hit baseball and was the winner when the Indians
scored one in the first, five in the second and one in the third
off knuckleballer Tim Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   In late March, Burba was scheduled to pitch Opening Day for the
Cincinnati Reds and during spring training he planned a postseason
fishing trip to Alaska because, after all, these were the
going-nowhere Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Burba, unhappy about the trade to Cleveland (for Sean Casey)
when it happened, recovered long enough to call his fishing friends
and say, ``Count me out, I'm going to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said Wednesday, ``Once the trade was made, I knew there
was a good chance to go to the postseason so I canceled the trip. .
.by the time we're through the water will be frozen over.''
</P>
<P>
   With Burba's help.
</P>
<P>
   The surreal stuff began on the Gooden's second and third pitches
to Boston leadoff hitter Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first pitch was a ball,'' Gooden said. ``I thought the
second and third pitches were strikes.'' Brinkman not only called
them both balls, he whipped off his mask and shouted at Gooden, who
backed off the mound with his palms up, as if to say, ``Hey, OK,
everything is all right.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't. According to Gooden, Brinkman kept yelling at
him. So Gooden walked toward the plate, bringing out manager Mike
Hargrove. After soothing Gooden, Hargrove confronted Brinkman with
some direct verbiage and was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden walked Lewis, walked John Valentin on a 3-and-2 count,
then struck out Mo Vaughn. Nomar Garciaparra drove one near the top
of the 19-foot high left field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis scored, but replays showed Valentin, trying to score from
first, was out easily. Brinkman called him safe. When replays were
shown and the 45,229 fans reacted, so did Gooden. He tried to get
at Brinkman and was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw the play, and he was in position, and I was right
behind him,'' Gooden said. ``Obviously, he was out. For some reason
Brinkley (Brinkman) called him safe. I was shocked. I was standing
right behind Brinkley (Brinkman) and it was not even a bang-bang
play. He was out by plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   Burba was thrust into the fray, but given all the time he needed
to warm up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagined I was starting the game, that it was 0-0 (it was
2-0, Boston),'' Burba said. ``I had plenty of time to get my
pitches ready, to get loose, to see which pitches were working and
which ones weren't. I was intent upon not letting what had just
happened affect me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing up stretching (in the bullpen) when I saw the
umpire throw Doc out, so I knew it was me,'' Burba said.
</P>
<P>
   David Justice, who had two hits and drove in four runs,
including a three-run home run in the five-run second, started the
Tribe back in the right direction with a sacrifice fly in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar contributed run-scoring doubles in the second and
third and Kenny Lofton had two hits, scored two and drove in one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three guys (Justice, Alomar, Lofton) are the guys
everybody targeted as having off years for us this year,'' Hargrove
said. ``It's a little ironic that these guys have stepped up big.
It doesn't surprise me. They're winners, they're good players,
they're good hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Burba, savoring the moment, admitted he wasn't thrilled with his
assignment in the bullpen after winning 15 as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my competitive nature and I wanted to start,'' Burba
said. ``I felt I was the backbone of the rotation all year. But as
Hargrove explained it to me, he had two young guys in the rotation
(Jaret Wright, Bartolo Colon), Doc Gooden is a bona fide starter
and he had no experience in the bullpen. So he said to me, 'You fit
the mold for what I need out there.' I told him, 'If that's what is
best for you and the team, I don't make waves, I'm there.'''
</P>
<P>
   As he walked down a tunnel toward the clubhouse after the game,
Burba smiled and said, ``This ranks right up there at the top of my
thrill list, but not as high as that home run I hit against the
Reds this year.''

 &HT;    What happened to the Cubs?
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It would be tempting to say the Cubs were hung over
from their Monday wild card playoff victory over San Francisco,
were emotionally spent, were lambs being led to the butcher.
</P>
<P>
   But then you'd have to explain all those other postseason games
John Smoltz has pitched exactly like this.
</P>
<P>
   What was the excuse in those?
</P>
<P>
   What was the Pirates' excuse in 1991 when they scored three runs
off Smoltz in 15 innings? The Twins' excuse in '91 (two runs in
14)? The Cards' excuse in '96 (two runs in 15 innings)? The
Yankees' excuse in '96 (one earned run in 14 innings)? The Dodgers'
excuse in '96 or the Astros in '97 when each scored one run in nine
innings?
</P>
<P>
   No, the Cubs needed no excuses Wednesday when they bowed to the
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prepared hard and we did everything we could do,'' Cubs
manager Jim Riggleman said. ``Smoltz was just the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' postseason monster bit off another head Wednesday as
Atlanta stuffed Chicago in the Divisional Series opener, 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   It was his 11th postseason victory, the most in baseball
history, one more than Whitey Ford and Dave Stewart. Yes, he has
had more opportunities, especially now that the playoffs are
three-tiered. But the fact is, his numbers are undeniable. Against
the best teams in the game, in 21 postseason starts, Smoltz is 11-3
with a 2.29 earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is,'' he said in the clubhouse later, ``I never
thought I'd be here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the hardest season of his career.
</P>
<P>
   And the best.
</P>
<P>
   How those two live together, Smoltz still can't say.
</P>
<P>
   ``God must have done it,'' he says. ``Really, I have no other
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   He was on the disabled list at the start of the year after
offseason elbow surgery. He went back on the D.L. in late May and
stayed a month.
</P>
<P>
   It hurt so badly, he was certain his career was over.
</P>
<P>
   When he came back off the second time, his elbow still bothering
him, he woke up nearly every morning wondering if he'd be able to
throw a ball. ``There must have been eight starts that I didn't
think I could make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he made every one.
</P>
<P>
   Final record: 17-3, his best percentage ever; 2.90 earned-run
average, second best ever, and better than his Cy Young season of
1996 when he was 24-8 with a 2.94.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it happened,'' he said again.
</P>
<P>
   The key at-bats Wednesday came in the top of the seventh after
Sammy Sosa whipped a double into the left-field corner to lead off.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs were down 3-0, but their guns were up _ Mark Grace, Oh
Henry Rodriguez and Gary ``The Rat'' Gaetti.
</P>
<P>
   Grace swung at the first pitch and popped up, flinging away his
bat in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him afterward if he was trying to doublecross Smoltz
because Grace usually swings at first pitches once per lunar
eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Grace said. ``I swing at a lot of first
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz was more honest. ``I threw him the fastball over the
plate because he almost always takes a pitch,'' Smoltz said. ``But
I didn't mean to have nothing on it. If I throw him that pitch
again, he'll get me more often than I get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz then struck out Rodriguez with a 3-2 changeup, and got
Gaetti to bounce to second to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as tough as ever,'' Gaetti said. ``He pitches me in,
then out and then I find myself jogging back to the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the universal postseason explanation when Smoltz pitches.
And with Tom Glavine going today and Greg Maddux in Game 3, the
Cubs likely won't see Smoltz again until next spring.

 &HT;    Dee and David Show delights in Columbus
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Call them the Killer D's. D-Lite. D'structive.
</P>
<P>
   Any way you tag them, the threat is always times-two with Ohio
State's David Boston and Dee Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most dangerous wide receiver tandem in college
football, Boston and Miller delight each Saturday in putting on The
Dee and David Show. Last season, the duo combined for 131
receptions, 1,951 yards and 19 touchdowns. In three games this
year, they've hauled in 35 catches for 509 yards and four
touchdowns. ``When the ball's in the air, I put my money on our
receivers, any day, against anybody,'' OSU quarterback Joe Germaine
said.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming Oct. 3 game against No. 7 Penn State (3-0), Miller
and Boston will get a chance to repeat the high-flying performance
they had against the Nittany Lions last season in combining for 22
receptions, 302 yards and two touchdowns. It was a career best
performance for each player.
</P>
<P>
   Their accomplishments were soured by a 31-27 Buckeye defeat, a
fate they hope to avoid this week when the Nittany Lions come to
Ohio Stadium for a battle of the unbeatens.
</P>
<P>
   With the 6-3 Boston and 6-1 Miller, OSU has a significant height
advantage over the Penn State defensive backs who are 5-9 , 5-8,
5-7 and 5-11. Miller says at times the height mismatch could factor
into the Buckeyes' game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if Joe (Germaine) puts a little bit of air underneath
the football, it gives Dave and I a chance to just jump up and make
some plays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Making plays is their speciality, although it took Miller, a
fifth year senior from Springfield South High School, a little
longer to get the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, a junior from Humble, Tex., waltzed into a starting job
_ ahead of Miller _ midway through his freshman season after Buster
Tillman got hurt. His game-winning touchdown catch in the Rose Bowl
made him an instant star and secured his position as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miller anxiously waited his turn. A knee injury had
sidelined him in 1994 and he received little playing time the next
two years, thanks in large part to Boston's arrival. Miller says he
doesn't begrudge his teammate for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that he's received and all the attention is
well-deserved,'' Miller said. ``I'm not a jealous guy. I just
wanted to come in and show everybody what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   He got his chance last fall when he was named the Buckeyes'
starting flanker. His breakout game came Oct. 11 at Penn State when
he caught a career-high eight passes for 149 yards. Boston set a
school single-game record for receptions during that same game with
14 for 153 yards.
</P>
<P>
   After a season in which Miller was a non-factor, it was quickly
becoming clear to opponents that OSU now had a double threat at
wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go after Dave because Dee will burn you,'' Germaine
said. ``You go after Dee, Dave will dunk you, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Boston: ``The better Dee plays ... the better it is for me.
It's great to have a talented receiver across from you so no one
can focus on one player.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller recognizes that Boston, who, in 1997, set a school
single-season record for receptions (73) and led the Big Ten in
that category, is still viewed by many as the marquee receiver for
OSU. He's just glad to be receiving partial billing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's still talking about Dave, but I think they're
starting to realize that we have another good receiver on the other
side, too,'' he said.

 &HT;    Computer problem freezes fingerprint ID in Florida
 &HT;    By Monika Gonzalez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dozens of crimes in Palm Beach County could be going unsolved
because the sheriff's computers can't compare fingerprints found at
crime scenes with those of criminals arrested in other parts of the
state, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While fingerprint experts said the now-two-year-old computer
communication problem in Palm Beach County should be fixed by
January, the delays it continues to bring investigators could be
the difference in whether a burglary victim gets her jewelry back
or whether a case's filing deadline will pass before a suspect is
found.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has affected six of Florida's largest counties. The
speed of technology is to blame, fingerprint examiners said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the state, it's not the local, it's not the
(computer) company. It's a little bit of everybody,'' said Pinellas
County fingerprint examiner Bill Schade. ``We're breaking new
ground. It's a tremendous program that's long overdue. The need is
so great and the benefit is tremendous. It's just a nightmare as
far as logistics.''
</P>
<P>
   It all comes down to a software compatibility problem that
actually stems from improvements to a network of state and local
fingerprint computers commonly known among police as AFIS _
Automated Fingerprint Identification System.
</P>
<P>
   AFIS allows police to check fingerprints found at a burglary
and, through recent advances, lets them see if the man they just
pulled in for stealing a car might be giving a different name from
the last time he was arrested, or is linked to another crime.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the system compares an unidentified fingerprint to
databases with fingerprints of those arrested in the county and the
state, returning several possible matches. A fingerprint examiner
then checks each manually.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office AFIS _ like its
statewide counterpart run by the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement _ was growing outdated, said Palm Beach County AFIS
supervisor Mark McDonald. Both agencies decided to upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's office completed its upgrade first in October 1996
_ knowing it wouldn't be compatible with Tallahassee's AFIS until
the state switched to the new system, McDonald said. During that
time, only searches of the county fingerprint database would be
possible. Everyone expected it to take about six months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time FDLE completed its improvements, the statewide
AFIS system upgrade surpassed the Palm Beach County system _ and
the two still were incompatible. The sheriff's office then chose to
get another upgrade that would also allow it to electronically add
fingerprints to the state database as inmates are booked into the
jail.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald hopes that will happen by January. In the meantime, on
major cases, detectives take fingerprints to a county that remains
in communication with Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Once the systems are linked, Palm Beach County fingerprint
examiners will run the hundreds of unidentified fingerprints
collected over the last two years against the statewide database.
It could mean suspects will be developed in a slew of cases.
</P>
<P>
   But solving crimes is often a race against time, Palm Beach
County fingerprint examiner Jay Mullins said. Getting victims'
belongings back often depends on police finding the suspect
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Running the unidentified fingerprints will probably take at
least a year because of staffing levels, McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any cases that the statute of limitations have run out will be
put at the end,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade, Broward, Collier, Lee and Pinellas counties all lost
their Tallahassee link for some time after the state upgraded.
Broward went six months without the ability to search the state
database, but now has a temporary, limited link to Tallahassee.
Dade County went on line with FDLE only Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County appears to have spent the most time without a
link to the state AFIS. The county has spent nearly $1 million over
the past 10 years on the system.
</P>
<P>
   Most county AFIS systems get the majority of their matches from
their own local databases, officials said. Prior to losing its link
to the statewide database, Palm Beach County sheriff's fingerprint
examiners were getting about two or three matches a month from the
state database. Miami-Dade police got about 20 hits last month from
the state database, officials there said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really significant in the big picture, but I'd like
to get those three or four,'' said Cpl. Joseph Barber, manager for
the Collier/Lee AFIS.
</P>
<P>
   endit
</P>
<P>
   KickerHed goes here
</P>
<P>
   QuickReadBecause of computer problems, the Palm Beach County
sheriff's office hasn't been able to compare fingerprints found
here with a state database of criminals. Here's how the system is
supposed to work:
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified fingerprint is scanned into a computer that
compares it to the fingerprints of nearly everyone arrested in Palm
Beach County in roughly the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The computer may find several possible matches or ``hits'' and a
fingerprint examiner checks each manually.
</P>
<P>
   If no true matches are found, the examiner then searches
another, larger database that includes everyone that has been
arrested in the state and is run by the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement in Tallahassee.

 &HT;    DA going for murder in Himalaya case
 &HT;    By Bob Banta and Leah Quin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ It's a harrowing case. A 15-year-old girl is thrown off
a carnival ride and killed as her father watches. Accusations
surface that carnival owners, operators, inspectors and maintenance
workers knew the ride had problems and ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   But is it murder? ``I do not know all the facts of this case,
but it is a mystery to me how the district attorney plans to show
intent to murder,'' said Travis County District Judge Jon Wisser,
who presides over criminal cases, including murder trials.
</P>
<P>
   Wisser lowered the bail for all nine people, including the
owners of an Arizona carnival company, that a Travis County grand
jury indicted Tuesday for murder in the death of Leslie Lane. The
McNeil High School student was thrown from the Himalaya carnival
ride at the Austin-Travis County Livestock Show &AMP; Rodeo on March
19.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said murder charges in mechanical mishaps are
stunningly rare and that winning convictions will be tough, if not
impossible. ``The bail I set is more in line with a charge of
criminally negligent homicide, which most cases like this end up
being,'' Wisser said. He set bail for four of the defendants at
$10,000 and bail for the other five at $25,000 -- compared to the
$75,000 to $500,000 recommended by the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Murder is punishable by five to 99 years in prison. The
punishment for criminally negligent homicide is six months to two
years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The murder indictments shocked legal observers, who said it is
unusual for any criminal charges to be filed against company
executives in such cases, much less murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Ronnie Earle was out of the country and not
available for comment. Earle's chief assistant, Rosemary Lehmberg,
said it is possible the indictments against executives and
employees of B&AMP;B Amusements, owners of the ride, will be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not backing off the indictment,'' Lehmberg said. ``But
it is not unusual that, after interaction with the defense
attorneys, some fine-tuning could occur. However, it's premature to
be talking about that right now.'' Lehmberg declined Wednesday to
say whether district attorneys had asked the grand jury to return
murder indictments against the nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the grand jury thought that what they heard was
egregious enough that the individuals should stand charged with a
high degree of criminal responsibility,'' she said. Lehmberg said
if prosecutors see that other charges are more appropriate, the
indictments could be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury returned murder indictments against Robert Dale
Merten Sr., his wife Shara Merten, and their son, Robert Merten II,
owners of Arizona-based B&AMP;B Amusements, which owned the Himalaya.
The indictments also named B&AMP;B maintenance workers Ottis Frasure
and Jeff Campbell, and the two B&AMP;B workers operating the ride that
night, Daniel Tucker and Joshua Johnson. Robert Gill and Joe Culver
of Bob Gill &AMP; Associates, a Florida-based company that inspected
the Himalaya, also were indicted. John Yeager, attorney for the
Mertens, said the grand jury overreacted. ``Clearly, indicting the
Mertens as if they consciously desired to cause the death of Leslie
Lane is totally inappropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frasure's lawyer, David Wahlberg of Austin, said Frasure would
plead not guilty to murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is an attempt by the district attorney's
office to send a message to the amusement industry,'' Wahlberg
said. ``But using the grand jury process to send a message is an
abuse of that process.'' Lane's family attended the livestock show
every year, though her father said he had always been a little
concerned about the safety of the rides.
</P>
<P>
   On March 19, Lane, her 9-year-old brother and a 16-year-old
friend were in Car No. 19 of the Himalaya, a circular coaster on an
undulating track. As the car crested a rise, all three children
were flung to the platform. Lane, who struck a wall, died there,
the restraining bar beside her.
</P>
<P>
   Austin police said the lap bar intended to keep riders in place
broke away at all three points connecting it to the car. An
investigation by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission found
Car No. 19 had a faulty lock and showed signs of wear at the bar's
base.
</P>
<P>
   Government and court records showed a history of accidents
involving the Himalaya, though none fatal. In a case similar to
Lane's, two California riders were injured because the pins
attaching the lap bar were not in place. Investigators in the Lane
case said cotter pins holding the lap bar to the car had sheared
off and that carnival workers told them the pins were sometimes
smaller than required.
</P>
<P>
   Most fatalities involving industrial mishaps are dealt with
through civil lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   If charges are filed, the vast majority are the equivalent of
criminally negligent homicide or manslaughter, which don't require
proof of intent to kill.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 20 years, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, which protects workers, has referred no more than
about 130 cases to federal prosecutors, said Bill Wright, a
spokesman for the federal agency. Of those, most were not accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most famous case of a company being criminally
charged in connection with deaths was one involving Ford Motor Co.,
which produced the Pinto wagon in the 1970s. A federal
investigation found the Pinto's gas tank could be easily punctured
in a rear-end collision, causing the car to catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   An internal memo disclosed Ford had conducted a cost-benefit
analysis that concluded it was cheaper to pay to settle civil
lawsuits filed by victims' families if deaths occurred than recall
all the Pintos and change the fuel systems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Ford became the first American corporation ever
indicted or prosecuted on criminal homicide charges. The company
was acquitted in 1980, although a jury hearing the civil lawsuit
awarded the victims $128.5 million. A judge later reduced the
judgment, the largest amount awarded at the time, to $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Professors at the University of Texas Law School said the murder
charges were surprising and extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   To prove murder, prosecutors must show B&AMP;B officials knew their
actions _ and in this case, their machinery _ would kill someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very high burden to carry,'' said Michael Sharlot,
dean of the law school. ``To say they did this and knew it was
reasonably certain to cause death ... wow.''
</P>
<P>
   An example of such a case is a person who purposely drops a
large stone off a 20-story building, Sharlot said. The person may
not aim it at a particular victim, but a rock dropped from that
height is expected to kill someone.
</P>
<P>
   Charging company owners with murder is rare but not
unprecedented, according to veteran trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1986, a trial was held in San Antonio in a case in
which the president, vice president, nursing consultant, and other
executives of Autumn Hills Convalescent Centers Inc. were accused
of murder.
</P>
<P>
   An 87-year-old woman died in a Texas City nursing home owned by
the corporation. Police charged she died from neglect.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly seven months, a jury deadlocked over whether to
convict the company and its executives. A judge dismissed the jury
and the chief prosecutor, Galveston District Attorney Mike Guarino,
dropped the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We based our case on the position that the defendants
knowingly _ not intentionally _ but knowingly neglected these
fragile patients and deprived them of their needed care,'' Guarino
recalled. ``We were not successful. Juries don't identify
defendants like these with the usual criminal type that shoots a
gun.''

 &HT;    ``Megan's Law'' upheld by Ohio court
 &HT;    By Wendy Hundley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ohio Supreme Court on Sept. 30 upheld the state's ``Megan's
Law,'' saying sexual predators must register with the county
sheriff even if they committed the crime before the law went into
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-0 decision reverses a ruling last year by the 3rd Ohio
District Court of Appeals in Lima that barred enforcement of the
law in Auglaize, Mercer and Shelby counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision means that every Ohioan can feel safer,''
said Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery. ``Now, in all 88
counties, before every judge in the state, sex offenders will be
required to register, and communities will have a right to know
when an offender is in their midst.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruling stems from the first challenge to the
law.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court in Lima ruled that community notification
violated the Ohio Constitution's ban on retroactive punishment. It
held that the law could not apply to anyone who committed an
offense before July 1, 1997, when the law took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, at least two other appellate courts have made
similar rulings, creating a situation where some communities were
notified of sex predators and others were not.
</P>
<P>
   In reversing the 3rd District ruling, the Supreme Court found
the sex offender law does not violate the retroactivity clauses of
either the state or United State constitutions since the
registration requirements were ``remedial'' and not punitive.
</P>
<P>
   The high court acknowledged that sex offenders may be ostracized
or harassed because of the public notification requirement.
</P>
<P>
   However, it found that these consequences aren't the direct
result of the law, ``but instead as a direct societal consequence
of (the offender's) past actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also found that the government's interest in
protecting the public from sex offenders outweighed a sex
offender's expectations of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Most states now have laws modeled after the 1994 New Jersey case
in which Megan Kanka was lured into the home of a two-time sex
offender. The 7-year-old girl was raped and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's law requires sheriffs to notify neighbors, area schools
and day-care centers when a sexual predator moves into a community.
</P>
<P>
   The law defines a sexual predator as someone who has been
convicted of a sex crime and who is likely to be a repeat offender,
and must register with the sheriff every 90 days for life.
</P>
<P>
   It defines two lesser categories:
</P>
<P>
   Habitual offender: A person convicted of more than one sex
offense who must register with the sheriff once a year for 20
years; a judge can decide if the community should be notified.
</P>
<P>
   Sexually oriented offender: Generally a first-time offender;
required to register with the sheriff once a year for 10 years;
neighbors will not be notified.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, 1,958 sex offenders have registered, according to
Montgomery's office. Of these, 136 are sexual predators; 84 are
habitual offenders (14 with notification, 70 without); and 1,738
are sexually oriented offenders.

 &HT;    The ants march two-by-two into the nation's theaters
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ DreamWorks' Antz , a computer-animated insect
adventure featuring the voices of Woody Allen, Sylvester Stallone
and Sharon Stone, tromps into theaters today. Disney's A Bug's Life
, a similarly styled film from the creators of Toy Story , follows
on its six heels on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   In a year of competing asteroid flicks ( Deep Impact and
Armageddon ), as well as two films about boys afflicted with
Morquio Syndrome ( Simon Birch and the forthcoming The Mighty ),
the warring ants will be the most closely watched race of all.
DreamWorks moved its film's release date up from spring 1999 when
partial subsidiary Pacific Digital Images delivered Antz ahead of
schedule, allowing the studio to get a seven-week jump on the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually didn't know there was another movie,'' DreamWorks
co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg said, jokingly, at a news conference
prior to Antz 's Sept. 19 premiere at the Toronto International
Film Festival. Katzenberg was head of Disney motion-picture
production during A Bug's Life 's development, prompting industry
debate over Antz 's origins.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his casual attire, Katzenberg's presence among the media
at a panel discussion with Antz 's cast and directors did not go
unnoticed. The film's star power and rushed release date
demonstrate his studio's desire to be king of the ant hill.
</P>
<P>
   Antz 's voice cast also includes Gene Hackman, Anne Bancroft,
Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lopez, Danny Glover, Dan Aykroyd and
Jane Curtin. A Bug's Life features Kevin Spacey, Dave Foley and
Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   Director Tim Johnson, who served as animation director of The
Simpsons ' 1995 Halloween special, Homer3 , admitted it was
intimidating to be going up against the makers of Toy Story .
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid that if people saw our film after their movie it
would be nothing but compared, and the film would never stand up on
its own,'' Johnson said. ``So to me, the greatest thing about being
into the theaters before them is people will judge this movie for
what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Antz tells the story of Z-4195 (Allen), a worker ant who dreams
of a life beyond the unyielding caste system of his colony. When he
falls for the beautiful Princess Bala (Stone), Z swaps places with
his best friend, a soldier ant named Weaver (Stallone). Surviving a
fierce battle with termites, Z becomes an unlikely hero, and soon
finds himself leading a revolution against regimented conformity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, human beings always try to displace their own
emotions to understand themselves through animals,'' said Glover,
who plays Barbatus, a seasoned soldier who takes Z under his wing.
``The idea that we take this insignificant little being and try to
understand something about loving, ideas, dreams and all, is
intriguing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Antz took nearly three years to develop from traditional pencil
drawings to state-of-the-art digital animation. Much of that time
was spent creating the details and nuances that convey what the
character is thinking. ``It has a lot less to do with big broad
gestures than the very subtle things _ it might do with the brow or
the corner of the mouth,'' co-director Eric Darnell explained.
``And the animators work very hard on that. I think on average, a
good animator is lucky to do five seconds a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice actors recorded their dialogue individually, most in
two or three sessions lasting several hours each. Saturday Night
Live veterans Aykroyd and Curtin, who play a pair of snobbish wasps
named Chip and Muffy, recorded their banter in separate cities,
weeks apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like doing radio,'' Curtin said. ``You're using your
wits, you're using your instrument and there's no facade, so you
can have a lot more fun with it, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No worry about weight loss or gain, either,'' Aykroyd added,
drawing laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, on the other hand, found it difficult to convey emotion
and sentiment using only her voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about doing a three-hour session, and at the end of
that you're truly exhausted,'' Darnell said, ``because they have to
put so much imagination, so much energy, into standing in this
empty room with just a microphone and to pull all of this stuff out
and get that into their performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast was videotaped as they recorded their voices, giving
the animators live-action reference for the gestures and movement
they put into their performances. While the arthropods don't
resemble the actors voicing them, their personalities are familiar
_ to everyone but the actors, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognized everybody but me,'' said Walken, who plays Col.
Cutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they got the length of my stinger too short,'' Aykroyd
quipped, again breaking up the room.
</P>
<P>
   Having such strongly identifiable voices can be a mixed
blessing, Johnson admitted. While there's a certain pleasure to
recognizing a famous voice, ``you really do want to lose yourself
in the characters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aykroyd used the example of Robin Williams as Aladdin 's Genie.
``We all knew it was Robin Williams, but he sold that character and
you didn't associate him, as the live actor, with the character
because it was just such a strong piece of animation, and marriage
of his ability with the animator's skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, whose character is introduced on a therapist's couch,
kvetching about being ``the middle child in a family of 5
million,'' signed on early in the process, allowing the directors
to fashion and mold the film to his character and his way of
working from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to know what our expectations were when we went in
to meet him,'' Johnson recalled. ``I guess I thought that as
somebody who is so accomplished as a director, that it might be
hard to have him see what we wanted in our vision for the film. But
the opposite was true. He looked at the script and he loved the
script and he said, `Guys, you tell me how to be successful for
your movie.'
</P>
<P>
   ``From that moment on, Eric and I would be sitting there in the
sound booth, Woody Allen would be reading our script and
improvising on it and changing words and making it much more
hysterical, and I would turn to Eric and say, `Here we are in the
middle of Manhattan and there all these people who just paid $75 to
see shows all over the city, and we've got the best show in town
right here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks certainly hopes that's the case.

 &HT;    Christian student organizations file discrimination suit against
universities
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should universities be allowed to provide operating money to
student organizations geared toward a single racial or sexual
orientation while denying Christian student organizations or
political groups similar funding?
</P>
<P>
   The question lies at the heart of a federal lawsuit filed
recently in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati in which four
Christian organizations and 11 students at Miami University
challenge the constitutionality of the school's policies on
allocating student activity fees.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit _ filed against Miami's president, vice president of
student affairs and dean of students _ claims that the university's
practice of refusing to allow Christian student organizations
access to student-activities money used to subsidize dozens of
other student groups violates the Christian organizations'
free-speech rights. The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages and
a court order barring Miami from using its current funding system.
About $34 per student is collected annually to support more than
120 campus organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The issues have raged on other college campuses, and in other
courtrooms as well: Members of Wright State University's College
Republicans group stirred controversy in February 1997 in a letter
to the student newspaper challenging the spending of university
money on specialized student groups. The controversy culminated in
a spirited 90-minute debate and public forum attended by 150
students featuring members of the Republican group, WSU's Black
Student Union and a gay and lesbian student group.
</P>
<P>
   WSU's funding policies are similar to Miami's: student groups
that are religious or political in nature may apply for one-time
grants to pay for special events, but generally do not receive
operating subsidy as do many other student organizations. However,
unlike Miami, WSU does not collect student-activity fees separately
from general fees, WSU officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the
University of Wisconsin at Madison could not force students to
finance campus groups that engage in political and religious
activities. For now, the ruling applies only to campuses in
Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana. Three university students had sued
the Madison college in 1996. In February 1998, five students at the
University of Minnesota filed a similar lawsuit against their
school.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has not affected private colleges such as the
University of Dayton and Cedarville College as much as it has
public universities. UD officials said student organizations raise
their own operating money but can apply for grants to pay for
seminars, speakers, newsletters and similar activities.
</P>
<P>
   Miami officials indicated they would vigorously defend their
position, pointing out two of the student religious groups suing _
a group called For the Love of God, and Sigma Theta Epsilon, a
Christian fraternity _ received student fee money last year. The
Christian Council and the Christian Coalition are also listed as
plaintiffs in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about access to funding. It's about using
mandatory fees to support religion,'' Miami spokesman Richard
Little said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami officials say they know they have students from many
diverse religions on campus and don't believe it's fair to use
student activity money to support a particular religious group.
Even academic honorary organizations, which exclude most students,
are not eligible for operating subsidies from student activity
fees, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Campus-based religious and political organizations may apply to
student government for funding for specific events and are eligible
for office space. But because the First Amendment prohibits public
funding for religious and political activities, the groups are not
eligible for operating subsidies from the university, Miami
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Randy Blankenship, an attorney who filed the lawsuit on
behalf of the student organizations and students, said funding
should be open to all student groups, regardless of ideological
advocacy. Blankenship said some of the students he represents have
attempted for years to change Miami's policy, ``but they basically
were just getting stonewalled by the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami officials said Blankenship's clients were asked to
participate in a review of the school's funding methods for
religious and political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose litigation over working within the system,'' said
Richard Nault, Miami's dean of students.

 &HT;    State judge freezes assets of Austin Forex
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A state district judge recently froze assets
that Russell Erxleben may have received from his failed Austin
Forex International Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The move prevents him from moving money from investors into
other accounts or from selling items such as autos that are owned
by the company.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary injunction, granted by District Judge Pete Lowry,
was requested by attorneys representing investors.
</P>
<P>
   It lasts until a civil trial on charges against Erxleben and
several other defendants is held. A preliminary trial date was set
for May.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate court hearing, District Judge Suzanne Covington
allowed the State Securities Board to transfer $200,000 from a bank
account of a company affiliated with Austin Forex to the receiver
handling the case.
</P>
<P>
   The receiver is trying to find out what happened to an estimated
$40 million to $60 million invested with Austin Forex by 700
people.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 18, the State Securities Board took control of the
accounts and books at the foreign currency trading company and got
a state court to appoint a receiver to determine what has happened
to investors' money. The company closed Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Erxleben, a former football All-American kicker at the
University of Texas, has maintained that the money was lost in
trading losses and the actions of unidentified ``third parties.''
He was not in court on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys at the securities agency say it may be months before
the receiver can determine how much money may be left.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Goldsmith, who requested the injunction, said that prior
to that action there wasn't sufficient protection to keep assets at
Austin Forex and its affiliate, International Foreign Exchange
Corp., from being moved.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Erxleben, Austin Forex and its affiliate, the injunction
includes any of the company's assets held in Bank of America or
Comerica Bank accounts, or by Michael Shapiro, a former Austin
Forex executive.
</P>
<P>
   The assets may include several high-dollar cars. Texas motor
vehicle registration records show that since July 1997, Austin
Forex has purchased a $48,459 1998 Lexus GS4, a $62,594 Mercedes, a
1995 Mercedes 420 and a $43,366 Chevy sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   John Stratton, Erxleben's attorney, said after losing the fight
over the temporary injunction that the court's action has ``no
impact whatsoever'' on Erxleben's personal assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence that Mr. Erxleben has any of that
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, three investors testified that they separately
invested a total of more than $1 million with Erxleben's company
just weeks before it closed. Erxleben, they said, gave no
indication the company could be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   He also told them that a small percentage of the company's funds
were actually invested at any one time, they said. Mark Miller, an
Austin real estate appraiser, said he invested $240,000 with Austin
Forex between February and August.
</P>
<P>
   He said that during a meeting on Aug. 28, Erxleben told him that
Austin Forex was grossing between $1.6 million and $1.8 million a
month and he was personally earning $300,000 and $500,000 a month
from commissions.
</P>
<P>
   He said Erxleben told him that Austin Forex was then trading $40
million for investors.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Miller said Erxleben called him to invite him
to put in more money because ``the currency markets were moving
quite a bit and he had the opportunity to make quite a bit of money
for investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on his solicitation, Miller said he had his last $50,000
investment wired to Austin Forex.
</P>
<P>
   Austin businessmen John Gilmore and James Wayne McMichael gave
similar testimony.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Stratton argued that each witnesses was a wealthy,
sophisticated investor who should have understood the contract they
were signing.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, who said he invested $650,000 with Austin Forex,
identified himself as a real estate investor who owns several dozen
properties worth at least $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   McMichael, who invested $60,000 in Austin Forex, said he has
managed and owned more than 100 properties worth $15 million to $20
million, and previously had oil and gas interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``They admitted they knew the arrangement and didn't withdraw
their money,'' Stratton said.
</P>
<P>
   Erxleben, he said, ``was the agent merely as a trader,
authorized to trade'' and wasn't acting in a fiduciary role for
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The State Securities Board has claimed that Austin Forex and
Erxleben violated state securities laws, in part, because of the
way the investors' funds were co-mingled.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lowry asked Stratton what chance investors had of getting
their money back. Stratton said it may be possible to recover from
third parties a substantial amount, ``even if they've been lost in
trades.''

 &HT;    'Miracle' works miracles for Pax TV
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Thomas, whose role as John-Boy in The WaltonsThe
Walton's was as wholesome as wholesome gets, will host family
friendly PAX TV's show ``It's a Miracle,'' Paxson Communications
Chairman Lowell ``Bud'' Paxson said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas joins actress Nia Peeples as co-host of the show,
replacing country singer Billy Dean. The change is set for this
Sunday Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tweaking 'It's a Miracle,''' Paxson said. ``It's like
our Mona Lisa -- we just have to change the frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Lea Sloan, spokeswoman for the West Palm Beach-based Paxson
Communications, said that Dean had been signed for only three
episodes. ``He has a very active music deal which is making it
impossible for him to do two things,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean's publicist, Lisa Gladfelter Bell of Force Inc. in
Nashville, said, ``It was mutual.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean was traveling more than he had expected between Nashville
and Los Angeles, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gladfelter Bell also said the new host was one of many changes
for the month-old series. ``They seem to be struggling with this
one,'' she said. ``I know they changed the format and got a whole
new production company. (Dean) just kind of bailed out. It was one
of those mutual things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Miracle'' is a one-hour weekly series that airs at 9
p.m. Sunday. The program tells stories of real-life miracles, such
as a pet that saved family members' lives and the success of a
young man who started life as a drug-addicted, abandoned baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the shows that's getting an incredible reaction,''
Paxson said. The program invites viewers to tell of their miracles,
Paxson said, noting that the show has now collected enough tales to
last it into the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how often God shows his face in people's
lives,'' Paxson said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Miracle is one of the original shows the nation's new
seventh network is airing. PAX's foundation is reruns of Touched by
an Angel, Diagnosis Murder and Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. But it
also airs original programming, including new episodes of Flipper
and Neon Rider .
</P>
<P>
   Thomas already stars in a program that runs Sunday mornings on
PAX: The Adventures of Swiss Family Robinson. The show runs as part
of the block of children's programming on Saturday and Sunday
mornings that PAX has dubbed Cloud Nine.
</P>
<P>
   While Gladfelter Bell said Dean doesn't have any other
television shows lined up yet, he is starring in a movie of the
week, Makeover, Paxson Communications (AMEX: PAX, $9.19) launched
PAX Aug. 31. The network programming will air on 95 stations that
Paxson will own, operate or is affiliated with once all its deals
are completed. The stations are in markets with more than 76
million households with televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson's West Palm Beach station is WPXP-Channel 67.

 &HT;    Silly Pigeons is right on target
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Palm Beach Post-Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jaunty crime tales are at least as old as the 18th century and
The Beggar's Opera. But they were never standard fare. Late this
century, however, a dark comedy about your average serial killer is
as common as bloody murder itself. Wild and crazy mischief pays.
Examples are Elmore Leonard's novels and the Coen brothers' movies.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the trend represents a kind of exorcism, like making fun
of the devil at Halloween. In any case, add rookie director David
Dobkin to the roster of movie-makers who combine low crime and
eccentric criminals with a police procedural that is both wacky and
intense.
</P>
<P>
   Dobkin's Clay Pigeons takes its cue from the Coens. There are no
Fargo wood chippers. But there is an offbeat killer and a schmo who
is ensnared in another man's crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The film isn't slick. The plot is a tad overstuffed, and the
score shrieks. A typically ``subtle'' joke occurs when a corpse is
pulled from a lake and we hear the theme from Deliverance. And can
you stand another Deputy Doofus in the Barney Fife mold? (Can't
anybody make a film these days without cutesy references to pop
culture?)
</P>
<P>
   But Dobkin, a music video director, gets good performances from
Vince Vaughn and Joaquin Phoenix. Even Janeane Garofolo's Medusa
mug has its charms. She plays an FBI agent who doesn't suffer
fools, and she has one fine bit when a crack appears in her deadpan
during a barroom pickup scene.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Pigeons is a movie created by youngish people for youngish
people. It's rambunctious and engaging, and wastes no time in
getting down to business.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is Clay Bidwell, a gas station attendant in a Montana
hick town. While shooting at beer bottles one afternoon, Clay is
suddenly accused by a buddy of sleeping with his wife (Georgina
Cates).
</P>
<P>
   This is true enough. But Clay is a decent lout. He doesn't
deserve to have his pal commit suicide in front of him, especially
when this pal has taken pains to make sure Clay is framed for the
``murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Frantic, Clay makes a mistake _ the first of many that will make
him chief suspect in a string of grisly murders. With every move he
makes, he digs a deeper hole for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Happy to lend a shovel is Clay's new best bud Lester Long
(Vaughn). With his Stetson and fringy duds, Lester is a dime store
cowboy who suddenly appears in town and leeches onto Clay. His glib
patter and palsy manner _ not to mention a reflexive cackle _ make
him a dude to keep a wary eye on.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Ed Healy gives us a fair number of twists, although
some wind up in too-neat circles. Vaughn (The Lost World) is a
chameleon of an actor, and brings a hypnotic touch of smiling
menace to his role. No pretty boy, Phoenix is convincing as an
average guy at loose ends, whose decent impulses and bad habits
combine to get him in plenty of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As a weary small town sheriff, veteran actor Scott Wilson holds
the moral center of a shifty universe in which the ordinary can
turn creepy. Cates is dislikable (and that's good) as a bored wife
who is loose in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   A story of a killer playing mind games with the innocent is
hardly new. And it doesn't get any fresher if you add a bouncy
sensibility. But despite its stylized moments, including an
unnecessarily prolonged stabbing scene, Clay Pigeons holds your
interest through good acting and, strange to say, silly humor.

 &HT;    Vaughn invented spine-tingling guffaw just for movie
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elvis Eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Vaughn's got them. But wait. He didn't have them in The
Lost World: Jurassic Park. Or did he? Maybe he wore them for his of
a wannabe Lothario in Swingers _ the breakthrough movie for the
28-year-old actor?
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn just cackles at the thought of Elvis. It's the eerie
laughter of his weirdo character in Clay Pigeons. He created that
guffaw for the film, and he doesn't mind using it as the answer to
questions during a recent phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   So who knows? Vaughn is proving himself such a crafty actor,
maybe he can make his eyes look different from movie to movie.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is an official Hollywood ``rising young star'' _ a phrase
that gets another Woody Woodpecker cackle from him. ``I just feel
like being in Los Angeles for 7 1/2 years, with a year and a half
without any work at all _ well, I am enjoying the chance to rise
for any job.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's kin were Midwestern farmers, but he largely grew up in
the Chicago suburbs. He went to Los Angeles at 18, after an
appearance in a Chevy commercial made him think he would cruise to
stardom. What followed was the long road of doing not much.
</P>
<P>
   The small-budget film Swingers led to a big-time phone call _
from Steven Spielberg. He wanted Vaughn to play the daring
documentary-maker in The Lost World. Spielberg said he was looking
for ``a new movie star _ an American icon to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Like slasher Norman Bates? That's Vaughn's upcoming role in the
remake of Psycho with director Gus Van Sant. He couldn't pass up
the challenge of reprising a classic.
</P>
<P>
   As for Van Sant, Vaughn said ``he's a great director who gives
you the opportunity to be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   In Clay Pigeons, Vaughn makes another dubious character come
alive. He's slick and sinister. ``I figured this guy had a bad
experience of some kind. He didn't like his reality, so he created
his own. But I didn't want to make him a psycho-Frankenstein,''
Vaughn said. Cackle. Cackle.

 &HT;    CIGARETTE COMPANIES LEAD SURGE IN LOBBYING COSTS
 &HT;    600&AMP;adds. With LOBBY-LIST for release Saturday, Oct.3.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Led by a British-owned cigarette maker, big
businesses and pressure groups are spending record amounts to
influence the federal government this year.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., a subsidiary of BAT Plc.,
spent an unprecedented $18.2 million on federal lobbying between
January and June, the latest available records show.
</P>
<P>
   That pace of $3 million a month is ``roughly double what anybody
spent lobbying last year,'' commented Larry Makinson, executive
director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which
studies the role of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Another tobacco company, Philip Morris Cos. Inc., ranked second
with $14.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   A Cox Newspapers examination of lobbying disclosure reports
filed with the U.S. House of Representatives found that the next
highest spenders were Bell Atlantic, $9.6 million; the American
Medical Association (AMA), $8.3 million, and the Chamber of
Commerce of the United States, $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined the latest semi-annual reports of all
registrants who had reported spending more than $500,000 in the
first six months of 1997 or $1 million in that entire year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 97 organizations reported spending at least $1
million apiece between January and June. In the first half of last
year, only 89 spent that much.
</P>
<P>
   Total spending by the 100 biggest spenders in the first six
months of 1998 exceeded $264 million _ a 13 percent increase over
the approximately $235 million spent by the top 100 in the first
six months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think lobbying is getting more expensive in Washington,''
said Elaine Acevedo, president of the American League of Lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to have mostly generalists, but now you have people
specializing,'' she said. ``You hire your grass-roots coordinator
here, your independent-expenditure specialist there, your
focus-group specialist over there, and it all adds up.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, a lobbying blitz led by Philip Morris, the world's
largest tobacco company, and Brown &AMP; Williamson, the American
branch of the world's second largest, crushed a year-long attempt
in Congress to pass the National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking
Reduction Act.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, killed in the Senate by a Republican-led filibuster,
would have imposed high costs and tight rules on the industry and
its customers in return for federal protection from class-action
lawsuits under a plan drafted by the attorneys general of most
states.
</P>
<P>
   The battle could resume next year. So, tobacco companies have
continued to supplement their lobbying with political contributions
and with print, radio and TV ads that by the end of July had
already cost their sponsors more than $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most expensive and sustained issue advertising
campaign ever undertaken on a piece of pending legislation,''
according to Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School
of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   At his Washington-based research center, Makinson said, ``The
tobacco companies are very smart and very rich, and they're not shy
about operating on a war-like basis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for freedom of speech,'' said Mark Smith, a
spokesman at Brown &AMP; Williamson's headquarters in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We faced the largest possible tax increase and restrictions
that would have jeopardized many tobacco companies' actual
existence,'' he said. ``We had to do what the Constitution allows,
and lobby the U.S. Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional adds follow.)
</P>
<P>
   The companies ranked just below the two tobacco giants also have
a lot at stake in federal policies that affect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic is one of the ``Baby Bell'' companies locked in a
fierce, multi-state battle with long-distance firms over how to
deregulate the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   The physicians in the AMA have stakes in battles between health
care providers, insurers and insured people over regulating managed
health care, cleaning up Medicaid fraud and restructuring the
financial incentives in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce is at the center of tax, trade,
minimum-wage and spending battles that affect bosses, workers and
shareholders in most communities in every state.
</P>
<P>
   Equally vital special interests are also at stake in this
Congress for the sixth through 10th biggest spenders on lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   They were the Edison Electric Institute (deregulation of
privately owned utilities), $5.5 million; American Council of Life
Insurance (entry into the insurance industry), $5.3 million;
General Motors Corp. (primarily trade, tax, environmental and
automotive policy), $4.9 million; Pfizer Inc. (primarily drug
licensing, health care and patent policy), $4.8 million, and Ford
Motor Co. (primarily automotive, trade, bankruptcy and
environmental policy) $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Because registrants use different methods of calculating
lobbying costs, comparisons between companies are imprecise. But
spending is clearly up this year.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the top 10 reported spending more in the first half of
this year than in the first half of last year. So did 63 of the top
100.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the biggest spenders ... were defending the status
quo, because after all a lot of them are big guys who are doing
quite well right now,'' said Bill Hogan, director of research
projects at the Washington-based Center for Public Integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average citizen thinks Congress doesn't do much,'' Hogan
said. ``Well, they don't stop and think that there are a lot of
people spending a lot of money getting Congress not to do much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides that, a lot of lobbyists love multi-year fights,''
Hogan said. ``Telecommunications has been in play for more than a
decade, and it's an unbelievable gravy train for Washington
lobbyists on all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add that can stand alone as a
sidebar follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Cox Newspapers examined the latest semi-annual reports filed
under the Lobby Disclosure Act with the clerk of the House and the
secretary of the Senate by organizations that use lobbyists. They
are supposed to provide ``best-faith estimates'' of how much they
spent, and list the lobbyists they employed or retained and the
laws or policies they sought to pass, block or modify.
</P>
<P>
   Reports for the first half of this year were due Aug. 15. The
public and press can examine them only after they are entered into
computers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the House reported that after 45 days of
processing the latest reports, ``virtually all'' of them had been
posted on the four computers the House lets the public use. In the
Senate, the estimate was 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cox contacted companies and associations directly when their
reports could not be found. All but two were willing to supply
copies of their reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like we ought to tighten that up,'' said Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz. ``Especially in a pre-election year, too long a
delay seems to restrict the public's right to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said, ``Maybe we ought to
handle lobby disclosure reports the way we do the reports on our
own personal finances.'' The Senate requires its clerk to let the
public see the annual reports of all senators and high-ranking
staff members on their personal finances 30 days after the filing
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyist Acevedo said, ``It's better than it used to be, when
they were all in boxes and you had to leaf through them. But it
strikes me as odd in this day and age that you still can't look
them up on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Registrants can report only their direct costs of lobbying the
federal legislative and executive branches, as the tobacco
companies did. But most of them choose to report the figure they
already calculate for tax purposes, which includes all federal,
state and local lobbying, plus such indirect costs as recruiting,
training and motivating ``grass-roots'' volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of organizations ignore the methods specified on the
official reporting forms and make their own calculations. ``None of
the methods apply to us,'' said a spokeswoman for the Seniors
Coalition, a conservative direct-mail organization.

 &HT;    Christian student organizations file discrimination suit against
universities
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should universities be allowed to provide operating money to
student organizations geared toward a single racial or sexual
orientation while denying Christian student organizations or
political groups similar funding?
</P>
<P>
   The question lies at the heart of a federal lawsuit filed
recently in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati in which four
Christian organizations and 11 students at Miami University
challenge the constitutionality of the school's policies on
allocating student activity fees.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit _ filed against Miami's president, vice president of
student affairs and dean of students _ claims that the university's
practice of refusing to allow Christian student organizations
access to student-activities money used to subsidize dozens of
other student groups violates the Christian organizations'
free-speech rights. The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages and
a court order barring Miami from using its current funding system.
About $34 per student is collected annually to support more than
120 campus organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The issues have raged on other college campuses, and in other
courtrooms as well: Members of Wright State University's College
Republicans group stirred controversy in February 1997 in a letter
to the student newspaper challenging the spending of university
money on specialized student groups. The controversy culminated in
a spirited 90-minute debate and public forum attended by 150
students featuring members of the Republican group, WSU's Black
Student Union and a gay and lesbian student group.
</P>
<P>
   WSU's funding policies are similar to Miami's: student groups
that are religious or political in nature may apply for one-time
grants to pay for special events, but generally do not receive
operating subsidy as do many other student organizations. However,
unlike Miami, WSU does not collect student-activity fees separately
from general fees, WSU officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the
University of Wisconsin at Madison could not force students to
finance campus groups that engage in political and religious
activities. For now, the ruling applies only to campuses in
Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana. Three university students had sued
the Madison college in 1996. In February 1998, five students at the
University of Minnesota filed a similar lawsuit against their
school.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has not affected private colleges such as the
University of Dayton and Cedarville College as much as it has
public universities. UD officials said student organizations raise
their own operating money but can apply for grants to pay for
seminars, speakers, newsletters and similar activities.
</P>
<P>
   Miami officials indicated they would vigorously defend their
position, pointing out two of the student religious groups suing _
a group called For the Love of God, and Sigma Theta Epsilon, a
Christian fraternity _ received student fee money last year. The
Christian Council and the Christian Coalition are also listed as
plaintiffs in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about access to funding. It's about using
mandatory fees to support religion,'' Miami spokesman Richard
Little said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami officials say they know they have students from many
diverse religions on campus and don't believe it's fair to use
student activity money to support a particular religious group.
Even academic honorary organizations, which exclude most students,
are not eligible for operating subsidies from student activity
fees, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Campus-based religious and political organizations may apply to
student government for funding for specific events and are eligible
for office space. But because the First Amendment prohibits public
funding for religious and political activities, the groups are not
eligible for operating subsidies from the university, Miami
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Randy Blankenship, an attorney who filed the lawsuit on
behalf of the student organizations and students, said funding
should be open to all student groups, regardless of ideological
advocacy. Blankenship said some of the students he represents have
attempted for years to change Miami's policy, ``but they basically
were just getting stonewalled by the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami officials said Blankenship's clients were asked to
participate in a review of the school's funding methods for
religious and political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose litigation over working within the system,'' said
Richard Nault, Miami's dean of students.

 &HT;    DA going for murder in Himalaya case
 &HT;    By Bob Banta and Leah Quin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ It's a harrowing case. A 15-year-old girl is thrown off
a carnival ride and killed as her father watches. Accusations
surface that carnival owners, operators, inspectors and maintenance
workers knew the ride had problems and ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   But is it murder? ``I do not know all the facts of this case,
but it is a mystery to me how the district attorney plans to show
intent to murder,'' said Travis County District Judge Jon Wisser,
who presides over criminal cases, including murder trials.
</P>
<P>
   Wisser lowered the bail for all nine people, including the
owners of an Arizona carnival company, that a Travis County grand
jury indicted Tuesday for murder in the death of Leslie Lane. The
McNeil High School student was thrown from the Himalaya carnival
ride at the Austin-Travis County Livestock Show &AMP; Rodeo on March
19.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said murder charges in mechanical mishaps are
stunningly rare and that winning convictions will be tough, if not
impossible. ``The bail I set is more in line with a charge of
criminally negligent homicide, which most cases like this end up
being,'' Wisser said. He set bail for four of the defendants at
$10,000 and bail for the other five at $25,000 -- compared to the
$75,000 to $500,000 recommended by the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Murder is punishable by five to 99 years in prison. The
punishment for criminally negligent homicide is six months to two
years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The murder indictments shocked legal observers, who said it is
unusual for any criminal charges to be filed against company
executives in such cases, much less murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Ronnie Earle was out of the country and not
available for comment. Earle's chief assistant, Rosemary Lehmberg,
said it is possible the indictments against executives and
employees of B&AMP;B Amusements, owners of the ride, will be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not backing off the indictment,'' Lehmberg said. ``But
it is not unusual that, after interaction with the defense
attorneys, some fine-tuning could occur. However, it's premature to
be talking about that right now.'' Lehmberg declined Wednesday to
say whether district attorneys had asked the grand jury to return
murder indictments against the nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the grand jury thought that what they heard was
egregious enough that the individuals should stand charged with a
high degree of criminal responsibility,'' she said. Lehmberg said
if prosecutors see that other charges are more appropriate, the
indictments could be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury returned murder indictments against Robert Dale
Merten Sr., his wife Shara Merten, and their son, Robert Merten II,
owners of Arizona-based B&AMP;B Amusements, which owned the Himalaya.
The indictments also named B&AMP;B maintenance workers Ottis Frasure
and Jeff Campbell, and the two B&AMP;B workers operating the ride that
night, Daniel Tucker and Joshua Johnson. Robert Gill and Joe Culver
of Bob Gill &AMP; Associates, a Florida-based company that inspected
the Himalaya, also were indicted. John Yeager, attorney for the
Mertens, said the grand jury overreacted. ``Clearly, indicting the
Mertens as if they consciously desired to cause the death of Leslie
Lane is totally inappropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frasure's lawyer, David Wahlberg of Austin, said Frasure would
plead not guilty to murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is an attempt by the district attorney's
office to send a message to the amusement industry,'' Wahlberg
said. ``But using the grand jury process to send a message is an
abuse of that process.'' Lane's family attended the livestock show
every year, though her father said he had always been a little
concerned about the safety of the rides.
</P>
<P>
   On March 19, Lane, her 9-year-old brother and a 16-year-old
friend were in Car No. 19 of the Himalaya, a circular coaster on an
undulating track. As the car crested a rise, all three children
were flung to the platform. Lane, who struck a wall, died there,
the restraining bar beside her.
</P>
<P>
   Austin police said the lap bar intended to keep riders in place
broke away at all three points connecting it to the car. An
investigation by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission found
Car No. 19 had a faulty lock and showed signs of wear at the bar's
base.
</P>
<P>
   Government and court records showed a history of accidents
involving the Himalaya, though none fatal. In a case similar to
Lane's, two California riders were injured because the pins
attaching the lap bar were not in place. Investigators in the Lane
case said cotter pins holding the lap bar to the car had sheared
off and that carnival workers told them the pins were sometimes
smaller than required.
</P>
<P>
   Most fatalities involving industrial mishaps are dealt with
through civil lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   If charges are filed, the vast majority are the equivalent of
criminally negligent homicide or manslaughter, which don't require
proof of intent to kill.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 20 years, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, which protects workers, has referred no more than
about 130 cases to federal prosecutors, said Bill Wright, a
spokesman for the federal agency. Of those, most were not accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most famous case of a company being criminally
charged in connection with deaths was one involving Ford Motor Co.,
which produced the Pinto wagon in the 1970s. A federal
investigation found the Pinto's gas tank could be easily punctured
in a rear-end collision, causing the car to catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   An internal memo disclosed Ford had conducted a cost-benefit
analysis that concluded it was cheaper to pay to settle civil
lawsuits filed by victims' families if deaths occurred than recall
all the Pintos and change the fuel systems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Ford became the first American corporation ever
indicted or prosecuted on criminal homicide charges. The company
was acquitted in 1980, although a jury hearing the civil lawsuit
awarded the victims $128.5 million. A judge later reduced the
judgment, the largest amount awarded at the time, to $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Professors at the University of Texas Law School said the murder
charges were surprising and extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   To prove murder, prosecutors must show B&AMP;B officials knew their
actions _ and in this case, their machinery _ would kill someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very high burden to carry,'' said Michael Sharlot,
dean of the law school. ``To say they did this and knew it was
reasonably certain to cause death ... wow.''
</P>
<P>
   An example of such a case is a person who purposely drops a
large stone off a 20-story building, Sharlot said. The person may
not aim it at a particular victim, but a rock dropped from that
height is expected to kill someone.
</P>
<P>
   Charging company owners with murder is rare but not
unprecedented, according to veteran trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1986, a trial was held in San Antonio in a case in
which the president, vice president, nursing consultant, and other
executives of Autumn Hills Convalescent Centers Inc. were accused
of murder.
</P>
<P>
   An 87-year-old woman died in a Texas City nursing home owned by
the corporation. Police charged she died from neglect.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly seven months, a jury deadlocked over whether to
convict the company and its executives. A judge dismissed the jury
and the chief prosecutor, Galveston District Attorney Mike Guarino,
dropped the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We based our case on the position that the defendants
knowingly _ not intentionally _ but knowingly neglected these
fragile patients and deprived them of their needed care,'' Guarino
recalled. ``We were not successful. Juries don't identify
defendants like these with the usual criminal type that shoots a
gun.''

 &HT;    Panel designs anti-gang program
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Warning that Texas faces a growing threat from
organized crime gangs, a special Texas Senate committee is poised
to recommend creation of a statewide Violent Gang Task Force to
better coordinate gang enforcement and monitoring efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In a report expected to be made public, a five-member Texas
Senate committee that has been studying gangs and juvenile justice
issues will recommend the task force be made up of representatives
from the prison system, police agencies and prosecutors _ to better
coordinate gang enforcement and monitoring efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Other recommendations include creation of a statewide computer
network to track gang members, stricter parole rules for imprisoned
gang members and a new 211 telephone help line for parents,
teachers and police.
</P>
<P>
   The 116-page report represents the most comprehensive look at
the growing gang-crime problem that the Legislature has undertaken
in several years. It also is a first step in what legislative
leaders have said they expect will be several new laws to crack
down on teen-aged street gangs and gang members in prisons when
lawmakers convene in January.
</P>
<P>
   In recommending the statewide computer database on gang members,
the report suggests police agencies across Texas should consider
standardizing gang data. It also suggests the Legislature consider
whether parents should be notified when their children are
designated as gang members, whether files on juveniles should be
purged as they grow older and stay out of trouble and whether
access to the gang database should be limited because of
constitutional privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Creation of a special three-digit phone number, patterned after
Atlanta's successful 211 system, would allow parents, police,
teachers and others to quickly and easily access information about
gang intervention, counseling and assistance programs. The
projected cost: $574,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the recommendations could carry a pricetag of more than
$49 million. More than $41 million of that is expected to be sought
by the Texas Youth Commission to expand juvenile lockups. The
state's current two-year budget is about $87 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Other recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   -Require the Texas Department of Public Safety to begin noting
on its computer files whether a crime was gang-related or a
criminal is a confirmed member of a prison gang, a move that could
help improve safety for street cops.
</P>
<P>
   -Require parole officials to more closely supervise gang members
who are released from prison, including tougher restrictions on
their movements and whom they associate wth. Parole officials said
Wednesday they already are working on such new rules.
</P>
<P>
   -Require the Texas Education Agency, local public school
officials and Prairie View A&AMP;M University's Juvenile Crime
Prevention Institute to better train school personnel to identify
and report gang membership and gang behavior.
</P>
<P>
   -Bolster with additional money existing state programs for
at-risk youths, as a way to thwart what has become prison gangs'
biggest pool of new recruits. State Sen. Royce West, a Dallas
Democrat who heads the special committee, did not return a phone
call for comment Wednesday. But in a letter to Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock
accompanying the report, West urged ``a stronger commitment to
prevention and intervention services for our youth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to reducing juvenile delinquency lies in providing
at-risk youth with healthy alternatives such as after-school and
weekend programs, as well as offering more prevention and
intervention services for those children who show a need.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimating there could be more than 145,000 gang members in
Texas _ at least 5,000 of those in prisons _ the report says most
are members of teen-aged street gangs. But those in spray-painting
and vandalism gangs, who police say are increasingly working with
the more violent prison gangs, are part of a growing crime problem
all across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the report estimates Texas has 3,276 active youth gangs
_ second only to California. But despite the growth in numbers of
gang members, police in several major Texas cities estimate
gang-related crimes have dropped in the past two years _ 28 percent
in Austin alone.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, police say, is that more gang members are being
arrested and sent to prison at the same time as gangs are refining
the way they do business _ becoming more selective, oftentimes more
violent, in the types of crimes their members are involved in.

 &HT;    CHINA GLORIFIES COMMUNIST PARTY ON NATIONAL DAY
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 500 words.
 &HT;    With digital photo placed in the International folder on the Cox
Server.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In one of China's most stridently nationalistic
interludes in a decade, the nation's rulers are pulling out the
stops to glorify the once pallid President Jiang Zemin and proclaim
the dominance of Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   With a single-mindedness that would have heartened the late
leader Mao Tse-tung, Communist Party propagandists recast
Thursday's National Day to praise Jiang for his brilliance in
directing a ``people's war'' to vanquish this summer's heavy
floods.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's most visible symbol is a 20-foot-long photo
montage featuring Jiang with a megaphone inspiring legions of
flood-fighting troops as they stand shoulder-to-shoulder protecting
sand-bagged river dikes.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Chinese holiday-makers viewed the giant Jiang
poster Thursday as they trooped into the Museum of the Revolution,
just off Beijing's Tiananmen Square, to see an urgently arranged
exhibition of flood-fighting photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which seems to be playing very well with the
people of China, is also symbolized by the lavishness of the
party's daily self-congratulatory rhetoric on radio and television.
The tone harkens back to the heady years not long after Mao
declared the founding of a ``new'' nation -- the People's Republic
of China -- on October 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has eloquently proved that the Communist Party of
China is a great, glorious and correct party,'' Premier Zhu Rongji
told 1,000 party leaders and foreign dignitaries Wednesday at a
banquet on the eve of National Day.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, who has enjoyed an overseas reputation as a non-ideological
pragmatist, has emerged in recent weeks as one of the Communist
Party's chief drum-beaters in the propaganda campaign to celebrate
what is repeatedly referred to as China's ``flood-fighting
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The socialist system has incomparable superiority and
vitality,'' Zhu said Wednesday in his first National Day speech
since becoming premier in March. ``Our people will be able to
advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics in all areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The state media have been laden with almost identical slogans
from other party luminaries, led by Jiang himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-flood campaign proves that the Chinese Communist
Party is a great, glorious and correct party,'' the president said
last month in a visit to the flood-damaged town of Jiujiang in
eastern China. ``The socialist system has great superiority. The
army is trustworthy. The Chinese people are industrious and
courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago, Jiang rose to new heights of rhetoric when he
likened China's victory over the floods to its conquest of
pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late 1980s and early 1990s, we stood up to the
international and domestic political disturbances to defend the
great undertaking of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and successfully withstood a severe test of
political risk,'' Jiang said. ``This time, we conquered the
assaults of the extraordinarily serious flooding . . . and
withstood a severe test of natural disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional ad follows.
</P>
<P>
   It remains a mystery just why the Communist party hierarchs
chose this year's floods as a pretext for such an extended barrage
of patriotic and pro-party propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that following President Bill Clinton's mid-summer
trip to China, the ruling party leaders were worried about a
stirring of support for ending the Communist Party's political
monopoly through the creation of a legal opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   The ``flood-fighting spirit'' campaign also arose at a time when
the image of the People's Liberation Army leadership was tattered
by reports of corruption. Meanwhile, the party was grappling with
how to explain the slowing of China's economy, following
two-decades of near double-digit annual economic growth credited to
Jiang's predecessor, the late Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever political calculations lay behind the anti-flood
campaign, the offensive is no doubt striking a chord with millions
of ever-patriotic Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of my generation are deeply moved by this,'' said
accountant Luo Si, 21, from Nanjing, who wept as she toured the
heroic flood-fighting scenes of the photo exhibit. ``Under the
leadership of the Central Committee of the party, all the systems
and regulations have been deepened through solid and stable
steps.''
</P>
<P>
   China's floods this year killed an estimated 3,004 people along
the Yangtze, Nenjiang and Songhua rivers. Flood losses were the
worst since 1954, but far less serious than the monstrous Yangtze
floods of 1931 in which 140,000 people drowned.

 &HT;    NEW UNIT TAKING OVER CHORE OF MANAGING INTERNET'S SWIFT GROWTH
 &HT;    1020&AMP;add. With DOMAINS-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Saturday, Oct. 3
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When cyberspace was young, legendary engineer Jon
Postel used to keep track of all the Internet addresses worldwide
in a notebook. These days, it takes a major U.S. company with more
than 150 employees working around the clock to register as many as
7,000 new sites each day.
</P>
<P>
   But in coming weeks, this company, Network Solutions Inc. (NSI)
in Herndon, Va., will lose its exclusive agreement with the U.S.
government to register top-level domain names, those catchy Web
addresses ending in .com, .org or .net that are popping up on
everything from shirts to billboards.
</P>
<P>
   This paperwork shift marks a much larger change. Under pressure
from around the globe, the U.S. government is getting out of the
business of managing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a group of international scientists and business
leaders have formed a private, non-profit corporation to make
future decisions about how the Internet is managed _ everything
from how addresses are assigned to technical standards for new
equipment. And the market for top-level Internet addresses will be
opened to competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major transition,'' said Postel, who heads the
University of Southern California's Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA). ``We're moving from a government research project
to a commercially funded organization to manage the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The casual Web surfer might not notice a difference. But the
transfer likely will result in an explosion of companies moving
into the Internet registration business. And these competitors are
expected to push for dozens of new top-level addresses by as early
as next September.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, any e-commerce company or Internet service provider
will rely on this new non-profit, rather than a government
organization, to assure the technical stability and security of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet began as a research project at the Defense
Department to link scientists, and for the past 30 years, the
federal government has played a central role in its growth. But in
1992, Congress voted to allow commercial activity, and a global
explosion of access and commerce ensued.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people on line has risen sharply from about 4
million worldwide in 1993, at the birth of the World Wide Web, to
about 100 million today. The number is may reach 1 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Business conducted on line is now estimated at $70 billion a
year, and is projected to hit $300 billion by 2002. The information
technology industry is responsible for one-third of the real growth
of the U.S. economy over the past three years, according to the
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the verge of the digital economy,'' said Ira C.
Magaziner, a senior policy adviser to President Clinton. ``How we
manage the Internet will lay the foundation for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the publicly traded NSI and non-profit IANA
have shared the job of managing the Internet. The Herndon company
assigns top-level domains, about 75 percent of all addresses. (The
other 25 percent are country codes, such as .uk, managed by private
companies or governments.) IANA, in turn, assigns numerical codes
that correspond to all addresses. Together, they let Web surfers
get from one site to the next.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NSI employees maintain a powerful computer server
that is the virtual heart of the Internet. Each night , NSI
employees enter every new or changed Internet address on this
machine, known to engineers as Root Server A. When they have
finished, twelve other main servers dial in from around the globe
to download the new information. The process takes between six and
seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   International leaders, business executives and Internet
engineers have grumbled that the U.S. government, and by extension
NSI, has had too much control over the Internet. Worse, they
complain, NSI has made a bundle without any competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no different than when AT&AMP;T had a monopoly on
long-distance,'' said Ken Stubbs, chair of the Florida-based
Internet Council for Registrars, a group of about 80 domestic and
international companies waiting to get into the domain-name market.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Clinton administration decided to turn management
of the Internet over to a private, non-profit corporation by
September 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, NSI and IANA took the first step in that
direction by setting up the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and
Numbers, initially to be controlled by a nine-member interim board.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Corp. will be a self-supporting organization financed
by the Global Internet Project, established by IBM Corp. and MCI
Communications Corp. The project expects to raise $500,000 by late
October.
</P>
<P>
   The first job for the Internet Corp. will be deciding whether
add new top-level address, such as .store for businesses offering
merchandise on line or .per for personal pages created by
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Many large corporations and trademark attorneys oppose this idea
because of the emergence of ``cyberpirates'' _ individuals who
anticipate and register popular addresses, and then try to sell
them back to companies at inflated prices. Additional domain
addresses will make much harder to police their trademark names,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge problem,'' said Sally M. Abel, a trademark
attorney who serves on the board of the International Trademark
Association in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But registration competitors such as Jay Fenello, president of
the Atlanta-based Iperdome Inc., are pushing for the change.
Fenello wants to launch the first additional registry, a .per
domain to be used for personal web pages and e-mail. ``There's a
lot of pent-up demand out there, and we see it as a great business
opportunity,'' Fenello said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the most enthusiastic backers of a free-market
organization to oversee Net activity expect the transition to take
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big challenge,'' said NSI's chief executive officer,
Gabe Battista, ``but the most important thing will be ensuring the
stability of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Battista is repositioning his company for the
new era.
</P>
<P>
   Until last April, NSI was able to charge individuals $100 per
Internet address every two years. The National Science Foundation
got $30 of that fee for its Intellectual Infrastructure Fund, to be
used for future Internet research.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of Internet addresses grew from 7,100 in 1992 to
roughly 2.3 million today, this fee translated into handsome
profits for the company, which went public in September 1997. The
company reported $45 million in revenues for fiscal 1997, and $36
million in revenue for the first six months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   NSI remains in a strong position. The company is the only one
worldwide to have experience in registering and managing Internet
addresses. What's more, the company is moving into new business
areas, such as developing services for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge market and they've in a great position,'' said
James J. Pettit, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.

   PRIVATIZING THE INTERNET: A TIMELINE
</P>
<P>
   1969: UCLA graduate student Jon Postel began tracking computer
network addresses for the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency's (DARPA) Arpanet project.
</P>
<P>
   1970s: Postel moved to USC's Information Sciences Institute and
continued his work. He also developed a list of technical
parameters that became the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA).
</P>
<P>
   1980s: DARPA continued funding the early Internet, mostly for
federal scientists.
</P>
<P>
   1987: IBM, MCI and Merit developed NSFNet, a national high-speed
``backbone'' network that supported 4,000 research and educational
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   1991: The National Science Foundation took over coordination of
the early Internet's non-military functions.
</P>
<P>
   1992: Congress gave NSF authority to allow commercial activity
on the Net. NSF signed a cooperative agreement with Network
Solutions Inc. (NSI) of Herndon, Va. to track Internet addresses.
Only 7,100 addresses existed.
</P>
<P>
   1995: NSF allowed NSI to charge $50 per year for Internet
addresses ending in .com, .org and .net. NSI put 30 percent of this
revenue into a federal Intellectual Infrastructure Fund to future
Internet research.
</P>
<P>
   1996: IANA called for additional top-level Internet addresses
ending in suffixes such as .store or .firm.
</P>
<P>
   1997: As part of a larger e-commerce strategy, President Clinton
directed the federal government to get out of the Internet
business. By now, roughly 90 percent of 1.5 million Internet
addresses were commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   1998: The Commerce Department issued a plan for a revamped
Internet-address system. It called on scientists, business leaders
and others worldwide to form a private, non-profit corporation to
oversee the Internet.

century and The Beggar's Opera. But they were never standard fare.
Late this century, however, a dark comedy about your average serial

   ALZHEIMERS-BUSH _ AUSTIN, Texas _ ``My father used to say, 'I
think I've got that old-timers disease,''' said Laura Bush, wife of
Gov. George W. Bush. ``Everyone fears it I because they know what a
burden they will be to their families.'' Watching her mother
shoulder the burden of caring for him took a toll on Bush, one
reason she has become involved with the local Alzheimer's
Association. (Park, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   FLAGLER-CATS _ PALM BEACH _ The curator, the cat lady, the

the birthparents who had surrendered her for adoption. Now she's

   GARDEN-CHARLESTON _ CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Gardening is simple if
you remember one thing, says Felder Rushing. ``This ain't England,
Texas or Kansas. It's the South,'' says the Mississippi Extension
agent in his down-home drawl. Yet Southern gardeners insist on
making a rewarding hobby a dreaded chore by trying to grow things
that will never make it in this climate. Rushing, the co-author of
the best-selling ``Passalong Plants,'' may be preaching to the
choir but he had a captive audience Thursday in Charleston, where
gardening is second only to history among residents. He's among the
featured speakers for the Southeast's largest fall gartdening
event, the Charleston Garden Festival, which continues through
Sunday. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA: 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   NURTURE _ As a psychology grad student, Judith Harris was kicked
out of Harvard because her work wasn't considered ``original.''
This fall Harris published a book, ``The Nurture Assumption,'' that
was original enough to turn psychology on its head, essentially
declaring that parents have little to no impact on their children's
personalities, after their genetic contribution. All those
goodnight stories, flash cards, and educational toys: wasted.
Harris, the outsider who stormed the gates of psychology, doesn't
have a degree, doesn't even have a school and has no expensive
experimental data: she based all her work on published studies. She
could have based them on her own life. Her two daughters, one
biological, one adopted, turned out radically different from each
other, though both were raised in the same home. We travel to her
Middletown, N.J., house, where she must spend almost all her time
due to lupus, to profile her. (Emerson, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTO. MOVED.

   TEENS-TALK _ Teens who talk with their mother about sex are much
less likely to experiment and much more likely to use a condom when
they do, CDC researchers say in a report in the American Journal of
Public Health. (Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA: 6 p.m.

declaring that parents have little to no impact on their children's
personalities, after their genetic contribution. All those
goodnight stories, flash cards, and educational toys: wasted.
Harris, the outsider who stormed the gates of psychology, doesn't
have a degree, doesn't even have a school and has no expensive
experimental data: she based all her work on published studies. She
could have based them on her own life. Her two daughters, one
biological, one adopted, turned out radically different from each
other, though both were raised in the same home. We travel to her
Middletown, N.J., house, where she must spend almost all her time
due to lupus, to profile her. (Emerson, Atlanta

 &HT;    NEW UNIT TAKING OVER CHORE OF MANAGING INTERNET'S SWIFT GROWTH
 &HT;    1020&AMP;add. With DOMAINS-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Saturday, Oct. 3
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When cyberspace was young, legendary engineer Jon
Postel used to keep track of all the Internet addresses worldwide
in a notebook. These days, it takes a major U.S. company with more
than 150 employees working around the clock to register as many as
7,000 new sites each day.
</P>
<P>
   But in coming weeks, this company, Network Solutions Inc. (NSI)
in Herndon, Va., will lose its exclusive agreement with the U.S.
government to register top-level domain names, those catchy Web
addresses ending in .com, .org or .net that are popping up on
everything from shirts to billboards.
</P>
<P>
   This paperwork shift marks a much larger change. Under pressure
from around the globe, the U.S. government is getting out of the
business of managing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a group of international scientists and business
leaders have formed a private, non-profit corporation to make
future decisions about how the Internet is managed _ everything
from how addresses are assigned to technical standards for new
equipment. And the market for top-level Internet addresses will be
opened to competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major transition,'' said Postel, who heads the
University of Southern California's Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA). ``We're moving from a government research project
to a commercially funded organization to manage the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The casual Web surfer might not notice a difference. But the
transfer likely will result in an explosion of companies moving
into the Internet registration business. And these competitors are
expected to push for dozens of new top-level addresses by as early
as next September.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, any e-commerce company or Internet service provider
will rely on this new non-profit, rather than a government
organization, to assure the technical stability and security of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet began as a research project at the Defense
Department to link scientists, and for the past 30 years, the
federal government has played a central role in its growth. But in
1992, Congress voted to allow commercial activity, and a global
explosion of access and commerce ensued.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people on line has risen sharply from about 4
million worldwide in 1993, at the birth of the World Wide Web, to
about 100 million today. The number is may reach 1 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Business conducted on line is now estimated at $70 billion a
year, and is projected to hit $300 billion by 2002. The information
technology industry is responsible for one-third of the real growth
of the U.S. economy over the past three years, according to the
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the verge of the digital economy,'' said Ira C.
Magaziner, a senior policy adviser to President Clinton. ``How we
manage the Internet will lay the foundation for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the publicly traded NSI and non-profit IANA
have shared the job of managing the Internet. The Herndon company
assigns top-level domains, about 75 percent of all addresses. (The
other 25 percent are country codes, such as .uk, managed by private
companies or governments.) IANA, in turn, assigns numerical codes
that correspond to all addresses. Together, they let Web surfers
get from one site to the next.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NSI employees maintain a powerful computer server
that is the virtual heart of the Internet. Each night , NSI
employees enter every new or changed Internet address on this
machine, known to engineers as Root Server A. When they have
finished, twelve other main servers dial in from around the globe
to download the new information. The process takes between six and
seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   International leaders, business executives and Internet
engineers have grumbled that the U.S. government, and by extension
NSI, has had too much control over the Internet. Worse, they
complain, NSI has made a bundle without any competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no different than when AT&AMP;T had a monopoly on
long-distance,'' said Ken Stubbs, chair of the Florida-based
Internet Council for Registrars, a group of about 80 domestic and
international companies waiting to get into the domain-name market.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Clinton administration decided to turn management
of the Internet over to a private, non-profit corporation by
September 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, NSI and IANA took the first step in that
direction by setting up the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and
Numbers, initially to be controlled by a nine-member interim board.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Corp. will be a self-supporting organization financed
by the Global Internet Project, established by IBM Corp. and MCI
Communications Corp. The project expects to raise $500,000 by late
October.
</P>
<P>
   The first job for the Internet Corp. will be deciding whether
add new top-level address, such as .store for businesses offering
merchandise on line or .per for personal pages created by
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Many large corporations and trademark attorneys oppose this idea
because of the emergence of ``cyberpirates'' _ individuals who
anticipate and register popular addresses, and then try to sell
them back to companies at inflated prices. Additional domain
addresses will make much harder to police their trademark names,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge problem,'' said Sally M. Abel, a trademark
attorney who serves on the board of the International Trademark
Association in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But registration competitors such as Jay Fenello, president of
the Atlanta-based Iperdome Inc., are pushing for the change.
Fenello wants to launch the first additional registry, a .per
domain to be used for personal web pages and e-mail. ``There's a
lot of pent-up demand out there, and we see it as a great business
opportunity,'' Fenello said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the most enthusiastic backers of a free-market
organization to oversee Net activity expect the transition to take
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big challenge,'' said NSI's chief executive officer,
Gabe Battista, ``but the most important thing will be ensuring the
stability of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Battista is repositioning his company for the
new era.
</P>
<P>
   Until last April, NSI was able to charge individuals $100 per
Internet address every two years. The National Science Foundation
got $30 of that fee for its Intellectual Infrastructure Fund, to be
used for future Internet research.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of Internet addresses grew from 7,100 in 1992 to
roughly 2.3 million today, this fee translated into handsome
profits for the company, which went public in September 1997. The
company reported $45 million in revenues for fiscal 1997, and $36
million in revenue for the first six months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   NSI remains in a strong position. The company is the only one
worldwide to have experience in registering and managing Internet
addresses. What's more, the company is moving into new business
areas, such as developing services for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge market and they've in a great position,'' said
James J. Pettit, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.

   PRIVATIZING THE INTERNET: A TIMELINE
</P>
<P>
   1969: UCLA graduate student Jon Postel began tracking computer
network addresses for the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency's (DARPA) Arpanet project.
</P>
<P>
   1970s: Postel moved to USC's Information Sciences Institute and
continued his work. He also developed a list of technical
parameters that became the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA).
</P>
<P>
   1980s: DARPA continued funding the early Internet, mostly for
federal scientists.
</P>
<P>
   1987: IBM, MCI and Merit developed NSFNet, a national high-speed
``backbone'' network that supported 4,000 research and educational
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   1991: The National Science Foundation took over coordination of
the early Internet's non-military functions.
</P>
<P>
   1992: Congress gave NSF authority to allow commercial activity
on the Net. NSF signed a cooperative agreement with Network
Solutions Inc. (NSI) of Herndon, Va. to track Internet addresses.
Only 7,100 addresses existed.
</P>
<P>
   1995: NSF allowed NSI to charge $50 per year for Internet
addresses ending in .com, .org and .net. NSI put 30 percent of this
revenue into a federal Intellectual Infrastructure Fund to future
Internet research.
</P>
<P>
   1996: IANA called for additional top-level Internet addresses
ending in suffixes such as .store or .firm.
</P>
<P>
   1997: As part of a larger e-commerce strategy, President Clinton
directed the federal government to get out of the Internet
business. By now, roughly 90 percent of 1.5 million Internet
addresses were commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   1998: The Commerce Department issued a plan for a revamped
Internet-address system. It called on scientists, business leaders
and others worldwide to form a private, non-profit corporation to
oversee the Internet.
</P>

 &HT;    Nashville book fest draws South's brightest
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Southern Festival of Books was launched 10 years ago in
Nashville, even some of the founders wondered about its future.
Nashville, after all, has always been more famous for country music
than literature.
</P>
<P>
   The festival not only has survived, though, it has flourished.
This year's event, scheduled Oct. 9-11 at Nashville's War Memorial
Plaza, features some of the best and brightest stars in the
literary field. Among the more than 200 authors participating are
Kaye Gibbons, Lee Smith, Terry Kay, Jay McInerney, Jill McCorkle,
Kinky Friedman, Tony Horwitz, Wendell Berry and Clyde Edgerton.
</P>
<P>
   The festival will feature panel discussions on mystery writing,
country music, poetry and the Civil War, as well as readings and
book signings. A variety of national and regional publishers and
book sellers will have exhibits set up on the plaza. In addition,
Brian Lamb's C-SPAN will televise live from the exhibit area Oct.
10-11.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is free and open to the public. Information:
615-320-7001 or at http://www.tn

   FAMILY MATTERS: Novels about women's friendships are as hot as
memoirs these days. Rebecca Wells' best-selling novel, ``Divine
Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' (HarperCollins, $14), the story
of a daughter's relationship with her mother and her mother's
friends (the Ya-Yas), has become a cult classic. Inspired by the
book, dozens of Ya-Ya groups have sprung up around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Now Susan Kelly, a North Carolina native and former Atlantan,
mines some of the same territory in ``How Close We Come'' (Warner,
$20), a novel about the friendship between two women. The main
characters, Pril Henderson and Ruth Campbell, are neighbors who
share tools, recipes and secrets they don't even tell their
husbands. When Ruth leaves for a skiing vacation with her children
and never returns, Pril is angry that her friend did not tell her
of her plans. Later, when she is named as a witness in a custody
suit filed by Ruth's husband, she is faced with a decision to
testify against Ruth or to stand behind the friend who shattered
her own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hung around women all my life,'' says Kelly, who grew up
with three sisters and attended an all-girls school. ``I talk to
them every day. The stories in the book are theirs as well as
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, 44, who worked as a paralegal in Atlanta in the late
1970s, was a budding writer as a child, but she didn't begin
writing seriously until she was 35 and the mother of three.
</P>
<P>
   After writing two unpublished novels, Kelly entered ``How Close
We Come'' in a contest sponsored by Banks Channel Books in
Wilmington, N.C. The manuscript won first place and was published
by the small press. Warner Books noticed the good review in
Publishers Weekly and bought the option to reissue the novel to a
wider audience this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kelly has been contacted about a possible movie deal
and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro is using the
novel in a graduate course in women's studies. The author is happy
her book is being used, but she's just not sure about some of the
terminology being applied to her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women that I know don't fling around words like `patriarchal
structure,''' she says, laughing. ``They just know they're mad.''
</P>
<P>
   OFF THE ROAD: If Alice Walker meant what she said in a Ms.
magazine interview, next Monday's reading at Emory University may
be one of the last chances we will have to hear her. ``I'm not
going to do any more lectures or readings beyond the ones I've
already agreed to,'' says Walker. The Pulitzer Prize-winning author
of ``The Color Purple'' will be in town to read from her new novel,
``By the Light of My Father's Smile'' (Random House, $22.95).
Walker says the novel presents ``a celebration of sexuality, its
absolute usefulness in the accessing of one's mature spirituality,
and the father's role in assuring joy or sorrow in this arena for
his female children.'' The father in the novel finds his
15-year-old daughter Magdalena having sex with a loyal boy. He
beats her in a scene witnessed by her sister, Susannah, and while
both daughters are wounded by the beating, it is Magdalena who
remains scarred.
</P>
<P>
   Walker will read from her novel at 7 p.m. Monday at Glenn
Memorial Auditorium, 1652 North Decatur Road. General admission is
$20. Information: 404-727-8425.
</P>
<P>
   KING BOOKS: As part of its multimillion-dollar publishing deal
with the Martin Luther King Center, Warner Books will issue ``The
Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr.'' in November. Edited by
King scholar Clayborne Carson, the book is compiled from a variety
of documents _ some never before available to scholars _ and is
written as if King is the narrator.

 &HT;    New hero emerges in Mosley stories
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Mosley, best known for his Easy Rawlins series, has
outdone himself with ``Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned''
(Washington Square, $14). The connected stories introduce Socrates
Fortlow, who moves to Watts after serving 27 years in prison for
murder and rape. The book is ``ultimately the picture of a black
community struggling to take on the challenge of finding its own
better life,'' the Los Angeles Times said.
</P>
<P>
   For a lighter look at life, try ``Lightning Song'' by Lewis
Nordan (Algonquin, $10.95). Leroy Dearman, 12, lives on a llama
farm in the South, surrounded by eccentric family members. (Uncle
Harris sets up a bachelor pad in the attic.) Self magazine called
the novel ```Portnoy's Complaint' set ... in Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil War and baseball addicts should check out ``Play for a
Kingdom'' by Thomas Dyja (Harcourt Brace, $14). A Union and a
Confederate company meet for a series of baseball games played
during the Battle of Spotsylvania. The Christian Science Monitor
said Dyja ``realistically encompasses two pillars of American
history and culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers also praised ``The Wind-up Bird Chronicle'' by
Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami (Vintage, $14). In Tokyo, a young
man searches for his wife's missing cat and finds himself looking
for his wife, too. He encounters a bizarre cast of characters as he
looks. The New York Observer found the novel ``a stunning work of
art.''
</P>
<P>
   Another international work, ``Panther in the Basement'' by Amos
Oz (Harcourt Brace, $11), takes place in 1947 in Palestine. Proffi,
12, becomes the friend of a kindly British soldier, though his
father dreams of dying in battle for the creation of a Jewish
state. Our AJC reviewer called it ``a fetching meditation on
treachery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reader'' by Bernard Schlink (Vintage, $11), an
international best seller, was published in this country last year.
In postwar Germany, young Michael Berg is helped by a woman twice
his age, who in time becomes his lover.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund White concludes his trilogy that began with ``A Boy's Own
Story'' and ``The Beautiful Room Is Empty'' with ``The Farewell
Symphony'' (Vintage, $14). As the narrator mourns his lover's death
from AIDS, he leads the reader through 30 years of memories.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Owl Books has published two volumes of short stories by
Harold Brodkey. ``First Love and Other Sorrows'' ($14) originally
appeared in 1958, but this edition includes three
never-before-collected stories. ``The World Is the Home of Love and
Death'' ($15) is Brodkey's final volume, assembled in the weeks
before he died in 1996. The New York Times Book Review noted that
``Brodkey captured the inner poetry of consciousness, the outer
music of the spoken voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential reads
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Faith'' by former President Jimmy Carter (Times, $13)
was a New York Times best seller for good reason. As Publishers
Weekly noted, it's ``an enjoyable look into the life of a man
engaged in living out his faith in the public eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics are at the forefront in ``Abuse of Power: The New Nixon
Tapes'' edited by Stanley I. Kutler (Touchstone, $17), detailing
201 hours of Watergate-era recordings from June 1971 through July
1973. The Los Angeles Times said this is ``Nixon raw, in his own
words, a president unmasked.'' Just as revealing is ``Mutual
Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy and the Feud That Defined
a Decade'' by Jeff Shesol (Norton, $17.95). Shesol details the
historic clash that shaped federal policy and shattered the
Democratic Party in the 1960s.

 &HT;    A grandmother attacks long-held beliefs about child rearing and
sets psychology on its ear
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, N.J._Rear your own children. Or let strangers do it
for you. The little creatures will grow up the same, either way.
</P>
<P>
   Or so says a new book that has set psychology on its ear. Pretty
much all your efforts to instill family values or make your kid
succeed in school are a waste of time, says ``The Nurture
Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do'' (Free Press,
$26).
</P>
<P>
   Children, we are told, are shaped by biology and their peers.
``Parenting matters zilch,'' author Judith Rich Harris declares in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Published in September, Harris' pugnacious theory has landed
like a hand grenade in the foxhole of family-obsessed America. Now
she's watching with glee as parents and the parenting industry
scramble to throw it back.
</P>
<P>
   Though endorsed by powerful names in the field, including MIT
professor Steven Pinker, Harris' view has drawn protest from
professionals and soccer moms alike. Writing in The Boston Globe,
Harvard psychologist Jerome Kagan said Harris' book ignores
important facts and is, perhaps, a sop to a generation too
self-centered to care for its children.
</P>
<P>
   Her message surely will appeal to two-career yuppies with busy
social lives, the folks who invented the concept of ``quality
time.'' Harris states blandly that there is no appreciable
difference between children raised in day care and children with
24-hour-a-day moms.
</P>
<P>
   Portrayed by critics as a monster who has given us permission to
abandon our children, Judith Harris looks rather meek. She's a
graying, sparrow-sized 60-year-old grandmother, just shy of 5 feet
tall, about 98 pounds of wit, grit and oversized spectacles. On a
recent sunny morning Harris could be found padding around her tidy
home in the prosperous South Jersey hamlet of Middletown, petting
her sheltie-collie, Page, and brewing coffee for her late-sleeping
husband, Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   This is the semi-agricultural end of New Jersey, where horse
farms are being carved into subdivisions of million-dollar homes.
Suffering from poor health, Harris rarely ventures out of her
modest, aluminum-sided cottage, but phone calls and e-mail let her
know the ruckus she's raised.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, words like ``zilch'' get people excited, she concedes
with a smile. She admits to presenting an ``extreme case'' and, of
those who accuse her of being purposefully provocative, she says
``they may be right.'' But, she adds, ``I believe the case I'm
making is defensible.''
</P>
<P>
   After chatting for more than an hour in her kitchen, she excuses
herself to answer a few calls and returns flushed with good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston Globe is going to give me 1,000 words!'' she says,
gasping with excitement. This will give her a chance to defend her
theory against Kagan and others, in particular those who accuse her
of saying ``parents don't matter.'' Harris says heatedly that
children obviously wouldn't survive without parents and that
parents should treat their children well, regardless of the
outcome, simply out of common human decency.
</P>
<P>
   Though she cries that her theory has been misunderstood, she's
obviously tickled by the attention, even the negative attention.
``People always feel strongly when you threaten their cherished
beliefs,'' she says, sipping filtered water at her Formica-topped
kitchen table. Neither Galileo nor Darwin, she points out, was
received with shouts of joy.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo and Darwin _ that's fancy company to be keeping. But,
says Pinker, who wrote the seminal ``How the Mind Works,'' Harris
belongs among the revolutionaries. Her book, he writes in the
foreword, ``will be seen as a turning point in the history of
psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   If Harris' theory truly is a breakthrough, it could not have
come from a more curious source. Harris was kicked out of Harvard's
psychology graduate program in 1960 because, according to acting
Chairman George A. Miller, her work didn't look like it would
amount to much.
</P>
<P>
   Bedridden with a mysterious lupuslike disease while researching
her book, Harris left the house only to collect books from the
Middletown library. She wrote sitting in bed, with a pen and a
spiral notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Her work goes to the very core of how Westerners have come to
view children in the 20th century: She accepts the notion that both
genetics and life experiences (''nature and nurture'') shape
children's personality. But she attacks what she calls ``the
nurture assumption,'' which she traces to Sigmund Freud: the
accepted tenet that parents are the most important environmental
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Harris proposes that the most significant environmental
influence comes from outside the home, in the playgrounds and the
schoolrooms and the places where children teach each other how to
live. Her work ties together phenomena that argue against parental
influence _ evidence that twins reared together are no more alike
than those reared apart, for example, and that the children of
immigrants end up speaking the language of their peers, not their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Harris first presented her ``group socialization theory'' (her
term for the way peer groups shape most of our significant
personality traits) in a 1995 article published in the journal
Psychological Review. Two years later her paper won a prestigious
prize, the George A. Miller Award, named for the man who had kicked
her out of school.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the award, the response from academia was thundering
silence, she says. Because she was a nobody, with no university
affiliation, no experimental evidence, no Ph.D., she wasn't taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   That reaction prompted Harris to go over the heads of the
academics and write a book for a general readership.
</P>
<P>
   Her outsider status also made it possible for Harris to ignore
conventional psychological wisdom and hatch her theory in the first
place, she says. ``I was not required to perpetuate the status quo
by teaching the received gospel to a bunch of credulous college
students.''
</P>
<P>
   If she wanted evidence that parental influence is overrated, she
didn't have to look far. She is the mother of two daughters. Her
biological child, Nomi, excelled in her studies and was easy to get
along with. Elaine, adopted after Nomi was born, rebelled against
her parents, took up smoking, hung with a rough crowd and dropped
out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   Same family environment, different outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   The girls had different biological parents, but the girls' story
speaks to more than just the power of genetics. Today, both girls
are leading successful lives. Nomi earned a master's in computer
science at MIT, and the once-troubled Elaine is a happily married
mother, a practicing nurse and a CPR instructor.
</P>
<P>
   The tale is meant to reassure parents, says Harris. Don't worry
so much, because your children are beyond your control. The
pressure she put on Elaine to reform ``actually caused quite a bit
of ill feeling and it didn't do any good in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea even Harris has had a hard time accepting, as
Elaine confirms: She likes the offer from The Boston Globe because
it gives her a chance to state her theory in her own words. The
payment is not important.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean they pay you for that sort of thing?'' she asks,
ingenuously. ``I'm not interested in clothing or jewelry, I don't
smoke or drink, I can't travel. I'm perfectly happy with my life
the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   What she wants is to push psychology into new avenues. And to
give parents a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted parents to feel less guilty, less pressured, less
obsessed with the idea that they might make a mistake,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of her book, she writes, parents have been sold a
bill of goods, and they can accept neither the credit nor the blame
for the kind of adults their children turn into.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that we can make our children turn out any way we
want is an illusion. Give it up. Children are not empty canvases on
which parents can paint their dreams,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not yours to perfect or ruin: They belong to
tomorrow.''

 &HT;    Confronting obstacles to Africa's renewal
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he visited Africa in April, President Clinton spoke of an
``African renaissance.'' Yet economic hardship, famine and war
still afflict the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Blaise Compaore, the president of Burkina Faso and
chairman of the Organization of African Unity, visited Atlanta to
brief former President Jimmy Carter on a range of African issues.
The next day, he sat down with Cox writer Don Melvin. Here are
excerpts of that conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Earlier this year, President Clinton made a high-profile
visit to Africa, and there were questions raised as to whether it
heralded a new era in U.S. policy toward Africa or was merely a
grand photo opportunity. What does the evidence suggest so far?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is no doubt that, through discussions President Clinton
had with African heads of state and through the message he
delivered, we are experiencing a new era in the relations between
the U.S. and Africa. The United States is prepared to assist Africa
in terms of infrastructure development. Another element is that the
United States is prepared to open its markets to African products.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are a number of places in Africa where the per capita
income is less than it was 20 or 30 years ago. What is the primary
cause of that, and what are the main remedies?
</P>
<P>
   A: Essentially this is due to bad organization of international
trade, which has not always been in favor of African countries,
which have been selling primary products. There has been a fall in
the prices of primary products as compared with the soaring prices
of manufactured goods that those African countries imported.
</P>
<P>
   The second element which could explain this is the bad
governance, which did not help economic development.
</P>
<P>
   We need a stable political environment, which encourages private
investment. Regarding the international community, what is needed
most is the opening of developed markets to African products.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently returned from a trip to report on the famine in
southern Sudan. The aid workers said the international community
cannot maintain its level of effort indefinitely, and that without
some resolution of the civil war in Sudan, these problems will
occur again and again. Are there steps that the international
community can take to press the parties in Sudan to reach a
permanent political solution?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is true that without peace, we will still be watching the
tragedy of famine and death in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is in a position to exert pressure on both
parties so that they engage in a dialogue towards a political
solution to the crisis. Such political solution should be based on
the need to recognize full citizenship to all the Sudanese people,
to work towards greater participation of all Sudanese regions in
the management of public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you favor an independent investigation into the nature of
the factory that was bombed in Khartoum by the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: We are small countries, and the United States is a powerful
country with bombs and fighter planes and a whole military arsenal.
Our concern is that one day we might be bombed without knowing the
reason why. The victims of the bombing have a right to know why the
bombing took place. This will not only be in the interest of
America; it will also be in the interest of African countries. If
Sudan is proved to be producing chemical weapons, this will not be
a matter of insecurity for the United States alone. It will be for
us, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you favor lifting of the sanctions against Libya? Do you
disagree with the U.S. contention that Libya has been a sponsor of
terrorism?
</P>
<P>
   A: Now we are referring to a given case: This is the Lockerbie
bombing. We are in full agreement with the United States when they
want to find those who are behind such bombings so that they face
international sanctions. But this should be done through a balanced
and transparent trial which will clearly establish who is
responsible for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have (U.N.) Resolution 1192, which provides for a trial
in the Netherlands, and we think that this will lead the
international community to understand that there are avenues to
combat international terrorism on the basis of the rule of law. The
terrorists act outside the law; those who want to enforce the law
should not follow the same course as the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And therefore sanctions should be lifted in advance of the
trial?
</P>
<P>
   A: We requested that there should be no sanctions before the
trial actually takes place, and this is based on simple logic. Let
us imagine that the trial takes place and the Libyans are found not
to be guilty. How will we offset the consequences of the sanctions?
If there is no trial there should be no sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the likelihood that the situation in Congo could
involve a war outside the borders of Congo?
</P>
<P>
   A: The war already involves Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola. If the
war is protracted, there are possibilities that the war might spill
over on the basis of political interests or ethnic interests.
That's why we feel that the international community should do its
utmost to bring the various parties to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a significant Nigerian community in Atlanta. How
great is your confidence that Gen. Abubakar will hold free and fair
elections in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   A: President Abubakar inherited a very difficult political
situation. But from what I know of him, I'm convinced that he has a
firm will to lead Nigeria to democracy.

 &HT;    $9 million effort to wipe out Guinea worm
 &HT;    By Keith Graham and Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Carter Center in Atlanta is making a final assault on Guinea
worm disease with some hefty fiscal backing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week the center announced that a record-breaking
total of more than $9 million was committed for the Guinea worm
eradication program in the 1998 fiscal year. Among key donors are
the World Bank, American Home Products Corp. and governments of
Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``With their generosity and a lot of hard work by people in
remote villages, we hope that Guinea worm will be eliminated
everywhere in the world outside of Sudan by the end of 2000,''
former President Carter said in a statement. ``Then we will focus
on Sudan and making Guinea worm only the second disease in history
to be eradicated.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, when the Carter Center became involved in the
eradication effort, more than 3.2 million cases of Guinea worm
disease were reported and more than 100 million people were at
risk, mostly in 16 African countries, Yemen and India. Today _
thanks largely to the Carter Center's leadership of a global
eradication coalition _ most of the 150,000 cases remaining are in
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Voice of a Georgian
</P>
<P>
   A Georgia State University professor, Dr. Nack An, has begun a
weekly stint fielding questions on American politics from around
the world during a live call-in show on the Voice of America radio
network. VOA broadcasts international, regional and U.S. news and
programming in 52 languages. The show in which An participates
transmits in the Korean language Wednesday mornings and generates
calls from Korea, China and Russia. The main topic on callers'
minds of late? The Clinton investigation. An, a professor in GSU's
Department of Political Science, says most callers want to know
about the likelihood of an impeachment and details on the process
of removing an American president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Latest developments
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center will host a public forum on development in
South Asia from 6 to 8 p.m. Oct. 8 at Emory University(Ga.)'s Cox
Hall. The event follows a round-table discussion at the center,
where leaders of nongovernmental organizations will discuss shared
social challenges facing South Asia and the United States.
Participants in the public forum will include Ashok Row Kavi of the
Humsafar Trust of India, Abdul Hay Khan of the Grameen Bank of
Bangladesh, Noor-un-Nisa Ghanghro of the World Wildlife Fund
Pakistan, and Vinya Ariyaratne of the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement
in Sri Lanka. The forum is free but registration is required. Call:
404-420-5188.

 &HT;    Harris follows Spock, not Freud
 &HT;    By Eric Sundquist
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judith Rich Harris' message for parents, that they should stop
worrying so much about doing just the right thing, has a
back-to-the-future ring. A century ago there were no degreed
experts, aside from the family doctor or clergyman, to spell out
the ``right way'' to raise children.
</P>
<P>
   The modern view of child development begins with Sigmund Freud.
An Austrian who laid the groundwork for modern psychiatry in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries, Freud thought parents played a
central role in shaping kids' minds. When treating patients,
Freudian therapists traced mental illnesses to relationships with
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Later, American B.F. Skinner and other ``behaviorists'' argued
that children learn through rewards and punishments. If parents
reward a child for an action, the child would repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   Such thought remained largely academic until after World War II,
when psychological theories began to be translated into parenting
manuals. The best of these, Dr. Benjamin Spock's ``The Common Sense
Book of Baby and Child Care,'' has sold 46 million copies since its
1948 debut.
</P>
<P>
   Before he died this year, Spock told USA Today that the advice
industry had grown too influential. Parents in the '90s, he said,
``buy more books, or go to more lectures, or read columns about
child-rearing, and are very easily intimidated by these things.
Half the articles I've written say don't be afraid of doing the
wrong thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris takes that message further. Parents shouldn't worry, she
says, because genes and peers outweigh whatever personality-shaping
they may try anyway.

 &HT;    Harris: Peers affect kids more than Mom or Dad
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judith Rich Harris' ``The Nurture Assumption'' carries a second
subtitle, ``Parents Matter Less Than You Think and Peers Matter
More.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, Harris intends to redirect the attention of
psychology from the grown-ups who birthed us to the peers who gave
us noogies on the playground.
</P>
<P>
   Harris points out that much research purporting to show the
impact of parenting on personality fails to filter out the effects
of genes. The research shows that parents who read to their
children raise children who love to read. But did the kids get
their verbal skills from cozy bedtime stories or from their DNA?
</P>
<P>
   Drawing from primate studies, anthropology, social psychology
and behavioral genetics, Harris presents a case for influences
outside the family.
</P>
<P>
   One assumes parents teach their children to speak, but the
evidence indicates otherwise. Many deaf parents have no verbal
signals to impart, yet their children grow up speaking normally.
They acquire language from their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Another example: The best predictor of teen smoking is whether
the teen's friends smoke, not whether the teen's parents smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Harris discusses the tendency of humans and other primates to
break into warring groups. It is through identification with the
group, not the family, that adult personality emerges, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Can parents have any impact? Some.
</P>
<P>
   First, says Harris, make sure you live in a nice neighborhood.
Children of single parents are no more likely to drop out of school
or get pregnant than the children of two-parent households, she
writes, as long as they stay in the same middle-class
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   A high-status position in a peer group can also be a boost, she
says. You can help your children make a good impression by making
them as ``normal'' as possible, buying them nice clothes,
orthodontia and even plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Group socialization'' knocks the parenting industry into a
cocked hat. Why should parents listen to Dr. Spock or Dr. Laura if
children aren't listening to parents? Accepting Harris' theory
means tossing out Zany Brainy's educational mobiles and Gov. Zell
Miller's classical music CDs. It means that sending children to day
care isn't a bad thing after all.
</P>
<P>
   Though the family-minded accuse her of throwing the parent out
with the bath water, even some critical psychologists credit Harris
with sparking a needed debate.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kindermann, developmental psychologist at Portland State
University in Oregon, thinks parents have more power than Harris
grants. But ``to focus the emphasis on peers is not a bad idea,''
he adds. ``They've been neglected across the last hundred years of
psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris says others have questioned the primacy of the family,
but they've been ignored. So her own book has an intentionally
strident tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have presented an extreme case to clarify the issues,'' she
says. ``Nobody pays attention to you if you're wishy-washy.''

HOW COMMON IS ADULTERY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (Mike McManus is a syndicated columnist whose ``Ethics &AMP;
Religion'' appears in almost 100 newspapers)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative
CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at (800) 444-0267 or (816) 822-8448, or
fax her at (816) 822-1444.)  
 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    David Letterman put the issue lightly but bluntly: ''Come on,
haven't we all had sex with an employee young enough to be our
daughter and lied about it under oath?''
 &HT;    No.
 &HT;    The best studies on American adultery have been conducted by the
National Opinion Research Center (NORC) of the University of
Chicago. It asked this question: ''Have you ever had sexual
intercourse with someone other than your spouse when you were
married?''
 &HT;    The response: 2 percent of women and 5 percent of men said they
had committed adultery within the last year. The cumulative
adultery rate of those who had ever been married was only 12
percent for women and 21.5 percent for men.
 &HT;    I mentioned these numbers to Dr. Shirley Glass, a therapist in
Baltimore who has written extensively on adultery, and she
dismissed them. She cited a study she made 18 years ago of 300
adults interviewed at Baltimore and Washington airports which
revealed 26 percent of women and 44 percent of men had violated the
commandment, ''Thou shalt not commit adultery.''
 &HT;    She questioned the NORC's methodology: ''They interview people
in their homes. They were not alone. Other members of the family
were present. There was no anonymity. They asked them a few
questions, and then asked if they have had sex outside their
marriage.''
 &HT;    Not so, says Dr. Tom Smith of the National Opinion Research
Center.''These questions come at the end of a long survey, the
General Social Survey, that has nothing to do with adultery. At the
end of the interview, people are asked to fill out a
self-completion form in private and put it in a sealed envelope.
 &HT;    ``They are not asked out loud to reveal sexual behavior. This
method is shown to have to highest level of frank and honest
answers. The rationale is that these questions are asked to help
health officials deal with sexually transmitted diseases.''
 &HT;    Second, NORC's estimates are based on an average of polls taken
in 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1996 and one not yet released. No other
analysis is as current or comprehensive.
 &HT;    However, Smith acknowledges that ''even under these
circumstances, not all will admit to a behavior they think is
undesirable, so there is some under-reporting.''
 &HT;    But the faithful outnumber the cheaters by a wide margin.
 &HT;    Dr. Glass asked, ''If in any one year, only 2 percent have sex,
why not multiply that times 30 years of marriage?'' Smith responds:
Much adultery is chronic, the same cheaters year after year.
 &HT;    The percentage of Americans who believe adultery is ''always
wrong'' is very high -- 78 to 80 percent. And this number has grown
from 70-72 percent in the 1970s, according to Smith, due to AIDS.
 &HT;    The base number is high because adultery ''is on the short list
of `Thou shalt nots.' Many Americans first learn that adultery is
something you should not do in Sunday School at ages 4 or 5, before
they have any idea of what sex or adultery is,'' Smith said.
 &HT;    Why then are so many willing to forgive Bill Clinton? Americans
say divorce is wrong, but most also say that it is a matter between
the husband and wife. It is up to them to work it out. ''The public
also distinguishes between job performance vs. personal behavior or
morality,'' Smith said.
 &HT;    Certainly, among some men, infidelity is more common. Famous men
seem to attract the Monica Lewinskys -- politicians, movie stars,
sports figures. Others have more opportunities and temptations,
such as airline pilots.
 &HT;    I asked Dick Tennies, an American Airlines pilot, to describe
the situation. ''Twenty years ago, I determined that 50 to 70
percent of pilots were not on their first marriage, and their
second wife or girlfriend was an employee of the airline. Now, with
the AIDS scare, fewer are as promiscuous.''
 &HT;    His wife, Alice, is often asked, ''Are you a flight attendant?''

   YUGOSLAVIA
</P>
<P>
   Capital: Belgrade
</P>
<P>
   Population: 10.7 million
</P>
<P>
   Area: 39,449 square miles
</P>
<P>
   Summary: The country now consists of Serbia and Montenegro, the
remnants of the former Yugoslav federation governed by Marshal Tito
until his death in 1980. At his death, the federation began to
dissolve, and by 1991 Croatia and Slovenia declared their
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Serbs supported by Serbia entered into an armed struggle
to seize territory in Croatia, and at one point the Serbs occupied
a third of the country. In Bosnia, ethnic Serbs fought a fierce
battle against the country's move toward independence. Serb forces
massacred thousands of Bosnian Muslims and engaged in ``ethnic
cleansing'' -- expelling non-Serbs from areas under Bosnian Serb
control, which extended over as much as 70 percent of the country.
After Serbian aggressions won world condemnation, the United
Nations in 1992 imposed sanctions on Yugoslavia and massive air
strikes on Bosnia Serb targets to end the bloodshed. In 1995, the
Dayton Peace Accord brought an end to the conflict and was signed
by leaders of Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, Yugoslavian officials say their campaign to eradicate
the armed separatist movement is justified because the country has
the right to put down an insurrection in its own borders. They
describe the situation as analogous to the British government's
long struggle against the Irish Republican Army, which sought to
end British rule over Northern Ireland. The officials say the
civilian casualties and accounts of atrocities have been
exaggerated by ethnic Albanians to gain the sympathy of the West.
They also assert that the number of refugees created by the
conflict has been inflated by humanitarian aid groups.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO
</P>
<P>
   Population: 2 million
</P>
<P>
   Capital: Pristina
</P>
<P>
   Area: 4,203 square miles
</P>
<P>
   Situation: A province of Serbia. Kosovo's population is mostly
ethnic Albanian -- 90 percent according to most accounts but less
according to Yugoslavian officials. The Serb minority is the
remnant of the medieval Serb Empire centered in Kosovo, which
retains monasteries and Orthodox monuments. Christian Serbs see
mostly Muslim Kosovo as their spiritual heartland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1389, Turkish forces of the Ottoman Empire defeated the Serbs
at Kosovo Polje (''Field of the Blackbirds'') causing the collapse
of Serbia, a battle that is viewed with reverence by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Most ethnic Albanians favor some measure of independence from
Yugoslavia, and the struggle against Serb rule has persisted for
decades. The conflict has been marked by a cycle of repression by
Serb authorities followed by ethnic Albanian resistance and now
guerrilla -- some say, terrorist -- warfare. Over the past several
months, more than 300,000 people have left their homes to escape
the conflict between Serb security forces and the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA), the rebel group seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 ethnic Albanians are thought to be permanently
homeless and face severe threats as the harsh winter approaches,
according to relief organizations. The United States has expressed
great concern about the plight of the refugees and is advocating
the use of military force, if necessary, to halt the fighting. The
Clinton Administration favors autonomy for Kosovo, but not
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ALBANIA
</P>
<P>
   Capital: Tirana
</P>
<P>
   Population: 3.3 million
</P>
<P>
   Area: 11,100 square miles
</P>
<P>
   Situation: Formerly allied with the Soviet Union, the Communists
were rejected by voters in 1992. Since then, the country has
endured economic stagnation and political unrest amid periods of
near anarchy. In September, unidentified gunmen assassinated Azem
Hajdari, a leader and member of parliament from the opposition
Democratic Party. Two weeks of rioting ensued and on Monday, Prime
Minister Fatos Nano resigned after failing to form a stable
government from his shaky five-party coalition. Nano's arch-rival
and former president Sali Berisha blamed him for the killing. Nano,
a moderate on Kosovo, became prime minister last year after his
party -- made up largely of ex-Communists -- defeated Berisha's
Democrats in parliamentary elections. The ruling Socialist Party
has nominated its 30-year-old secretary, Pandeli Majko to replace
Nano.
</P>
<P>
   Nano did not favor independence for Kosovo, and the country has
been officially neutral.
</P>
<P>
   MACEDONIA
</P>
<P>
   Capital: Skopje
</P>
<P>
   Population: 2.1 million
</P>
<P>
   Area: 9,781 Square miles
</P>
<P>
   Situation: A former republic of Yugoslavia, the country declared
its independence in 1991 -- and in 1996, normalized relations with
Yugoslavia. With the presence of a large ethnic Albanian population
-- which represents about 23 percent of the Macedonian people --
diplomatic officials worry the conflict in Kosovo could spill over
the border and destabilize an already unsteady government.
Consequently, the United Nations has a security force in Macedonia
to attempt to maintain stability at least for the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Internally, the country is already strained by a conflict
between Slavic Macedonians, who represent about two-thirds of the
population, and ethnic Albanians. There are also concerns that the
Macedonian army, which is 25 percent Albanian, would hold together
in a conflict.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVO LIBERATION ARMY (KLA)
</P>
<P>
   Spearheading a seven-month insurgency against the Serb military.
The KLA has claimed to have 50,000 fighters but more generally
thought to number about 15,000. The modestly trained and armed
group has surprised political leaders by its success. In July, the
KLA claimed possession of about 40 percent of Kosovo, even though
the Yugoslavian government denies the organization's holdings were
ever so large. The leadership of the group is shadowy -- barely
known even among ethnic Albanians -- and consequently, the KLA has
been a challenge for United Nations and NATO negotiators who find
it difficult to meet with anyone in authority.
</P>
<P>
   SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian president since 1987. He seized power by exhorting
Serbs to rise up against perceived past injustices and create a
Greater Serbia. He is seen by many in the West as the man most
responsible for the descent of the Balkans into years of warfare.
He is blamed for the attempt at ``ethnic cleansing'' of non-Serbs
in Croatia and Bosnia. Under his government, Serbia was the main
supplier of arms to ethnic Serb fighters in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
but Milosevic has denied any involvement in the atrocities that
were reported in those conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   IBRAHIM RUGOVA
</P>
<P>
   The most recognized leader of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
Rugova has supported proposals to keep Kosovo within Yugoslavia,
but as a self-governing region. Often viewed as a pacifist, he has
called for passive resistance to Serb authority. Even though he
remains popular with the masses and commands moral authority,
Rugova's leadership nevertheless has been rejected by militants in
the Kosovo Liberation Army. While the West tends to consult with
Rugova, diplomats are frustrated because he seems to have no
influence over the warring factions.

<P>
   The eagles that live in the canyons of Colorado use a special
kind of stick to build their nests. A female eagle will sometimes
fly 200 miles to find a branch from an ironwood tree.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the ironwood sticks as strong as their name
suggests, but they also have thorns that allow them to lock
together so the nest can set securely on a ledge high up in the
canyon.
</P>
<P>
   After building the nest, the eagle pads it with layer upon layer
of leaves, feathers and grass to protect future offspring from the
sharp thorns of the ironwood.
</P>
<P>
   In her preparations, the female eagle goes to great lengths to
promote the survival of the birds she will hatch. This interest in
their survival extends well beyond their birth, although the
expression of that interest changes.
</P>
<P>
   As the young eagles grow, they begin to fight for space in the
nest. The chicks' demands for food eventually become such that the
mother eagle is unable to fulfill their needs. She instinctively
knows that in order to survive, her brood is going to have to leave
its nest.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage the young eagles to fend for themselves, the mother
pulls the padding out of the nest so the thorns of the ironwood
branches prick the young birds. As their living conditions become
more painful, they are forced to climb up on the edge of the nest.
The mother eagle then coaxes the young eagles off the edge.
</P>
<P>
   As they begin to plummet to the bottom of the canyon, they
wildly flap their wings to brake their fall, and end up doing what
is the most natural thing in the world for an eagle -- they fly!
</P>
<P>
   As human beings, we may often find ourselves in a similar
situation. When our lives can no longer provide us with the growth
we desire and change must take place, we may need to leave safety
and familiarity behind and journey into unknown territory.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the baby eagles are reluctant to leave the nest, we may
also resist change. Even though conditions may not be pleasant, we
sometimes make an effort to tolerate the increasing discomfort
because we're afraid of the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   But if your ship is tied up at the dock, it doesn't matter how
you turn the rudder -- that ship isn't going anywhere!
</P>
<P>
   Many times unpleasant conditions in our lives tell us that we
are ready to move on and experience new areas of our potential.
While our fear of the unknown might temporarily increase our
tolerance of an uncomfortable situation, life's circumstances may
likely get thorny enough that, like the growing eagles, we'll be
coaxed into moving on. We can trust life and move ahead into new
experiences with confidence because, in a wonderful way, we live in
a friendly universe -- a universe designed to support us and our
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irving Oyle recognized this when he said, ``The universe is
not opposed to our best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever said to yourself, ``I've wanted to do something
like this, but never quite had the courage?'' Take a look at the
urge within your being that may be prompting you to step forward.
</P>
<P>
   When the time comes to venture out and accept new challenges,
remember that everyone has an innate ability not only to survive
but to prosper. We are designed, by God, with the possibility to
achieve high levels of success and to enjoy fulfillment and
satisfaction in life.
</P>
<P>
   This means we do not have to settle for less than we're capable
of, unless that is our choice.
</P>
<P>
   The following quote taken from the Association for Humanistic
Psychology Newsletter was written by an 85-year-old woman. Take a
moment and reflect on the wisdom shared through her observations:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my life to live over, I'd dare to make more mistakes
next time. I'd relax. I'd limber up. I would be sillier than I've
been this trip. I would take fewer things seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would take more chances. I would take more trips. I would
climb more mountains and swim more rivers. I would eat more ice
cream and less beans. I would perhaps have more actual `troubles,'
but I'd have fewer imaginary ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, I'm one of those people who live sensibly and sanely
hour after hour, day after day. Oh, I've had my moments, and if I
had it to do over again, I'd have more of them! In fact, I'd try to
have nothing else!''
</P>
<P>
   So often, we have within our grasp a whole new way of life and
fail to explore it. Why? Could one reason be that we may not be
secure enough in who and what we are to release the pioneering
spirit?
</P>
<P>
   An interesting thing is that we do have our life to live over.
Every day, life comes for us to live a new experience. Over and
over, around the calendar, 24 new hours present themselves to us.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we could ask ourselves, regardless of our age, ``Have I
really lived all my years, or has each year been one day lived over
and over again?''
</P>
<P>
   Within each of us are resources that can be realized only when
we climb to the edge of the nest, slip off into the air -- and fly!

 &HT;    ShortTakes: The lost art of thanks

   ``Thank you for bringing us bagels, Papa,'' said my
granddaughter, Mira, one or two Sundays ago. Mira is receiving
extensive training in the moribund art of being polite. Her world
is filled these days with ``thank you's'' and ``excuse me's'' and
``pleases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're very welcome, Mira,'' I said, ``I'm very glad you like
it,'' thus fulfilling my part of the transaction: If you say
something nice to me, I'll say something nice to you. Some people
think it's all kind of middle-class and artificial, but I think
politeness is the grease that lubricates life's squeaky wheels.
There isn't much of that going around these days. A guy flipped me
the bird the other day just for the fun of it as he passed me on
the road. OK, I was poking along, but that's no excuse.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think Mira is a big fan of the bagels I bring over on
Sunday mornings. Shading the truth is part of being polite. Mira IS
a big fan of the stuff you spread on bagels, cream cheese, jam and
butter, sometimes all at once. If she had her way, she would simply
lick the bagel clean, and skip the dull bread part. She tried that,
too, until her mother let her know that wasn't polite either.
</P>
<P>
   This is a complicated world, particularly if you're trying to be
nice about it. Being polite means having to thank older people for
bagels just to make them feel good.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for reading this.

 Color slides and black and white photos of scenes from the films
``One True Thing,'' ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Meet Joe
Black.''
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Hollywood seems to be taking note of the fact that the century
is racing to its conclusion. And just like the Victorians at the
end of the 19th century, with their seances and their interest in
the occult, movie makers are preoccupied with some very strange
stuff.
 &HT;    Witness the current and future spate of movies dealing with
death, dying, angels, the afterlife, heaven and hell.
 &HT;    Just out is Robin Williams in ``What Dreams May Come,'' a
romantic drama complete with special effects, set in the afterlife.
Williams literally goes through hell to be reunited with his former
wife and soulmate (Annabella Sciorra).
 &HT;    He's in heaven after dying in a car crash. His wife, however, is
down below _ after killing herself from grief at losing her husband
and family. Robin makes the journey from paradise to the underworld
to rescue his true love.
 &HT;    In November, Brad Pitt plays the Grim Reaper himself in the very
offbeat ``Meet Joe Black,'' inspired by the l934 Frederic March
classic ``Death Takes a Holiday.'' Death assumes the face of the
recently killed Pitt, who while vacationing from his gruesome
duties falls madly in love with businessman Anthony Hopkins'
daughter (Claire Forlani) and discovers there's more to life than
death.
 &HT;    ``There was much talk of death on the set and how we would like
to die,'' recalls Hopkins, who last worked with Pitt in the movie
``Legends of the Fall.''
 &HT;    Pitt may seem rather unlikely casting for a fellow usually
depicted in a hooded robe carrying a scythe, but Hollywood seems to
have a penchant for turning death into a pretty face. Remember
Robert Redford as the unwelcome visitor to a very old lady played
by Gladys Cooper in an early episode of ``The Twilight Zone''?.
 &HT;    Director Martin Brest says they chose Pitt to avoid being
gruesome and heavy handed about the topic. ``I thought Brad had
that slightly otherworldly presence we needed,'' he told
Entertainment Weekly.
 &HT;    Nicole Kidman also takes a foray into the realm of the
supernatural, teaming up with Sandra Bullock in ``Practical
Magic,'' a spiritual tale about two women who happen to be New
England witches. The film, which opens Oct. 9, is based on Alice
Hoffman's novel.
 &HT;    Also upcoming (Nov. 6) is ``Jack Frost,'' with Michael Keaton as
a musician who dies in a Christmas car crash and comes back to life
... as a snowman. ``He's a funny, hip guy,'' says Keaton, ``who's
been transferred to a new body and finds cool things to do with
it.'' (That's cool as in snow, presumably). Keaton stepped into
this role after George Clooney, who took over from Keaton as
Batman, dropped out.
 &HT;    Earlier this year Nicholas Cage stepped out of the afterlife in
``City of Angels,'' as the angelic being who falls in love with
surgeon Meg Ryan and decides he wants to enjoy earthly joys with
her. He makes it back in the land of living _ just as Meg
unfortunately exits. The weepy romance was quite a hit among teens.
 &HT;    Woody Allen, for whom a preoccupation with dying is nothing new,
this past year gave us ``Deconstructing Harry,'' which included his
rather hilarious descent by elevator into hell, accompanied by Old
Nick himself, played by Billy Crystal.
 &HT;    Of course, Hollywood long ago learned that movies about dying
can be very profitable. Films like ``Ordinary People'' (1980),
``Terms of Endearment'' (1983) and ``Philadelphia'' (1993) all told
stories in which key characters died.
 &HT;    In the same vein, Meryl Streep plays a mother dying of cancer in
``One True Thing,'' based on Anna Quindlan's l995 novel. The
performance will certainly earn Streep another Oscar nomination for
best actress.
 &HT;    In the tearjerker ``Stepmom'' (opening in December), Susan
Sarandon is a wife and mother who discovers she's dying and
reluctantly coaches her ex's new wife Julia Roberts to step into
her shoes.
 &HT;    And in ``The Theory of Flight'' (opening, believe it or not, on
Christmas Day) Helena Bonham Carter is dying of a neurological
disease and must use a wheelchair. She wants to lose her virginity
before she dies _ and asks Kenneth Branagh to help her achieve her
goal. (This is the couple's first on screen pairing since their
offscreen romance went public.)
 &HT;    In ``Patch Adams,'' Robin Williams is back as a doctor who tries
to treat his terminally ill patients with humor, ``looking at death
lightheartedly,'' as the actor puts it. In l999 Williams will show
up in ``Jakob The Liar,'' this time a cheery story about death and
the Warsaw ghetto. ``Yeah--that was a nice double bill,'' he muses,
``to go from 'Dreams' to 'Jakob the Liar.'''
 &HT;    How are we expected to take all this dwelling on the dark side
without running from the theater in panic? Meryl Streep for one
thinks the answer is perfectly natural. ``We need to feel something
when we go to movies,'' she says. ``We need to cry ... It's OK.''
 &HT;    She cites ``Titanic'' as the ideal death movie. ``Leonardo
DiCaprio goes down in the depths and the kids cry and they put down
their money to go again and again.''

   A growing peanut allergy movement, however, has left planners of
the 54th annual Floresville Peanut Festival shell-shocked _ and
worried about what it could do to business.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the U.S. Department of Transportation directed
airlines to set aside ``peanut-free buffer zones'' for passengers
who suffer from allergic reactions to peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   And schools in the Midwest and New York have told students to
leave that staple of school diets _ the peanut butter sandwich _ at
home. Some schools have removed peanut candy from vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this airlines deal is just the latest effort by those
yahoos in Congress to put all farmers out of business,'' said
Vaughn Yeager, whose family has been growing peanuts on the same
690-acre farm for three generations.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is viewed with alarm here and elsewhere in Texas
where the goobers _ as peanuts are called here _ are a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300,000 acres of peanuts are planted statewide, and they
account for about $200 million in annual income. Texas ranks second
nationally in the production of peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of those who are sensitive to peanuts has all but
overshadowed recent planning sessions for the Floresville Peanut
Festival, which runs Oct. 8-10 in this town of 5,000 people
southeast of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Estrada, who has been in the peanut business since 1946, and
is this year's festival parade marshal, said he thought the concern
about allergies had been blown all out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are some people somewhere who suffer from this
allergy, but I just think this is an overreaction,'' Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
   At several recent meetings of peanut growers, the allergy issue
has been widely discussed, Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
   Peanut Association President Gloria Martinez confirmed the
subject was a hot topic.
</P>
<P>
   The federal order requires airlines to set aside at least three
rows where no peanuts can be served, whenever they receive an
advance request from a passenger with a medically documented peanut
allergy.
</P>
<P>
   Some private schools in New York City have banned peanut butter,
or established ``peanut butter-free zones.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines has made peanuts almost a part of its
corporate identity, having dispensed them free to passengers since
it began flying in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, the airline handed out 87.4 million 1-ounce
packages, Southwest spokesman Ed Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   And at one time, the Dallas-based airline even featured its
no-frills meals in advertising campaigns promoting fares for
``peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Southwest never has recorded an in-flight reaction from an
allergy sufferer, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually started peanut-free flights about five years ago
when passengers would notify us in advance of their allergy. But
the Department of Transportation has now ordered peanut-free zones
be designated in each plane,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said there is no way Southwest can do that on its
planes, since the airline has open seating. But Southwest will
continue its past practice of a peanut-free flight when a passenger
suffers from the allergy and notifies the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT directive is based on a 1996 Mayo Clinic study which
found that peanut allergens can waft through airline ventilation
systems after 5,000 hours of flight.
</P>
<P>
   Allergists say an allergy to peanuts can be serious, even
life-threatening.

ARMY WORMS LAUNCH PERENNIAL OFFENSIVE IN HAPLESS TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Photos available on Wieck database)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH ALLEN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ First there was drought. Then there were floods.
Now worms are munching their way across Texas, eating pasture
grass, lawns, oats ... and football fields.
</P>
<P>
   The fall invasion of army worms, common to the South and
Southwest, was revved into high gear by heavy late-summer rains and
may not quit until the weather turns cool.
</P>
<P>
   Many pastures just recovering from drought are being devoured by
army worms, which actually are caterpillars with green and yellow
stripes that earned their name by marching steadily toward new
forage en masse. The damages are difficult to calculate, but
producers say ranchers will be hardest hit as the caterpillars dine
on fall forage.
</P>
<P>
   East of San Antonio, rancher Steve Ehrig said the army worms
stripped 600 acres of pasture in a few days; and rancher Bodey
Langford said the caterpillars munched through 75 acres of young
oats.
</P>
<P>
   Langford saw a few army worms at the edge of his oat field one
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got up at 7 o'clock the next morning and they had eaten 75
of my 90 acres,'' he said. ``I never saw anything move through a
field that quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Langford estimated his damages at about $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Army worms are doing the most damage in the Coastal Bend and
East Texas, although they are reported in most Central Texas
counties, agricultural extension agents said. The weather pattern _
drought followed by late summer rains _ is similar to 1996, the
year of another army worm invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Extension agents balked at putting a dollar figure on damage
caused by the army worms' advance, saying it varies, depending on
the crop and the level of infestation, which can be patchy and
doesn't always destroy an entire field.
</P>
<P>
   The insects are expected to continue reproducing until
temperatures fall to the 50s at night.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean a long standoff for the Luling School District.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, football field caretaker Eddie Moses thought he
noticed the ground moving under the chalk he was applying for an
upcoming game.
</P>
<P>
   On closer inspection, Moses said, ``I saw a whole bunch of them
on the west end-zone area. I started looking at the street, and
they were crossing the street'' from the adjacent farm.
</P>
<P>
   School officials, trying not to mix pesticides and players, are
limited in how they can fend off the caterpillars. Moses said he
applied a dose of pesticide to the field, later watering it down.
</P>
<P>
   The worms are a serious threat to young oats and other winter
crops that haven't developed a good root system, said David Bade,
an extension specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Producers can spray pesticides on their acreage, but it's pricey
at $6 to $9 per acre, said Gonzales County extension agent Travis
Franke.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get rid of the army worm is expensive,'' Franke said. ``If
they've got ample hay, I recommend that they don't spray.''
</P>
<P>
   Extension specialists advise inspecting two to three times
weekly for army worms, which don't do as much damage when they are
small, and treating for them if as many as three insects per square
foot are detected.

2012 OLYMPICS: NO-WIN SCENARIO FOR SEATTLEITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Memo to Seattle City Council: You hadda be there.
</P>
<P>
   If you were, you wouldn't want it coming here.
</P>
<P>
   Enough time has passed in the nation of the World's Shortest
Attention Spans that the mess of the 1996 Summer Olympics in
Atlanta is largely forgotten. But now that the Seattle Bid
Committee is attempting to persuade the council that it should go
for the 2012 Olympics, the experience of Atlanta needs to be
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In a word: Bleah.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the competitions themselves weren't delightful and
fascinating. Nor were the facilities less than first class. And the
thousands of volunteers were earnest and helpful. But there's
nothing all those wonderful athletes and volunteers can do about
the indisputable facts:
</P>
<P>
   -- The Summer Olympics are a gargantuan enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   -- The International Olympic Committee makes herculean demands
of the host city, yet takes no financial responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   -- Modern security requirements turn venues into virtual
garrisons.
</P>
<P>
   -- Economic forecasts and the physical consequences are almost
never what promoters claim.
</P>
<P>
   I know the fine people on the Seattle committee took many notes
about what went wrong in Atlanta, and along with the IOC and U.S.
Olympic Committee, have vowed the mistakes will not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there is no avoiding the fact that for mid-sized
cities such as Atlanta and Seattle, the scale and complexity of a
Summer Games becomes an overwhelming energy suck that warps
virtually everything else on the civic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For many Puget Sounders desperately grasping onto what is left
of the compelling reasons they remained or settled here, the
boosterism that always beats down good judgment on the way to
hosting an Olympics is anathema.
</P>
<P>
   Please, gung-ho developer types, save your letters calling me a
tree-hugging retro dweeb. Long ago I made my peace with the
inevitability of growth and change, and the need for economic
stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   An Olympics isn't the way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Boosters always cite the new sports facilities as well as the
improved infrastructure that accompany the Games. But in Atlanta,
it's not as if the legacy screams out at the visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, it's as if (the Olympics) never occurred,'' Dick
Pound, an IOC vice president, said last year. ``That's the real
tragedy for the city of Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   If your impression is different, that's because you saw the
Games through the skewed filter of NBC, whose huge rights fees paid
for much of the Games. The money also allows them to tell stories
as they want, not as they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta was very fortunate that Dick Ebersol (NBC Sports
president) threatened to fire anyone who pointed a camera outside
the arenas,'' said Pound, a Canadian lawyer. ``The rest of America
had no idea how bad it was.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC didn't cover the thousands of ticketless kids from around
the world who roamed downtown, looking to party. It didn't cover
the adventure of getting through the security maze, or the
breakdowns of transportation and technology.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the network didn't cover the financial
consquences. When the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games
(ACOG) closed its books last summer, it claimed to have broken even
on its record $1.7 billion budget, less $10 million to clean up the
last of the lawsuits. But ACOG had to auction off every last
doorknob and coat button, as well as negotiate downward numerous
contracts with the USOC and others. And the final tally didn't
include $156 million of a budget surplus that was promised as part
of Atlanta's 1990 proposal to the IOC that won the Games bid.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Also unnoticed was that in order to make way for new facilities
downtown, an estimated 15,000 homeowners, tenants and small
businesses were uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta proclaimed its Olympics were the first to be completely
funded privately (not counting money spent on highways, police,
public services, etc.). But that created a tawdry spectacle of
commercialism that scarred the Games and Atlanta's image, and
provoked IOC legislation forbidding a repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the only alternative is governmental subsidies,
such as was done for February's Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, as
well as the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney. On the eve of the Winter
Games, the mayor of Nagano said the final bill was going to be 20
percent more than the estimate that won the bid.
</P>
<P>
   As disturbing as are the consequences, Seattle's decision to
push for the U.S. bid probably is already done. Our congressional
delegation wants it, the downtown power brokers want it, the
high-tech crowd wants it. Nobody ever stops them.
</P>
<P>
   Those folks will begin to persuade the rest of us with TV
commercials showing smiling kids trundling from Ballard to the UW
for Olympic track or gymnastics. A local athlete will win a gold
medal, Alex Rodriguez will light the Olympic torch and ohmigawd,
who can resist?
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that the parents of those kids probably work for
Coke, Visa, Kodak, NBC or the myriad other mega-corporate sponsors
who underwrite the Games.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't think you would be offered a big-event ticket, did
you?

HUSKIES DISCOVER A KEEPER IN SMITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On a windy, late-December afternoon in El Paso in
1995, Josh Smith knew. He knew it was time to end this madness, to
escape the life of a football player asked to do things he couldn't
do.
</P>
<P>
   He was 250 pounds, a big human, a small defensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iowa linemen were coming up to the line,'' he recalls,
``and laughing at me.''
</P>
<P>
   When that turkey of a Sun Bowl ended with Washington's 38-18
loss, Smith, who had spent two years in the program, went in to ask
coach Jim Lambright for a release from his letter of intent. That
would allow him to transfer to Portland State and receive financial
aid.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have done some creative things to patch together a
football program doubled over with the loss of 20 scholarships in
two years. They tried to recruit selectively, they beckoned
walk-ons. They got lucky with transfer receivers like Jerome Pathon
and Dane Looker.
</P>
<P>
   With Smith, they did something even more unusual. They stood in
the doorway. Lambright told him he wouldn't release him from his
letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very grateful he didn't,'' Smith says today. ``Yeah, it
ticked me off. But I'm a strong believer that these days, education
is overpriced. No way I could work, and I didn't want my parents to
pay for school for a year or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd stick it out.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times when Smith, now a senior, would have reason to
question that decision. Times like February, when he had back
surgery, and a month later when, after lying in bed for a week, he
went in for an operation on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Times like the conditioning segment of Husky drills, when Smith,
hunched and looking a lot like a 65-year-old man, lags behind his
teammates, his back killing him.
</P>
<P>
   Times like Tuesday in practice, when the defense was getting
pushed around a little too much and he heard a couple of teammates
taking it too lightly on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-five bleepin' points!'' he roared, loud enough to be
heard on Upper Campus. ``Fifty-five bleepin' points!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a young team,'' Smith says. ``I don't think they
understand quite yet. We got our butts handed to us on national
television. I don't care who's coming at you, you don't give up 55
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not be the appropriate way, but it's got to be
voiced.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five points, 55 bleepin' points, is what Nebraska scored
on Washington last week, and now 14th-ranked Arizona comes to town
Saturday night. If this is a game of the heart for the Huskies, a
game to test their resolve, they have no better representative than
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   He's their resident tough guy. Polite and well-spoken off the
field, he's a rube on it. He was the one who crossed the field last
week in Lincoln to make a fairly game run at DeAngelo Evans on his
60-yard sprint with an option pitch.
</P>
<P>
   He's the one who threw up at halftime at Arizona State, did it
again walking up the tunnel at game's end. Finally, they helped him
up onto a table and hurried five liters of fluid into his system.
He took on three liters last week at Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tough kid,'' said UW strength coach Rick Huegli. ``His motor
is wide-open.''
</P>
<P>
   In Huegli's empire is a conditioning apparatus, like a
stairclimber squared. The players hate it, the coaches love it
because the players hate it. You climb vertically using hands and
feet, and your effort is computer-calculated against an estimated
ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Smith discovered that assistant coach Rick Mallory, the former
NFL lineman, took about 25 minutes in scaling 4,000 feet. He
mounted the machine, hell-bent to beat Mallory.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decent effort is about 32 minutes, 31,'' said Huegli. ``He
(Smith) did it in about 26 minutes. He didn't beat him, but he put
in an impressive effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's coach at Sehome High in Bellingham, Birger Solberg,
remembers the same sort of passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a playoff game against Rainier Beach,'' says
Solberg. ``They had tons of speed. He missed a play on the
quarterback, who scrambled away from him. He got him 30 yards
downfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's family moved from Boston to Bellingham when he was in
seventh grade. He chose Washington over Washington State and has
appreciated the ride, however potholed.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies eventually moved him to defensive end, where he
wouldn't get road-graded. This year, he stepped into a starting
spot vacated by Chris Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the best thing I've learned since I've been here is,
the grass isn't greener on the other side,'' he says. ``You can
always go through life and think it's going to be so much fun down
at Portland State, but it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   When it's darkest, and his mood is lousiest, he finds a teammate
usually there to crack him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The camaraderie makes it all worthwhile,'' Smith said. ``I
love the football team. I might hate it at times, but I still like
going out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He won't be doing that much longer. Smith already has a job
lined up next year in Chicago, managing health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody,'' he laughs, ``needs health care.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as anybody, he would know.

 TOUGH DAYS FOR HAWKS' McKNIGHT  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND _ The expectations for wide receiver James McKnight
could not have been much higher.
</P>
<P>
   That will happen when you are coming off a career-best season,
your team signed you to a new contract in the offseason and then
passed on selecting Randy Moss in the first round of the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   But four games into his season of great expectations, McKnight
is struggling along with the rest of the Seahawks' offense. He has
dropped passes in each of the past three games, including one in
the end zone in the fourth quarter of Sunday's three-point loss at
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with McKnight, the big-play receiver from little
Liberty University? And what can his team do to help him emerge
from his slump?
</P>
<P>
   Warren Moon supplied those answers during and after Wednesday's
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing you want to do is alienate a guy when he's
having some problems,'' the veteran quarterback said. ``If
anything, you want to feed him. You want to give him more
opportunities to come out of it. Like a shooter in basketball who's
in a slump, you keep shooting. If this guy's having problems
catching the ball, you keep throwing it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon did that in practice, going to McKnight early and often as
the Seahawks began preparing for Sunday night's nationally
televised game against the Chiefs in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there aren't concerns about McKnight and the
offense, which ranks 20th in the league. The offensive meetings
that usually wrap up just before midnight on Tuesday lasted until
after 2 a.m. this week, and coach Dennis Erickson sat in on the
sessions where the game plan is formulated.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches reached the same conclusion as Moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our minds, James is a proven player who has made plays,''
offensive coordinator Bob Bratkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, McKnight averaged 18.7 yards on 34 catches. He also
caught six touchdown passes, averaging 38.5 yards on his scoring
plays. This after catching only eight passes in his first three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McKnight is concerned, but not overly. He calmly
points out that he also had drops last year, but they didn't seem
as significant because the Seahawks had the NFL's top-ranking
passing offense. This year, the passing game has slipped to 24th,
so everything is magnified as everyone searches for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows what I'm capable of doing. They know the plays
I'm capable of making,'' McKnight said. ``I haven't been playing
100 percent, but none of my coaches or teammates have said it's
from a lack of effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to know that despite the circumstances, your team
has not given up on you.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been the drops _ the one last week, as well as a pair
on third-down passes against Washington the week before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone has to be the fall guy. I'm not playing well. So all
the pressure is on me,'' McKnight said. ``That comes with
territory. I have to deal with it. I can't sit around and say,
`This ball was there.' Or, `This guy was holding me.' That's not
me. I don't make excuses. I have to remain disciplined and go out
and help my team win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I drop a ball, nobody can get more mad at me than I get
at myself,'' he said. ``But I see it on the replay and it's gone.
If you allow it to affect you, you're not going to be any good to
yourself or your teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight also has made plays _ four of his six receptions have
produced the yardage needed for the first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the James McKnight we know. That's who James McKnight
is,'' Bratkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the James McKnight the Seahawks need against the Chiefs,
whose physical style of jamming receivers off the line and covering
them one-on-one plays to McKnight's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Two of McKnight's breakout games in his breakthrough season came
against the Chiefs. He caught a 54-yard touchdown pass in Kansas
City last year, then had a four-cacth, 66-yard game against the
Chiefs at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Moon reminded McKnight of that before they took the practice
field Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything wrong with James,'' Moon said.
``I think he understands what he has to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And what the Seahawks need him to do. McKnight must make plays
to relieve some of the pressure of constant double-coverage from
Joey Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   As Moon said, this is the first year McKnight has been counted
on to make plays. And make no mistake, Galloway needs a productive
McKnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' the Seahawks' leading receiver said. ``James is
as important to me as Warren Moon.''

 McILVAINE: `SEASON COULD NOT HAPPEN AT ALL'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sonic center Jim McIlvaine is in Seattle and he is
depressed.
</P>
<P>
   But his funk has nothing to do with a fear of constant rainfall.
McIlvaine is a frontline player in the NBA's labor strife and he
senses where the stalemate is headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season could not happen at all. That's a real
possibility,'' McIlvaine said from his Eastside home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine, secretary-treasurer for the NBA Players Association,
has been involved in every players meeting and was a part of the
only negotiating session between the union and the NBA owners since
the owners, exercising a clause in the collective bargaining
agreement, locked out the players on July 1. Wednesday, both sides
confirmed that bargaining negotiations would resume a week from
today. Only one formal bargaining session was conducted during the
summer, and that meeting ended abruptly when the owners stormed
out.
</P>
<P>
   The major sticking point is the salary cap. The owners want an
absolute maximum on player payroll; the players want to keep the
loophole that allows teams to exceed it.
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine, who came back here just in case the Sonics' training
camp opened as scheduled next Tuesday, called the situation ``a
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that popped out of nowhere,'' McIlvaine
said of the labor problems. ``I've only been in the league four
years and I could see this building up. If I were the average fan,
I'd be disgusted that this is happening. I'm sure we're going to
lose a lot of fans, if we haven't lost a lot of them already. ...
It's anyone's guess when (the lockout will end).''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McIlvaine keeps busy. Between player meetings in New
York, the Sonic center has worked on his game. He worked out
consistently at his alma mater, Marquette. Last month, McIlvaine
again participated in Pete Newell's Big Man Camp.
</P>
<P>
   He's had surgery on his left ankle to remove bone spurs, but
also has enjoyed life's pleasures, such as the growth of his first
child, Hansen (10 months), and the building of a new five-bedroom
home in Jamesville, Wis., close to where McIlvaine grew up.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout will end when one side appreciably budges from its
stance, but that does not figure to happen anytime soon. The league
sent the union a new proposal last week, which the union dismissed
as being nearly identical to the offer owners made in May.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put: The owners want to put a ceiling on player salaries.
The players will not accept what amounts to a hard salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Today marks the fourth month of stalled negotiations. The
regular season is scheduled to begin Nov. 3, and at least three
weeks would be needed after an agreement is reached to sign
players, make trades and hold abbreviated training camps. The
league already has canceled 25 exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides await a ruling from arbitrator John Feerick on the
union's grievance over whether players with guaranteed contracts
should be paid during the lockout. Feerick's decision could come at
any time before Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the owners) have no reason not to wait,'' McIlvaine
said. ``And they have basically told us that regardless of the
ruling, they're going to continue this. If (Feerick) rules in our
favor, the owners have basically said they will appeal. It's a
waiting game. They're banking that they can sit this thing out
longer than we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the owners' strategy could be to see what happens when
players miss paychecks. Players are scheduled to receive their
first paychecks Nov. 15. McIlvaine, though, cautions the owners
that the players union is unified and prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union did a good job of telling the players to save their
money a long time ago. From what I've heard, a lot of players have
done that,'' McIlvaine said. ``Plus, anyone who looks like they
need help can contact us. So far we've had only 12-15 guys. I
thought it'd be a lot higher, but I'm sure it will get a lot higher
the longer this goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine agreed with teammate Gary Payton's prediction:
</P>
<P>
   ``You might see a lot of players going to Europe or Japan or
wherever,'' McIlvaine said. ``The players association realizes that
they can't keep conceding to the owners.''
</P>
<P>
   The league, contending that several teams are losing money, has
intimated that it will not play an abbreviated season. The league's
hard stance is partly backed by its new six-year television deal.
NBC and TNT paid the first and final years' installment on its
rights fee up front, with the league paying one year's worth back
at the end of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   That means if there ever was a time to play hardball, this is
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides are prepared to take a hard line,'' McIlvaine said.
``But fans need to understand that we didn't go on strike. The
owners locked us out. We offered to work under a
`no-strike/no-lockout' clause, but the owners said no. ... For a
long time I was optimistic about this, but now it's just
depressing.''

WILSON VETOES HIV REPORTING BILL BACKED BY AIDS ACTIVISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Pete Wilson late Wednesday vetoed
legislation creating a statewide system for reporting HIV
statistics, a move health officials and AIDS activists said was a
blow to public health.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the measure was flawed because the HIV-infected
person's name would not be reported to the databank, and that
``concerns over confidentiality and discrimination should not be
used to justify an inadequate reporting system.''
</P>
<P>
   California is one of nine states that does not report statistics
on the human immunodeficiency virus into a databank used to track
the epidemic, which has killed 65,000 people in the state. Wilson,
a Republican, said he would have preferred a bill allowing names to
be recorded and notification of the infected person's sex partners.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS activists and public health workers expressed dismay at the
veto. Pat Christen, executive director of the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation, said it was ``harmful and short-sighted and ...
squanders a unique opportunity to implement an HIV-reporting
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's veto came just before a midnight deadline to act on
legislation from the 1997-98 session.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which HIV weakens the immune system,
subjecting the body to serious infection. AIDS is most often spread
through sexual contact, sharing contaminated needles and infected
blood products.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state does keep track of AIDS cases, many health
officials wanted a statewide system for HIV cases since many new
drug treatments are keeping people from showing symptoms of AIDS
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Assemblywoman Carole Migden, who sponsored the bill
Wilson vetoed, rejected a reporting system that included the
infected person's name so as not to scare people away from getting
tested in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern is that it would deter people who are at the
highest risk of HIV from testing and medical care,'' said Fred
Dillon, state policy director for the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation. ``We need to do everything we can to avoid those kinds
of barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill would have enabled California to modernize its AIDS
case reporting system ... without driving individuals away from HIV
testing and medical care,'' said Dr. Mitchell Katz, the director of
public health in San Francisco. ``(The bill) represented a sound
public health approach to HIV reporting, and deserved the
governor's support.''
</P>
<P>
   In his veto message, Wilson acknowledged that public health
officials are divided on the best way to report HIV infections. Six
other states have anonymous systems like Migden envisioned, but
Wilson said 30 states report names to a central databank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Existing law ensures confidentiality and protects those with
HIV or AIDS from discrimination,'' Wilson said. ``Any further
concerns over privacy and discrimination do not warrant designing a
reporting system that does not adequately provide for partner
notification. Irrational concerns over privacy should not interfere
with what must be our highest priority, interrupting the chain of
HIV transmission.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also signed into law:
</P>
<P>
   _ A bill mandating prison time for people convicted of having
unprotected sex with the intention of infecting someone with HIV.
The bill calls for up to three, five or eight years in prison, and
allows for public disclosure of the person's HIV status if they are
under investigation for this crime.
</P>
<P>
   The measure does not cover people who have unprotected sex even
when they know they are HIV-positive. Instead, a prosecutor must
work under a tougher legal standard _ proving the person willfully
intended to infect the partner.
</P>
<P>
   _ A measure requiring emergency regulations to protect health
care workers from unsafe needles that may contain HIV or hepatitis
B and C. Every year, 1 million U.S. health care workers are injured
by being accidentally poked with a needle. The measure forces state
worker-safety agencies to act on the new regulations by Jan. 15,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   _ A measure establishing a new red-ribbon license plate to raise
money for AIDS research in the University of California system. The
plates cost $50 apiece and $40 a year to renew. For the program not
to be canceled, at least 5,000 Californians must order the
red-ribbon plates within two years.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 COLD BAY, Alaska: ... federal lands.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the fight over the road through Izembek National Wildlife
Refuge is the most heated because the road would pass through seven
miles of wilderness, where, by law, ``man is a visitor'' and roads
are forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   People in Alaska, home to half of all federal wilderness, have
long chafed at land policies they regard as rigid. Murkowski said
Congress should ``occasionally make exceptions to allow access
across a wilderness for a legitimate purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Babbitt and conservation groups such as Defenders of
Wildlife and the National Audubon Society say that Izembek, 300,000
acres of rolling green and gold hills that provide some of the
richest coastal bird feeding areas in the country, is the perfect
place to make a stand against wilderness development.
</P>
<P>
   An entire sub-species of geese, the Pacific black brant, stop at
Izembek to build strength for their winter migration, feasting on
the beds of eelgrass piled like mounds of spinach along the shore.
Once they leave, the birds fly for 60 hours straight to Mexico,
losing a third of their body weight.
</P>
<P>
   A road, even if it is used only once an hour, could reduce the
birds' chances of surviving their migration, argues biologist
Michael Roy of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. ``If they are
flushed once an hour and take 10 minutes to settle down, the
effect'' on feeding ``could be substantial,'' Roy said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the hundreds of brown bears of Izembek, beasts that
grow up to 9 feet tall, could face increased hunting pressure from
King Cove-based guides who would gain easy access to the
wilderness. ``It becomes a day hunt all of a sudden for some of the
best brown bear hunting, arguably, in the world,'' said Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the road would pass directly through the wintering area
of a caribou herd that is only now beginning to recover from a
natural population crash in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a place you can defend against a road, it's
Izembek,'' said Roy. ``There's no need for habitat management or
restoration because it's all here. It hasn't been screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Road supporters scoff at the idea that a dirt road would harm
the wildlife, noting that the refuge already has roads that are
used by hunters and fishermen. It was decided, in fact, not have a
paved road in order to minimize the impact to the environment. Even
the wilderness section of the refuge still has a few miles of old
military roads, though they are not maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about the animals,'' said Jim Plowers, vice
mayor of Cold Bay. He said people carrying on about the wildlife
are the same people who, in the 1960s, said, ``Play guitar. End the
war. Sit around the campfire and sing `Kumbaya.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens's office, too, says environmentalists needlessly pumped
up the controversy, applying urban sensibilities to a wild place.
They note that, in exchange for 85 acres where the road would go,
an Aleut-run corporation would agree to turn over 664 acres to the
refuge under Murkowski's bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska is a very unique case,'' said a member of Stevens's
staff, both because of its enormity and an economy dependent on
natural resources. ``Policies that work well in ... small eastern
states may not work as well in Alaska.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Alaska is unique, the place where, more than anywhere
else in the United States, nature has not been tamed.
</P>
<P>
   Though Alaska is twice the size of Texas, its road system is the
size of Vermont's, due largely to impenetrable mountains, glaciers,
and other obstacles, as well as the lack of people to drive on
them. As a result, more than 150 villages across the state are
accessible only by plane or boat.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the communities in the Bush, as Alaska's vast rural
outback is known, enjoy their isolation. Residents of the fishing
village of Cordova have repeatedly voted down a road project that
would have connected them to the highway.
</P>
<P>
   But most residents of King Cove feel a little too isolated.
Since the late 1970s, various government agencies have touted a
road from King Cove to Cold Bay as a way to boost the area's
fishing economy. In 1995, Governor Tony Knowles renewed the call
for a road, saying it ``would allow the bountiful wild salmon
caught in the King Cove area to be delivered quickly ... anywhere
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans in Congress have taken leadership on the road,
focusing relentlessly on the medical need for it. ``How many Aleuts
have to die'' before the road is built? asked Young.
</P>
<P>
   Backers recite a litany of victims, such as Tatiana Samuelson,
whose husband had to wait three days to get to a hospital after his
1989 heart attack because severe weather closed King Cove's
airstrip. The delay damaged his heart, ultimately requiring a
transplant, she said. Her husband died in 1992 at the age of 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sincerely believe if we could have gotten him out of here
when he had his heart attack, he would still be alive today,'' said
Samuelson.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that, while the rural health problems are real,
a road costing $14 million to $29 million is not the solution when
bad weather will often make it impassible.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately, a University of Alaska at Anchorage study found
that ``telemedicine'' could eliminate 49 percent of all medical
evacuations from rural areas by allowing doctors to treat patients
from afar. A video screen would bring doctor and patient face to
face, while the phone line would transmit information about the
patient's condition.
</P>
<P>
   For those who require hospitalization, road critics say a
helicopter emergency squad or a marine rescue team might work
better than a road, while allowing emergency crews to serve other
isolated communities who would not benefit from the road.
</P>
<P>
   But Marilyn Mack, chief of the King Cove rescue squad, said the
alternatives seem dreamed up by outsiders who do not know what it
is like to be so close to Alaska's third largest airport and not be
able to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes sense to be able to take a car and drive a
patient to the airport,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, some residents say that people who choose to live
hours from medical care have to accept that they are taking a
health risk. ``There are many sacrifices we make and risks we must
accept,'' said Terri L. Mach of Cold Bay. ``We have made this
choice, fully cognizant of the risks, just as a mountain climber
ascends a peak.''

<P>
   COLD BAY, Alaska _ It is hard to imagine a place further removed
from America's love affair with the car: a windswept cluster of
pre-fab houses and Quonset huts on the edge of the tundra, with no
roads connecting them to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the main road is dirt, and people share it with the huge
brown bears who sometimes wander in from the nearby wildlife
refuge. The only way out for the 82 residents _ the reason Cold Bay
exists at all _ is a World War II-era airstrip literally big enough
to land the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   But a proposal to build a one-lane dirt road connecting Cold Bay
to the even more isolated village of King Cove has made this ground
zero in the national debate over where America's highways should
end.
</P>
<P>
   Despite veto threats from the Clinton administration, Alaska's
senators were to launch their bid Thursday to win approval for a
27-mile road through a prized federal wilderness where birds and
caribou now roam largely free of people. The Alaskans say the road
will save lives by giving King Cove emergency access to an
all-weather airport.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists believe the road is a Trojan horse,
appealingly cast as a medical issue when the real goal is to weaken
protection for 15,000 square miles of wilderness from the
California desert to the Great Swamp of New Jersey. Since the
Wilderness Act passed in 1964, no permanent road has been built
through legally protected wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt calls the Cold Bay-King Cove
road ``the opening shots against the integrity of our nation's
parks, wilderness areas, and wildlife refuges.'' If the road is
built, Babbitt warned last summer, the ardently prodevelopment
Alaskan congressional delegation ``will have driven a stake through
the heart of wild places everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Once one road is built through wilderness, administration
officials say, the next will be harder to resist. And for what
follows, they point to the tourist-jammed roads to Yellowstone
National Park to Alaska itself, whose population growth followed
construction of a road to the ``Lower 48.''
</P>
<P>
   While the argument goes on in Washington, the people who live in
King Cove and Cold Bay are divided, too. Here, people debate
whether a road is the best solution to a health crisis common to
scores of communities in Alaska's roadless areas.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic in King Cove, a predominantly Aleut village of 770
near the Aleutian Islands, has no doctor, or even a technician who
who can read X-rays. Anyone who is seriously ill or injured has to
be airlifted to Anchorage, 750 miles away. The Aleuts are native
people who have lived in southwestern Alaska for thousands of
years.
</P>
<P>
   That is dicey in a region known as ``the birthplace of the
wind'' for its 80-mile-an-hour gusts and 300 days a year of
overcast weather. Only Cold Bay's airport, built to repel the
Japanese invasion of the Aleutian Islands, has the electronic
navigation aids to remain open in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Stories abound in King Cove of people forced to wait for vital
medical care because the village's dirt airstrip was closed, such
as the 5-year-old whose broken arm could not be set and the
fisherman who waited three days after a massive heart attack to see
a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, residents of King Cove overwhelmingly support
construction of the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had that darned road, I'd be home right now,'' said
Amidha Porter of King Cove, stranded in Cold Bay for the night on
her way home from gall bladder surgery in Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   Other residents, especially in Cold Bay, believe that
alternatives, such as tele-medicine, where doctors treat patients
through electronic communication, should be explored first. They
fear the road will cause as many problems as it solves, bringing
drunk driving, auto accidents, and other problems more common to
the Lower 48.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you build a road, I'm buying a wrecker and I'll be busy on
Friday and Saturday nights,'' said John Waterhouse, manager of Cold
Bay's bar, grocery store, and motel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But Alaska's congressional delegation brook no talk of
alternatives, and are going all out to get the road. ``If anyone in
this Senate votes against me, this is one I will not forget,''
warned Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican, at a hearing last
June.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, observers expect a close vote in the Senate,
perhaps on party lines, as environmentally oriented Republicans
feel pressured to back senators Stevens and Frank Murkowski, both
of whom chair important committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough vote,'' said Nicholas Graham, spokesman for
Senator John Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island. He said Chafee,
usually closely tied to environmental groups, remains undecided on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists increasingly oppose new roads on public lands,
viewing them as the first step toward exploitation of remote
places. Earlier this year, they persuaded the US Forest Service to
freeze construction of logging roads in many national forests,
roads that first allow logging, but then permit much heavier
recreational use of formerly inaccessible areas.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful Alaska delegation on Capitol Hill represent perhaps
the major challenge to that view, often pushing for more
development of public land. Stevens is chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, while Representative Don Young and
Murkowski, respectively, chair the House and Senate environmental
committees.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the trio has pushed a variety of measures to open
undeveloped areas, including bills to permit a road across a major
waterfowl feeding area in Alaska's Chugach National Forest, to
study a new road in the park near Mount McKinley, and to allow
helicopter tourism throughout Alaskan federal lands.

 Of genes and obesity: More clues to a link
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Boston's Joslin Diabetes Center have discovered
another defective gene that can cause severe obesity, adding to
clues about the connection between genes and weight.
</P>
<P>
   The normal gene controls the formation of adipocytes, or
fat-storing cells. When it is mutated, the gene speeds the
development of fat cells, enhancing the body's fat storage,
according to a report in the current issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The mutant gene, called peroxisome-proliferator-activated
receptor gamma-2, was found in four of 121 very obese men and women
in a group of unrelated individuals in the North-Rhine-Westphalia
region of western Germany. Further study is under way to determine
if the mutant gene is similarly common in other populations, said
Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, director of the Joslin center, who authored the
report along with Dr. Michael Ristow.
</P>
<P>
   Neither this gene nor several others that have been uncovered
the past few years account for a significant amount of obesity,
Kahn said in an interview. ``But while rare, they are beginning to
help us understand something about the genetics of obesity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Predicting fatal risks of a heart syndrome
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the estimated 25,000 to 50,000 Americans with a genetic
heart condition called long-QT syndrome are likely to die suddenly
in moments of stress, while others tend to have recurrent fainting
spells that are not fatal. Now, a genetic test can pick out those
at highest risk of sudden death and target them for treatments such
as implantible defibrillators, says a report in the current issue
of the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Long-QT syndrome causes abnormal heart rhythms that can be fatal
in young athletes or other young people under physical or
psychological stress, said Dr. Arthur J. Moss of the University of
Rochester School of Medicine, an author of the article. In studying
541 people with the syndrome, the researchers found that one of
three different genetic mutations that can cause the syndrome is
associated with a higher risk of death than the other two.
</P>

   ``This means that by identifying a higher-risk group'' with a
gene test ``we can use drugs or put in a defibrillator'' that can
shock the abnormal heart rhythm back to normal, he said.

 &UR; Lymph-node surgery: Methods are debated

</P>
<P>
   Removingall the under-arm lymph nodes in a woman with breast
cancer is the standard way of determining whether the cancer has
spread beyond the breast. But this surgery causes pain, swelling,
and other side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Removing just the ``sentinal node,'' the first gland that the
cancer would reach, is a new method that avoids extensive surgery.
But a study from the University of Vermont and other centers,
published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found varying
success rates among surgeons and patients, and said that in some
cases the sentinel node couldn't be identified.
</P>
<P>
   A group of specialists said in an accompanying editorial that a
number of questions need to be answered in ongoing trials. Until
then, said the specialists, led by Dr. Kelly M. McMasters of the
University of Louisville, the standard method shouldn't be
abandoned.

<P>
   A bone-building drug called pamindronate can increase bone mass,
reduce pain, and maintain growth in children with osteogenesis
imperfecta, a genetic disorder also known as ``brittle-bone
disease,'' scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,000 and possibly 50,000 people in the United States
have the disease, which has several forms and can cause patients to
have hundreds of fractures and be unusually short because their
vertebrae are fractured and compressed.
</P>
<P>
   No treatment has been very successful up to now, say the
scientists reporting in the New England Journal, led by Dr. Francis
H. Glorieux of the Shriners Hospital for Children in Montreal. But
pamindronate, which prevents bone cells from being reabsorbed by
the body, helped slow bone turnover in the trial involving 30
children, and enabled four of them to stop using wheelchairs.

GAY ISSUE BRINGS DISCORD TO MAINE RESORT TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OGUNQUIT, Maine _ Rustled by brisk, early autumn winds, the
colorful flags fly from the porch of a quaint roadside inn here,
bright symbols of tolerance that have become banners of division.
</P>
<P>
   In this seaside tourist resort, acclaimed for its shimmering
seashore and phenomenal foliage, a storm is gathering. One official
already has resigned his post in protest. Another could be forced
out in November.
</P>
<P>
   In a town where gays and lesbians have lived in harmony with the
straight community for decades, a raw debate about a local bid to
outlaw discrimation based on sexual orientation threatens to
dislodge Ogunquit's live-and-let-live philosophy _ an easygoing
rhythm in tempo with a place that proclaims itself the ``beautiful
place by the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten all very complicated for an issue that started
with a flag,'' said Albert Dello Russo, a member of the Planning
Board. ``Ogunquit has always been a very tolerant community. There
have always been a lot of gay people and gay businessmen here.
Until this happened, everybody was friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this is forcing people to sort of take sides on
homosexuality. It's been very divisive to this place.''
</P>
<P>
   This town, where neon is banned in favor of hand-crafted wooden
signs and the bed-and-breakfast inns serve coffee from sterling
silver service, is an improbable backdrop for division.
</P>
<P>
   But after Maine voters decided narrowly last February to strip
civil rights protections from gays and lesbians, leaving the state
the only one in New England without such a law, Ogunquit's
tranquillity began to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   The town had overwhelmingly opposed the Feb. 10 referendum
rescinding Maine's gay-rights law. Four months later, local
officials decided to adopt a proclamation, making it plain that
Ogunquit abhors discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Before a standing-room-only public meeting, the Board of
Selectmen embraced the proclamation. It carries no force of law,
but officials believed that it signaled that Ogunquit's view of gay
rights differs from the new statewide policy.
</P>
<P>
   But for David Mills, who with his partner Garry John purchased
the red-shingled Admiral's Inn on Route 1 three years ago, that
didn't go far enough. And when he asked why the town did not enact
a strong antidiscrimination ordinance instead of a toothless
proclamation, he apparently drew the ire of John Miller, the
72-year-old chairman of the Board of Selectmen who is unaccustomed
to challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, as Mills sat in the inn's office, poring over
paperwork, he heard a commotion outside _ a rumpus the innkeeper
said he first tried to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this elderly gentleman in a vehicle, screaming and
yelling and waving his fist. And when I went outside, Miller
continued in this rage and demanded that we take down the flag,''
Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   The inn's rainbow flag, a welcoming symbol for gays and
lesbians, had flown for three years without any complaint that it
violated Ogunquit's ban on decorative flags, an ordinance intended
to stomp out tackiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him who he was, and I asked what the problem was, and
he said, `That flag's illegal, and it has to be taken down.' He was
in a rage,'' Mills said. ``I swear if he was able to get a hold of
me, he would have killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of that scene unfolded quickly and, some say,
irrationally.
</P>
<P>
   The Planning Board quickly dubbed the rainbow flags political
statements protected by free speech. But the state attorney
general's office ruled that Miller had not violated the innkeepers'
civil rights when he told them to take down the flag. The
innkeepers nailed a sign to their porch, accusing the town of
discrimination, and demanded Miller's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Tossing accelerant on an already-raging firestorm, Miller said
he was not about to be pushed out of office, telling the Portland
Press Herald: ``I can't accept homosexuality. But that's a
political opinion. And you can't remove a chairman for his
political views.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying the uproar was causing him constant headaches and stomach
pains, the town's only openly gay selectman, Robert G. Brown,
resigned, and within weeks local officials had placed a measure to
recall Miller on the same Nov. 3 ballot that will carry a local
ordinance that would bar discrimination based on sexual orientation
in housing, credit, and public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little bumps in the road become earthquakes in a small
town,'' said Paul Hagen, a 66-year-old retiree who chairs the
Planning Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Miller is very pigheaded and argumentative, and because
of his actions he's brought this to a head,'' Hagen said. ``And the
people he had the conflict with are exactly the same _
argumentative and aggressive. They've fought back, and they've gone
too far. I don't think the gay community supports them any
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   While many agree that Miller and the innkeepers are on the
extreme margins of an issue that is more complex and nuanced, their
high-volume public scuffle is forcing an open and sometimes
uncomfortable examination of Ogunquit's commitment to equality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be OK to be gay in Ogunquit if you kept your mouth
shut,'' said Hal Feldberg, a leading oust-Miller activist who runs
a dance bar called The Club. ``That's not true anymore, and it's
not going to be true. Miller cannot do what he wants to do. In my
opinion, he's treating the gay community as second-class citizens.
We contribute a tremendous amount of tax dollars to the town of
Ogunquit, and we deserve equal treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Few, at least publicly, are disputing that. There is no
organized opposition to the gay rights measure. But some residents
say voters may feel they must choose between a veteran official,
who by all accounts has worked hard for his town, and a measure to
protect a minority group that traces its connection here to early
1900s arts studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad it's gotten to this point because Ogunquit has
always had a gay community and it was pretty much, `You don't
bother us, we won't bother you.' And now people will have to say
what they're for and what they're against,'' said Kathy King, a
45-year-old cashier who grew up here. ``And some people may not
have the strength to stand up to their convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, stripped of his chairmanship earlier this month, would
not be interviewed for this story. His wife said he has been badly
hurt by the publicity. Working at the ice cream shop he runs with
his family, he politely waved a reporter away one afternoon last
week. ``I bear you no ill will,'' he said. ``I just don't want to
be a part of your story.''
</P>
<P>
   Many residents said Miller has been overtaken by times that
demand tolerance, and predicted that Miller will be recalled on
Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Littlefield Seaman, a 68-year-old amateur historian who
traces his family's roots here to 1643, said Miller should be
allowed to serve the rest of his term and retire in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Miller is his own worst enemy,'' Seaman said. ``I've
never agreed with everything John has said, but I don't think he
should be recalled. Some of these new people coming into town, like
those guys at the Admiral's Inn, seem to want to cause trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Not true, said Mills, who has added four more rainbow flags to
the porch of the inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the poor old man, I really do,'' said Mills.
``It's too bad that he can't adjust. I hate to see anyone put
through this. He has worked for the town for a number of years and
has done a good job. But he's overstepped his bounds.''

A NOT-SO-HOT IMPERSONATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not content with being cute and popular, the Apple iMac on my
desk has lately begun doing an impersonation of a Windows PC. It's
better than my impersonation of Charles Bronson, but not a whole
lot better.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago I wrote about a couple of nice PC programs for
searching the Internet. I complained in passing that the programs
aren't also available for the Macintosh. I got the usual barrage of
responses from Mac users _ a few rude, but most of them useful.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, readers pointed out that the next upgrade to the
Mac operating system will include a feature called Sherlock, which
is similar to the PC search programs I wrote about. Industry rumor
has it that the Mac upgrade will appear in mid-October, though the
company has not confirmed this.
</P>
<P>
   But other readers declared that I needn't wait. I could run my
favorite Windows programs on the iMac, they said. All I needed was
emulation software _ a program that makes a Mac imitate a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Emulation software tries to solve an old problem in computing.
Traditional computer software is tightly bound to the hardware used
to run it. Operating systems like Windows and the Mac OS are
designed for specific processor chips. Windows was designed to run
on chips designed by Intel Corp., or on clones of Intel chips. Mac
OS works with the old 68000 series of chips from Motorola Inc., or
the newer Power PC chip from Motorola and IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Real people use the software that runs on top of the operating
system _ browsers, word processors, games. But these programs have
to be written especially for a given operating system, which in
turn is written for a particular chip. And that's why you can't
play the PC version of, say, Mechwarrior 2 on a Mac.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you could write a program that would make your
computer pretend to be a different kind of computer? Engineers have
done this for years. How do you think they design new chips? They
write a program that will work exactly like the new chip they're
designing. Then they load this program on a computer, and see what
happens when they run it. This way, they can fix bugs in the chip
design without having to burn any real silicon. In the same way,
you can make a Power PC-equipped Mac think it's a Pentium-based PC.
</P>
<P>
   Just one problem with this approach. You're using a piece of
software to make one piece of hardware pretend it's another piece
of hardware. Perhaps out of sheer confusion, the whole thing tends
to go rather slowly.
</P>
<P>
   So I've discovered while using SoftWindows 98, from Insignia
Solutions of Fremont, Calif. SoftWindows is one of the most popular
PC emulators for Mac users. The box cites a Chicago Tribune
reviewer's claim that a Mac with SoftWindows runs PC software as
well as a 266-megahertz Pentium.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Trib guy's Mac was specially modified by NASA. On my
straight-from-the-box iMac with 32 megs of RAM chips, SoftWindows
98 can't even match the old 120-megahertz Pentium I'm typing this
on.
</P>
<P>
   SoftWindows is adequate for standard business applications like
word processing. With some advice from Insignia executives, I got
it tuned to where Microsoft Word ran only a little slower than it
does on a real PC. But Web browsing in SoftWindows is distinctly
sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are games. There are far more available for PCs than
for Macs, and some of you may be tempted to buy SoftWindows just
for play. But SoftWindows has trouble with some popular PC games. I
tried a favorite shoot-'em-up, ActiVision's Mechwarrior 2, but it
was SoftWindows that crashed and burned. I did get Quake to run,
but it was more of a limp.
</P>
<P>
   Emulator programs are memory hogs, so the measly 32 megs in an
iMac are far too few for a proper test. I'll bet Mac users with
hotter boxes get much better performance. But a lot of iMac buyers
are computer newbies who may believe that buying SoftWindows will
turn their Mac into a crackerjack PC. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need a PC more than a third of the time, a separate PC
probably is worth it,'' an Insignia spokeswoman admitted. Good
point, especially when you consider SoftWindows 98 lists for $169.
Nowadays you can get a real PC for a few hundred more, instead of
turning your iMac into a not-so-hot PC impersonator.

AS ANNIVERSARY NEARS, MOXLEY HOPES BUOYED  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Dorthy Moxley, October is the cruelest month.
</P>
<P>
   When the fall arrives, and the leaves whirl, her anxiety builds
up to the final days of the month, when Moxley must mark the
anniversary of the savage murder of her daughter Martha.
</P>
<P>
   But this month, for the first time in 23 years, Moxley's anxiety
is tinged with nervous excitement as she watches prosecutors track
down reluctant grand jury witnesses, and compel them to tell what
they know about the killing of the 15-year-old Greenwich, Conn.
girl _ and the whereabouts of Michael and Thomas Skakel, brothers
who lived next door, on the night of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony remains secret, but pressure on the Skakels is
increasing as key witnesses receive grants of immunity and others
are forced to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is progressing, that's for sure,'' said Dorthy
Moxley Wednesday, during a telephone interview from her home in a
New Jersey suburb. ``It's like a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael and Thomas Skakel, who both live in Massachusetts now,
are the nephews of Ethel Kennedy, widow of Robert F. Kennedy. Both
Skakels for years have been repeatedly named as suspects in
Moxley's slaying, though no grand jury was ever convened and no
charges ever brought. Both, through their attorneys, have
repeatedly denied killing Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, police are searching for a cousin of the Skakels _
James Terrien _ who is key to Michael Skakel's version of events on
Oct. 30, the night Moxley was clubbed to death with a six-iron and
dragged across the lawn between her parents' home and the
Skakels's. Skakel has reportedly told police he was at Terrien's
house that night.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, prosecutors granted immunity to a former tutor for
the Skakel brothers, Kenneth Littleton, who had refused to testify
earlier, exercising his Fifth Amendment right. But after
negotiations with Connecticut State's Attorney Jonathan C.
Benedict, Littleton, who was in the Skakel home the night Moxley
was killed, testified. He did so with the understanding that he
could not be prosecuted for any crime connected to the case except
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a man who headed the Elan School in Poland Spring,
Maine, during the nearly two years that Michael Skakel attended the
private institution and received treatment for emotional and
behavioral trouble has been ordered to appear after initially
refusing. Michael Skakel reportedly began living at the school in
the spring of 1978, when Joseph Ricci was director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only say that Joseph Ricci was here, and that he refused
to answer questions, and that he was served with an order
compelling him to return on Oct. 8,'' said State Inspector Frank
Garr.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare proceeding, Connecticut prosecutors are presenting
evidence to a single grand juror in Superior Court _ Judge George
Thim. About two-thirds of the men and women on the witness list
have appeared, 35 in all, according to Garr, who would not comment
on the content of the secret proceedings. Investigators requested
the grand jury this year, saying they had new evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Dorthy Moxley said she has always wanted police to
question Terrien, the Skakels' cousin, who also uses the name James
Dowdle, and whose last known address was reported to be on
Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the night that Martha was missing, I called the Skakels
many times, and one time Julie (Skakel) suggested I call the
Terriens, and when I called, he (James) wasn't home,'' said Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the investigation said an attorney for
the Skakel family is fighting the introduction of material in a
private investigator's report, detailing how Michael and Thomas
Skakel apparently changed their accounts of the night of Halloween
Eve, 1975.

CARDSCAN IS COOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go to a conference, an afternoon seminar, or even a high-powered
dinner party, and you're likely to come home with a fist full of
business cards. A quaint holdover from the 19th century, business
cards are actually one of the primary techniques for circulating
names, addresses and contact information in the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Business cards are incredibly flexible, and decidedly low-tech.
You can be really simple and just put your name, address and phone
number on a card. Or you can get fancy, and populate your little
piece of real estate with a logo, two addresses, a company slogan
and more. Today's business cards increasingly are filled with
Internet-related information, like e-mail addresses and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But while business cards are a great way to transmit
information, they're not terribly practical for information storage
_ they're easy to misplace, and it's hard to search through a stack
of cards to find somebody in particular.
</P>
<P>
   One approach that I have used in the past for dealing with
business cards is to photocopy a dozen or so cards onto a big page,
punch holes in the paper, and keep everything in a three-ring
binder. The cards that I find myself referring to again and again
got typed into my computerized address book, which makes it easy to
drop somebody an e-mail or to address an envelope to them.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to manage your business cards is to scan them into
your computer directly, then manage the information using CardScan,
a nifty product by Corex Technologies. Stripped-down versions of
CardScan ship with some scanners, such as Visioneer's PaperPort.
Corex just shipped Version 4 of its full-strength application,
priced at roughly $80.
</P>
<P>
   CardScan is actually two products in one. The first is a Windows
95 contact-management program which is specially optimized for
managing scanned business cards. The second part of the CardScan
equation is the CardScan 300 business card scanner. This $270
device connects to a Windows-based computer through the parallel
port and lets you scan cards directly into the CardScan
application.
</P>
<P>
   The CardScan application program is a pleasure to use. The
address book creates a little database with the fields for each of
the pieces of information (Name, Title, etc.) that goes on a
business card. Although I prefer free-format address books to those
based on fields, CardScan is flexible enough to store many
different kinds of addresses.
</P>
<P>
   For each business card , CardScan stores an image in its
database. The program then analyzes the card, looking for the
person's name, address, phone, and other information. The program
automatically recognizes words like ``Fax'' and ``Pager'' and
assigns the information to fields with these labels. Slogans show
up in a field called ``Other.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a card is scanned into a database, you can go back and
proofread the information. As you correct it, CardScan will
automatically display the particular part of the card from where
the information was scanned. That's good attention to usability on
the part of Corex.
</P>
<P>
   CardScan has a great ``QuickSearch'' feature that lets you
quickly find the entry for a person by just typing a few letters of
their name. For example, type ``h'' and all of the entries in your
address book that begin with ``h'' in either their first or last
name appear. Type an ``o'' and
</P>
<P>
   all of the names that begin ``Ho'' will appear.
</P>
<P>
   By default, the QuickSearch screen displays the person's name,
company and phone, although you can customize this. To see the
person's full record, just click on their name. You can also click
on a little icon of a telephone to dial their phone number or click
on an envelope to send them email.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few rough edges here and there. The CardScan program
crashed on me frequently; I never lost information, but programs
shouldn't crash. The program doesn't let me click on URLs and
automatically open them in Web browsers, and it sends e-mail using
Microsoft's MAPI system, rather than just using the ``mailto:''
system that Internet Explorer and Netscape use.
</P>
<P>
   But my biggest gripe is not with the handling of e-mail, but
with paper envelopes. It would be nice if I could just click a
button and have an envelope come off my printer with the address,
bar code, and return address. You can do this with CardScan, but
it's difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that the CardScan scanner has been on the
market for a number of years, I never took it very seriously. After
all, I had a full-size scanner. Why spend $270 on a second scanner
that just scans business cards? The reason, I've recently
discovered, is quality.
</P>
<P>
   Although CardScan's software can work with conventional
scanners, the optical character recognition does a much better job
when it used with the company's special-purpose scanner. Cards that
I've scanned with my Visioneer PaperPort routinely have scanning
errors that need to be corrected. Card images that I scanned with
my PaperPort and transferred to the CardScan application also have
a way of occasionally making the application program crash. This
must be due to some disagreement between Visioneer and Corex on the
file format. Whatever the reason, it is most annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Cards that I scan with the CardScan 300 scanner, on the other
hand, normally scan with no errors whatsoever. The scanning process
is smooth and simple. And unlike other scanning applications that
I've used, you can do all of your scanning at once, then leave your
computer alone while it does the optical character recognition in
the background.
</P>
<P>
   The new 4.0 version of the CardScan application allows you to
transfer your scanned cards into more than 40 different
applications, including ACT!, Day-Timer Organizer, Lotus Organizer,
and Microsoft Outlook. You can also synchronize the CardScan
application directly with a 3Com Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I'm quite pleased with CardScan. The application is a
great address book, and the scanner does a great job with OCR. I
think that the company actually does itself a disservice by
bundling its software with scanners made by other vendors: by doing
a bad job with scanners like PaperPort, Corex gives its core
technology a black eye.
</P>

EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT CHENILLE APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   So plush. Warm. Cuddly. We're not talking teddy bears, we're
talking chenille. Some 60 years ago, that fuzzy yarn first cropped
up in this country in the form of bedspreads and bathrobes.
Fast-forward to the early '90s. Chenille transformed itself into
colorful sweaters that were all the rage. As the decade nears its
end, chenille furnishings have migrated back into millions of
homes.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with its meaning in French _ hairy caterpillar _
chenille has seen its future as a butterfly. In the past five
years, this tufted velvety yarn has matured into beautifully
textured and patterned upholstery and slipcover fabrics and
luxurious furniture throws, pillows, tassels, and trims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chenille is especially appropriate for the New England climate
because it gives a warm, lush feeling to a room,'' says Susan
Shulman of Susan Shulman Interiors in West Newton, Mass. ``It's a
very soft and tactile fabric that seems to envelop you in a way
other fabrics don't. It's like wrapping yourself in a blanket. And
there's a natural tooth to it that keeps you in place, unlike
sitting on leather, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   In Shulman's opinion, chenille is a gender-neutral fabric. It
appeals to everyone and comes in a wide array of colors, textures,
and prices. The most popular colors are muted, neutral tones _ the
beiges and off-whites.
</P>
<P>
   Chenille, Shulman says, has also taken over the trim, tassel,
and fringe departments of furnishing stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love working with chenille because it's so lush and the
varieties are endless,'' says Shulman. ``Plus the prices vary
widely, as does the quality. It can fit into anyone's budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices depend upon fiber content, says Larry Isaacson,
upholstery buyer for Fabric Place in Framingham, Mass. He says the
most popular chenilles are the softest ones, which are usually made
from 100 percent cotton. Another top seller is a blend of 71
percent cotton and 29 percent polyester. Other blends include rayon
and olefin, man-made additions that allow the fabric to be
classified as ``double rubs'' and rated for heavy-duty use.
</P>
<P>
   David Webster of Webster &AMP; Company in the Boston Design Center
raves about his top-of-the-line chenilles. They are made from 100
percent viscose, a manmade fiber that is strong and luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the viscose because it's more durable than other
chenilles and has a prettier look to it,'' says Webster. ``The
sheen is really beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   What everyone agrees on is that upholstery chenilles must come
with backing, whether knit or acrylic, to make them durable. The
softer or looser the chenille, the more fragile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important to know the fabric because many chenilles
must be backed with a stabilizing finish before they can be used,''
says Cheryl Chernack of A Second Opinion Design in Natick, Mass.
``They have a great deal of stretch and movement and without the
proper backing and preparation, the final product could stretch and
wrinkle. But if they are properly backed, they can take a lot of
wear and tear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chenille is a very interesting yarn because it is twisted and
can be woven in different ways,'' says Mike Zimman, owner of
Zimman's in Lynn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a technical, weaving point of view, you can do a lot more
with it than velvet. It's also a very textured and comfortable
fabric. It provides the nesting comfort that people are looking for
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Goldberg of PGG Interiors of Providence, R.I. sees a
trend toward using chenille in vacation homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use it a lot in summer settings,'' she says. ``There's
nothing more comfortable than coming in from a round of golf or a
tennis game and sitting on a chenille sofa or chair with bare legs.
Besides that, I think chenille has such a calming influence on
people.''
</P>
<P>
   This may hark back to the days of tufted bedspreads and
bathrobes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a memory thing, almost Proustian,'' says Rick Garafolo of
the home-furnishings store Repertoire in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something very powerful about the message that
chenille brings up for our customers. It's a very positive memory.
And although chenille is a mainstream fabric and has been around
for a number of years, we have recently used it for drapes and
pillows and on club chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The story goes that at the turn of the century, a Georgia
teenager named Catherine Evans Whitener wanted to give her brother
a special gift for his wedding. So she made a bedspread decorated
with soft cotton turfs. Thus, chenille was born.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; By the '40s, spreads and bathrobes made from the fabric were
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But just in the past five years, chenille has become a fabric to
reckon with in the home-furnishings industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chenille has made an incredible resurgence in the past two
years,'' says Dan Gaudet, manager of the Lee Jofa showroom at the
Boston Design Center. ``It is an updated replacement for antique
velvets. There are so many new chenilles with various napes,
textures, and patterns. They just don't come in solids as in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Leni Joyce, president of Leni's Inc., a fabric mill in
Watertown, Mass., says she started hand weaving chenilles 18 years
ago. Then, no one wanted them. Today, she can't keep up with her
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chenilles are not just relegated to family rooms anymore,''
says Fabric Place's Isaacson. ``The solid chenilles still are
appropriate for dens because they are more casual. But the tapestry
chenilles can be used in more formal settings. And Italian and
Belgium mills have started using their chenille yarns in historic
prints that are hundreds of years old. They are beautiful. I
definitely think they are here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Patty Anjesky, design consultant for Choice Seating in
Cambridge, Mass., agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'll ever go out of style,'' says Anjesky.
``It's a very rich look. It makes a statement along the lines of
velvet. It's a classic.''

A DAUGHTER'S GIFT OF UNDERSTANDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My daughter Laura gave me a dress for my birthday. The material
is an Indonesian print sprinkled with a series of moons in their
various phases and it's so short I'm using it as a tunic over
tights. It's definitely a hippie-type dress designed for someone
much younger, but I'm wearing it anyway. I take Laura's gift as a
sign that I'm finally entering that stage of life when I no longer
have to worry about mortifying my children.
</P>
<P>
   It was very different back in the late '60s and early 70s. There
I was in my favorite costume, an anklet with bells and wide-legged
jeans I'd embroidered with dragons and mermaids, embarrassing my
kids every time I jingled. Before I went anywhere near their
schools, the kids insisted on dressing me in the most conservative
clothing they could find in my closet. When I talked to strangers
in elevators or in line at the movies, they cringed and pretended
they were with someone else. More than anything, they wanted me to
look and dress and act like a mother, a role they felt should be
filled by someone who was quiet, well-mannered, dignified, and, as
far as I could tell, nearly invisible.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to please them, but I couldn't imagine enjoying life if
I could no longer laugh with my head thrown back and my mouth open.
I doubted I could twist myself, like a pretzel, into someone who
takes up very little space and never calls attention to herself. I
didn't want to give up my leather mini-skirts, my pink aviator
glasses, or my yellow high-heeled clogs, but I certainly never
blamed my kids for trying to rein me in.
</P>
<P>
   I'd felt exactly the same way about my own mother.
</P>
<P>
   My mother painted in oils and made recordings for the blind. No
one else's mom did anything like that. Refusing to become a
housewife, she ignored the dishes in the sink and the mounting
piles of laundry. How could I invite anyone to our messy house?
Plus, she'd talk to anyone. Once, when we were driving past Fort
Devens, one of the guards whistled at our car. She turned around
and went back. ``Did you want something?'' she asked sweetly, as
the guy, realizing he'd whistled at a woman twice his age, turned
beet red. When you went somewhere with my mother, anything could
happen. I smile now, but at the time I sank back into the passenger
seat and wished I was anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   A funny thing happened on my way to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   I became proud of her.
</P>
<P>
   I came to see my mother as a woman who followed her own heart in
many ways. She chose to do things that made her feel creative and
useful. She ignored the conventions that would have confined her to
home and hearth, and though working was not really an option for
women in her position in the '40s and '50s, she filled her leisure
time with imagination and playfulness. She supported the same
traits in her children, giving generously of her time and energy as
long as we did things that interested her. This lady, whom I often
railed at for ``ruining'' my life, was actually a great model.
</P>
<P>
   Who would want to grow up if it meant putting yourself in a
straitjacket as envisioned by a 12-year-old?
</P>
<P>
   Like her, I didn't give in to my kids' importuning. I was afraid
that if I trimmed my sails and made myself into the very model of a
model mother, the day would come when my kids would look at me and
decide that they certainly didn't want to grow up to become this
same pale shadow of a whole person. I was convinced my kids would
view my self-abnegation as a diminishment of my real self. Besides,
I knew they'd never take the responsibility for having done this to
me. They were only children, after all. How could I blame them for
my decisions?
</P>
<P>
   And there I'd be, having suppressed everything that made my life
interesting and fun, for what?
</P>
<P>
   I'd have simply become another kind of embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm taking Laura's gift as a signal that my daughters are
coming to terms with how I dress, at least. There's nothing more
liberating in the world than to reach the point where you
understand that the only person your mother can truly embarrass is
herself. I can only hope my daughters reach that point soon. Since
both of them are more conservative than I am, you'll never find
them looking like characters from a local production of ``Hair''
who've wandered offstage without removing their costumes.
</P>
<P>
   I can live with that.
</P>
<P>
   As long as they no longer mind if I do.

   CHINA-COMMUNISTS _ BEIJING _ For anyone who thinks that the
Chinese Communist Party is about to wither away and usher in a new
era of Chinese capitalism and democracy, events of the last month
must come as a stunning disappointment. As China celebrates the
49th anniversary of the Communist takeover on Thursday, President
Jiang Zemin has launched a Mao-like propaganda campaign to
celebrate the ``glorious'' achievements of the Chinese Communist
Party and of its military wing, the People's Liberation Army. Talk
of economic reform abounds in this multi-media blitz, but no one is
mentioning politicial reforms that might pave the way for democracy
and dilute the party's power. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service).

<TEXT>
<P>
   Your tousle-haired 10-year-old has just told you to buzz off
when you tell him _ for the third time _ to turn off the TV and set
the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   Your first impulse is to swat him. Your second is to banish him
to his room for a week. The last thing you, as a parent, want to do
is empathize with the little brat and talk through the impasse with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is exactly what child psychologist Ross Greene suggests
you do, if you have a child who is known in the lexicon as
difficult or oppositional. What Greene counsels parents to do is
divert such children from even worse behavior (a violent meltdown),
by using empathy, logic, and judiciously applied compromise.
Punishing a child like this for swearing, he says, will only make
matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's approach to taming what he calls the ``explosive
child'' is a radical departure from the standard strategies for
dealing with disruptive children, and he is the first to admit that
this new approach won't make him popular among many parents or
other mental health professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are parents and teachers who say I'm going to spoil kids
with my approach,'' says Greene, who spells it all out in a
detailed new book called ``The Explosive Child.'' ``After all, it's
the way most of us were raised, with punishment and rewards, and
it's hard to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene is quick to acknowledge that rewards and punishment, when
done properly, are effective with most disruptive children. Such
children, after all, are the majority; specialists estimate that
only between 2 and 16 percent of all children fall into the
category of explosive, and the majority of those are boys. It's
these explosive children for whom the conventional strategies don't
work, Greene argues, and a more nuanced approach is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Many psychologists would take issue with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``These type of kids are not verbally useful, and they don't
learn a lot from talking about their behavior,'' says Thomas
Phelan, a Chicago-area psychologist who has refined the ``1-2-3
Magic'' formula, which involves counting to three when children are
misbehaving and giving them an automatic timeout if the count
reaches three.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan lectures to parents around the country, winning quick
converts to his formula wherever he goes. He has little patience
with mental health professionals like Greene, who attempt a more
complicated approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to dig a hole and jump in it, you can discuss
things with these kids,'' says Phelan, who is himself the father of
a hyperactive child. ``But it doesn't work; you need something
where you're drawing the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, of course, has heard this all before _ from skeptical
parents and colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital, where he
works. So when a reporter also challenges him on his technique,
asking whether it's really such a good idea to compromise on
important issues, such as whether a child should be allowed a
sleepover on a school night, Greene doesn't even sigh. He smiles to
himself, sits further back in his chair, and calmly explains his
philosophy one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not giving in, this is parents proposing a problem and
helping a child collaborate on a solution,'' Greene says. ``Look at
this way: What's more important, blind adherence to authority or
resolving conflict?''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Greene is nothing if not persuasive. But beyond those
powers of persuasion and an endearing lack of defensiveness, it is
easy to see why Greene gets along so well with troubled children
and desperate parents: At first glance, he looks like a child
himself, with an elfish grin, a mop of curly dark hair, and warm
brown eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But at age 40, Greene has been working with troubled youths for
almost 20 years, and his experience shows, in the self-assured way
in which he fields skeptical queries. And it doesn't hurt that by
the time most parents arrive at his office, a tiny and rather
sterile cubicle high near the summit of Mass General's ambulatory
care tower, they are ready to try anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's walking in the door are people who've learned that
teaching the kid who's boss isn't working,'' says Greene, who grew
up in Miami, the well-behaved middle child of parents who did make
clear who was boss. ``They're already so frustrated they're open to
something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these parents, keep in mind, have children who are at
the extreme end of the behavioral spectrum. These are not kids who,
after whining how unfair it is they have to go to bed, will
eventually capitulate in the face of persistent threats. (``You are
going to timeout if you don't get up the stairs this instant.'')
</P>
<P>
   These are children who go from flat resistance to a parental
request _ ``No, I won't!'' _ to an outright meltdown in a matter of
minutes, screaming, cursing, throwing things, even destroying
property and (occasionally) attacking people physically. They don't
melt down all the time, of course, and some of these children may
melt down only with their parents and not in school, but when they
do, it's a horrifying sight.
</P>
<P>
   It's also dangerous, to themselves and to others around them.
Greene says some of the children he has worked with are suicidal,
and a few have threatened to hurt other people. In the most extreme
scenario, a child who shares this profile and is not given the help
he needs could become the next Kip Kinkel, the 15-year-old Oregon
boy who shot his own parents to death and then walked into his
local high school and killed two of his classmates, wounding dozens
of others.

ROBIN WILLIAMS FINDS PARADISE IN PURGATORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robin Williams dies in the first few minutes of ``What Dreams
May Come.'' Fortunately, as the movie's tag line proclaims, the end
is just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows life beyond death and proclaims that a great
love can survive that journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe in that,'' Williams said. ``I believe love
is the one kind of unifying thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in keeping with a movie that deals, sometimes darkly,
with separation and loss, Williams seemed a bit subdued when he
called to talk about his new film, which opens Friday. Subdued, at
least, compared to his usual buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
   But, as is almost always the case with Williams, there comes a
point in the conversation, usually sooner rather than later, when
the chat ceases to be an interview and starts to be a Robin
Williams performance.
</P>
<P>
   The longer you can keep from laughing (not long), the more
straight answers you can get. But once he senses your amusement, it
seems he can't help himself.
</P>
<P>
   So you enter uncharted territory when asking him a question
like, ``Do you believe in life after death?''
</P>
<P>
   Williams took an audible deep breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or, as the Buddhists say, life is a (drag) and then you die
and then you die and then you die? Don't squash that cockroach; it
might be Richard Nixon,'' Williams joked, then, switching to a
Nixon imitation: ``I'm over here. I never ate that chicken. I am
not a cook.''
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes into the interview, and Robin the comedian has
taken control, tossing in humorous lines so fast it's hard to keep
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to follow that act,'' said ``What Dreams May Come''
producer Barnet Bain. ``He's amazing; it's like interviewing a
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Robin first read the script of `What Dreams May Come,' he
called up very excited and said, `I've got to play this part. I'll
play all the parts.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dreams May Come'' is a fantasy in which the initial story
feels familiar _ Williams' character, Chris Nielsen, dies, and his
spirit tries to find a way back to the living.
</P>
<P>
   Like many movie afterlife fantasies, this one is romantic. Chris
wants to contact his wife, Annie (Annabella Sciorra). But it cannot
be done, he's told.
</P>
<P>
   Williams believes such fantasies are popular because people are
fascinated with the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different books and accounts of people who
have had out-of-body experiences,'' he said. ``Or people in L.A.
with out-of-car experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked Annabella, `What do you think death is?' She said,
`I think you die, and then there's a lot of dirt.' That's the
nihilist view. Boom, that's it, thank you, check please.''
</P>
<P>
   But seldom has a romantic fantasy presented such dark twists and
turns for its characters to overcome. The movie deals seriously
with loss, guilt and sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``But also,'' Williams said, ``the idea of eternal love, a love
that goes beyond. It falls in the category of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   And never has a fantasy had such extensive special effects to
portray an alternative world.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of the reason to do it,'' Williams said. ``To see
special effects used in such a unique way _ to create a world. And
not just any world. I mean, I've never seen this done before. I've
seen it to create animals and aliens and lots of explosions but, to
get the virtual van Gogh, that's quite different.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the movie takes place in heaven and hell. To show it on
screen convincingly meant a huge amount of imagination and
special-effects work. Creating two entire worlds also meant a
budget of about $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   The actors spent much of the movie pretending to react to seeing
wondrous or horrible things that would not be added to the movie
until post-production. For Williams the experience was both
familiar and different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done it before,'' Williams said, ``but it's not like
`Jumangi,' where you're running from a Teamster carrying a sign.''
(That's a joke refering to ``Jumangi's'' union problems.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The effects (in `What Dreams May Come') have an emotional
resonance. When you see a tree, it has a lot of emotional
reverberations, and you have to find a way of dealing with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll show you a storyboard . . . and you try to work with
that. After that, it's up to your imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weird thing,'' Williams said, ``because sometimes they
explain to you one thing, and then because of budget cuts or
whatever, it changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The special effects were a major reason the movie took so long
to get to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't the technology to show the visuals,'' said Bain,
whose partner, Stephen Simon, bought the rights to the Richard
Matheson novel 20 years ago. ``Even while we were making the movie,
we were inventing it as we went along.''
</P>
<P>
   Bain also believes the public was not ready for such a spiritual
movie in the past but that has changed because of what he calls
``millennium consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Previously, there was something in our culture that
(suspected) a lack of depth if you had a spiritual center or
thoughts that weren't empirical,'' Bain said. ``A deepening
appetite for issues spiritual and philosophical makes this
mainstream in a pleasing way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bain and Simon set up their film company, Metafilmics, which
made ``What Dreams May Come,'' to make movies that touch people in
a way more profound than action movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metafilmics' movies are about empowering people and showing
the decency of being human and the beauty of being a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   So while effects are essential to ``What Dreams May Come,'' it
is the story and the message that is important, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effects can be astonishing, but if they're not following
the characters, they are kind of like a giant cat toy.'' He
laughed. ``A sparkly.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that emotional aspect that worried Williams about doing
the film. Playing such a charged role for four months would be
painful. Like the scene in which his character speaks at the
funeral of his two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's really hard,'' Williams said. ``Emotionally, it's
difficult. One day you have to (act out) a eulogy for your children
for 13 hours. It's not something you really want to do for five
minutes, having to inhabit that and do it time and time again. It's
not something you want to extrapolate if you have children.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams hopes ``What Dreams May Come'' will open the way
for Hollywood to find more imaginative and thoughtful uses of
special effects than dinosaurs and spaceships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the hands of the artist,'' he said. ``The amazing
thing now is effects can be used for anything. The possibilities
are almost infinite.''
</P>
<P>
   He would like to think that people will leave the theater having
serious conversations on the nature of life, death and
reincarnation. But being Robin Williams, he also can't help making
fun of it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is kind of strange to me is these people who do
past-life regressions. They always say they were amazing things,
like `I was Nefertiti's gynecologist.' `I was a princess.' `I was a
warrior god.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They never say, `I was a schlub named Murray,' you know?'' &QL;

WINNING IS A PIECE OF CAKE FOR MORTEN FAMILY IN KATY, TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MELISSA FLETCHER STOELTJE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATY, Texas _When it comes to bake-offs, winning is an old
Morten family recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Natalie Morten of Katy, Texas, recently became one
of five finalists in the first Easy-Bake Oven ``Baker of the Year''
contest scheduled for Oct. 9 in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Linda Morten, blazed the contest trail in 1996, when
she won $10,000 in the Pillsbury Bake-Off for her Cowboy Steak 'n'
Veggie Soup, entered in the 30-Minute Main Dish category.
</P>
<P>
   Big sis Jennifer Morten, 17, went home with $2,000 in last
year's Pillsbury Bake-Off. Her winning concoction was a 30-minute
side dish, Nicaraguan Red Beans and Rice.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York competition, the younger Morten will re-create
Raspberry Orange Blossom Cake _ a fruity, almond-topped concoction.
All entrants in the contest, open to child bakers ages 8 to 11, are
required to use one or more Easy-Bake brand mixes in their
ingredients. Contestants aren't required to cook their confections
in Easy-Bake ovens, those colorful plastic toy ovens from the 1960s
with a 100-watt light bulb for heat.
</P>
<P>
   Morten's competition will include a 10-year-old from Georgia who
makes caterpillars out of marshmallows and chocolate and an
8-year-old from Idaho who shapes ice cream into butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will receive a $5,000 savings bond and a two-year
supply of Easy-Bake brand mix sets. The four runners-up will earn a
$1,000 savings bond and a one-year supply of the mix sets.
</P>
<P>
   Mom Morten, an avid contestant of baking contests, also won the
Betty Crocker Grand Prize in 1994. All of which proves that flour
is thicker than water. &QL;

 UNDATED: ... dozens of others.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``These are easily frustrated kids who become antagonistic
toward their parents and other adults, and they can become very
alienated,'' Greene says. ``Alienation expresses itself in many
ways, and it could lead to a kid walking into school and shooting
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   But while most people would look at a teenager like Kinkel and
see an antisocial loser who became violent to get his way, Greene
sees a child who, often because of inherited problems (attention
deficit disorder, learning disability, Tourette's syndrome) is
easily frustrated, has a difficult time shifting gears, and just
doesn't know how to react in a more civilized way.
</P>
<P>
   On page 30 of his new book, Greene sums up the mindset of these
children in a cartoon showing a dog being directed to sit by his
master. And the dog is thinking, ``I may want to sit. Just give me
a chance to process this.''
</P>
<P>
   If these children are pushed too hard before they can process
the new command, they explode. ``When your child explodes, you
can't talk to him,'' says a Boston educator whose 12-year-old son
suffers from Tourette's syndrome and has been explosive all his
life. ``It's like trying to break up a bar fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene makes a distinction between the child who throws a
``coherent'' tantrum _ he stops when he notices his mother isn't in
the room anymore and then starts up again when he finds her _ and
children who throw ``incoherent'' tantrums _ ``they go crazy and
really lose it,'' whether or not their mother is still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I worked with these disruptive kids, the more I
became convinced that their oppositional behavior is
unintentional,'' Greene says. ``Parents think the kids are just
doing it to yank their chain; but they usually aren't throwing
tantrums on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   For the many children who are throwing tantrums on cue, the
standard system of rewards and punishment may indeed be very
effective. A parent who consistently sets limits on misbehavior
through a strategy like 1-2-3 timeout, should be successful in
eradicating tantrums in time, Greene and other psychologists agree.
</P>
<P>
   But for the children Greene sees, the standard strategies have
failed, and that has a lot to do with their brain chemistry. A
unique chemistry explains why medications are often part of the
solution, Greene says: Ritalin for attention deficit disorder,
Prozac for depression, Risperadone or clonadine for Tourette's
syndrome. But in many cases, medication is not sufficient to turn
the tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are children whom I couldn't work with, without
medications,'' observes Greene, as a rare cognitive therapist in a
child psychiatry department known to rely on drugs for assistance.
``But medication is frequently not the sole answer to a child's
problems, and in some cases, it isn't meeting their needs at all.''
</P>
<P>
   What Greene does, with the parents he advises and in his book,
is to provide a detailed road map for parents to follow before
their child melts down. If it's time for 9-year-old Sally to get
ready for bed, Greene suggests that instead of demanding that Sally
come inside or face punishment, a parent might stay calm in the
face of deafening resistance and say, ``Whoa, slow down. I don't
really think this is one to get all upset about. I may actually be
willing to compromise about this if you could chill a little.'' And
then the parent could discuss with Sally ways to reach a mutually
satisfactory compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Greene recommends this kind of negotiation in all but
circumstances where the child's safety is at stake. For instance,
parents would decide that some behaviors, such as riding a bike
without a helmet, are never acceptable and thus nonnegotiable. But
with an explosive child, at least initially, all other behaviors,
even ones that most parents cling to, such as getting homework done
by bedtime, should be left open to compromise, in an effort to
avert meltdowns.
</P>
<P>
   When this approach is applied consistently by parents, teachers
and other adults in the child's world, Greene says he has seen even
the most explosive child learn to temper his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who have worked with Greene agree, with the fervor of
born-agains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our son is as explosive as ever, but the frequency of his
explosions has diminished considerably,'' says the mother of the
boy with Tourette's. ``This strategy has worked as well as
anything, but boy, was it hard to do. We had to give up every
sacred cow of parenthood.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rub, some say. The approach outlined in Greene's
book may eventually be effective, for some children some of the
time, but it requires a superhuman effort by parents. After all,
when a child calls you a ``(expletive)-poor excuse for parents,''
how many parents can curb their knee-jerk tendency to roar back?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Greene insists the majority of parents he has worked with are
able to achieve this paradigm shift in behavior. Even so, Greene,
who is now the father of a 2-year-old himself, counts himself as
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we lucked out,'' he says. ``Our daughter has a sweet
temperament.''

IMPOSTORS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ The toughest thing to do in movies
is make a successful farce. Stanley Tucci, who wrote and

PHOTOGRAPHER TAKES A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME WITH ROCK ART 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Zintgraff, a 72-year-old San Antonio photographer, has an
assignment scheduled next week. He will be going west to a canyon
along the Pecos River _ a journey to his own past and that of a
prehistoric people.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has made the same trip for 46 years, Zintgraff said
the area retains its magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel very impressed every time I visit that region,''
he said. ``I have a strong feeling being there.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1952, at the same site, Zintgraff discovered a
pictograph painted about 4,000 years ago. After recording the
unique figure, named ``The White Shaman,'' through his camera's
lens, he devoted his life to understanding and protecting the Pecos
River rock art.
</P>
<P>
   The art and mythology of Pecos River people are the main focus
of his work. The pictography, Zintgraff said, was the way the
indigenous artists expressed their conflicts and doubts. The
artists depicted the meaning of life, life after death and even
their food supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``In pictographs, people dramatized their religious and
political concerns,'' he said. ``And some of these questions remain
in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Through almost 100 slides, including ones with ``The White
Shaman,'' Zintgraff affirms the importance of preserving this
treasure, painted upon the limestone canvas of rock shelters and
canyons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man has destroyed important sites in the name of progress,''
he said, mentioning the man-made Amistad Reservoir, west of Del
Rio.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Zintgraff worked on a project to record prehistoric
pictographs before water covered the area. ``Going back to the site
when the water level was down, I saw (that the) drawings had been
washed (away) completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Zintgraff's interest in prehistoric art began in the 1950s with
an admiration for anthropologist Joseph Campbell's work.
</P>
<P>
   Zintgraff's love for photography began in his childhood. ``I
grew up with a camera in my hands,'' said Zintgraff, whose father
was a photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Before getting involved with the pictographs, Zintgraff's career
was focused on advertising. The expedition to the Pecos River
region dramatically altered his professional life.
</P>
<P>
   Zintgraff has published two books with images of his journeys _
``Ancient Texas: Rock Art and Lifeways Along the Lower Pecos'' and
``Pecos River Rock Art: A Photographic Essay.'' San Antonio's Witte
Museum also has a permanent exhibition of his works.
</P>
<P>
   Zintgraff is a co-founder of the Rock Art Foundation, created in
1992 to promote the conservation and understanding of the Pecos
River legacy. The foundation also offers guided tours to the
region.

THE ANGST OF `ANTZ'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One way to distinguish DreamWorks' new
computer-animated insect movie, ``Antz,'' from Disney's upcoming
``A Bug's Life'' comes during an early scene where a worker ant
reclines on his psychiatrist's couch and complains about being the
middle child in a family of 5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get much attention, you know,'' the ant, aptly named
Z, grumbles. Later he adds, ``All I really want to do is get in
touch with my inner maggot.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it's Woody Allen, in all his neurotic glory, who
is providing the voice of Z tells you all you need to know about
the spirit of this subversive animated offering. Kids will dig the
eye-popping visuals, but ``Antz'' has a decidedly adult sensibility
with its themes of class struggle, modern romance and
post-traumatic stress syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at its heart, the movie pits Z's socialist leanings
against the fascist leadership of the ant colony. As a comedy,
``Antz'' leans closer to Karl Marx than Groucho.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise then, that when we meet ``Antz''
co-directors Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson, Darnell introduces
himself by saying, ``I'm the communist. Tim's the one bent on world
oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was just the opening line. These guys are brimming with
off-the-wall jokes, probably because they've finally finished their
movie and have a chance to relax. ``Antz'' is the culmination of
years of hard work by Johnson, Darnell and hundreds of other people
at Pacific Data Images (PDI), the Palo Alto-based production
company that has partnered with DreamWorks to create
computer-animated fare. Whereas Pixar (makers of the 1995 smash
``Toy Story'') took four years to make ``A Bug's Life,'' PDI
delivered ``Antz'' in two years and change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was definitely a little push at the end to have it ready
by October,'' says PDI president and founder Carl Rosendahl.
``There were a lot of unknowns when we started because this was our
first movie. But we were able to deliver it ahead of schedule, and
I think they were pretty happy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement. The early finish allowed DreamWorks to
release ``Antz'' nearly eight weeks ahead of ``A Bug's Life,''
giving the studio a potentially potent one-two punch with its other
anticipated animated film, the biblical epic ``Prince of Egypt,''
due out Dec. 18. The advanced release also helps ``Antz'' avoid
bumping heads with potential mammoth hits like the ``Babe'' sequel,
``Babe: Pig in the City,'' and the ``Rugrats'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (DreamWorks) had no choice,'' says a studio distribution
executive. ``If they came out after `Bug's,' they would have been
dead in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not. But beating Disney out of the gate has bigger
ramifications for the studio than just the bottom line. DreamWorks
executive Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney four years ago when
chairman Michael Eisner wouldn't make him president. Katzenberg was
one of the primary forces behind Disney's resurgence in animation,
and some at the Mouse House privately say that Katzenberg took the
idea for ``Antz'' with him to DreamWorks.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the issue is a pitch meeting on Aug. 25, 1994, with
Pixar's director John Lasseter. Katzenberg was still on the Disney
lot but wasn't at the meeting. However, Disney sources say he was
told of the pitch. Katzenberg denies this. A year later, DreamWorks
executive Nina Jacobson came to Katzenberg and proposed the insect
movie. It was green-lighted quickly and rushed into development.
</P>
<P>
   Such synchronicity isn't a new development in Hollywood. In the
past couple of years, rival studios have given us two volcano
movies, two end-of-the-world asteroid films, two Steve Prefontaine
movies. Before that, competing Wyatt Earp and Robin Hood projects
dueled to the wire. In a pipeline full of remakes and movies based
on TV series, originality often proves to be the exception, rather
than the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Darnell, it turns out, had been toying with their
own animated bugs movie, titled ``Lights Out,'' when they learned
of Jacobson's idea. It was a natural marriage then for PDI (known
mostly for its effects work and for turning Homer Simpson into a
3-D character in the 1995 Halloween episode of ``The Simpsons) and
DreamWorks to join forces and meet the beetles, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   As for allegations that Katzenberg and PDI made off with Pixar's
concept, Darnell laughs and says, ``It would have been ridiculous
for us to have attacked an idea just because somebody else was
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Johnson: ``Look at it this way. You had our concept,
`Lights Out,' which we were pitching to studios back in 1991. Since
then, we've had `Joe's Apartment,' `James and the Giant Peach' and
`Starship Troopers.' There's just something about insects that
lends itself to computer animation. It's a medium that likes
hairless, naked creatures because they're easier to realistically
depict.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at that, ``Antz'' pushes the level of such animation to an
even higher level with jaw-dropping crowd scenes that humorously
depict life inside an ant colony. There are more than 500 of these
kinds of shots, ranging in size from a handful of ants to more than
60,000. What makes the work remarkable is that every ant in the
crowd is doing something interesting, moving at a different angle
or in a unique fashion _ marching, fighting, dancing _ so that
anywhere you look on the screen, you can enjoy the view.
</P>
<P>
   PDI ratcheted up the computers' ability to provide characters'
facial expressions, too, going beyond the typical happy-sad-angry
palette to give animators some 300 different options for their
invertebrates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like a blessing and a curse mixed together,''
Johnson says. ``We had 300 controls. There was no emotion or hint
of thought or feeling that we couldn't pull off. If you gave
someone with a marionette that many options, they'd probably go
insane. But in the end, I think it provides some of the best
moments of our movie, where the audience can really get into the
head and soul of the characters and imagine that they're human
beings instead of animated ants.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with being an animated ant.
Woody Allen, Gene Hackman, Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Danny
Glover didn't think so; neither did Jennifer Lopez, John Mahoney,
Anne Bancroft, Jane Curtin and Christopher Walken. Katzenberg was
the primary force in attracting the all-star cast and has worked
similar magic for ``Prince of Egypt.'' (Michelle Pfeiffer, Val
Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes are among the participants in that movie.)
</P>
<P>
   `` `Antz' was written with Woody in mind,'' Darnell says.
``Jeffrey kind of buttered him up and got him interested. Once he
signed on, the movie was very attractive to other talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Johnson: ``Z is the kind of ant who looks around and says,
`This is not for me.' He's uncomfortable with everything in the
overly regimented world of the colony and, of course, Woody Allen
does uncomfortable really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, Allen will be plenty comfortable with the finished
product. ``Antz'' is his funniest movie in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recorded him in a studio off Broadway,'' says Darnell,
``and I remember thinking of all the other people paying 80 bucks a
pop for a theater ticket and here we were with the best show in
town.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when the workers control the means of
production. Beautiful, isn't it?

THERE'S NOTHING `CLEAN' ABOUT PUBLICLY FUNDED CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Libertarians will never be a force to contend with in electoral
politics because they are crippled by two disabilities from which
Republicans and Democrats rarely suffer:
</P>
<P>
   1. They are animated almost entirely by principle.
</P>
<P>
   2. They have a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Both qualities were on display in Massachusetts last week, as
four Libertarian candidates for state office gleefully made a hash
of the state's absurd campaign finance law. For that service alone,
Dean Cook (the Libertarian candidate for governor), Elias Israel
(lieutenant governor), David Atkinson (secretary of state), and
Carla Howell (auditor) deserve to be elected in November.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 Massachusetts law requires candidates for statewide
office to declare an upper limit on the amount they will spend to
get elected. Those who offer to abide by the ``voluntary'' cap
specified in the statute are rewarded with a check from the state.
Those who declare a higher limit receive no public funding _ (ital)
and (unital) their opponents get to spend up to the higher amount.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in the race for governor Democrat Scott Harshbarger agreed
to abide by the statutory cap _ $1.5 million _ and so qualified for
$750,000 in public money. Republican Paul Cellucci forfeited the
subsidy by declaring a higher limit, $5 million. Were they the only
candidates, the cap would have been raised to $5 million. But Cook,
the Libertarian candidate, declared a spending ``limit'' of
$19,514,800,000. That blew a hole right through the
campaign-finance law, freeing all three candidates to spend, in
effect, as much as they like. Of course, Cook also blew his chance
to get a big chunk of taxpayers' money. But as a Libertarian, he
wouldn't have taken public money anyway.
</P>
<P>
   $19,514,800,000, a Libertarian Party news release noted, ``is
greater than the entire gross domestic product of Bolivia'' and
``four times that of Iceland.'' It also happens to be the size of
the bloated Massachusetts state budget for fiscal year 1999 _ far
and away the largest budget in Bay State history. The Legislature
cannot keep its own spending under control, yet it has no trouble
trying to compel candidates for office to limit (ital) theirs.
(unital)
</P>
<P>
   Libertarians and others oppose campaign spending limits on the
grounds that they abridge political expression; restrict a
candidate's ability to fund his campaign and you restrict his right
to free speech. It is true that American politics is obsessed with
raising money, but that is because campaign-finance ``reforms''
have made fundraising too difficult. The same 1994 Massachusetts
law that created the spending limits also cut the maximum
contribution from $1,000 to $500. That didn't make political
campaigns cheaper. It simply made candidates work twice as hard to
raise the same amount as before.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, dollars equal speech. They also equal the only
chance most challengers have of ousting an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more one restricts financing,'' writes political
commentator Avi Nelson in the summer issue of Commonwealth, the
superb journal of Massachusetts politics and policy, ``the more it
benefits the incumbents. Consider an extreme case: Suppose
candidates could only spend $5 for a race. Who would win? The
incumbents, of course, because of all the ... advantages they
already have.... The more one restricts campaign expenditures, the
more incumbents are assured re-election.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who ran twice for Congress in the 1970s, points out a
fundamental injustice of campaign-finance laws. To mandate that
every candidate in a race be subject to the same spending limit
``is to presume that (all) of them start even on the track. But
they don't.'' Most elections are fought by candidates with unequal
levels of name recognition, unequal mailing lists, unequal speaking
skills, unequal campaign managers, and unequal access to free
media. By what Procrustean logic does it follow that the one thing
that (ital) must (unital) be equal is their freedom to raise money?
</P>
<P>
   But bad as the existing statute is, the proposed ``Clean
Elections Law'' _ Question 2 on the Massachusetts ballot in
November _ is far worse. Here is a law that would all but abolish
the freedom of voters to contribute to candidates they like, while
forcing them to underwrite handouts to politicians they can't stand
_ or never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   If Question 2 passes, any candidate who met a minimal
fundraising threshold would automatically receive a huge windfall
of public money. For instance, a state Senate candidate who raised
as little as $2,250 would be given $43,000 in the primary, and
another $29,000 for the general election. Candidates for governor
would have to raise no more than $30,000 in order to reap a bonanza
of up to $2.55 million. Powerball will become passe. Anyone looking
to get rich quick would be crazy not to run for office in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The law would impose new spending limits. In theory these would
be voluntary, but if a candidate went over them, punishment would
be swift: His opponents would be given public ``matching funds''
equal to the amount of the excess spending. Meanwhile, political
donations would be limited to $100.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents of Question 2 say with straight faces that it is
``elegant in its simplicity.'' In fact it is grotesquely
convoluted: It runs to 7 1/2 pages of dense, single-spaced text. It
is almost surely unconstitutional. Worse, it is an affront to
honest politics. ``Clean'' elections? There is nothing clean about
forcing taxpayers to hand over money to candidates they don't
support. And nothing dirty about voters who willingly write a check
to a candidate they believe in.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens who like having the state make their political choices
for them will no doubt favor Question 2. Those who would rather
make up their own minds have every reason to vote no.

HOUSTON BUSINESSES CONSIDER ADDING DEFIBRILLATORS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  with art slugged DEFIBRILLATOR 
 
By LESLIE SOWERS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Last spring, while planting roses at her home, Betty
Yoder began to feel different than she had ever felt before. And
she did not feel well.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the chest pain, she went inside and called 911.
She remembers telling the operator that her back door was unlocked.
The next thing she remembers was being asked to blink her eyes to
indicate she could hear.
</P>
<P>
   Her heart had stopped. Rescue personnel had used an automated
external defibrillator to shock it back to a regular beat.
</P>
<P>
   Yoder was lucky on two counts. Emergency help arrived promptly.
And they were equipped with the AED.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the AED, I wouldn't be here,'' Yoder, 54, said Tuesday
at an American Heart Association workshop introducing this device
to Houston business leaders. In Houston, the Heart Association has
a campaign to encourage corporations to acquire AEDs and train
designated employees in their use.
</P>
<P>
   The most common locations for sudden cardiac arrest are the home
and large public facilities, including the corporate environment.
Each day about 1,000 Americans suffer cardiac arrest. More than 95
percent of them die, often because defibrillators are not available
in time, according to the Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Training more people to administer CPR has brought the survival
rate from one in 100 to one in four, and the Houston chapter of the
Heart Association hopes that training more people to use the AED
will save even more lives _ perhaps as many as 20,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sudden collapse, time is of the essence,'' said David
Persse, city of Houston Emergency Medical Services director.
``Often in a cardiac arrest the heart goes into a twitching rhythm,
and the definitive treatment is shock.''
</P>
<P>
   While Persse said the city's EMS response time is excellent,
circumstances sometimes cause unavoidable delays. Traffic presents
one obstacle. And waiting for an elevator in a downtown office
building can add life-threatening minutes. An AED at the job site
might make a life-and-death difference.
</P>
<P>
   If corporations purchase AEDs, does this mean the department
secretary is going to be shouting, ``Clear'' and shocking the CEO
to the ceiling?
</P>
<P>
   AED reality is much less dramatic than the high drama of the
television emergency room. No medical knowledge is necessary to use
the battery-powered device, which directs the process by clear
audio instructions and visual display.
</P>
<P>
   Trained personnel need only attach two electrodes in adhesive
pads to the victim's chest, stand clear and wait for the device to
analyze the heartbeat. If, and only if, shock is needed, the user
is instructed to push one button. Error is unlikely since the
machine will not deliver an unneeded shock. Helpers are instructed
when to avoid contact with the victim to avoid shock themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, the machine will recognize that the heart
does not need shock, yet there is no pulse. In these situations,
responders are told to administer CPR until help arrives.
</P>
<P>
   The Heart Association recommends that the device be kept in a
central location accessible to the employee trained in its use. The
goal is to ensure that every building has at least one of the
devices. Currently, they are on hand at Hobby and Bush airports,
the Memorial Park jogging track, the Houston Fire Department, the
mayor's office and at the Astrodome. Health professionals also have
them on site at all big public events.
</P>
<P>
   Two possible barriers to broader availability of AEDs are cost
and liability issues.
</P>
<P>
   Four manufacturers supply AEDs, and their cost averages about
$3,500 to $4,000. Since the devices first became available in the
1980s, they have become smaller and simpler to use and maintain. An
industry representative said the technology improves constantly and
price continues to decrease.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Lee Shuchart said a ``good Samaritan'' law in Texas and
a number of other states offers broad protection to citizens who
try to help in a crisis. She said a number of jurisdictions,
including Texas, may pass laws that would offer immunity to those
trained in using the device. This would not affect the
manufacturer's liability for the safety of the device.
</P>
<P>
   Shuchart said that only a few lawsuits have been filed against
good Samaritans in Texas, and that both state and national courts
have favored broad protection of those who try to help. She said,
in fact, that one airline was found negligent in failing to provide
an AED, which would have prevented a death. As a result, several
airlines have responded by making AEDs available on all flights.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is among the cities seeking to increase the use of AEDs,
and the only city to sponsor a corporate awareness campaign.
Training in the use of the device may be provided by the
manufacturer, or the Heart Association can provide a trainer for a
nominal fee. Interested business leaders can call the American
Heart Association at 713-610-5000 to get information about AEDs and
training. Some states are providing AEDs for communities unable to
afford them, and at the national level, the Heart Association has
some funds available to subsidize AED purchase.
</P>
<P>
   After Yoder was revived by the AED, she spent two weeks in the
hospital for testing. She said the results were inconclusive, but
she did have an internal defibrillator implanted in case such a
heart spasm occurs again.
</P>
<P>
   She said she takes her health a little more seriously,
especially since she realized how her death would affect her
husband and two grown children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have become a cheerleader for the AED,'' Yoder said. ``And
so has my family.'' &QL;

`ANTZ' RAISES THE BAR FOR COMPUTER-ANIMATED FILMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By   BOB STRAUSS   
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's good to be different. That's the moral of
``Antz,'' a groundbreaking, hilarious and surprisingly mature,
computer-animated feature.
</P>
<P>
   It might just as well be the motto for DreamWorks' cartoon
division. Though not the upstart studio's first in-house production
_ ``Antz'' was made by a digital outfit called PDI, much as
Disney's ``Toy Story'' was put together by Pixar _ DreamWorks'
first animated release declares loud and clear that the studio
won't slavishly imitate the Mouse's house formula.
</P>
<P>
   No syrupy kiddie songs here. For that matter, not much for
little tykes at all _ the movie's humor is both political and
psychologically sophisticated, and its big action set-piece looks
like something out of ``Starship Troopers.'' Even the film's
abundant visual wit, while certain to amuse insect lovers of all
ages, is more concerned with the humor of breathtaking perspective
shifts than in simple sight gags.
</P>
<P>
   After such witless Disney knockoffs as ``Anastasia'' and ``The
Quest for Camelot,'' ``Antz'' is refreshing evidence that animated
features can be much more interesting and diverse than they've
generally been allowed to be. That wouldn't mean much if the film
didn't deliver, but happily, it's as awesome as it is cockeyed, a
spectacle that never fails to dazzle the eye or tickle the laugh
nodes.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, the acting's even better than in most live-action films
you'd care to mention. Starting with the voice work of Woody Allen.
</P>
<P>
   He's the kvetching, unsatisfied Z, one of a few million drones
who dig dirt in a bustling, underground ant colony. ``The system
just makes me feel so insignificant'' he complains to his
six-legged shrink at the start of the movie. ``Breakthrough,'' the
analyst cries, ``You are insignificant!''
</P>
<P>
   The part was written especially for Allen and he ad libs
incorrigibly _ there are almost as many good lines here as in one
of the director's fabled, earlier funny ones. More than that, Z's
neurotic griping soon instigates a colony-wide workers' revolt
against conformity, just as the maniacal Gen. Mandible (Gene
Hackman), head of the army, puts his plans for a genocidal power
grab into play.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the cute talking ant movie is really a dialectical
manifesto that pits socialism against fascism and individualism
against regimentation. And this from a company owned by Steven
Spielberg and David Geffen, two of the most successful mass
entertainment capitalists the world has ever known.
State-of-the-art computer graphics and delicious irony _ I told ya,
this film's got everything.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, nebbish Z becomes an inadvertent hero when he
accidentally survives a battle with neighboring termites, kidnaps
the equally restless Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) and flees to the
outside world in search of the mythical Insectopia, where all God's
pests live together in peace and plenty.
</P>
<P>
   You can probably guess what that paradise turns out to be _
``Antz's'' most pronounced weakness is the obvious plotting in Todd
Alcott and Chris and Paul Weitz's screenplay. Yet there's no
predicting the delightful and exciting ways in which directors Eric
Darnell and Tim Johnson create a bug's-eye view of a world bursting
with gigantic, colorful new thrills and dangers. Yeah, it's a place
where you can get trapped inside a single drop of water. But where
else can you find such a temptingly delicious variety of dung?
</P>
<P>
   Great leaps forward in computer-graphics capability give
``Antz'' a much richer, more detailed and intricately kinetic look
than ``Toy Story's.'' Special software also makes for the most
expressive CG faces yet seen, a real necessity when you don't want
to waste an all-star voice cast that includes Dan Aykroyd, Anne
Bancroft, Danny Glover, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone and
Christopher Walken.
</P>
<P>
   On all fronts _ graphic, thematic, character _ ``Antz'' points
to the vast potential computer animation holds while setting
admirably high standards of its own. (And it's only the second
feature ever done this way; Disney/Pixar's ``A Bug's Life,'' which
will really have to be spectacular to compete, comes out at
Thanksgiving). Best of all, it succeeds by following the kind of
elegant logic craven, copycat Hollywood rarely embraces: when
you've got amazing new creative technology, it's time to break the
boring old rules.
</P>
<P>
   Insectopia indeed.

`THE IMPOSTERS' RUN OUT OF STEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 { Stars

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget sinking an ocean liner or restaging the
Normandy Invasion. The toughest thing to do in movies is make a
successful farce. Stanley Tucci, who wrote and co-directed the
sleeper hit ``Big Night'' two years ago, gives it a game try with
his new film, ``The Impostors,'' and he triumphs over the form for
about an hour. After that, the wheels come off, the manic energy
begins to flag and the film dissolves into the froth. Farce claims
another victim.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean ``The Impostors'' doesn't have its moments. It
has quite a few good bits, in fact. The movie begins with a
brilliant piece of silent filmmaking that calls to mind the best
work of Buster Keaton. Mixed in with the opening credits, two men,
Arthur (Tucci) and Maurice (Oliver Platt) are shown quarreling at
an outdoor cafe. Tensions escalate, a knife is pulled and Platt
dramatically keels over dead. It looks like Laurel and Hardy have
gone gangster.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice isn't really dead, of course. It turns out that he and
Arthur are perpetually out-of-work actors who go around New York
staging these kinds of scenes to practice their craft. In this
case, Arthur is very upset because it was his turn to die. ``You
stole my death,'' he complains bitterly. Arthur lives to die, you
see.
</P>
<P>
   After an attempt to extort a few cream puffs from a baker goes
hilariously awry, Arthur and Maurice find themselves with tickets
to the theater as a consolation prize. They go, even though the
show stars a hambone actor, Jeremy Burtom (Alfred Molina), whom
they despise. One thing leads to another, and soon the two are on
the run from police over a misunderstood altercation with Burtom in
a bar. Maurice and Arthur hide in a crate, which, naturally, gets
loaded on a departing ocean liner which, naturally, counts Burtom
as one of its passengers. So the chase continues, this time on
water.
</P>
<P>
   The ship contains a wide assortment of oddballs and Tucci has
cast some of the independent film world's finest actors wonderfully
against type to play them. Lili Taylor, usually the social outcast,
plays Lily, the ship's ingenue head stewardess, while the beautiful
Hope Taylor portrays a comically morose passenger. (``All is
death,'' she says with utter conviction.)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Buscemi is a suicidal lounge singer, Campbell Scott the
German head steward with eyes for Lily, and Billy Connolly a tennis
pro with improbable eyes for Maurice. (His pickup line: ``I once
wrestled a man on the steps of the Acropolis when the sun was at
its peak, wearing only what God Almighty sent me into the world
with. Can you picture that?'') Woody Allen also has an unbilled
cameo as a Broadway director.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone looks like they're having a ball, and the cast's
enthusiasm for the material proves contagious. There are many
laugh-out-loud moments. Unfortunately, Tucci isn't able to sustain
the momentum throughout the entire film. The turning point comes
when the plot abruptly reverses course, with Arthur and Maurice
doing the chasing instead of being chased. From there, ``The
Impostors'' takes on a forced, stilted tone. Too many characters
and too many subplots sink this movie faster than the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough business,'' Tucci's Arthur says at one point
about acting.
</P>
<P>
   He could well have been talking about making a farce, too.

WHEN SAFETY IS A HAZARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happens when the Federal Reserve Bank orchestrates a $3.65
billion rescue of a failed hedge fund? What would have happened if
the Fed had not intervened in the meltdown of Long Term Capital
Management? What will happen as a result of the Fed's intervention?
These questions haunt financial markets today and raise a larger
issue that affects the culture of American politics. That issue is
known as moral hazard.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple concept. To quote The Wall Street Journal, moral
hazard is a ``term the financial community uses to describe the
distortions introduced by the prospect of not having to pay for
your sins, in this case financial ones. The prospect of government
bailouts leads to abandonment of credit standards and assessments.
As moral hazard grows, you get a market so skewed by the
expectations of bailouts that vital signs about genuine risk no
longer get through. Eventually, the danger turns into one of
systemic collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps appropriate that the collapse of Long Term Capital
Management was brought about by Russia's default on its financial
obligations last month. Long Term Capital had 8 percent (or as much
as $125 billion, depending on how you count the value of derivative
financial products) of its highly leveraged funds in Russia, not
because it thought Russia was a good investment, but rather because
it thought Russia too big to fail. Prior to the default, Russia was
literally printing money to meet its obligations. Cross-border
investors were reaping huge returns.
</P>
<P>
   Long Term Capital bet billions of dollars on a morally hazardous
certainty: that the United States and the International Monetary
Fund would always come to the rescue of an economically perilous
country with thousands of potentially ``loose'' nuclear warheads.
Russia's default made that certainty uncertain, and within days
margin calls came raining down on Long Term Capital's Greenwich,
Conn., headquarters. Long Term Capital sold what it could to meet
its obligations, but after selling the good stuff, it was left with
a ton of useless paper. No one would buy it, at any price. And the
game was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve did the right thing in jawboning Long Term
Capital's creditors into becoming a consortium of cash infusion.
Allowing Long Term Capital to collapse might have spelled disaster
for the world's financial system and completely undone the market
for derivative products. An orderly liquidation of the hedge funds
portfolio over three years allows the financial markets to regain
their balance.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that in so doing, the Fed has re-raised the issue
of moral hazard. In a recent post on the financial news Web site
thestreet.com, David Kansas wrote that Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin, prior to Long Term Capital's collapse, believed that moral
hazard had diminished as an issue, ``primarily because a lot of
those who invested in more speculative projects in places like
Russia and Asia have already suffered steep losses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting,'' Rubin told Kansas, ``if you look at what
happened to investors and creditors and others over the past year.
Enormous losses have been sustained, so the moral hazard issue that
people have been concerned about is not nearly as potent as it used
to be because people have taken the kinds of losses that hopefully
will induce more careful investment and credit extension.'' Rubin
went on to say that moral hazard issues will not stand in the way
of the United States providing ``national assistance where it is
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing national assistance where it is needed makes sense,
especially in those cases where US national security interests are
involved. Organizing the rescue of a private hedge fund, the very
definition of a risky financial vehicle, is another matter
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, no public monies were involved. Yes, it is true that the
rescue scheme is better than watching $50 trillion of derivative
products chain react and come home to roost. And yes, it is true
that Long Term Capital Management's partners are forever disgraced
and face the real possibility of prosecution under the Federal Wire
Fraud Act.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, the signal sent by the Federal Reserve's
intervention says that the rules that apply to the rest of us do
not apply to certain elites. Any other hedge fund would have been
shut down by Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch in a three-minute phone
call. Long Term Capital gets a cash infusion of $3.65 billion and
is allowed to continue to charge a management fee that would make
Fidelity blush.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has been sending this signal for a long time, but
with heightened frequency of late. The most noxious recent example
of Washington moral hazard is, of course, the contention that
President Clinton should not be impeached for perjury, obstruction
of justice, and misuse of executive power because he has a high job
performance rating in public opinion polls. The effect of all this
on the body politic is toxic. It teaches people to believe that
they can never be too cynical.

A LOVE STORY PAINTED IN NEW AGE COLOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Take the love story of ``Ghost,'' infuse it with
the precepts of James Redfield's ``The Celestine Prophecy,'' add a
dash of ``Orpheus'' and filter it all through the sun-dappled light
of a Monet painting and you have ``What Dreams May Come,'' a visual
feast of a movie that takes you on a provocative trip through
heaven and hell, all the while holding your hand with familiar film
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dreams May Come'' isn't just beautiful to watch. It
contains the most stunning, jaw-dropping scenes of the afterlife
that have ever been filmed, visions that would have been impossible
before the advent of computer-generated special effects. Not
everyone is going to swallow the film's New Age, science of mind
precepts, but if you have an open mind, the movie will take you on
a journey that's often as emotionally moving as it is eye-popping.
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens, we're given a thumbnail sketch of the lives
of Chris (Robin Williams) and Annie (Annabella Sciorra). They meet
in an impossibly cute way on an impossibly blue lake in the Italian
Alps, and soon they're getting married and having water fights in
front of an impossibly big house with their two great-looking kids.
Before we're even comfortable in our seats, though, a couple of
tragedies strike this family, and Chris and Annie find themselves
on opposite ends of the afterlife with no hope of being together
again.
</P>
<P>
   Director Vincent Ward and his outstanding production team
(designer Eugenio Zanetti should prepare his Oscar speech now) have
taken the ``Celestine'' concept of making your own reality and
carried it over to the Great Beyond with their remarkably striking,
painterly visions of heaven and hell. For the art-loving Chris,
eternity stretches out before him literally like a Van Gogh canvas,
complete with daubs of paint. Even the beloved family pet (a dog,
of course) makes an appearance, along with a guide, Albert, (Cuba
Gooding Jr.), who was an old friend and mentor.
</P>
<P>
   It's perfect, except for the fact that Chris can't share it with
Annie. She's imprisoned in her own frightening reality, unable to
escape because she can't accept the natural course of things. But
then, neither can Chris. Despite warnings from Albert and a wise
old tracker (Max Von Sydow), Chris sets out across the void to find
his wife and help her find the redemption she so desperately needs.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of self-help spirituality will undoubtedly come across
as pretentious hokum to some, but Ron Bass' script (based on the
Richard Matheson novel) never lays it on too thick as to become
obnoxious. The story's primary deficiency lies in its eagerness to
comfort. Even when Chris finds himself in hell stepping through a
terrifying field of suffering human faces buried in mud, the film
can't resist lightening the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never took more than 30 percent from any client,'' one
sorrowful voice moans.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great jab, but it undercuts the gravity of the story. The
film's pace, which sometimes plods, doesn't help matters, either.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``What Dreams May Come'' can break your heart and bend
your mind with its lyrical renderings of a life beyond this one. If
its story isn't always on the same level, it isn't completely
grounded, either. Not that it matters, of course. In this case, a
picture is worth more than a thousand words.

`ROXBURY' ONE LONG COMEDY SKIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 1{ Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They'll just turn any ``Saturday Night Live'' skit
into a movie, won't they?
</P>
<P>
   If ``It's Pat'' was a one-joke premise, ``A Night at the
Roxbury'' has got to be a half-a-joke concept. It's a big-screen
version of that skit about the two nerds who dress themselves up in
slick suits, scare women at nightclubs and are always bopping their
heads to the beat of Haddaway's ``What is Love?''
</P>
<P>
   The gag barely sustains three minutes of ``SNL'' airtime every
month or so. Though a slight 83 minutes, the movie is still about
80 too long.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, time must be taken to tell you everything you don't
need to know about the Boppers _ and if you've seen ``Wayne's
World,'' you know this backstory anyway in, by comparison, more
Proustian depth.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, they're idiots, played like lobotomized Abbott and
Costello by Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan. They're also brothers;
Steve (the big, dense one) and Doug (the little annoying one)
Butabi. They work in their grumpy father Kamehl's (Dan Hedaya) silk
flower shop and live in his unaccountably grand, Beverly Hills
home. They drive Dad's luxury cars to all the hot Sunset Strip
clubs, which they're nonetheless too uncool to get into.
</P>
<P>
   The non-plot involves a traffic accident with Richard Grieco
(Richard Grieco!) that results in entree to the glamorous Roxbury.
A life goal achieved, the brothers have nowhere else to go but
toward a falling out. When a ruthlessly nesting-minded non-hottie
(``SNL'' cast mate Molly Shannon) seduces Steve into engagement, it
looks like the Butabi boys' partying days are finished.
</P>
<P>
   Laughless for, oh, about the first hour _ you know the wit
situation is dire when we're expected to be amused by the Butabis
struttin' down the street to ``Stayin' Alive'' for three minutes _
``Roxbury'' actually gets pretty humorous as the climactic,
inevitably catastrophic wedding approaches. Shannon is far and away
the film's funniest element; her desperate-yet-determined
bride-to-be may be an unflattering cliche, but at least she's not a
brain-dead cipher like every other character in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The director, John Fortenberry, makes his feature debut after
helming episodes of such better-than-average TV comedies as ``Just
Shoot Me,'' ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' and ``The Ben Stiler
Show.'' He also reportedly directed the pilot for a projected TV
series built around Toonses, the ``SNL'' cat who drives cars off
cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   If they had put a Toonses scene in ``Night at the Roxbury,'' the
whole thing would've added up to a one-joke concept.

RAND STUDY FINDS AMERICANS LIVING NOT ONLY LONGER, BUT HEALTHIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The number of older Americans who can perform
simple tasks of daily living is on the rise, evidence that people
are living not only longer but healthier as well.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by two Rand Corporation researchers, published Thursday
in the American Journal of Public Health, showed that between 1984
and 1993, older Americans found it easier to read newspapers, carry
a 10-pound bag, and walk a quarter mile.
</P>
<P>
   The results varied according to age. Gains were modest among
50-to-64-year-olds. But they were more dramatic among those over
80.
</P>
<P>
   Rand, a social research think tank based in Santa Monica,
Calif., underwrote the study with support from the federal National
Institute on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initial reports of the decline in disability among older
Americans were met with enormous skepticism,'' said Richard Suzman,
associate director for behavioral and social research at the NIA.
``This study provides important new evidence of the strength of the
trend and moves us toward understanding what is behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   The study by Rand researchers Vicki Freedman and Linda Martin
marks a number of health improvements for all older-people age
brackets. The number of those with:
</P>
<P>
   _ Difficulty seeing newsprint dropped from 15.3 percent in 1984
to 11.6 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ Problems lifting and carrying a 10-pound bag fell from 23.5
percent in 1984 to 18.9 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inability to climb a flight of stairs without resting declined
from 24.5 percent in 1984 to 22 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ Difficulty walking a quarter mile, about three blocks, went
from 25.8 percent in 1982 to 22.3 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers chose these activities as markers because most
people do them regardless of their traditional gender roles in
households, how much money they have, and what kind of house they
live in.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies used activities such as bathing, shopping or
doing laundry, which can be affected by factors that have nothing
to do with health.
</P>
<P>
   A male respondent, for instance, may not give an accurate
response on the difficulty of shopping or doing the laundry because
his wife does both. And someone who reports greater difficulty
bathing may lack a walk-in shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things we looked at were less susceptible to environmental
factors and socially defined roles,'' said Freedman. ``What we
found is that there actually are improvements in underlying health.
Socio-economic characteristics don't explain these changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The study team did not seek to determine why older Americans are
more healthy, but Freedman said the improvement probably reflects
greater health consciousness among them, as well as healthier
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the elderly today are better educated than 10 years
ago, and we know people with education are less likely to engage in
unhealthful behaviors, and are more likely to see doctors,''
Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
   She and Martin based their research on data compiled by the
Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation. From
that data, they compiled the answers for 1984 and 1993, and
adjusted them for age, sex, marital status, race, income and
geographic region. The sample sizes were 13,277 in 1984 and 12,716
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements were most dramatic in the age 80-and-above
category. There, for instance, the number of people with problems
lifting a 10-pound bag declined 10.5 percentage points, from 51.5
percent in 1984 to 41.0 percent in 1993. By contrast, the number of
those in the 50-to-64 age bracket reporting similar problems fell
from 16.6 percent in 1984 to 13.5 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The study comes at a time of national debate on shoring up
Medicare and Social Security, the two pillars of federal social
programs for the elderly. Both are under financial stress with the
massive baby-boom generation scheduled to start reaching retirement
age in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that the elderly have become healthier could be useful
ammunition, for instance, for those arguing that the age at which
people start receiving Medicare should rise from 65 to 67.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan passed the Senate last year during debate over the
balanced budget agreement. But it lost in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The study also supports other evidence that for many seniors,
the ``golden years'' are more enjoyable than ever. A poll of 1,300
Americans over age 60 found that 61 percent of men and 37 percent
of women engage in sexual activity at least once a month. Also, 79
percent of men and 66 percent of women said an active sex life was
an important aspect of their relationship with their partner.

REGLAZING PEELING TUB DRAIN IS IFFY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I had my bath reglazed two or three years ago. Now, it keeps
peeling around the drain. The reglazing man came back once to fix
it but it's doing it again. What can I do now?
</P>
<P>
   A CALLER
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yep, peeling can occur because the reglazing is not actual
glazing but application of an epoxy finish. It looks great, and in
many cases does not peel, but occasionally it will, particularly if
the surface of the tub is not properly prepared. The reglazing man
was faithful to his warranty, but repairing such a job is iffy at
best, because for some reason the repair job peels as well.
</P>
<P>
   Your only recourse is to forget about the reglazing and have an
acrylic shell put over the tub. Companies that do this have a
variety of shapes and sizes, probably one that will fit your tub,
if it is a standard tub. It is more expensive than reglazing, but
the result is permanent and the acrylic will not peel. Look for
acrylic-shell companies in the Yellow Pages under ``bathroom
remodeling.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I put up a limestone mantel over my fireplace, and it looks
very nice. Is there anything I should seal it with to help keep it
clean and possibly prevent efflorescence, the leaching of lime out
of the mantel by water? After all, it is limestone. And, by the
way, should I seal outdoor concrete?
</P>
<P>
   CRAIG LEPPANEN, Windham, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Try a clear sealer; I think a clear masonry sealer will be
best to make the limestone water-resistant, resistant to stains,
and more easily washed. I don't think the sealer will prevent
efflorescence, which is pretty hard to avoid. But I don't think
that will be a problem because the mantel is indoors and is
unlikely to take up much moisture, which is what causes
efflorescence. As for sealing outdoor concrete, I don't think there
is any need, despite the TV propaganda from manufacturers of
sealers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The stairway hall in my three-family house was painted light
cream, but it shows finger marks that won't wash off. Is there some
kind of a spray that I can use to prevent future fingermarks, once
I get the wall clean again?
</P>
<P>
   ANONYMOUS CALLER
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sorry, we're all out of magic sprays. You could varnish the
wall but that would look pretty awful. The only thing that will
work is to secure a sheet of one-eighth-inch-thick Plexiglas or
acrylic on the wall high enough so hands cannot reach above it.
This is the best you can do; any finger marks on the acrylic can be
washed off with detergent and water.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am making a rather large bookcase, and it is working out
nicely, by how do I secure it to the wall? I was thinking of a
series of angle irons screwed into the wall, but I would have to
make sure they are driven into a stud.
</P>
<P>
   BOB McDONALD, Stow, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Angle irons would work nicely, and be unobtrusive, but you
have to be careful locating them. The way to do that is to screw
the angles into the studs at the proper position under a shelf,
then set the bookcase in position and screw the angle iron to the
bottom of the shelf. Of course, first you would either have to
remove the baseboard so the bookcase will set flush against the
wall, or notch the uprights to clear the baseboard.
</P>
<P>
   Or, do it the easy way, as the handyman did. Notch the uprights
under the bottom shelf and top shelf and nail on a 1(MUL)(MUL)2 or
1(MUL)(MUL)3 on the back, under each shelf. Then when you set the
bookcase against the wall, locate the studs and nail or screws
through those supports into the studs.
</P>
<P>
   The support boards will also give extra support to the shelves,
at least to the back of them. Incidentally, whenever you built a
bookcase, do not let the shelves span more than 3 feet. Even a good
piece of pine, unless it is 1 1/2 inches thick, will not support a
load of books wider than that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have well water that is so acid that it is making pinhole
leaks in the copper pipe. I have replaced pipe six times and am
getting tired of it. A plumber said the problem comes from a low
current in the pipe, which causes enough corrosion to make the
pinholes. A neighbor who has the same problem said he installed a
calcite-bed filtering system to de-acidify the water. Would that
work?
</P>
<P>
   MIKE CONTRINO, Plymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I suppose it would, but I think it would be better to replace
your copper pipes with the appropriate plastic, which I believe is
within code in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

COMPUTERS, SOFTWARE CAN HARM SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Short attention span. Needs instant gratification. Can't focus.
Doesn't apply himself.
</P>
<P>
   If this is what you're hearing from your child's first- or
second-grade teacher, before you panic and think learning
disabilities or attention deficit disorder, consider something
external: your family computer.
</P>
<P>
   Educators have long intuited that early exposure to computers
doesn't give children an educational edge. Now researchers have
data to show it can actually be harmful, potentially undercutting
brain development, interfering with the way a child learns,
intruding on social and emotional development, and putting health
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to give a computer to a child under 7,''
says educational psychologist Jane M. Healy. If she had her way,
she'd throw computers out of preschool and early elementary
classrooms and keep kids off them at home. Her
sure-to-be-controversial new book, ``Failure to Connect: How
Computers Affect Our Children's Minds, for Better and Worse''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster), is eye-opening reading.
</P>
<P>
   Many researchers agree with her. ``For children under 7 or 8 who
have not reached the age of abstract reasoning, computer exposure
changes the way they absorb material. Some of us think this is
quite frightening,'' says educational policy analyst Ed Miller of
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Technology researcher Douglas Sloan, a professor at Teachers
College at Columbia University, says, ``It's something of a scandal
that it's taken us so long to figure this out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the troubling trends Healy identifies:
</P>
<P>
   _Kindergartners who don't want to draw with markers and crayons
because ``it isn't as pretty as my computer drawings.''
</P>
<P>
   _First-graders who are so used to a computer game's reward for
doing something easy, they don't want to try anything hard.
</P>
<P>
   _Kindergartners who are nonverbal and don't know how to play
with peers because of too much time alone at the computer.
</P>
<P>
   _First-graders who are unable to understand what they read
because they lack a rudimentary language base they typically get
from peer and adult interaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In putting little kids at the computer, you take them away
from peer play,'' says Sloan. ``That compromises social development
and imagination.'' Not only that, but a child is being provided
with someone else's visual images at precisely the time when he
needs to be developing his own image-making capacities. ``That's
what leads to intellectual growth later,'' Sloan says. The same
thing is true with too much TV time, but studies show parents
monitor TV more. ``We've come to ascribe almost magical educational
qualities to the computer,'' he says. He researches how to protect
children from computer misuse.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with computer exposure aren't limited to early
childhood. Bill Schechter, a history teacher at Lincoln-Sudbury
(Mass.) Regional High School, says he knows the Internet has the
capacity to be a tremendous tool for research, but so far he hasn't
seen how.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting to the point where I'm not going to accept
Internet research,'' he says. ``The technology for cheating far
outdistances a teacher's ability to recognize it. All I'm seeing is
lazy Internet use, where kids use it as an excuse not to open a
book, not to check sources, not to go to the library.''
</P>
<P>
   Software researcher Howard Budin says one of the problems is the
vastness of the Internet. Last year, his son's sixth-grade research
project required two Internet sources. ``When he did a search for
`panda,' he turned up 54,000 entries! If I hadn't been there with
him, he would have been totally frustrated,'' he says. Most of the
entries were for schools with pandas for mascots, but it took even
an experienced navigator like Budin a half-hour to get to
appropriate sites.
</P>
<P>
   Budin, who is director of the Center for Technology and School
Change at Columbia, says exposure to the Internet should start in
third or fourth grade, not before. ``Introduce it as a source of
information, not entertainment,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it can lead to the kind of problems teachers like
Schechter see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's teaching these kids how to use it and where the
information comes from and what it means?'' asks Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   He says that in the rush to wire classrooms, these critical
questions are largely ignored. ``Data itself is not knowledge,''
says Sloan. ``It's only knowledge when you connect it thoughtfully
and critically to curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   In many schools, the problem is lack of human infrastructure,
says technology researcher Vicki O'Day, of the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center. She speaks admiringly of a new principal at an
elementary school in California who had the courage to shut down
the computer lab for two years until she had technical support and
curricula-links.
</P>
<P>
   She says a school needs to fund two positions, a technology
coordinator who keeps equipment up and running and is not a
teacher, and a curriculum development person who is a teacher but
not in the classroom. ``You can't expect a classroom teacher to be
knowledgeable about software and the Internet in addition to what
she already does,'' O'Day says.
</P>
<P>
   She also tells schools to put computers in the classroom, not in
a computer lab; they're more likely to be integrated into the
curriculum and to be seen as one more tool, along with a dictionary
and pencil sharpener. ``We used to think kids should do computer
just for the sake of doing computer,'' says O'Day. ``Uh-uh. It
should always be used for a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   For parents, this means restricting the computer to what's
useful and forgetting about what's entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Healy, who's a purist about this, would limit a young child's
access to e-mail to write to grandpa, or to sitting on your lap
while you download pictures of her favorite animal or truck.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bennett, who reviews software and is author of ``The
Plugged-in Parent'' (Times Books), tells parents to think of
themselves as ``parentware.'' He defines that as an involved
parent. ``It's just as important as software,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In his home, the computer is one resource among many and it's
not used as a babysitter or as entertainment. He enforces limits on
screen time _ his kids, 8 and 11, can have two half-hour sessions a
day, after homework, although he says they hardly ever use it _ and
restrictions on software: no ``drill and grill'' games,
shoot'em-ups, or Internet surfing. Budin has similiar restrictions
for his children; his sixth-grade son spends his computer time on
spread sheets, graphic programs, and 3-D renderings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to setting limits on software, Sloan says, parents
should avoid what he calls an adulatory attitude toward the
computer. If your child is young and you're just starting out,
``Look at it as an appliance,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And if you already have a 4- or 6- or 9-year-old who's hooked on
computer games?
</P>
<P>
   It's never too late to talk about family values, even to say
you've made a mistake about allowing certain games. ``The ultimate
challenge and most successful counter,'' says Sloan, ``is to
provide such a rich environment in your home that the games seem
dull compared to whatever else is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Limit computer use for a child of any age to an hour a day,
tops. Dividing it into two or more sessions reduces potential
eyestrain or posture problems.
</P>
<P>
   _Researchers don't like software that doesn't tell your child
why he got the wrong answer or games where the only problem-solving
involved is figuring out the formula for winning. Many of them
don't like Living Books _ ``Kids just learn which buttons to push
to get the animation,'' says Jane Healy _ or reading programs.
</P>
<P>
   _Software most researchers like: drawing programs like Kid Pix,
KidWorks, and Dabbler; problem-solving games like The Logical
Journey of the Zoombinis.
</P>
<P>
   _In school, how close are children to the machines next to them?
Especially with older machines, which schools tend to have, there
is the potential of electromagnetic radiation.
</P>
<P>
   _Pay attention to your child's posture; even kids can get carpal
tunnel syndrome. Fluorescent lights can create a glare that is hard
on the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   _Rules to give a child for Internet use: Never type in your
name, age, address, or other personal information; if a name is
required to get a database, get your parent to do it.
</P>
<P>
   _Children under 12 should be on the Internet only with an adult.
</P>
<P>
   _Children's Software Quarterly is a newsletter for parents that
reviews software. Write c/o Children's Software Press, 720 Kuhlman
Rd., Houston, TX 77024. Also ask about their booklets on Internet
use.

MURALS ADD AN EXTRA TOUCH OF CLASS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  with art 
 
By MADELEINE McDERMOTT HAMM 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For the newly renovated lobby of The Rice apartments,
it was that extra touch of class.
</P>
<P>
   For the media room of a Houston-area mansion, it was a permanent
party mood.
</P>
<P>
   For a Lake Conroe resort restaurant, it was the illusion of
being transported to an exotic place.
</P>
<P>
   More than decoration or even works of art, murals can create a
distinct ambiance in a private room or public arena. Paintings once
planned to fill a blank wall or even provide an imaginary view now
often set the desired tone in a space.
</P>
<P>
   Although artists have been painting fanciful designs, scenes,
angels, animals and people on walls and ceilings for centuries, in
recent years it seems to be the thing to do. Relatively plain
spaces acquire instant atmosphere with walls painted to look like
ancient ruins or a tropical rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   During long, intense days in late summer, native Houstonian
Russell Erwin put his classical art training to the test while atop
a 30-foot scaffolding in the rotunda of The Rice. As various
craftsmen refurbished the elegant lobby of the historical Houston
hotel, now converted to residential lofts, Erwin and his assistants
painted six murals into the curves where columns meet the vaulted
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Factoring in delays and other aspects of the project, each mural
was completed in an average of two days. Erwin says the
``classical'' paintings were inspired by imagery used by painters
Lord Frederic Leighton, C.A. Lenoir and J.W. Waterhouse.  &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The first stage of Erwin's Rice project involved the creation of
two murals for the ballroom. While the rotunda murals were sketched
and painted on the walls, the ballroom murals were painted on
canvas, then mounted on opposite walls high above the room.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin said the project started with ``one unsigned and
irreparably damaged original mural from the Rice Hotel.'' He said
the 6-foot-by-36-foot canvas, found in the basement, could possibly
be 100 years old and had obviously been exposed to high heat and
humidity for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old mural was full of holes and parts of the canvas were
completely rotten. Worst of all, (it) had never been varnished, and
the oil paint was rapidly disintegrating,'' Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
   After restoration was ruled out, the choice was a new mural
based on the canvas, expanded by about a third. Erwin says the
original mural appears to have been painted by a theatrical or
scenic artist using a decorous Neoclassical, Victorian style.
</P>
<P>
   To create the new mural for the west wall above the stage, as
well as one for the opposite wall, Erwin altered and adapted other
works in the style of the original. When finished, the new murals
received an umber glaze, simulating an antique patina.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the upper floors of The Rice, artist Jeff De Lude
turned the long hallway in a two-bedroom loft into a view of a
Tuscan landscape, seen beyond a columned archway. The mural, which
is 12 feet wide and almost 9 feet high, visually opens up the
space, giving an illusion of depth.
</P>
<P>
   The mural is painted directly on the Sheetrock. De Lude painted
the surrounding walls to look like aging plaster. The subdued
colors in the mural, plus a few spots where it appears that the
paint has flaked off, give the effect of an antique painting.
</P>
<P>
   Interior designer Sandy Lucas of Lucas/Eilers Design Associates
finds murals a good way to deal with large spaces, especially in
residences. When Lucas was doing the interiors for a new residence
in the Memorial area, she and her client were inspired by the
murals in Joey's, one of the Vallone family's restaurants, during a
trip to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we wanted something playful and fun for the walls in
the wine room. It's a small space with high ceilings,'' Lucas said.
``We hired artist Janice Parsons, who has done the murals for
several of Tony Vallone's (restaurants), decided on a
Toulouse-Lautrec Moulin Rouge-type theme, and went from there. It
was the perfect solution because a mural allows you to keep the
scale of the art large enough to be seen high on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   A mural also proved the answer for the media room. ``We needed
something to set the tone for the room, to complement the purpose
as well as balance the big screen, but not be too serious,'' Lucas
said. ``My client thought it would be fun to make it look like a
party, with their favorite celebrities and friends.'' Erwin was
commissioned to paint the family and other favorite people on the
walls, making it a very special space.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Cynthia Stone decided she needed more than paint or
wallpaper to liven up the exercise room of Mountain Canyon, a
residential high rise in Phoenix, Ariz. ``We needed something to
counterbalance the coldness of those exercise machines,'' she said.
The Houston interior designer turned to Houston artist Suzanne
Kitrell to create a ``cheery and fun'' mural of energetic
exercisers with a Southwestern desert-type landscape.
</P>
<P>
   A desert southwest setting also was painted onto the walls and
ceiling of a Lake Conroe restaurant, giving the remodeled space the
look of a quaint village nestled at the base of an ancient cliff
dwelling. Designer Sharon Staley worked with Richard Aiple, resort
manager of Del Lago Golf Resort and Conference Center, to develop
his ideas for transforming &UR;  &LR; the dated garden-theme restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The concept for the new restaurant, renamed Kiva, was a logical
extension of the exterior Spanish-Mediterranean architecture of the
hotel complex. Airbrush artist Rick Fitzpatrick worked from
photographs of Santa Fe, N.M., and Phoenix to paint the intense
scenes that envelop the dining areas.
</P>
<P>
   Denice Hockett worked with Staley on the design of Grand Slam,
the Del Lago sports bar, and Fitzpatrick painted the multisport
murals that wrap around the space. Sports fans will recognize
famous football broadcasters, such as Frank Gifford, in the press
box above the bleachers. Other sections of the nostalgic murals
represent baseball, basketball, even water-skiing. Staley said the
resort reports a strong increase in business because of the lively
atmosphere. &QL;

RIPPLES OF ASIAN CRISIS SPREADING IN STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes job-loss text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For more than a year Massachusetts has watched warily
as Asia's economic downturn has forced one sector of the state's
economy, semiconductors, to lay off more than 3,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Gillette Co. preparing to issue pink slips to 4,700
employees worldwide _ and the number in Massachusetts still
undisclosed _ the state now is on notice that Asia's problems may
take a wider toll here in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The next industry to be hit, economists said Wednesday, could be
financial services _ a sector that includes mutual funds, banks and
insurance companies, and which had 166,000 employees in the state
at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of anecdotal evidence that there is a hold on
hiring'' in financial services, said Rachael Chiono, a regional
economist at DRI/McGraw Hill in Lexington, since US stock markets
began plummeting in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already hearing of layoffs on Wall Street,'' added Wayne
Ayers, chief economist at BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Economists also warned that, even if the impact of global
financial problems on Massachusetts can be limited, almost every
economic reversal has a ``ripple effect.'' This includes ``everyone
from the people who supply the copy paper to the pizza shop,'' said
Ayers.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's problems as a worldwide seller of consumer goods are
singular in Massachusetts, which has few large firms that sell
consumer goods and fewer that sell globally, said David A.
Tibbetts, the state's commissioner of economic development.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, repeating the views of others, a broader mix of
industries than during previous recessions is expected to help the
state better withstand any recession in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   But Gillette's announcement was a warning, Tibbetts said, that a
recession could have impacts far beyond the specialized
semiconductor industry that depends heavily on Asia for sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a concern? Yes,'' said Tibbetts. ``Is it time to
panic? Certainly not.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiono said DRI economists now believe there is a 50-50 chance
of a recession in the United States that could reverse years of job
growth in Massachusetts. But even if a recession can be averted,
she said, the fact Massachusetts exports a higher fraction of its
industrial output to Asia than other states will limit job growth
here to about 1 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite ongoing layoffs, the state's job growth rate this year
is running about 2.9 percent, said Chiono.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial Associates of West
Chester, Pa., agreed with these projections, but only if the global
economy ``expands at a better rate next year than it has this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``if the world economy goes flat next year
and the stock market falls another 25 percent,'' Zandi said, the
shocks will be substantial almost everywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Tibbetts said Gillette chairman Alfred M. Zeien refused to tell
him the company's plans for its Massachusetts plants and offices,
but left him believing there will be little if any impact at the
largest of those plants, in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `We've just spent $400 million upgrading this
plant, and it is running seven days a week, 24 hours a day _ you
can read between the lines,''' Tibbetts said.

BLEDSOE: TURN OVER A NEW LEAF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Twenty-one games have come and gone since
the last time Drew Bledsoe set foot in the Superdome in New
Orleans. The game, you may recall, was the most important of
Bledsoe's career _ a 35-21 Super Bowl loss to the Green Bay Packers
Jan. 26, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bledose returns to the scene of the frustrating loss, though he
knows Sunday's game against the Saints won't be quite the same. He
knows it will be louder _ and more hostile _ because the partisan
crowd will be behind the 3-0 hometown Saints. He goes into the game
older and wiser. The Patriots are 13-8 since the Super Bowl,
including playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of facing Danny Wuerffel, New Orleans's second-year
quarterback, led Bledsoe to reflect on what it's like to be a young
quarterback in the NFL, specifically about the struggles of rookies
Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf, who already has had run-ins with the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Ryan a little bit,'' said Bledsoe, who attended
Washington State five years before Leaf. ``He's going through some
tough things right now. He's a volatile guy, always has been, and
probably always will be. If he goes through the emotional swings
like he seems to be going through now his whole career, he's going
to have a heart attack. I haven't talked to him, but I left him a
message after the Kansas City game,'' when Leaf was 1 for 15 with
two interceptions in a 23-7 San Diego loss, ``and told him to keep
his head up.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf has lashed out at reporters and had to issue a statement of
apology this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at times people forget how hard the job that we do
is,'' said Bledsoe. ``And to come in as a rookie and try to be a
starter in the NFL at quarterback, it might be the toughest task in
sports. The guys are struggling a little bit. Ryan is struggling a
little bit with the media off the field. I know Ryan a little bit
and he loves to play football, but he's probably a little bit like
me in that he loves the game but the off-the-field stuff he could
let slide a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get caught up in the emotional swings where you get
real high after a win or real low after a loss, that can be hard on
you. You have to maintain a certain level each week _ win or
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bledsoe was a rookie, his coach, Bill Parcells, deflected a
lot of the media attention. The Colts' Manning, despite a horrible
start, seems more mature than Leaf and better able to cope with
failure, probably thanks to his father, Archie, an NFL veteran who
surely told Manning there would be some tough times.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be the determining factor with Ryan and Peyton
_ how they're dealing with the adversity they're going through,''
said Bledsoe. ``They can go at it one of two ways. Either they can
bounce back from it, be a little patient, gain some confidence,
move on, and be successful, or they can let it get to them and go
down that road and then bounce around from team to team. Sometimes
they'll have to deal with (adversity) for two or three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who has a calmer demeanor than Leaf, credits agent
Leigh Steinberg with helping him deal with the media. Leaf also is
a Steinberg client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leigh Steinberg gave me a lot of direction in how to deal with
the media and also I tried to pay close attention to guys who were
perceived well and guys who were perceived negatively by the
media,'' Bledsoe said. ``You watch some of the guys who are some of
the real classy guys in the NFL and watch the way they conduct
themselves. Everything is always positive and they're upbeat
regardless. They take as much responsibility as they can. You learn
by watching. You don't want to be like the guys who point fingers
at somebody else or make excuses. Ultimately that comes back to
haunt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he learned from watching veterans such as Troy
Aikman, Warren Moon, and John Elway who are ``respected on and off
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   His message to Manning and Leaf: There will be tough times, but
it's better to roll with the punches than throw them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going to Buffalo my first game and seeing Bruce
Smith walk onto the field and that was an intimidating thing for a
21-year-old,'' Bledsoe said. ``It was just a blur looking back on
it. I remember some of the positives. I had an excellent tight end
who was just coming into his own in Ben (Coates). At the time I had
a center who was extremely smart in Bill Lewis. When I'd come up to
the line and if they were giving me a certain look, he'd turn
around and say `Check 58.' So I'd call out `Check 58.' I had some
guys who helped me out a little bit. I was never 1-for, but I had
some bad ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe has not been intercepted once this year. But he's
certainly not taking New Orleans for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a very aggressive up-field defense,'' said Bledsoe.
``They led the league in sacks last year. They're showing why this
year. Probably more now than in other weeks, there's a real matchup
up front for our guys. If they can give me a little time to throw
and a little room to run, we'll be all right. If they don't, it
could be a real ugly game offensively. That's the overriding theme.
Teams look ugly when they play against them. We have to execute and
make a couple of plays in the game to put some points on the
board.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he figures the Saints will get into the pocket and
try to make him throw on the run. He said the Saints will do
everything they can to stop Robert Edwards. And he's ready for the
dome noise.
</P>
<P>
   He has wrist bands that have some of the longer plays written on
them so he can expedite play calling. And backup quarterback Scott
Zolak will be equipped with a headset wired to quarterback coach
Jack Reilly, so if Bledsoe can't hear the play call from Reilly in
the transmitter in his helmet, he can turn to Zolak for help.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe realizes the fact that he hasn't thrown an interception
yet won't help him Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a week-to-week battle. If I go out and turn the ball over
a lot in this game, we won't have a chance of winning the ballgame.
The most important statistic other than the final score is the
turnover ratio. We have a gaudy record (24-2 since 1994) when we
have a positive turnover ratio.''

EGANS OF EMC FAME MOVE INTO VENTURE INVESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decade that saw the undoing of such giants as Digital
Equipment Corp. and Wang Laboratories, no company or family better
epitomized the continuing vitality of Massachusetts' technology
story than EMC Corp. and its founding family, the Egans.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the 1990s, the Hopkinton computer storage
company has seen its revenues explode to nearly $4 billion from
$132 million and profits mushroom to more than $500 million from
the red-ink days of the 1980s. The Egans, and any investor smart or
lucky enough to stick with them, got rich: The stock rose from
about 27 cents a share at the start of the decade to about $57 a
share today.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe, in its annual ranking of companies, this year
named EMC the ``Company of the Decade.'' The company itself touts
its success as ``The EMC Effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a core of young tech start-ups are hitching their futures to
``The Egan Effect'' _ a bet that the family's magic and money can
make them something special, too.
</P>
<P>
   As the Egans wind down their involvement with the company they
built from scratch, the family is increasingly focusing its energy
_ and its money _ on a new generation of New England technology
companies. Investors, too, might want to note where the Egans are
placing their bets.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month John R. Egan, EMC's heir apparent and the son
of cofounder Richard J. Egan, said he was leaving the company to
run Egan-Managed Capital, a venture firm built on the family
fortune. John Egan, 40, cited a desire to spend more time with his
family and his passion for venture investing as the reasons behind
his departure from EMC.
</P>
<P>
   In a venture capital world flooded with money, this is a modest
beginning. The firm was started with $32.8 million in Egan family
money, a sum dwarfed by any number of other firms aimed at
early-stage companies. Another larger fund, which will include
money from outside investors, is planned for early next year.
</P>
<P>
   But more than money _ in some ways the easiest part of the
venture game these days _ the firm is pushing the Egan name and all
that it represents. In the venture business today, success or
failure is determined by who can persuade the best and brightest
entrepreneurs that you are the venture partner for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is different about us is John Egan. We lead with that,''
admits Michael Shanahan, one of Egan's two partners and a former
partner at Eastech Management Co., a Boston venture firm.
</P>
<P>
   Egan's other partner is Francis J. Hughes, a longtime partner
and president of American Research &AMP; Development Co., the storied
Boston venture firm that originally bankrolled a young Ken Olsen
and his fledgling Digital Equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Egan says he is focusing on New England technology companies
because New England is where he is and technology is what he knows.
The firm has so far invested anywhere from $1 million to $2 million
in six small companies and plans to make as many as 16 investments
before the current pool is spent. Says Egan: ``If it is a passive
investment, we're not interested. If it is more active, we're more
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the money, Egan says the family contacts can provide his
start-ups an entry to potential customers at some of the biggest
companies in the world and be helpful in recruiting talent. He
thinks Egan-Capital knows technology and how technology companies
work.
</P>
<P>
   And, he says, there is less pressure for the kind of quick
``trophy'' public offering other venture firms want. ``Our family
doesn't have that cadence. We can be patient,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Like most venture firms that specialize in start-ups, the Egan
portfolio is littered with no-name firms: Eprise Corp. in
Framingham, Terascape Software in Needham, VXI Corp. in
Rollinsford, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   EPiCON Corp., a 40-person software development firm in Waltham,
says it went to Egan-Capital for a reason: ``There is an Egan
Effect,'' says Jack Sweeney, EPiCON's chief executive. ``The Egans
have a lot of credibility in the market. I wanted John on the board
to help bring that credibility to EPiCON.''
</P>
<P>
   BlazeNet Inc., which plans to make network switches, has just 35
people, no revenues and won't even ship its first product until
next year. Egan ran the search that found the company's chief
executive, Bruce Cohen, a cofounder of Chipcom. Says Cohen: ``The
venture capital community always talks about high risk, high
reward. This definitely is high risk. We think it is going to be
high reward _ that is to be determined.''
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups are calling for the head of Massachusetts
insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt. Who would be insurance
commissioner if Attorney General Scott Harshbarger were to beat
Acting Governor Paul Cellucci in November?
</P>
<P>
   The smart money is on Joanna Connolly, Harshbarger's assistant
attorney general who handles most of the office's insurance issues.
Connolly has been a low-profile presence on a lot of high-profile
issues over the last few years, including sales practice cases
against Prudential Insurance and John Hancock Mutual Life.

ACCORD OVER CHINATOWN ANIMAL SALES COLLAPSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The agreement between Chinatown merchants and
animal-rights proponents on the proper way to slaughter animals
collapsed Wednesday, threatening to prolong a cross-cultural
dispute in the ethnically vibrant section of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel frustrated, angry and betrayed,'' said Richard
Avanzino, president of the San Francisco Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals. ``We unfortunately are getting into an
adversarial and combative mode.''
</P>
<P>
   An agreement brokered in April by the SPCA and the Chinese
Consolidated Benevolent Association, a group with a 150-year
history in Chinatown, fell apart over the humane and proper ways to
kill hard- and soft-shell turtles, and how to store frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Avanzino said he and others would ask the state Fish and Game
Board to take action against Chinatown merchants who sell live
animals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, they will contend that frogs and turtles
are nonindigenous species being sold illegally and released into
wilderness areas and public ponds and lakes, threatening the
ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wartelle, an attorney representing the merchants, countered
Wednesday that a court ruling in July had already vindicated them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our stores don't treat animals inhumanely at all. ... We don't
have to do any of this,'' Wartelle said. ``The courts say our
methods are fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over selling live turtles, frogs and other animals
for food in Chinatown has raged for more than two years. In a 1997
lawsuit, animal-rights activists accused the merchants of storing
and killing animals in a cruel fashion by keeping them in cramped,
dirty conditions, denying food and water, and tearing shells off
live turtles.
</P>
<P>
   A San Francisco Superior Court judge said in a tentative opinion
in July that the merchants were not violating health or penal
codes, a charge leveled by the activists. He denied the activists'
request for an injunction on the sale of live seafood and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the court ruling, attempts to reach a compromise
continued.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines included a ban against selling injured or
diseased animals, storing animals in cramped conditions, and
removing feathers, skin or shell while the animal is alive.
</P>
<P>
   Wartelle said in an interview Wednesday that the negotiations
began to break down after the merchants hired Dr. Joy Mench,
director of the Center for Animal Welfare at the University of
California at Davis, to analyze the handling of animals and to
recommend how it could be improved. Mench made a few
recommendations but said the animals already were being treated
humanely.
</P>
<P>
   The merchants took Mench's recommendations to SPCA
representatives, who disagreed. Wartelle said the disagreements
were insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   Because the agreement fell apart, Avanzino said, the SPCA will
seek or has discussed seeking a ban on the sale of turtles and
frogs, advocating a boycott of Chinatown, sponsoring a statewide
initiative banning live animal sales and seeking criminal charges
against the market operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was avoidable,'' Avanzino said. ``Now, we're in an
all-out confrontation ... that's created a dynamic that hurts
everybody. It leads to divisiveness that's sad and unfortunate.''

TALLAS FEELS THE HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ There are many young players who are
benefitting from the fact that four free agents have not yet come
to terms with the Bruins, especially the forwards. With Jason
Allison, Anson Carter, Ted Donato, and Kyle McLaren on the
sidelines, that has meant a lot more ice time for players such as
Antti Laaksonen, Peter Nordstrom, Peter Ferraro, and Chris Taylor.
While the Bruins are thin at forward, they've got goaltenders
aplenty. Wednesday's exhibition against the Pittsburgh Penguins at
the Centrum was Rob Tallas's chance to make a case for staying in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Both Jim Carey and Byron Dafoe have had their full games. Tallas
was next in the rotation. One factor that complicates Tallas's
situation is that the Bruins have to play Carey in about a dozen
games in order to be able to expose him in next June's expansion
draft. Tallas said he knows there are other considerations when
putting the roster together besides how well he plays, and that
puts more pressure on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's there,'' said Tallas, 25. ``It's obvious and it's out
there. It's something you think about. I'm just trying to make this
club. I think last year I wasn't just a backup in the league, I was
the best backup in the league, and that means something to me. I
took a lot of pride in that. I want to get back into that rhythm. I
know it's a new season, I can't look back at last season, it's
done, it's behind me. I just have to look at what's up for me in
the future here and what's going to happen. That's something that
is always on your mind. It just seems like every year I've been the
odd man out and it is tiring and it is hard. It's mentally hard
through training camp knowing that you are kind of still the odd
man out all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas took the Bruins to arbitration this past summer believing
he deserved a one-way contract after posting a record of 6-3-3 in
14 games in Boston last year with a 1.83 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is one thing but I've never been one that worried
about money,'' said Tallas. ``I don't think I need to be rich to
have a good life. I just really enjoy being in the NHL. There are
nights I sit on the bench and I'm in awe that I'm still here and
excited that I'm here. It's never been about money. Going into the
arbitration case, we never had a figure we were sticking by, we
were just arguing for a one-way (contract). That's all I really
cared about and being up here. I really enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas is trying to relax and remain focused as he, Dafoe and,
Carey battle for two jobs. Dafoe came into camp as the No. 1
netminder and has done nothing that would alter that perception,
which leaves Carey and Tallas fighting for the backup job. As long
as the free agents remain out, goals will be hard to come by and
the goaltenders' roles will become more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes goalies tend to think we can stop anything,'' said
Tallas. ``Even on great goals, we look back and think, `I could've
had that.' Some games you might have had it. But you have to worry
about what you're doing out there. You can take the worst offensive
team in the league and put in Dominik Hasek and I guarantee you
they'd win some games. It all comes down to goaltending and guys
rally around that. Last year, we were kind of looking at it the way
we're looking at it now. Who do we have really? But guys shined
through and really stepped up. Hopefully it will happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, the only thing the Bruins and Allison were
agreeing on is that they disagree. Assistant general manager Mike
O'Connell spoke to Bob Gerow, Allison's representative, before
Gerow and Allison left Boston Wednesday and they were no closer to
working out their differences than they had been before Allison and
Gerow came to town for a meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically asked them if they were comfortable with the
decision they've made,'' said O'Connell. ``He wants a two-year deal
and we just can't come to an agreement. Of course we hope something
will get done but if it can't be done, we've got to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said the Bruins won't trade Allison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even thinking about it,'' he said. ``It doesn't make
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more optimistic note, O'Connell spoke to Doug Messier, the
agent for defenseman McLaren, and is hopeful there will be a
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good discussion,'' said O'Connell. ``We're getting
closer, it appears to me.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said there was no news on Carter or Donato.

   FILM-ANTS (Undated) _ DreamWorks Pictures' first animated
feature, ``Antz'' is certainly no ``Bambi,'' but it is a visually
engaging and moderately entertaining fantasy that makes another
eye-popping showcase for the fast-evolving art of computer
animation.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-DREAMS (Undated) _ Any movie set almost entirely in the
afterlife seems doomed to a certain kind of failure from the start.
``When Dreams May Come'' is so grounded in Hollywood imperatives,
and so intent on being acceptable to all denominations and points
of view, that _ despite its undeniably striking visuals _ the film
comes off as being weak and unconvincing on one hand, and shrill
and fundamentalist on the other.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-IMPOSTERS (Undated) _ There's not much to say about a
comedy that falls as flat as Stanley Tucci's ``The Impostors.'' As
hilarious as it may have seemed on paper, the
writer-producer-director-star fails to bring off even a single
scene. Sitting through it is a grueling experience.

<P>
   FILM-ROXBURY (Undated) _ Things move in waves at the movies, and
disco currently is the craze. ``A Night at the Roxbury,'' which is
a whole lot more fun and memorable than the current box office dud
``54,'' is the surprise in a less-than-memorable pack.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-LOLITA (Undated) At first glance, Stanley Kubrick's
``Lolita'' would seem to be the rare movie classic that could stand
a remake. After all, in the movie climate of 1962, Kubrick had to
dance all around the subject of a 37-year-old man's lust for a
14-year-old ``nymphette.'' But the new ``Lolita'' has fared badly.
As good as the film is in many respects, the concept of a more
``serious'' treatment of Nabokov's novel has proven to be less
appealing on celluloid than it did on paper. The story seems to
demand a heavy sense of irony, even comedy. Without it, the film is
a long 137 minutes.

   TRAVEL-ST.PETERSBURG (St. Petersubrg, Russia) _ Often called
``The Venice of the North'' for its architecture, beauty and
setting by water, St. Petersburg is one of the world's great
cities. With a little advance preparation, a visit can be a pure
delight.

LOSER CRUISERS FROM `SNL' SKIT AREN'T HALF BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Take your typical ``Saturday Night Live'' skit and
turn it into a movie, and you get five minutes' worth of laughs
embedded in 90 minutes of fluff and suet. Consider, if you can,
``Stuart Saves His Family, ``It's Pat,'' ``The Coneheads.''
</P>
<P>
   But every now and then, the ``SNL'' crew hits the comic nail
right in the funny bone: ``The Blues Brothers,'' ``Wayne's World.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the two ``SNL'' extremes falls ``A Night at the
Roxbury,'' which is just funny enough to keep you from thinking:
Whatever made them think they could turn a sight gag about two guys
with neck spasms into a movie?
</P>
<P>
   The Will Ferrell/Chris Kattan skit has one joke: two disco dudes
bopping all night to the same song. Funny enough for a couple of
minutes, but it could have made for one long, painful movie.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the ``SNL''-ers realized that because the dudes hardly
ever spoke or did anything but dance, they could invent an entire
story to go around them.
</P>
<P>
   John Fortenberry, a TV director moving up to the big screen, and
his writers decided that the two lounge losers are brothers living
in Beverly Hills, trying to make the LA club scene.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Butabi (Kattan) is the smart one, while brother Steve
(Ferrell) is the good-looking one _ at least compared to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers dream of opening their own disco club, where the
inside will be the outside, and vice versa. Meanwhile, their
reality is that they work at their dad's fake flower shop, they
wear bathing suits they shouldn't, and they actually score.
</P>
<P>
   Steve is also pursued by the girl from the shop next door (a
sexually predatory Molly Shannon), which threatens to break up this
brotherhood of dunces.
</P>
<P>
   The story bops along with just enough laughs so that every time
you think they've run out of ideas, they haven't.
</P>
<P>
   In the skit, the guys groove to that one disco song all the
time, with the lines ``What is love? Baby, don't hurt me,''
repeated so often you think it's their mantra. In case you're
worried that the song comprises the entire soundtrack of the movie,
it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Night at the Roxbury'' is not the funniest movie of the
year. Not close. But it is much funnier than we had any right to
expect it to be.
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG-13, ``A Night at the Roxbury'' should have received an
R for profanity, flashes of nudity and sex. The fact that they got
away with a PG-13 is the film's biggest shocker. 3 sta rs. &QL;

 c.1998 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One summer weekend two years ago, America's newspapers and talk
shows shared a jolly laugh at the expense of Hillary Clinton. A new
book claimed that the first lady had communicated, through a spirit
medium, with the dead Eleanor Roosevelt; and the image of this
super-rational lawyer resorting to psychic comfort was cruelly
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The following Monday, Mrs. Clinton was due to appear in public
for the first time since her humiliation, to address a conference
in Nashville. The audience waited, cringing on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Then a beaming figure appeared upon the stage. ``This conference
is a terrific way of bringing together people,'' she purred; ``I
had one of my conversations with Mrs. Roosevelt, and she thinks
this is a terrific idea as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists and conference-goers dissolved into laughter, and
any lingering psychic embarrassment was instantly forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, save perhaps her husband, shrugs off public humiliation
as elegantly as Mrs. Clinton. Time and again since she drove down
to Arkansas to manage her future husband's 1974 congressional
campaign, she has had to confront allegations of his infidelity:
with Gennifer Flowers and Paula Jones; with a host of
long-forgotten names; and now with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again she has done more than merely stick with him; she
has defended him. Had she done otherwise, Bill Clinton might never
have reached the White House; had she denounced him over the
Lewinsky affair, his career might now be over.
</P>
<P>
   Future historians will remember the current scandal in many
ways: for the president's childish squandering of huge political
talents, for the obsessive inquisition conducted by Ken Starr, for
the disturbing influence of Internet-borne leaks, for the gap
between the chattering classes and the public. But future
biographers will focus on America's remarkable first lady.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Flowers sold her story of a 12-year affair with
candidate Clinton to a supermarket tabloid, Mrs. Clinton dismissed
the whole business as ``trash for cash,'' and compared rumors about
her husband's sex life to UFO sightings.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Jones sued President Clinton for sexual harassment,
Mrs. Clinton advised him to settle out of court, despite the
humiliation that would follow from her husband's implied admission
of infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lewinsky story surfaced in January, some thought this
would be the last straw: they worried that Mrs. Clinton would march
out, destroying her husband both emotionally and politically. But
Mrs. Clinton stuck by him again, blaming the allegations on a
``vast right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, even though the worst Lewinsky rumors have proved true,
Mrs. Clinton is still there, loudly defending her husband's record.
</P>
<P>
   This would be remarkable enough. But Mrs. Clinton does all this
without asking anyone for sympathy. She refuses to discuss her
feelings; indeed, she reveals nothing of herself whatever. On a
recent money-raising campaign swing, she assured anybody
impertinent enough to ask that she was ``Just fine!''
</P>
<P>
   Even officials who have worked with her for years seem mystified
by her. One White House aide, no great Hillary fan, recalls a
tete-a-tete with the first lady at a particularly bad moment in the
Lewinsky saga. Throughout lunch she was ``completely calm, chatting
about life.''
</P>
<P>
   Her self-control, her knack of sweeping problems into some
corner-cabinet of her mind, is even more amazing than her
husband's.
</P>
<P>
   Through all this, moreover, she manages to be popular. She
exudes as much empathy as a management consultant with flu; she is
the most ruthless of her husband's spin doctors; she has, in short,
the qualities that would doom most public figures.
</P>
<P>
   But she has recently become the most popular speaker at
Democratic fund-raising events. According to one recent poll, 54
percent of men see her as a good role model, and 66 percent of
women feel that way about her.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that Mrs. Clinton was especially popular among
career women who identified with this lawyer-mum, but less so among
housewives. Now the polls suggest that non-career women are Mrs.
Clinton's keenest supporters.
</P>
<P>
   There is a message in this popularity, and it is not the one
that seems most obvious. It would be tempting to conclude that Mrs.
Clinton's image-makers have successfully disguised her ambitious
side, conning Middle America into identifying with her. Over the
years, Mrs. Clinton has forsaken frizzy brown hair in favor of soft
blonde locks; she has traded nerdish spectacles for contact lenses;
she has even boasted about her low-fat cookie recipe. After a bad
spell as a front-line wonk, leading her husband's failed effort to
reform health care, she has retreated to safely feminine issues
like children.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite this careful repositioning of her brand, it
would be wrong to think that Americans have been taken in. They do
not see her as a traditional wife, standing meekly by an abusive
man. On the contrary, 48 percent of Americans view the Clintons'
marriage as a practical career relationship; and, because of this,
56 percent expect her to divorce Bill Clinton when he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Americans see Mrs. Clinton for what she is: a
laser-brained careerist, who met her future husband in the Yale law
library and has propelled him, not always scrupulously, to the
White House. They are prepared to believe that she skirted the law
in a property deal known as Whitewater; they may not entirely
dismiss the extreme view, put about in recent days, that she
defends her husband because she needs a presidential pardon to save
her from indictment. And yet, seeing her this way, a majority of
Americans remain fond of her.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom holds that politicians must be packaged
as feeling family types, rather than thick-skinned, sharp-elbowed
machines dedicated to self-advancement. But America thrives on a
healthy respect for ambition, even in its raw extremes. It would be
a lesser place if it did not admire the amazing Mrs. Clinton.

Pogrebin.

`ART' OF THE MATTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's ``Art'' all right, but is it art? That's a
question critics and audiences on two continents have answered
mostly positively about Yasmina Reza's play ``Art.''
</P>
<P>
   Now L.A. audiences can have their own say. Alan Alda, Victor
Garber and Alfred Molina will re-create their original Broadway
roles in an exclusive eight-week engagement of the play, Jan. 15
through March 14, at the UCLA/James A. Doolittle Theatre, 1615 N.
Vine St., Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 Tony Award-winning drama, the relationships among
three friends are turned upside down when one of them buys a piece
of modern art _ an all-white painting.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are available only as part of Center Theatre Group's
Blockbusters Series, a package that also includes ``Fosse: A
Celebration in Song and Dance,'' the musical ``Titanic'' and
Matthew Bourne's ``Cinderella,'' and to current Center Theatre
Group subscribers at the Ahmanson Theatre and the Mark Taper Forum.
For more information, call CTG Audience Services at (213) 628-2772.
Tickets for ``Art'' will go on sale to the general public in
November and will be available through TeleCharge at (800)
447-7400.
</P>
<P>
   OUTSTANDING OVATIONS: ``The Cider House Rules,'' the Mark Taper
Forum's marathon adaptation of John Irving's novel set in and
around a Maine orphanage, squeezed out 13 nominations for the 1998
Theatre LA Ovation Awards, which were announced at a Sept. 28
cocktail reception at the Hotel Inter-Continental.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cider House,'' which received nods for best play, lead actor
(Josh Hamilton), lead actress (Jillian Armenante) and director of a
play (Tom Hulce and Jane Jones) was followed by ``Chicago'' with 10
nominations and Circle X Theater Company's ``Great Men of Science
Nos. 21 &AMP; 22'' with seven nominations. Four productions received
six nominations each: ``Blame It on the Movies'' and ``The Old
Settler,'' both at the Pasadena Playhouse; Actors Alley's ``Room
Service''; and East West Players' ``Pacific Overtures.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 26 categories in all, with separate awards for larger
and smaller theaters in most categories. Voting season covered the
period Sept. 1, 1997, to Aug. 31, 1998. A total of 281 productions
were eligible to compete, of which 105 were world premiere plays or
musicals and 21 were new translations or adaptations. The voting
body consists of professionals from Theatre LA member companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Ovation Awards are administered by Theatre LA, the nonprofit
association of more than 150 theaters and producers that represents
and promotes theater in the Greater Los Angeles area. Its programs
include the Theatre LA half-price ticket outlet at Jerry's Famous
Deli in West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The awards will be presented at a gala ceremony at 7:30 p.m.
Nov. 16 at the Shubert Theatre in Century City. Nathan Lane will
host. The awards are open to the public; tickets may be purchased
by calling TeleCharge at (800) 447-7400 for $15, $35 and $125. For
groups of 15 or more buying $35 seats, a 10 percent discount is
available by calling Jeanne Kowalski at (714) 994-6150.
</P>
<P>
   THIS YEAR'S MODEL: Seventeen years since she scored a surprise
British pop hit with ``O Superman,'' Laurie Anderson is still
wearing purple suits and a punk-Tinkerbell haircut.
</P>
<P>
   She's still delivering her stream-of-portentousness commentaries
in a unique tone of voice _ husky, insinuating, seductive,
conspiratorial _ that makes her sound like the mischievous twin
sister of HAL the computer in ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   And she's still painting in the same aural palette of monstrous
electronic squawks, sotto voce growls, synthetic banshee wails and
digitally processed yodels that occasionally seems as dated as
Michael Jackson's hiccups and shrieks on the ``Thriller'' album.
</P>
<P>
   Call it an '80s thing.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``The Speed of Darkness,'' Anderson's ``stripped-down''
solo performance Sept. 25 at UCLA's Royce Hall, had a slightly
retrograde feel to it, the 80-minute show also reaffirmed
Anderson's reputation as an artist of unquenchable curiosity and
astuteness. She tackles subjects that mainstream theater hardly
seems to know exist.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Anderson's subject is the dual-edged blade of
technology, specifically the creeping (and creepy) globalization of
world culture via computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do with something really big and really powerful
that you don't understand?'' she intones. ``You worship it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowing before the high-tech godhead, Anderson sees us as a
culture of information hunter-gatherers, a theme she interweaves
with soothing-menacing anecdotes about Cree Indian rituals,
cybersex, the Unabomber, Dolly Parton's ``Dollywood'' theme park
and sheep cloning. Culled from her own frequent-flier existence,
these impressionistic verbal e-mails have the ring of confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Her point? Humans are engaged in a ``personal arm's race,''
obsessively stockpiling arsenals of dubious info-bytes while
converting their souls and bodies into click-on icons. Hardly a
novel idea, plus the show's ostensible focus on a theater, a mental
hospital and a control room never gets very well developed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Anderson is able to fuse her mostly shrewd cultural
insights, cryptic stories and ominous soundscapes into a kind of
post-apocalyptic memory play, as if she were looking back on a
century's long, slow slide into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, whose next project is an adaptation of ``Moby Dick,''
is the Ishmael of performance artists, a sly survivor whose
prophetic musings look more prescient with each passing year. She's
an artistic Cassandra whose voice is still far too wise and funny
to be taken lightly.

ON A SHOESTRING

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The announcement of the prestigious Mercury Music
Prize two weeks ago in London was a shock to everyone _ especially
the members of Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   The five young musicians, who recorded their award-winning debut
album on a shoestring in bedrooms and garages over the space of a
year, don't produce the Brit-centric pop of fellow nominees like
Pulp, Massive Attack and the Verve.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gomez is steeped in Americana, proudly pointing to such
landmark acts as Little Feat, the Band, Dr. John and Captain
Beefheart as signposts on the way to developing a unique sound.
</P>
<P>
   Tunes from Gomez's hard-to-pigeonhole album, ``Bring It On''
(Virgin), include ``Tijuana Lady,'' which could be an Eagles
outtake, and ``Free to Run,'' which late Little Feat leader Lowell
George would've been happy to call his own. The surreal-sounding
first single, ``78 Stone Wobble,'' recalls Beck.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very American feel to the record,'' admits Gomez
singer-keyboardist Tom Gray. ``It's almost exclusively American
music we listen to. But bands coming along and experimenting with
American music because they love it is a constant theme in British
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez _ the name was borrowed from the last name of a friend _
appears Saturday with Eagle-Eye Cherry at the El Rey Theatre in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were five guys bored with the contemporary music scene in
Britain,'' Gray said this week. ``And that's not a good thing for
five people who are in love with music. We couldn't find what we
wanted, so we went out and did it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The British rock weekly New Musical Express dubbed ``Bring It
On'' one of the most ``assured, poised, hilarious, out-there ...
enjoyable albums in living memory.''
</P>
<P>
   The five guys in Gomez, none of whom is older than 21, came
together two years ago, but at least two members have been friends
since their childhood in Southport, near Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   Holed up in a cold garage, huddled over their amps and tape
console, the group cut ``Bring It On'' before ever performing
onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened very naturally,'' Gray said. ``When we play
together, that's the sound that comes out. The recording was five
friends having fun. It was recorded in bedrooms, garages _ all over
the shop. We had a little old 4-track tape machine that was
half-broken and you had to balance a book on the power supply to
make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   After Gomez signed to Virgin, the tapes were taken to a
full-service studio, where the roughest parts were re-recorded. But
the slightly murky lo-fi quality adds to the disc's warm, bluesy
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs have always been the basis of Gomez,'' Gray said. ``We
love songs. I mean, we like to play with the structures, but I
think the most important medium in music is the song. Five years
ago, when the dance scene was at its height, people were saying
songs don't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today, even dance music has gotten very song-oriented.
That's because the song is too strong culturally. It means too much
to too many people. There's nothing better than a great song.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody picked ``Bring It On'' to bag the Mercury Prize. Among
the 12 competing albums were acclaimed efforts from such
top-selling acts as the Verve, Massive Attack, Portishead, Robbie
Williams, Asian Dub Foundation and Cornershop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just felt fantastic,'' Gray recalled. ``We weren't
expecting it. A lot of the people who work around us were willing
us to win, but certainly it came as a huge shock. It's difficult to
quantify what an award means to anyone. But it sure felt nice. This
was an album we made in our spare time for the love of it.''

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One summer weekend two years ago, America's newspapers and talk
shows shared a jolly laugh at the expense of Hillary Clinton. A new
book claimed that the first lady had communicated, through a spirit
medium, with the dead Eleanor Roosevelt; and the image of this
super-rational lawyer resorting to psychic comfort was cruelly
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The following Monday, Mrs. Clinton was due to appear in public
for the first time since her humiliation, to address a conference
in Nashville. The audience waited, cringing on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Then a beaming figure appeared upon the stage. ``This conference
is a terrific way of bringing together people,'' she purred; ``I
had one of my conversations with Mrs. Roosevelt, and she thinks
this is a terrific idea as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists and conference-goers dissolved into laughter, and
any lingering psychic embarrassment was instantly forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, save perhaps her husband, shrugs off public humiliation
as elegantly as Mrs. Clinton. Time and again since she drove down
to Arkansas to manage her future husband's 1974 congressional
campaign, she has had to confront allegations of his infidelity:
with Gennifer Flowers and Paula Jones; with a host of
long-forgotten names; and now with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again she has done more than merely stick with him; she
has defended him. Had she done otherwise, Bill Clinton might never
have reached the White House; had she denounced him over the
Lewinsky affair, his career might now be over.
</P>
<P>
   Future historians will remember the current scandal in many
ways: for the president's childish squandering of huge political
talents, for the obsessive inquisition conducted by Ken Starr, for
the disturbing influence of Internet-borne leaks, for the gap
between the chattering classes and the public. But future
biographers will focus on America's remarkable first lady.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Flowers sold her story of a 12-year affair with
candidate Clinton to a supermarket tabloid, Mrs. Clinton dismissed
the whole business as ``trash for cash,'' and compared rumors about
her husband's sex life to UFO sightings.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Jones sued President Clinton for sexual harassment,
Mrs. Clinton advised him to settle out of court, despite the
humiliation that would follow from her husband's implied admission
of infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lewinsky story surfaced in January, some thought this
would be the last straw: they worried that Mrs. Clinton would march
out, destroying her husband both emotionally and politically. But
Mrs. Clinton stuck by him again, blaming the allegations on a
``vast right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, even though the worst Lewinsky rumors have proved true,
Mrs. Clinton is still there, loudly defending her husband's record.
</P>
<P>
   This would be remarkable enough. But Mrs. Clinton does all this
without asking anyone for sympathy. She refuses to discuss her
feelings; indeed, she reveals nothing of herself whatever. On a
recent money-raising campaign swing, she assured anybody
impertinent enough to ask that she was ``Just fine!''
</P>
<P>
   Even officials who have worked with her for years seem mystified
by her. One White House aide, no great Hillary fan, recalls a
tete-a-tete with the first lady at a particularly bad moment in the
Lewinsky saga. Throughout lunch she was ``completely calm, chatting
about life.''
</P>
<P>
   Her self-control, her knack of sweeping problems into some
corner-cabinet of her mind, is even more amazing than her
husband's.
</P>
<P>
   Through all this, moreover, she manages to be popular. She
exudes as much empathy as a management consultant with flu; she is
the most ruthless of her husband's spin doctors; she has, in short,
the qualities that would doom most public figures.
</P>
<P>
   But she has recently become the most popular speaker at
Democratic fund-raising events. According to one recent poll, 54
percent of men see her as a good role model, and 66 percent of
women feel that way about her.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that Mrs. Clinton was especially popular among
career women who identified with this lawyer-mum, but less so among
housewives. Now the polls suggest that non-career women are Mrs.
Clinton's keenest supporters.
</P>
<P>
   There is a message in this popularity, and it is not the one
that seems most obvious. It would be tempting to conclude that Mrs.
Clinton's image-makers have successfully disguised her ambitious
side, conning Middle America into identifying with her. Over the
years, Mrs. Clinton has forsaken frizzy brown hair in favor of soft
blonde locks; she has traded nerdish spectacles for contact lenses;
she has even boasted about her low-fat cookie recipe. After a bad
spell as a front-line wonk, leading her husband's failed effort to
reform health care, she has retreated to safely feminine issues
like children.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite this careful repositioning of her brand, it
would be wrong to think that Americans have been taken in. They do
not see her as a traditional wife, standing meekly by an abusive
man. On the contrary, 48 percent of Americans view the Clintons'
marriage as a practical career relationship; and, because of this,
56 percent expect her to divorce Bill Clinton when he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Americans see Mrs. Clinton for what she is: a
laser-brained careerist, who met her future husband in the Yale law
library and has propelled him, not always scrupulously, to the
White House. They are prepared to believe that she skirted the law
in a property deal known as Whitewater; they may not entirely
dismiss the extreme view, put about in recent days, that she
defends her husband because she needs a presidential pardon to save
her from indictment. And yet, seeing her this way, a majority of
Americans remain fond of her.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom holds that politicians must be packaged
as feeling family types, rather than thick-skinned, sharp-elbowed
machines dedicated to self-advancement. But America thrives on a
healthy respect for ambition, even in its raw extremes. It would be
a lesser place if it did not admire the amazing Mrs. Clinton.

`THE GLOBE SESSIONS' SOMETHING TO CROW ABOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
SHERYL CROW/``The Globe Sessions'' (A&AMP;M)
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the title suggests, Crow's self-produced third effort has a
raw, blow-by-blow feel best realized on the disc's atmospheric
finale, ``Crash and Burn.'' Those expecting the supremely catchy
upbeat-ness of her previous albums should plan to let this one sink
in a bit. Crow is in a moody mood on many of these tracks, but the
material grows on you. Standouts include ``My Favorite Mistake,''
the lost Bob Dylan gem ``Mississippi,'' ``There Goes the
Neighborhood'' and the poetic ``Riverwide.'' Stones fans will
recognize Bobby Keys on sax, while Tom Petty hand Benmont Tench
tinkles the piano and Lisa Germano adds violin. In case you're
wondering, ``Anything But Down'' is not the first song ever written
about an elevator. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ELVIS COSTELLO With Burt Bacharach/``Painted From Memory''
(Mercury)
</P>
<P>
   This concept may have been better in theory than practice. The
pairing of Costello and Bacharach already had produced one winning
track _ the 1996 ``Grace of My Heart'' soundtrack tune ``God Give
Me Strength'' _ when the two pop geniuses decided to stretch the
collaboration out for an entire album. Bacharach immediately
channels his late '60s glory days by bringing in the female backup
chorus, the oodles of sweet strings and sharp acoustic piano, but
Costello is pushing himself beyond all reason. His singing often
sounds studied and forced, as if the tunes were beyond his comfort
range. Despite the clever arrangements and fine musicianship,
there's a surprising lack of memorable melodies here. 2 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOOTIE &AMP; THE BLOWFISH:/``Musical Chairs'' (Atlantic)
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to dredge up anything to hate about old Hootie. On the
other hand, it's difficult to drum up much excitement about the
band either. On the band's third major label release, the South
Carolina quartet puts forth confidence and muscle even while
churning out a pretty convincing bluegrass cut. The star of the
show, as usual, is r&AMP;b-tinged crooner Darius Rucker, whose soulful
approach helps sell so-so material like ``Michele Post,'' ``Las
Vegas Nights'' and radio-ready album-opener ``I Will Wait.'' 2
Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
LEE ANN WOMACK/``Some Things I Know'' (Decca)
</P>
<P>
   If you long for the days before country went Canadian, check out
the sophomore effort from chanteuse Womack, whose instinctive grasp
of phrasing connects with the listener. She's at her best on such
heartbreak ballads as ``A Little Past Little Rock,'' ``The Man Who
Made My Mama Cry'' and ``I Keep Forgetting,'' but best of all is
the dark and dreamy ``The Preacher Won't Have to Lie.'' A
supporting cast of Nashville's best and brightest adds to the fun.
3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHRIS ISAAK/``Speak of the Devil'' (Reprise)
</P>
<P>
   This velvet-throated king of lonely hearts knows what side his
bread is buttered on. And don't think for one minute he's going to
start playing in major keys just because he collaborated with
top-40 mainstay Diane Warren on one cut. For the just-released
``Speak of the Devil,'' Isaak and band Silvertone remain firmly in
that familiar post-Orbison downcast groove. The Warren-Isaak cut,
``Breaking Apart,'' might win some new fans, but the soul of this
record is in such material as ``Walk Slow,'' ``Black Flowers'' and
the strong title track. 2 { Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JUDE/``No One Is Really Beautiful'' (Maverick)
</P>
<P>
   The glossy well-produced sheen on this much-talked-about debut
from 28-year-old Michael Jude Christodal doesn't detract from the
generally despondent tone of this collection of witty originals.
Owner of a distinctive vocal sound and taste for high-wire
wordplay, Jude delivers intimacies on ``I'm Sorry Now'' as well the
super-freaky on the straight-to-radio ``Rick James.'' Strong backup
work from L.A. session mafia. Think Elliott Smith, except with
tunes. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JOHN WILLIAMS/``The Guitarist'' (Sony Classical)
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the overly familiar classical or romantic guitar
repertoire, virtuoso Williams instead blends the textures and
harmonies of Eastern Mediterranean music with the rhythm and
character of music from the medieval era. Even the classical pieces
here are unusual _ arrangements for guitar and chamber orchestra
and solo transcriptions of piano pieces by French composer Satie _
plus originals and works by Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis are a
delight. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FRANK SINATRA/``Songs for Young Lovers/Swing Easy,'' ``Songs for
Swingin' Lovers,'' ``A Swingin' Affair'' and ``Come Fly With Me''
(Capitol)
</P>
<P>
   Want to know what all the hub-bub about Frank Sinatra is about?
The four latest Sinatra reissues from Capitol wouldn't be a bad
place to start. The albums, recorded from 1953 to 1958, represent
the singer at his expressive best and continue the wonderful
remastering work Capitol and Reprise have performed on his
wide-ranging catalog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs For Young Lovers/Swing Easy'' (4 Stars) were Sinatra's
first albums with Nelson Riddle, the masterful arranger who helped
the Chairman redefine his sound after losing his way, not to
mention his recording contract. These two eight-song sets,
collected together on one CD, set the template for Sinatra's
Capitol years with their exquisite mixtures of swing, jazz and
ballads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs For Swingin' Lovers'' (4 Stars) is probably the best
album Sinatra ever recorded, although that's like saying blue is
the most beautiful color God created. (How do you choose?) But
``Swingin' Lovers,'' made in 1956, perfectly captures the
sophisticated swing Sinatra and Riddle had been honing on previous
records. It's a work that really is too marvelous for words.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Swingin' Affair,'' (4 Stars) which followed ``Songs for
Swingin' Lovers'' by a year, is a perfect sequel, another 15 love
songs about the joys and sorrows of love, this time including more
of a psychological bent. His straightforward rendition of Duke
Ellington's ``I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good'' is pure
confessional heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come Fly With Me'' (4 Stars) has Sinatra joining forces this
time with arranger Billy May in a loose, boisterous album that
takes them around the world for classics like ``Moonlight in
Vermont'' and the title track. The album bounces between beautiful
ballads (``Vermont,'' ``April in Paris'') and rollicking numbers
(``On the Road to Mandalay''), a perfect synthesis of Sinatra's
genius.
</P>
<P>
   We can't wait for the next round of reissues.

`DREAMS' IS ITS OWN HELL TO ENDURE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Here's what's wrong with giant movie screens: You can
fill them with extreme close-ups of Robin Williams' face.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can imply that this is what heaven's like: spending
eternity looking at giant close-ups of Robin Williams' face as he
weeps and moans and emotes in such a soppy fashion that he could
make a chorus of angels want to fwo up. (CQ)
</P>
<P>
   The last time Williams ventured from his safe ground of comedy
into metaphysical histrionics, he made the worst film of his
career, ``Being Human.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, with ``What Dreams May Come,'' he only makes the
second worst.
</P>
<P>
   Williams plays Chris, whose entire life is dispensed with in the
opening credits, when he is whisked from being a young man who
meets cute Annie (Annabella Sciorra), marries her, has a successful
career and two kids, has them die, then dies himself.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now the movie can begin, as Chris is led on a tour of the
afterlife by an angelic guide (Cuba Gooding Jr.).
</P>
<P>
   Chris' heaven is a place where you can create anything you can
dream up. So, what do people dream up? In this heaven, they float
upside down a lot, dress up like rich people from Victorian
England, ride old-fashioned bicycles and walk around holding tennis
rackets.
</P>
<P>
   But not Chris. He can't stop mourning for the soulmate he left
behind. When Annie commits suicide, she goes to a hell she can't
escape from because ``suicides don't realize they're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't stop Chris, who determines to rescue her from hell,
even though other ex-people tell him that can't be done, even
though they also tell him there are no rules.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe no one can make a really good metaphysical film about
heaven and hell. Certainly, director Vincent Ward can't.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, who made the wonderfully poetic ``Map of the Human
Heart,'' slips into maudlin melodrama with this vision of the
afterlife as something created in negotiations between Peter Pan
and Dante.
</P>
<P>
   Ward is aided in his visions by screenwriter Ron Bass, one of
the best writers in Hollywood. Or maybe it was some other Ron Bass
who wrote ``Rain Man,'' ``Waiting to Exhale,'' ``Dangerous Minds''
and ``My Best Friend's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say which Bass and Ward got worse: the attempts at
cute romantic repartee to establish the deep love between Chris and
Annie (he likes to buy her meatball subs and thanks her for all the
arguments they've had together) or the deep philosophical
ruminations (``God is somewhere up there shouting that he loves us
and wodering why we don't hear him?'').
</P>
<P>
   You may cringe with embarrassment for creative people who are
incapable of cringing with embarrassment for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The first rule for dealing with metaphysics without looking
stupid should be: Don't put Robin Williams in your movie. He
appears to be made of spun sugar and sludge. Who can buy into a
deep romance where Sciorra (``Cop Land'') is glumly serious, while
Williams is walking smarm?
</P>
<P>
   Ward's visions of the afterlife provide the film's sole
redemption, ranging from Monetlike impressionistic gardens to
something that looks like the Bronx on a bad hereafter day. Some
people will be relieved to know that old dogs go to heaven, but
spiders go to hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dreams May Come'' is so incessantly treacly and morose
that it's strictly for people who felt that there just weren't
enough violins in ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dreams May Come'' is misrated at PG-13. It contains
enough profanity and flashes of nudity to have earned an R. 2
stars. &QL;

OCTOBER IS MONTH FOR DOCUMENTARIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For those who couldn't pass up the critically
acclaimed documentary ``The Farmer's Wife'' last month on KCET,
there is more of that gritty, emotional realism ahead this month in
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of luckless Nebraska farmers, substitute
down-on-their-luck clowns on a pathetic road trip in ``Circus
Redickuless'' _ without a doubt the most curious documentary
subject of DOCtober, starting tonight at the State Theatre in
Pasadena. In all, 13 films are included in this second annual
weeklong event sponsored by the International Documentary
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Other intriguing topics include the women of the Black Panthers,
a widow's return to Vietnam to heal her emotional loss and a look
at the making of ``Kundun.''
</P>
<P>
   DOCtober originated in 1997 so the viewing public could see the
latest efforts by reality-based filmmakers. Three films from last
year's festival were nominated for Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Glau's film, ``Circus Redickuless,'' about a ragtag
circus of losers headed by a man named Chicken John, has been
recommended for Oscar consideration by IDA. Chicken John invites 17
friends and acquaintances with nothing better to do to join his
traveling show, which takes them all on a miserable journey of
canceled shows, broken-down vans, Dumpster diving and abysmal
hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Revolutionaries,'' by Sienna McLean, listens to two
women who participated in the '60s struggle for change waged by the
Black Panthers. In ``Regret to Inform,'' director Barbara Sonneborn
realized she has never gotten over her husband's death in the war,
so she contacts other widows to recount their experiences and loss.
``In Search of Kundun'' is Martin Scorsese's encounter with the
Tibetan people and the Dalai Lama during the making of the film
``Kundun.'' Directed by Michael Henry Wilson, the documentary
raises questions about spirituality in the modern world and how to
pursue it.
</P>
<P>
   The themes of brutality and violence are taken up in several
submissions, starting with ``The Last Days,'' directed by James
Moll and presented by Steven Spielberg. It follows five Hungarian
Holocaust survivors of the brutal Nazi occupation of their
homeland. In a germane tangent, ``Human Remains'' looks at the
personal lives of men who _ for worse _ changed the course of
20th-century history. ``Thug Life in D.C.'' is a collection of
stories told by prison inmates that sum up the bleak experiences
and futures for young African-American men.
</P>
<P>
   All films will be screened daily at the historic State Theatre,
770 E. Colorado Blvd. Call (626) 792-3540 for program information.
Tickets cost $6 per film or $20 for a festival pass. Tickets may be
purchased through Ticketmaster by calling (213) 480-3232 or (805)
583-8700.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Laemmle's Grande 4-Plex in downtown Los Angeles
continues its ``Documentary Days'' series tonight with a weeklong
screening of ``Biker Dreams.'' This examination of the
Harley-Davidson subculture is ``a memorable portrait of people who
have found community, independence and the road to their dreams
straddling a motorcycle.'' It takes place at the annual Black Hills
Motorcycle Classic that draws 25,000 bikers from all strata of
society _ from bankers to outlaws _ to Sturges, S.D., to share
their mutual passion for bikes.
</P>
<P>
   The theater is at 345 S. Figueroa St. Tickets cost $6.50, and
validated parking is available across the street at the World Trade
Center. Call (213) 617-0268 for information.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the UCLA campus, the annual showcase of feature-length
and short documentaries gets under way Tuesday night at the James
Bridges Theatre on the UCLA campus. Admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   An 8-year-old guitar prodigy, Julian Lage, is the compelling
subject of ``Jules at Eight,'' screening at 7:30 p.m. Spike Lee's
Oscar-nominated ``4 Little Girls'' about a Birmingham, Ala., church
bombing in 1963 that claimed four girls' lives and had
ramifications for the city and nation as well.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998-99 Contemporary Documentary Series runs through March
and is presented by the Academy Foundation of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences and UCLA Film and Television Archive.
Call (310) 206-3456 for future screenings.
</P>
<P>
   The series picks up Oct. 13 with gay-themed ``Paul Monette: The
Brink of Summer's End'' and ``Stolen Moments.'' The former film
looks at the writer who chronicled the effects of AIDS, including
his own illness, at the end of his life. ``Stolen Moments''
spotlights lesbianism in Europe and North America and points to the
sense of community lesbians have established at various points and
places.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, the International Documentary Congress at the
academy in Beverly Hills opens with ``Docs Rocks,'' a collection of
some of the most memorable nonfiction films about rock 'n' roll
performers and their music. The three-day assembly of
documentarians convenes Oct. 28-30 and includes a screening of
``Docs That Shook the World'' and a screening of ``Everest'' at the
IMAX Theatre at the California Science Center at Exposition Park.
Registration is open to the public; call (310) 247-3000, Ext. 176,
for information.

POKING FUN AT BORDER RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Local singer-songwriter Rebekah Florence proves
subtle wit and country music can co-exist.
</P>
<P>
   On her second self-produced album, ``Mexican Prozak''
(UnderStress Records), Florence sings of a trip across the border
to buy foreign-made pharmaceuticals and, in the song ``Chris
Douridas,'' of trying to attract the attention of the former music
director at influential public-radio station KCRW-FM (89.9).
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people thought `Mexican Prozak' was an attempt to make
fun of country music but it was really a tribute to country music
and some of my favorite artists, like Lucinda Williams and Emmylou
Harris,'' the Santa Monica-based Florence said.
</P>
<P>
   Florence, who has opened for Harris, next appears Oct. 27 at
Genghis Cohen in West Hollywood with multi-instrumentalist Jinsoo,
who plays on the album.
</P>
<P>
   The song ``Chris Douridas'' was written when the ex-DJ was slow
to include Florence's first disc, ``Please Yourself,'' on KCRW's
popular ``Morning Becomes Eclectic'' program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a political ax to grind with Chris, only a
personal one,'' said Florence, who is in her early 30s. ``It was
making fun of myself for making someone so important. That's what
the song is about. It's like being a spurned lover except I was
spurned by this DJ.''
</P>
<P>
   The track includes such rhymes as: ``I'd ride to London on the
back of a cheetah/Wearing a pair of high-top Adidas/ Promise not to
use the word elitist/If I could just get a little attention from
Chris Douridas.''
</P>
<P>
   Douridas left KCRW earlier this year to take a job at DreamWorks
Records and was replaced by Nic Harcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of weeks before Chris left, I did begin to get
airplay at the station,'' Florence said.
</P>
<P>
   CHEAP TRICK: &UR;  &LR; In one of the oddest touring concepts yet, '70s
and '80s hitmakers Cheap Trick will revive entire albums in
sequence tonight and Saturday at the House of Blues.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago pop-rockers tonight perform the 1977 disc ``In
Color,'' which included the studio version of the group's first top
10 hit, ``I Want You to Want Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at the West Hollywood club, the band will reprise its
``Heaven Tonight'' album, which featured the hit ``Surrender'' and
a cover version of the Move's ``California Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the recent repackaging of the band's first three
albums, Cheap Trick's drummer, Bun E. Carlos, declared the music
somehow timely.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what was recorded by other groups in 1978 doesn't
hold up this well,'' he crowed. ``Nothing was so trendy that it
sounds dated.''
</P>
<P>
   `SGT. PEPPER' FAVE: The Beatles' ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band'' topped Web site Wall of Sound's top 100 albums poll
this week. The survey asked users to vote for their 10 favorite
albums from each of the last four decades. The results were
combined to create the final list. More than 25,000 users
responded.

TRUST NO ONE IN `THE SPANISH PRISONER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Leave it to David Mamet to make a game of it _ a
confidence game, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright/screen writer/director takes pleasure in setting
his stories in the world of con men and high-price scams. His
latest film, ``The Spanish Prisoner'' (Columbia TriStar), which is
out on video this week, is reminiscent of his first film, ``House
of Games'' (1987) with its complex psychological twists, surprising
plot turns and sharp dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The mantra in any Mamet script is ``Don't trust people _ they're
not always who they seem to be,'' and that's what keeps you
guessing right up until the end in ``Prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's title comes from an age-old con. A man tells a
wealthy man whom he has befriended that his beautiful sister is
being held prisoner back in his home country. He produces pictures
and other documents to prove he's not lying, and then asks for a
loan to pay her ransom. In return, he says, he will bring his
sister back to marry the wealthy man. There is no sister, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Prisoner'' the con revolves around a formula that Joe Ross
(Campbell Scott) has discovered that is supposed to make his
company, headed by Klein (Ben Gazzara), a lot of money. Don't worry
about what the formula is because it's a McGuffin _ Hitchcock's
term for a plot device that gets the action in motion. On a
business trip to the Caribbean, Ross meets a mysterious
businessman, Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin), who asks him to deliver a
package to his sister in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   After some comments by a company assistant (Rebecca Pidgeon)
along for the trip, Ross begins to doubt that Dell is who he says.
His colleague (actor/sleight-of-hand artist Ricky Jay) tells him
that ``worry is like interest paid in advance on a debt that never
comes due'' _ an example of clever Mamet dialogue. But it soon
becomes evident that Ross should be worried as the scam unfolds.
The question is who's involved.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet makes his moves like a chess master as the story reveals
itself. But if it was all sleight-of-hand, then Mamet (the author
of ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' ``American Buffalo'') would be minor
leaguer. What ratchets up his dramas are the ever-shifting roles
his characters play, and ultimately that's what the stories are
about. For in Mamet's world, people's characters are the illusions,
and what we think we know about someone is as apt to disappear as
quickly as a coin from a magician's hand.
</P>
<P>
   After a while it all seems like tricks, and we're left with the
questions: What's real? How much do we really know? But in the
meantime, like any good magician, Mamet is diverting your
attention. This time with an enjoyable film.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE ADULTS: There are a few other new videos worth checking
out. Vanessa Redgrave gives a masterful performance in ``Mrs.
Dalloway'' (BMG) that, it is hoped, will be remembered at Oscar
time. The adaptation of the Virginia Woolf novel about Clarissa
(Redgrave), a London society matron, who reflects on the choices
and missed opportunities of her life is quite elegant, though a bit
stifling. Directed by Marleen Gorris (``Antonia's Line,'' the 1995
Oscar-winning foreign language film) it also stars Natascha
McElhone as the young Clarissa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Girls and a Guy'' (Fox) is one of those claustrophobic
productions that has you yearning for the wide open spaces by the
end. Starring Robert Downey Jr. as a two-timing actor who finds
himself surprised one day at his New York City apartment (where all
the action takes place) by the two women he's dating, Heather
Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner. Although director James Toback's
script has its moments and Downey and Graham give terrific
performances, this menage a trois lacks heat. Still, it probably
plays better on video than it did in the theaters. By the way,
there is also an NC-17 version available, but you'll have to find
out how much hotter it is.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE KIDS: If you're looking for a fun family film that
adults can sit through, try ``Paulie'' (DreamWorks). It's the story
of a sharp-tongued parrot who is the pet and friend of a little
girl who stutters. When Paulie is banished by her family, who don't
know the bird talks, he ends up across the country where he begin
his odyssey back home. Told with good humor and warmth, ``Paulie''
is a winner for families.
</P>
<P>
   `X-FILES' UPDATE: According to Fox, the video of the ``The
X-Files'' movie (Oct. 13) will include new footage that will answer
one of the long-standing questions of the series (you'll have to
watch to find out what). The video also features exclusive
interviews with producer/creator Chris Carter and actress Gillian
Anderson.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder is an ordinary man and, by electing him
chancellor, Germany has shown itself to be an ordinary country. A
banality? In other countries, ordinariness is not usually an issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany, so traumatized by history, has never before dared
to behave quite like other countries, and has always chosen leaders
who see the future through the prism of the awful past.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder will be different, and so will Germany be.
</P>
<P>
   He is the first German chancellor to carry no guilt-inducing
memory of World War II. He will be the first postwar chancellor to
hold office in Berlin, presiding over a Germany that will look
almost as much to Central Europe as it has, till recently, cast its
approval-seeking gaze across the Rhine to France.
</P>
<P>
   He is a business-friendly, barely left-leaning Protestant from
Hanover, in northern Germany, whose instincts draw him not just to
Paris and Rome but also to London, even to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He has a beautiful fourth wife, once a journalist on a tabloid
newspaper, and he seems unabashed about his three divorces.
</P>
<P>
   For making Germans feel relaxed enough to elect such a
thoroughly modern fellow, give thanks to Helmut Kohl, Schroeder's
ejected predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has been a great, generous and generally good man to have
at the head of Europe's biggest, and the world's third-biggest,
economic power for 16 years. His sincerity as peace-maker and
democrat is undoubted. His courageous leadership saw NATO's
missiles deployed, in the teeth of Soviet and much western
opposition, in West Germany in the last great confrontation of the
cold war. It enabled a nervous nation to seize the chance to unify
itself in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He had the determination -- wise or foolish, time will tell --
to drag an unwilling people into a single European currency to
further his desire to integrate a continent more tightly in the
interest, as he saw it, of peace.
</P>
<P>
   He was not infallible. He concentrated too much on European
designs. German unification proved expensive. Unemployment rose to
dreadful levels.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Kohl failed to modernize a corpulent economy when the
going was good. But, tired and passe as he had become, he finished
the task that his predecessors had started, of making Germany a
normal country. He paved the way for Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Many doubts attend the new chancellor. What does he really stand
for?
</P>
<P>
   After presenting himself at the start of the campaign as a
modernizer wedded to a ``new center,'' he edged leftward to curry
favor with blue-collar workers, pensioners, the unemployed and the
aggrieved of the ex-communist east. He said he would roll back some
of the outgoing government's tepid but sensible reforms to shave
welfare, ease hiring and firing, and cut taxes. But mostly he
remained vague.
</P>
<P>
   That may have been tactically wise. He did not want to upset too
many voters, calculating correctly that he could win by coming
across as youthful (at 54), flexible and above all fresh.
</P>
<P>
   But it has left onlookers uncertain as to what he believes in,
and how he will now act.
</P>
<P>
   First, he must set up a coherent and plausible team of
ministers. He has attractive, lively-looking candidates for some
posts -- a computer entrepreneur, Jost Stollmann, to take charge of
the economy, Walter Riester, a forward-looking trade unionist, to
deal with labor, Michael Naumann, a civilized publisher, for the
arts. But his hand is not wholly free.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he is obliged to give the Greens, his chosen
partners in coalition, some important jobs. The Greens' leader,
Joschka Fischer, is serious and mostly sensible. But, egged on by
their woollier elements, the Greens have some pretty silly ideas --
for instance, for tripling gasoline prices -- that they have only
recently and reluctantly shelved.
</P>
<P>
   Many Greens remain hostile to NATO, not to mention the idea that
Germany should play a bigger part in peace-keeping abroad. The
leadership has moderated its stance, but a Green foreign minister,
as has been suggested, would give some cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, there is Oskar Lafontaine. The doyen of the
party's socialist old guard, Lafontaine is much less of a
modernizer than Schroeder, and is far less keen to reform Germany's
increasingly unaffordable social-security system. Yet he commands
great support within his party and will plainly exercise much
influence, perhaps as finance minister. Schroeder will have a hard
job preventing him from tearing the heart out of any radical labor
and welfare reforms that the chancellor seeks to make.
</P>
<P>
   The hope must be that, now that his electoral victory is won,
Schroeder will become bolder -- if need be, beating back the more
foolish ideas of the reds and Greens with threats of seeking help
from the Christian and Free Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As yet there is no reason for other countries to fear a
Schroeder administration, even if its assessment of Germany's
national interests may be more jarring to its neighbors than Kohl's
used to be. That, after all, will be evidence of normality.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder will not apologize for putting Germany first. In the
European Union, he may fight Germany's corner more obviously than
Kohl did. He might also make a bigger effort to strengthen
Germany's links beyond its special friendship with France -- to the
east, to Britain, even to America.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, would bespeak a new German attitude to the world. It
should not be feared. It is welcome. Long may Germany be boring.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder is an ordinary man and, by electing him
chancellor, Germany has shown itself to be an ordinary country. A
banality? In other countries, ordinariness is not usually an issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany, so traumatized by history, has never before dared
to behave quite like other countries, and has always chosen leaders
who see the future through the prism of the awful past.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder will be different, and so will Germany be.
</P>
<P>
   He is the first German chancellor to carry no guilt-inducing
memory of World War II. He will be the first postwar chancellor to
hold office in Berlin, presiding over a Germany that will look
almost as much to Central Europe as it has, till recently, cast its
approval-seeking gaze across the Rhine to France.
</P>
<P>
   He is a business-friendly, barely left-leaning Protestant from
Hanover, in northern Germany, whose instincts draw him not just to
Paris and Rome but also to London, even to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He has a beautiful fourth wife, once a journalist on a tabloid
newspaper, and he seems unabashed about his three divorces.
</P>
<P>
   For making Germans feel relaxed enough to elect such a
thoroughly modern fellow, give thanks to Helmut Kohl, Schroeder's
ejected predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has been a great, generous and generally good man to have
at the head of Europe's biggest, and the world's third-biggest,
economic power for 16 years. His sincerity as peace-maker and
democrat is undoubted. His courageous leadership saw NATO's
missiles deployed, in the teeth of Soviet and much western
opposition, in West Germany in the last great confrontation of the
cold war. It enabled a nervous nation to seize the chance to unify
itself in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He had the determination -- wise or foolish, time will tell --
to drag an unwilling people into a single European currency to
further his desire to integrate a continent more tightly in the
interest, as he saw it, of peace.
</P>
<P>
   He was not infallible. He concentrated too much on European
designs. German unification proved expensive. Unemployment rose to
dreadful levels.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Kohl failed to modernize a corpulent economy when the
going was good. But, tired and passe as he had become, he finished
the task that his predecessors had started, of making Germany a
normal country. He paved the way for Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Many doubts attend the new chancellor. What does he really stand
for?
</P>
<P>
   After presenting himself at the start of the campaign as a
modernizer wedded to a ``new center,'' he edged leftward to curry
favor with blue-collar workers, pensioners, the unemployed and the
aggrieved of the ex-communist east. He said he would roll back some
of the outgoing government's tepid but sensible reforms to shave
welfare, ease hiring and firing, and cut taxes. But mostly he
remained vague.
</P>
<P>
   That may have been tactically wise. He did not want to upset too
many voters, calculating correctly that he could win by coming
across as youthful (at 54), flexible and above all fresh.
</P>
<P>
   But it has left onlookers uncertain as to what he believes in,
and how he will now act.
</P>
<P>
   First, he must set up a coherent and plausible team of
ministers. He has attractive, lively-looking candidates for some
posts -- a computer entrepreneur, Jost Stollmann, to take charge of
the economy, Walter Riester, a forward-looking trade unionist, to
deal with labor, Michael Naumann, a civilized publisher, for the
arts. But his hand is not wholly free.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he is obliged to give the Greens, his chosen
partners in coalition, some important jobs. The Greens' leader,
Joschka Fischer, is serious and mostly sensible. But, egged on by
their woollier elements, the Greens have some pretty silly ideas --
for instance, for tripling gasoline prices -- that they have only
recently and reluctantly shelved.
</P>
<P>
   Many Greens remain hostile to NATO, not to mention the idea that
Germany should play a bigger part in peace-keeping abroad. The
leadership has moderated its stance, but a Green foreign minister,
as has been suggested, would give some cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, there is Oskar Lafontaine. The doyen of the
party's socialist old guard, Lafontaine is much less of a
modernizer than Schroeder, and is far less keen to reform Germany's
increasingly unaffordable social-security system. Yet he commands
great support within his party and will plainly exercise much
influence, perhaps as finance minister. Schroeder will have a hard
job preventing him from tearing the heart out of any radical labor
and welfare reforms that the chancellor seeks to make.
</P>
<P>
   The hope must be that, now that his electoral victory is won,
Schroeder will become bolder -- if need be, beating back the more
foolish ideas of the reds and Greens with threats of seeking help
from the Christian and Free Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As yet there is no reason for other countries to fear a
Schroeder administration, even if its assessment of Germany's
national interests may be more jarring to its neighbors than Kohl's
used to be. That, after all, will be evidence of normality.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder will not apologize for putting Germany first. In the
European Union, he may fight Germany's corner more obviously than
Kohl did. He might also make a bigger effort to strengthen
Germany's links beyond its special friendship with France -- to the
east, to Britain, even to America.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, would bespeak a new German attitude to the world. It
should not be feared. It is welcome. Long may Germany be boring.

<P>
   You have to squint a little bit and get kind of a gravelly roll
in your throat, as if you're on the verge of a cold.
</P>
<P>
   Your voice should be soft but clear. Then you twang it up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can work on the hand gesture. It's almost as if you're
holding an imaginary remote control, your thumb poised to click at
any moment _ but you work your arm up and down, as if you're a
priest dispensing incense.
</P>
<P>
   But you're no priest. You're Billy Clinton!
</P>
<P>
   You too can imitate the president. Go ahead and give it a try,
using the directions outlined above.
</P>
<P>
   Not sure what to say? Come on, you know all the familiar
catchprases:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building a bridge to the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel your pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I want you to listen to me. I did not have sex with that
woman, Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Very good! Welcome to the club. You're now one of the 50 million
people in the United States who has attempted a Bill Clinton
impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   With his distinctive voice, his undeniable charisma, his easily
lampooned sexual appetites and his ubiquitous presence on TV,
President Clinton is a dream chief executive for every professional
and amateur comedian who looks to the White House as a source for
humor. He is probably the most imitated human being in history.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody on the radio imitates Clinton; on any given morning,
there must be at least 500 heavyset guys in satin jackets who are
doing Clinton in a skit featuring the newsman as Ken Starr and the
perky sidekick as Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Even Howard Stern, who rarely bothers to attempt more than a
half-hearted attempt to duplicate a celebrity's vocal mannerisms
(his O.J. just sounds like Amos and Andy), has developed a dead-on
Clinton imitation in recent months. It's brilliant, and you can
tell Howard is surprised and thrilled with his impersonation every
time he trots it out.
</P>
<P>
   But Stern is not the King of All Clinton Imitators. That title
belongs to Darrell Hammond, who is sort of the heir to Phil Hartman
_ a bland-looking white guy who can slip into dozens of characters
with smooth comedic finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Hammond's triumph is that he sort of looks like Clinton.
Unlike other presidential imitators on ``SNL'' who had to be
heavily made up to resemble their target, Hammond needs only to put
on a suit and he's good to go.
</P>
<P>
   The key, of course, is the voice _ and Hammond more than any
other comic has captured the deceptively complicated vocal patterns
of the president. A rudimentary impersonation of Clinton is rather
easily attained, but Hammond has spent a lot of time studying the
subtle nuances of Clinton's speech, as well as the almost
evangelical way in which the president romances the camera.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it could be argued that Hammond's Clinton is the best
presidential imitation since Rich Little's take on Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure some vaudevillian did a killer take on Woodrow Wilson,
and no doubt there were radio comics who lampooned FDR's fireside
chats, but as far as I'm concerned the modern era of presidential
impersonations began with JFK duplicate Vaughn Meader.
</P>
<P>
   Meader's 1962 album, ``The First Family,'' reached No. 1 on the
charts and won the Grammy for Album of the Year. Meader's brief
moment in the spotlight happened before my time, but I have heard a
few snippets of ``The First Family.'' He did a pretty good job with
the president's famous voice, but the humor was mild and
affectionate _ downright corny by today's standards. They say
Meader's career died the day the president was assassinated _ but
how much of a career was the guy going to have if he just had the
one trick in his bag?
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson, with a voice as big as Texas and a personality
to match, would seem to have been a perfect subject for
impressionists, but there wasn't any one comic who made a big
splash with an LBJ routine.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but Nixon! With his dark scowl, his habit of shooting his
arms to the sky in a double V salute, his baritone voice and
phrases such as ``Let me make one thing perfectly clear'' and ``I
am not a crook,'' the adult Nixon was juicy fodder for comedians
such as David Frye and Rich Little.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, after Nixon was out of office, Dan Aykroyd
skewered him on ``Saturday Night Live,'' most memorably in a skit
in which he told ``Henry Kissinger'' to get down on his knees and
pray. ``Saturday Night Live'' was also the home of Chevy Chase's
imitation of Gerald Ford, which wasn't really an imitation at all.
The mussy-haired, then-skinny Chase didn't even try to look like
the stocky, bald and much older Mr. Ford - he just fell down
beautifully, in ``tribute'' to Ford's occasional public stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Aykroyd and a number of other comics tried to duplicate Jimmy
Carter's blinding smile and his soft Georgia drawl, but there
wasn't much more to work with. Carter was dull, and so were his
mimics.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan, the first actor-president, was a goldmine. Reagan
was in office for eight years, and he had a unique speaking style
as well as a TelePrompTer filled with memorable sayings, from
``There you go again'' to ``Make my day.'' He was imitated by
dozens of comedians, from Joe Piscopo to Harry Shearer to Randy
Quaid to Phil Hartman. Surprisingly, though, no single comic
emerged as the definitive Reagan imitator of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with George Bush. Dana Carvey owned George Bush. (For
that matter, Carvey also owned Ross Perot _ but oddly enough,
Carvey failed miserably when he attempted to make the transition to
a Clinton imitation.)
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us up to the Clinton era, and the legions of
funnymen and wannabe-comics who just can't resist trotting out
their presidential imitations. Politics aside, when Clinton leaves
he will be missed by those who have duplicated his voice over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   On the presidential horizon: Al Gore, or maybe George W. Bush
(the president's eldest son), or possibly Bill Bradley. Wooden,
boring and tall, in that order. Enjoy the Clinton era while it
lasts.

 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    It was Karl Marx, not Gore Vidal, who said that history repeats
itself _ the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.
 &HT;    But since Vidal has said practically everything else of interest
and wit on the subject, he might as well have said that too.
 &HT;    He has spent a half-century chronicling U.S. history, in the six
linked novels ``Burr,'' ``Lincoln,'' ``1876,'' ``Empire,''
``Hollywood'' and ``Washington, D.C.,'' while also knocking out
thunderous essays, not to mention such hairpin turns as ``Myra
Breckinridge.'' His most recent novel is ``The Smithsonian
Institution.''
 &HT;    One of literature's most caustic and seductive voices, a rich
kid who early on nurtured an acerbic relationship with the spoils
of capitalism, a libertarian's hero but also JFK's intimate _ and
Jackie's brother by marriage _ Gore Vidal has lived an erratically
patriotic life that finally landed him on the Amalfi coast, looking
back at us savages.
 &HT;    What does the future look like from there?
 &HT;    Al Gore is his cousin, which may or may not account for Vidal's
defense of the Internet as an endangered emblem of democracy. Yes,
he has a computer _ and a computer vassal to operate it.
 &HT;

mythological hero. What's the next station in his journey?
 &HT;    GORE VIDAL: ``Mythological'' is the wrong word. He's not a myth
but a dim fact, like the Forbes list of the Truly Rich and
Infamous. The physical sciences _ not the arts and certainly not
philosophy _ are the central fact of the last three centuries.
Interesting that three writers as different as Martin Amis
(``Time's Arrow''), Tom Stoppard (``Arcadia''), and Gore Vidal
should all be writing about physics as fiction, or vice versa.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Can we learn from history?
 &HT;    A: The United States of Amnesia has a very good reason not to
cultivate a sense of the past, as our crimes against so many people
might make us _ not, God forbid, guilty, but jittery living in a
world where we are, contrary to our unrelenting propaganda,
detested.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Is ``progress'' a fiction?
 &HT;    A: Was the invention of cellophane progress? My father brought
some home for me to look at in the '30s. DuPont had introduced it
and no one knew what to do with the stuff. Now human progress, and
some of my new novel, involves slow alterations of a Darwinian
nature, like the withering away of the little toe or the addition
of a third sphere to the brain. Incalculable.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You do take the long view, centuries-long at least.
 &HT;    A: I try to imagine it all from the big whimper on, and that
puts our self-important race in a class with the viruses. I do look
_ hope _ for change, but our short known history of 4,000 years or
so tends to be more of the same, with variable interest rates.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: So how does the ``Digital Revolution'' rate in revolutions
the world has known?
 &HT;    A: Revolution, or evolution, or simply the latest gimmick? A
subject I don't ponder. I still want to know what Iago meant when
he said to Othello, ``What you know, you know.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Lots of people have claimed that a Kennedy White House would
never survive in this age of Internet/media frenzy. You're one of
the few people actually in a position to know.
 &HT;    A: Actually, we always thought JFK would be shot _ by an angry
husband. But he was a cooler character than Bill Clinton and I
suspect would have stared down the enemy. Also, if he had to, he'd
take everyone else with him. He would _ and could _ reveal
everyone's sex life, and then the government would fold. He was the
greatest gossip I've ever known.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What's the biggest thing you've changed your mind about over
the years?
 &HT;    A: I was brought up, like all Americans, to believe that we were
a peace-loving country whose bad luck it was to keep getting roped
into other people's wars. Then, while writing ``Empire,'' I
realized to what extent the Spanish-American War was cold-bloodedly
planned, specifically by the assistant secretary of the Navy,
Theodore Roosevelt and by Admiral Mahan, Cabot Lodge, and Brooks
Adams _ New England grandees with imperial longings. These four,
exactly one century ago, maneuvered us into a war with Spain so
that we could steal the Spanish colonial empire.
 &HT;    Looking again at ``Burr,'' ``Lincoln'' and ``1876,'' I saw there
was something big at the core of these narratives, something that
as an American author I had missed in my own work: that plainly we
are driven to conquest, whether by love of God or by some peculiar
DNA code.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: T., the 13-year-old protagonist of your latest novel, ``The
Smithsonian Institution,'' is your bid to rewrite history, showing
us what might have been an alternative future.
 &HT;    A: Yes, Woodrow Wilson provided us with World War I _ after
another invasion of Mexico, just for practice. It should be noted
that, all through this, the American people, ignorant of geography
and history, wanted no part of foreign wars. My guy T. time-travels
so that he can stop World War II, by stopping World War I, by
keeping Wilson from becoming president.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Where would you time-travel?
 &HT;    A: Nowhere without anesthetics.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you find the future more interesting than it used to be?
 &HT;    A: Less interesting. The only hopeful sign I see is that our
number two export, after weapons, is entertainment. Can Disney save
us? Tune in to the next millennium.
 &HT;    I haven't even made reservations, since, actually, I'm not going
to spend much _ if any _ time there.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: A good argument for cloning, perhaps?
 &HT;    A: What's the point of a physical duplicate when it is the
mind-experience that is a person? Yet if memory could be saved at
regular intervals, one might have a true immortality _ very
tempting in the sense that the more one knows, the more wonderful
consciousness is.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you have any concerns about electronic books, and
specifically, the electronic supertome, whose screen will display
the contents of innumerable books?
 &HT;    A: Yes! How do we _ the creators _ get paid?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What will you write about next?
 &HT;    A: The loss of our Bill of Rights.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What advice would you give to a creative 23-year-old looking
to make a difference in the world?
 &HT;    A: Read.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Did you ever get any good advice at that age, or any other?
 &HT;    A: My father warned me never to date a girl who called her
mother Mummy. So I dated her brother and lived happily ever after.

 &HT;    It was Karl Marx, not Gore Vidal, who said that history repeats
itself _ the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.
 &HT;    But since Vidal has said practically everything else of interest
and wit on the subject, he might as well have said that too.
 &HT;    He has spent a half-century chronicling U.S. history, in the six
linked novels ``Burr,'' ``Lincoln,'' ``1876,'' ``Empire,''
``Hollywood'' and ``Washington, D.C.,'' while also knocking out
thunderous essays, not to mention such hairpin turns as ``Myra
Breckinridge.'' His most recent novel is ``The Smithsonian
Institution.''
 &HT;    One of literature's most caustic and seductive voices, a rich
kid who early on nurtured an acerbic relationship with the spoils
of capitalism, a libertarian's hero but also JFK's intimate _ and
Jackie's brother by marriage _ Gore Vidal has lived an erratically
patriotic life that finally landed him on the Amalfi coast, looking
back at us savages.
 &HT;    What does the future look like from there?
 &HT;    Al Gore is his cousin, which may or may not account for Vidal's
defense of the Internet as an endangered emblem of democracy. Yes,
he has a computer _ and a computer vassal to operate it.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    KATRINA HERON: Today the scientist-nerd has become a new

 &HT;    Hollywood and Las Vegas have a lot in common. Both towns _ twin
oases in different deserts _ feed greedily on our collective dreams
and desires.
 &HT;    The strongest connection between the two places is that neither
really cares much about history, but both are loaded with
mythology.
 &HT;    The biggest difference between them is that in LA, when the
movies are done shooting, the sets come down. The sets where Las
Vegas dreams _ the casinos and theme hotels _ have to last for
years and years.
 &HT;    Now the biggest long-duration set of them all is under
construction on 63 acres of prime real estate in the middle of the
Las Vegas Strip. In one gigantic engineering feat, this ``set of
the century'' will culminate in a hotel-casino complex called The
Venetian. Among other things, it conjures D. W. Griffith building a
massive Babylonian temple in Hollywood for his film
``Intolerance.''
 &HT;    This Renaissance Venice is on the exact site of the old Sands
Hotel, where Dino, Frank, Sammy and the other Rat Pack boys whooped
it up at least a thousand years ago.
 &HT;    The price tag for this bit of old-world charm is about $2.5
billion and, as its promoters never tire of saying, when it's
finished it will be the biggest resort of its kind in the world.
 &HT;    The Venetian will, of course, sport canals. More than a quarter
mile of them, including 650 feet of outdoor waterways that will run
parallel to the Strip. The canals won't go through the casino, but
will slide gracefully through the 800,000-square-foot enclosed
shopping complex _ built to mirror Piazza San Marco and,
conveniently, house 150 upscale shops and restaurants.
 &HT;    Phase I of The Venetian _ the area with a replica of Saint
Mark's Square at its center _ broke ground on April 14, 1997, and
is expected to open in the spring of 1999. Phase II, The Lido, a
``beach resort'' containing a marina, then begins construction.
When both phases have been completed, their hotels alone will
contain more than 6,000 rooms.
 &HT;    The Mirage and Treasure Island hotels across the street already
look less like big-time resorts and more like Disneyland rides.
 &HT;    When Bovis, principal construction manager for The Venetian,
poured the foundation of Phase I, it was the largest continuous
concrete pour in U.S. history. To be precise, Bovis used 300
workers and 125 trucks to pour 20,600 cubic yards of concrete in 30
hours, creating a 68,000-square-foot foundation slab 8 feet deep.
 &HT;    According to Kurt Ouchida, publicist for The Venetian, Bovis
could have poured more concrete that day, but it would have meant
shutting down all construction in LA for a weekend.
 &HT;    The Vegas Venice will offer the greatest hits: the Doges'
Palace, the Campanile tower, the Rialto Bridge and Bridge of Sighs,
the Contarini Palace and Saint Mark's Square, sited like a
Renaissance rummage sale.
 &HT;    But then Vegas has pretty much always epitomized a certain kind
of hospitality, the malleable kind. The fantasies here are generic,
populist, with the promise of extravagance. This is the home of the
water feature, the deluxe discount, the Ideal Guest Experience, in
addition to being the home of the evanescent lucky streak.
 &HT;    Even the dusty, pre-theme-hotel Vegas (talk about ancient
history) had it, this quality and enticement of the extraordinary.
The saloons and bordellos were like something out of a John Ford
western: functional and minimal and alluring.
 &HT;    What could be more dreamlike, right here, right now, than
bringing Venice, a city of water, to the middle of the American
desert?
 &HT;    When The Venetian is finished, besides the surreal ribbon of
canals and the humming craft (gondoliers plying poles for show
while serenading their customers), the first thing you'll see is
the looming Campanile tower _ 315 feet tall. You'll also espy the
Doges' Palace, serving as a grand entrance to the
116,000-square-foot casino. The tower will lead to the Palace via
the Rialto Bridge. The bridge will feature a people mover on which
tourists will glide into the Saint Mark's shopping area.
 &HT;    A company called Treadway is in charge of the multitude of
planned statuary and ornately carved cornices and moldings and
friezes. Venice is a city that is lousy with marble, but The
Venetian will not be, except for floors in places like the Doges'
Palace. (In a city of illusions, the Vegas crew scored big here:
They're getting their stone from the quarry that supplied it for
the original palace.)
 &HT;    Most of the ``marble'' will be made of polyurethane foams,
expanded polystyrene, and sign foam (aka polyiso foam) _ the same
materials used to carve large structures on many movie sets _ then
hand-painted with marble texturing. Some of the sculptures will be
made from glass-fiber-reinforced concrete. It's a strong material,
and Treadway has developed a formula that looks remarkably like
marble.
 &HT;    Despite all the synthetic materials and techniques (including a
computer-driven cutter that roughs out giant foam sculpture blocks
for Treadway's artists), much of the fabrication is like that of a
Renaissance workshop, and concrete pieces are cast using a process
similar to the one artists have used for hundreds of years.
 &HT;    So can we expect Elvis in wrap-around shades and Cesare Borgia's
cardinal's robes, waving to us from the Doges' Palace?
 &HT;    Well, wasn't Venice the Vegas of its day, full of overblown and
sexy distractions, warring families, political and power factions?
Is the Venice of the Renaissance really all that different from the
Vegas of Bugsy Siegel, $2 shrimp cocktails and nude ice-skating
spectaculars?
 &HT;    Consider the famous Campanile tower: While it's a lovely thing,
and the subject of high praise by many critics, including John
Ruskin in his exalted book `The Stones of Venice,'' the one now
standing in Venice isn't even the real tower. The original one
collapsed in 1902, and a new tower was built in 1912. A
reproduction.
 &HT;    Consider also Saint Mark in the Vegas pantheon. He's the patron
saint of the actual city. He rates a major square and a cathedral
in his name. But Mark isn't Venice's first patron saint. That was
Theodore, a warrior saint, and defender of the Venetian city-state.
But Saint Mark had a better spin than Theodore, and in the year
828, when a couple of plucky merchants smuggled Mark's remains from
Alexandria back to Venice, Saint Theodore was out of luck.
 &HT;    It's not hard to see Theodore as the spiritual version of Bugsy
Siegel in this little tale. Both were early supporters and
protectors of their cities, both were warriors and both, after
their deaths, were swept under the carpet of convenient history.
Saint Theodore fared a little better. His statue, standing atop a
crocodile, is situated across from Mark's winged lion on the Piazza
San Marco.
 &HT;    There are no memorials to Bugsy, the man who pretty much
invented the idea of the big hotels on the Strip. In fact, when it
came time to expand the Flamingo in 1993 _ the hotel Bugsy helped
finance and build _ the new owners bulldozed Bugsy's special
bulletproof bungalow-office and tossed the remains out with the
trash.
 &HT;    What's especially striking about The Venetian, in the context of
Vegas' current building boom (according to the Las Vegas Sun, as of
July 1997, there were 15,000 new hotel rooms under construction),
is that it's the best and brightest example of the city's latest
romance _ with the past.
 &HT;    For sure, if Venice isn't to your taste, you can try another
city-themed complex, Bellagio _ or Paris (Paris) or Burma (the
Mandalay Bay) _ built to re-create its past glory. But it should go
without saying that none of the new resorts is about re-creating
the past, The Venetian least of all.
 &HT;    These hotels, really vast self-contained entertainment
arcologies, are Big Gulp Super-Size Monuments that are _ surprise!
_ really about Vegas itself, and the Swell Future to Come.
Capitalism triumphant. Boundless optimism. Sex and youth and
vitality forever and getting rich quick. As long as there's sun and
land to expand into, we'll never die, never even grow old, never
end up like Europe, with its sad weight of history, collision of
languages and soon, some weird common currency that's less
convincing as money than the Jimi Hendrix chips at the Hard Rock
Casino.
 &HT;    Leave it to a Frenchman, though (Jean Baudrillard, the
postmodernist poster boy), to observe that there ``is something
stronger than sex or happiness: the passion for illusion.'' Maybe
he was passing through Vegas. It's all here, in Vegas as in
Hollywood, and in the empty spaces in between, and on the grounds
of The Venetian _ still waiting for its Renaissance sculptures
carved from expanded polystyrene and sign foam. Collapsible time,
where the past, present, and future merge into an endless,
revisable dream.

 &HT;    This Renaissance Venice is on the exact site of the old Sands
Hotel, where Dino, Frank, Sammy and the other Rat Pack boys whooped
it up at least a thousand years ago.
 &HT;    The price tag for this bit of old-world charm is about $2.5
billion and, as its promoters never tire of saying, when it's
finished it will be the biggest resort of its kind in the world.
 &HT;    The Venetian will, of course, sport canals. More than a quarter
mile of them, including 650 feet of outdoor waterways that will run
parallel to the Strip. The canals won't go through the casino, but
will slide gracefully through the 800,000-square-foot enclosed
shopping complex _ built to mirror Piazza San Marco and,
conveniently, house 150 upscale shops and restaurants.
 &HT;    Phase I of The Venetian _ the area with a replica of Saint
Mark's Square at its center _ broke ground on April 14, 1997, and
is expected to open in the spring of 1999. Phase II, The Lido, a
``beach resort'' containing a marina, then begins construction.
When both phases have been completed, their hotels alone will
contain more than 6,000 rooms.
 &HT;    The Mirage and Treasure Island hotels across the street already
look less like big-time resorts and more like Disneyland rides.
 &HT;    When Bovis, principal construction manager for The Venetian,
poured the foundation of Phase I, it was the largest continuous
concrete pour in U.S. history. To be precise, Bovis used 300
workers and 125 trucks to pour 20,600 cubic yards of concrete in 30
hours, creating a 68,000-square-foot foundation slab 8 feet deep.
 &HT;    According to Kurt Ouchida, publicist for The Venetian, Bovis
could have poured more concrete that day, but it would have meant
shutting down all construction in LA for a weekend.
 &HT;    The Vegas Venice will offer the greatest hits: the Doges'
Palace, the Campanile tower, the Rialto Bridge and Bridge of Sighs,
the Contarini Palace and Saint Mark's Square, sited like a
Renaissance rummage sale.
 &HT;    But then Vegas has pretty much always epitomized a certain kind
of hospitality, the malleable kind. The fantasies here are generic,
populist, with the promise of extravagance. This is the home of the
water feature, the deluxe discount, the Ideal Guest Experience, in
addition to being the home of the evanescent lucky streak.
 &HT;    Even the dusty, pre-theme-hotel Vegas (talk about ancient
history) had it, this quality and enticement of the extraordinary.
The saloons and bordellos were like something out of a John Ford
western: functional and minimal and alluring.
 &HT;    What could be more dreamlike, right here, right now, than
bringing Venice, a city of water, to the middle of the American
desert?
 &HT;    When The Venetian is finished, besides the surreal ribbon of
canals and the humming craft (gondoliers plying poles for show
while serenading their customers), the first thing you'll see is
the looming Campanile tower _ 315 feet tall. You'll also espy the
Doges' Palace, serving as a grand entrance to the
116,000-square-foot casino. The tower will lead to the Palace via
the Rialto Bridge. The bridge will feature a people mover on which
tourists will glide into the Saint Mark's shopping area.
 &HT;    A company called Treadway is in charge of the multitude of
planned statuary and ornately carved cornices and moldings and
friezes. Venice is a city that is lousy with marble, but The
Venetian will not be, except for floors in places like the Doges'
Palace. (In a city of illusions, the Vegas crew scored big here:
They're getting their stone from the quarry that supplied it for
the original palace.)
 &HT;    Most of the ``marble'' will be made of polyurethane foams,
expanded polystyrene, and sign foam (aka polyiso foam) _ the same
materials used to carve large structures on many movie sets _ then
hand-painted with marble texturing. Some of the sculptures will be
made from glass-fiber-reinforced concrete. It's a strong material,
and Treadway has developed a formula that looks remarkably like
marble.
 &HT;    Despite all the synthetic materials and techniques (including a
computer-driven cutter that roughs out giant foam sculpture blocks
for Treadway's artists), much of the fabrication is like that of a
Renaissance workshop, and concrete pieces are cast using a process
similar to the one artists have used for hundreds of years.
 &HT;    So can we expect Elvis in wrap-around shades and Cesare Borgia's
cardinal's robes, waving to us from the Doges' Palace?
 &HT;    Well, wasn't Venice the Vegas of its day, full of overblown and
sexy distractions, warring families, political and power factions?
Is the Venice of the Renaissance really all that different from the
Vegas of Bugsy Siegel, $2 shrimp cocktails and nude ice-skating
spectaculars?
 &HT;    Consider the famous Campanile tower: While it's a lovely thing,
and the subject of high praise by many critics, including John
Ruskin in his exalted book `The Stones of Venice,'' the one now
standing in Venice isn't even the real tower. The original one
collapsed in 1902, and a new tower was built in 1912. A
reproduction.
 &HT;    Consider also Saint Mark in the Vegas pantheon. He's the patron
saint of the actual city. He rates a major square and a cathedral
in his name. But Mark isn't Venice's first patron saint. That was
Theodore, a warrior saint, and defender of the Venetian city-state.
But Saint Mark had a better spin than Theodore, and in the year
828, when a couple of plucky merchants smuggled Mark's remains from
Alexandria back to Venice, Saint Theodore was out of luck.
 &HT;    It's not hard to see Theodore as the spiritual version of Bugsy
Siegel in this little tale. Both were early supporters and
protectors of their cities, both were warriors and both, after
their deaths, were swept under the carpet of convenient history.
Saint Theodore fared a little better. His statue, standing atop a
crocodile, is situated across from Mark's winged lion on the Piazza
San Marco.
 &HT;    There are no memorials to Bugsy, the man who pretty much
invented the idea of the big hotels on the Strip. In fact, when it
came time to expand the Flamingo in 1993 _ the hotel Bugsy helped
finance and build _ the new owners bulldozed Bugsy's special
bulletproof bungalow-office and tossed the remains out with the
trash.
 &HT;    What's especially striking about The Venetian, in the context of
Vegas' current building boom (according to the Las Vegas Sun, as of
July 1997, there were 15,000 new hotel rooms under construction),
is that it's the best and brightest example of the city's latest
romance _ with the past.
 &HT;    For sure, if Venice isn't to your taste, you can try another
city-themed complex, Bellagio _ or Paris (Paris) or Burma (the
Mandalay Bay) _ built to re-create its past glory. But it should go
without saying that none of the new resorts is about re-creating
the past, The Venetian least of all.
 &HT;    These hotels, really vast self-contained entertainment
arcologies, are Big Gulp Super-Size Monuments that are _ surprise!
_ really about Vegas itself, and the Swell Future to Come.
Capitalism triumphant. Boundless optimism. Sex and youth and
vitality forever and getting rich quick. As long as there's sun and
land to expand into, we'll never die, never even grow old, never
end up like Europe, with its sad weight of history, collision of
languages and soon, some weird common currency that's less
convincing as money than the Jimi Hendrix chips at the Hard Rock
Casino.
 &HT;    Leave it to a Frenchman, though (Jean Baudrillard, the
postmodernist poster boy), to observe that there ``is something
stronger than sex or happiness: the passion for illusion.'' Maybe
he was passing through Vegas. It's all here, in Vegas as in
Hollywood, and in the empty spaces in between, and on the grounds
of The Venetian _ still waiting for its Renaissance sculptures
carved from expanded polystyrene and sign foam. Collapsible time,
where the past, present, and future merge into an endless,
revisable dream.

<P>
   Under Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, I foresee
an unreasonable financial policy aimed at pumping the economy with
empty rubles. I'm convinced that no structural economic changes
will be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the communists have become the ruling party. They have
all the levers of influence on the country's social and economic
life. So far the only things they haven't gotten their hands on are
the people's basic rights and freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party would love to introduce censorship, and
that's what it will try to do. The communists dream of having
political control over the power ministries and they will spare no
effort to achieve this.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that two years ago Boris Yeltsin became president
under the banner of fighting communist restoration, yet by now he
has voluntarily handed over the economy to them. But Yeltsin has
grown weak. His main task is to hold onto the presidency and
preserve himself as a guarantor of at least those rights and
freedoms that society managed to achieve since the reign of Mikhail
Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   In the past Yeltsin wasn't the kind of person to assume such a
modest role. But people change. Age, health and a person's
surroundings take their toll. By dismissing the ambitious reform
government of Sergei V. Kiriyenko, Yeltsin in effect laid down his
powers as the head of state responsible for Russia's social and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think the communist cabinet Primakov has formed will
last long. Primakov, formerly foreign minister and one-time head of
Russia's foreign intelligence service, most likely is around for
the long haul, but his ministers aren't. Primakov is a smart and
talented man who, in moving from the Politburo to Yeltsin's
Kremlin, shows he has learned lessons from life's experiences. I
don't think he'll tie himself to the policies his cabinet will be
conducting.
</P>
<P>
   Certain deputies and ministers will be kicked out of the
Primakov government, and they will be held personally responsible
for the collapse of financial, social and industrial policies. This
is a tactic that Primakov knows well, and is most likely one he
will stick to.
</P>
<P>
   I believe we will see the level of stealing and corruption rise
sharply; budget money will be allocated to departments and
enterprises in an irrational manner. The bankruptcies of many banks
and small and medium-size businesses will leave hundreds of
thousands of qualified people unemployed, and this includes Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The people will be running away from the ruble, and its rate to
the dollar will be unpredictable. The government will try to fix
it, and in so doing it will generate a hard-currency black market.
The rate will jump up and down, and speculators will make a fortune
off it while ordinary citizens will plunge deeper into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the communist authorities' obsession with printing
new money, next year inflation will fluctuate from 100 percent to
1,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The communists could use the people's protests to dislodge
Yeltsin. But right now he isn't controlling the country's social
and economic situations. He is not responsible for wages, pensions,
benefits and the military's salaries. Yeltsin will not be actively
involved in any kind of economic decisions.
</P>
<P>
   If the communists do manage to dislodge Yeltsin, this will
inevitably bring back censorship and control over the most
influential ``renegade'' ministers through political torture and
terrorism. The people can be incited to demand Yeltsin's dismissal
by blaming him for the social and economic problems, but from now
on, in fact, the communists are the ones who are responsible for
setting the country on its course.
</P>
<P>
   In his final speech, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
whom Yeltsin had tried to bring in to replace Kiriyenko, said the
whole situation would end with the power going not to the
communists, but to the radical ultranationalists. This is possible.
It will all depend on the amount of the communists' madness per
unit of time. If the average month salary drops to $3 and the
streets are filled with millions of homeless people, it's very
probable. If we have a more or less balanced policy, we can avoid
the brown shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Initially Yeltsin fought for Kirikenko; he had a hard time
convincing the Duma to accept Kiriyenko and bringing him to the
political stage and so he linked his own fate with Kiriyenko's.
</P>
<P>
   But after Yeltsin himself sacked the Kiriyenko cabinet and
practically kept out of the process of endorsing a new premier, he
made it clear that he is voluntarily tapering his duties.
</P>
<P>
   I consider the Kiriyenko government to have been the best
qualified in all Russia's years of reform. We had a chance to
minimize the financial crisis, but not to avoid it altogether.
Right now, one of the greatest hazards for the country is to
default on the estimated $180 billion in foreign debt. In other
words, for the government to turn its back on its obligations to
the Paris and London clubs of government creditors, the IMF and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   This default could have been avoided under the Kiriyenko
government by immediately holding talks on the process of
liquidating debts. Under Primakov's leftist, or communist,
government, default is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   I think the Kiriyenko regime was entirely capable of conducting
structural reforms, including the implementation of major
investment projects. It was also capable of making the investment
climate more attractive by improving the tax system and protecting
owners' rights.
</P>
<P>
   These are ideas that will be removed from the lexicon of
Primakov's rule. I think that with Yeltsin's support, the Kiriyenko
government would have been able to hold out, not without a certain
amount of tension and provided that it corrected its mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   I feel that it was a huge mistake on the part of the president
to dismiss the Kiriyenko cabinet. But right now Yeltsin's position
is such that he is unable to provide political protection. And it
was because of this, unfortunately, that the Kiriyenko government
was doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is rapidly approaching the abyss of a national disaster.
Elections to the Duma are not scheduled until December 1999. In the
meantime, we must be prepared for everything.

TEST PREPARATION COMPANY OFFERS VIRTUAL LAW DEGREE 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, a company best known for its courses to
prepare students for college admissions exams now plans to offer
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But a big question faces Kaplan Educational Center's new Concord
University School of Law, a four-year juris doctorate program
offered entirely online: Can virtual classes provide the kind of
education that trains students to think like well-spoken lawyers?
</P>
<P>
   Concord and Kaplan officials are convinced the answer is
``yes,'' but others are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to launch October 6, Concord University plans to
charge $4,200 a year for its four-year program -- a fraction of the
$6,500 to $26,000 charged yearly by ``bricks and mortar'' schools.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan is targeting working professionals and others who cannot
make it to a classroom regularly, but desire a legal education and
are willing to get it from an unaccredited school. Jack R. Goetz,
dean of the school, which is based in Los Angeles, said Kaplan has
received about 2,000 inquiries from potential students and
``dozens'' of applications since the venture was announced last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a wide array of people, working professionals and
others, who just want legal education,'' he said. ``There are tons
of people who just can't put down everything at 5 p.m., quit their
jobs and make it to evening class to begin legal education.''
</P>
<P>
   Goetz believes that technology can replace what goes on in a
conventional classroom. The Concord program will rely on
video-streamed lectures from law professors, supplemented with
standard textbook readings and discussions that will take place via
e-mail, by phone or in virtual chat rooms. ``We are able to offer a
quality legal education at less than the cost of fixed facility
schools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Carl C. Monk, executive director of the Association of
American Law Schools, is among those who question whether ``cyber''
can adequately substitute for ``real'' when it comes to
jurisprudence. ``I am very skeptical of a degree offered totally
through online instruction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Monk pointed out, law schools are increasingly
offering students the opportunity to work under supervision with
real or simulated clients -- an experience that demands
face-to-face interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, Monk and others say, is that an
essential task of law school is training students to think and
respond quickly. Although not as favored today as it was in the
past, the Socratic teaching method, in which a professor asks
students probing questions to elicit well-thought out responses, is
still common in legal education.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a courtroom, if you are asked a question by a judge, you
can't say 'I need a day or so to look that up on the Web,''' said
James L. Hoover, associate dean and professor of law at Columbia
University's School of Law.

   Goetz responds that students can learn clear thinking through
Concord's writing and research requirements. In addition, he
questions how often law students really get to exchange ideas with
their professors. ``Mostly today you have 110 people stuffed in a
lecture room and one professor engaged in a Socratic dialogue with
one student,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, one thing is clear: Concord officials do not
expect to get the blessing of the American Bar Association, the
main national accrediting body for law schools. Students who
graduate from one of the 182 ABA-approved schools in the United
States may take the bar examination, a licensing requirement, in
any state.
</P>
<P>
   Concord graduates, on the other hand, will face certain
obstacles if they want to practice law. They will be able to sit
for the California bar examination, the prerequisite for a license
to practice in that state, if they first pass the state's ``baby
bar,'' an exam given to students at unaccredited law schools after
their first year, according to Goetz.
</P>
<P>
   If they wish to practice elsewhere, they may be eligible to take
the bar in 10 to 15 other states -- but only after practicing in
California for three to 10 years, Goetz said.
</P>
<P>
   Concord officials have not applied for ABA accreditation
because, among other things, the organization's guidelines
currently call for at least 1,120 hours of ``in residence'' study.
``We recognize that an online law school doesn't fit into these
guidelines,'' Goetz said.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is that the American Bar Association does not look
kindly on correspondence courses. Kurt S. Snyder, assistant
consultant on legal education to the American Bar Association, said
a big question if Concord were to apply would be whether its course
of study amounted to a correspondence course or to something
different, such as an online forum that provided for meaningful
professor-to-student and student-to-student exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Goetz believes that chat rooms, e-mail discussions, phone
conversations and electronic feedback on tests are good
substitutes. And Jonathan Grayer, Kaplan's chief executive officer,
hopes one day to apply for bar association recognition and make the
case.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Goetz is convinced that Concord will attract
what he believes is a large body of potential lawyers and students
who do not necessarily want to practice law, among them scholars
who want to deepen their knowledge of jurisprudence and business
people who think knowing the law will help them in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not competing with ABA law schools, the Harvards and
the Yales of the world,'' he said. ``We are competing for people
for whom law school is otherwise inaccessible.''

ARTS(AT)LARGE 
 TRACKING A VOYAGE OF 600 FEET 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ward Shelley's latest work is quite a departure for him. In
fact, he left Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Atop the Voyage Platform, a wooden deck that sits 10 feet off
the ground, Shelley, a New York sculptor, and two compatriots have
embarked on a week-long journey that will take them across the
art-laden terrain of the Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island
City, Queens _ a distance of about 600 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The trio will stay on the 120-square-foot platform until their
mission is completed. They move the stilt-legged structure by
disassembling the back section and rebuilding it in the front. As
of Sept. 23, they had passed the halfway point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sort of leapfrogging across the park,'' explained
Kathleen Gilrain, the director of the 4.5-acre outdoor museum on
the banks of the East River, which boasts an expansive view of the
Manhattan skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many modern-day adventurers who document their travels
with electronic postings from exotic locales, Shelley is
chronicling the voyage online, the small-scale nature of his trip
unintentionally mocking the tedious travelogues that clog the Web.
His equipment is appropriately low-tech: with a cellular telephone,
he calls a friend with brief reports, which are then added to the
project's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that not that many people are going to see us do
this, and that the main thing was to tell the story,'' Shelley said
in a telephone interview. When the trip is done, he said, the team
intends to expand the Web site with a more complete account.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley and his collaborator, William R. Kaizen, a Web-savvy
Brooklyn artist, describe the Voyage Platform project as ``an
expedition into the unknown, within the familiar.'' Part sculpture,
part performance, the work encourages viewers to reconsider the
notion of statuary as static objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful piece,'' said Simon Lee, the park's education
director. ``It's actually quite a complicated piece of work. It's
about space. It's about crossing space. It's about traversing the
park, about navigating through the sculptures to get from one side
to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley was inspired by Ole Olaussen, a Norwegian expeditionist
and writer who took the sculptor on a mountain-climbing trip last
year. He recalled: ``I decided we should do something that was a
bit more like the mountain-climbing adventure, that had this goal
you tried to reach. I tried to think what you could do with the
park, and this just popped into my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Socrates selection committee approved the project, and
Shelley, Kaizen and Olaussen, who became the team's third member,
began conceptualizing in earnest. They developed the platform's
architecture with a computer-aided design program and, modeling
themselves on the Challengers of the Unknown, a 1950s comic-book
quartet, exchanged character profiles via e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Matching the lineup of the vintage comic book's everyday heroes,
Shelley is a redhead, Kaizen has brown hair and Olaussen is a
blond. ``Roy'' is the fourth member of the party, a human-sized
figure sporting an Elvis Presley wig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't find a black-haired guy to do it with us, so we
made a dummy for him,'' Shelley explained. ``You can see we had too
much time to plan this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Voyage Platform is a contemporary version of Kon-Tiki, the
balsa-wood raft that another Norwegian, the explorer Thor
Heyerdahl, sailed from Peru to Polynesia in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   But since the team set out on Sept. 18, its greatest challenge
has been not the Pacific but the park's drainage ditch. The
structure is designed for relatively flat terrain, and the crew
disagreed over the best technique for bridging the shallow valley.
</P>
<P>
   The team has also had to alter its southerly route to
accommodate the park's new exhibition, which opened Sept. 20.
``They put a lot of sculpture in this park that we hadn't planned
on,'' Shelley said. ``We have to make a lot of turns, and this
thing is really designed to go straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the resilient individuals who strive to set new
roller-coaster and kissing-contest records, the Voyage Platform
crew gets no five-minute breaks, although a catwalk under the deck
affords a small measure of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley is an experienced sailor, so he is accustomed to packing
for extended journeys away from land. Dinner on Sept. 21 was chili
and rice. There are tents for sleeping, and a tripod rigged with
motion-sensing devices alerts the crew to nighttime intruders. So
far, only a dog and a lightning storm have triggered the warning
system.
</P>
<P>
   As the trio learns the ropes, they have stepped up their pace.
Kaizen is insisting that they will reach their goal by Sept. 25.
Shelley said, ``We're working hard to increase our speed. It's
become more athletic, more competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   When the trip is done, the crew would like to saw off some of
the stilts and leave the platform behind, listing at a severe
angle, as a sculptural reminder of the journey -- a proposal the
park's safety experts have yet to approve since local children are
likely to want to clamber on it, as they do the site's 50 other
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island City is an ethnically diverse community and the
park, an illegal dump site that the sculptor Mark di Suvero
reclaimed for art in 1985, is visited regularly by residents of a
nearby low-income housing project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a high degree of fascination from the local community
about what (Shelley's) doing, especially from kids, where it's a
little bit magic,'' Lee said. ``Here are these grown-ups who are
behaving like kids. They're getting a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley said neighborhood visitors all ask the same thing: ``Are
you really not coming down?'' He gives a straightforward response:
``This is like a raft on stilts, and we're building it across the
park. We're living here while we do it. We're not coming down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they have to ask the question twice, but this is New
York, so people are used to weird things. Most people seem to be
really tickled by the idea,'' he said.

CAN A WEB LINK BREAK COPYRIGHT LAWS? 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suppose a Web site links to a site that links to another site
containing illegally reproduced photographs. Can the first site be
sued for illegal linking?
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of the many head-scratchers that were raised by
an unprecedented copyright infringement lawsuit filed and then
withdrawn by Gary Bernstein, a veteran Hollywood glamour
photographer. The suit charged J.C. Penney Inc. and other parties
with copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein quietly withdrew his lawsuit Sept. 21 after he lost a
preliminary round in the legal contest. But the fundamental issue
he raised -- liability for linking on the Internet -- is still
alive and will come up for court review another day, legal experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's lawsuit is ``fascinating and also really scary,''
said Jessica Litman, a copyright expert and law professor at Wayne
State University. ``If people are going to be liable when they link
to material that they have no reason to think is infringing, then
everyone, everyone who links, will be dragged into court all the
time. That doesn't make good policy sense.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept., Los Angeles Federal District Court Judge Manuel A.
Real appeared to pour cold water on Bernstein's case when he
dismissed one of the defendants. Conopco Inc. had argued in legal
filings that Bernstein's suit had ``no support in the law, and
would effectively eviscerate the Internet as a medium of
communication.'' Real did not issue an opinion in the matter, but
his decision prompted Bernstein's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, 50, is the author of nine books on photography and a
30-year veteran behind the camera, having snapped Sophia Lauren,
Johnny Carson, Elizabeth Taylor and other celebrities. His foray
into cyberspace law began last year when he was surfing the Web and
came across J.C. Penney's home page. He noticed that the company
was promoting sales of Elizabeth Taylor's ``Passion'' perfume,
which is made by Elizabeth Arden Co. and Parfums International
Ltd., both divisions of Conopco.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein knew the perfume well. In 1989, he had created and
licensed an elaborate photo of Elizabeth Taylor -- which Bernstein
dubbed the ``Pink Lady Image'' -- in connection with the
advertising and promotion of ``Passion.'' He also took pictures of
Elizabeth Taylor on other occasions, notably in 1986 for the cover
of Petersen's Photographic Magazine. Bernstein calls that shot the
``Lavender Image.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein discovered during his visit to the J.C. Penney site
that by clicking on a series of hyperlinks to get additional
information on Elizabeth Taylor, he was taken from J.C. Penney's
``Passion'' subpage to a site called the Internet Movie Database --
which is not affiliated with J.C. Penney or the makers of
``Passion'' -- and then to a site in Sweden called SUNET, for the
Swedish University Network. The site contains a large collection of
celebrity photos, apparently placed on the Internet by fans. It
included two images of Ms. Taylor -- the Pink Lady Image and the
Lavender Image.
</P>
<P>
   After learning of Bernstein's claim that the SUNET site
contained illegally reproduced images, J.C. Penney removed its link
to the movie database site. As of Oct. 1, the movie site still
linked to the Swedish site from its collection of information on
Ms. Taylor, with a disclaimer of liability for linking.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein sued J.C. Penney, the perfume makers, the Internet
Movie Database and other parties in April, claiming that they were
liable for copyright infringement. Specifically, he claimed the
defendants' use of multiple links intentionally drove Web surfers
to the pirated Taylor photos on the Swedish site.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he claimed that if J.C. Penney and the perfume
makers wanted to use his pictures, they should have paid him
directly -- instead of indirectly linking to the photos and reaping
the benefit but escaping the fee.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney denied the charges in court filings, and a spokesman
for the company declined comment on the dropped case. The perfume
companies moved to have themselves dismissed from the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Conopco's lawyer, Roger Myers of Steinhart &AMP; Falconer in San
Francisco, argued that the J.C. Penney site was not guilty of
direct copyright infringement because it didn't make a copy or
distribute the Taylor images. The pictures remained on the site in
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who has represented The New York Times in some legal
matters, further argued that Penney and his client could not be
guilty of ``contributory'' copyright infringement. This requires
that the guilty party have knowledge of the first infringement and
take some action to aid that infringement.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, he said, there was no evidence that the J.C.
Penney site or the perfume maker knew the series of links would
eventually lead to a set of pirated pictures abroad. He also
asserted that the chain of links -- six in all -- on the road to
the pirated photos was too long to meet the legal standard for
assisting another's infringement.
</P>
<P>
   One wrinkle in the case has some legal experts especially
worried. Bernstein asserted that any Web surfer who viewed the
pirated Taylor images on the Swedish site was technically guilty of
direct copyright infringement, and that the defendants are guilty
of contributing to infringement. After all, he claimed, a user's
computer makes a copy of the images viewed, and when the images are
illegal, the copy is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In his court filings, Myers said that such copying by an end
user was a ``fair use'' -- thus immunizing the average Web surfer
from such a lawsuit. But the question has not been answered by a
federal appellate court, which would set a powerful precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case law is not clear on the liability of end users for
copyright infringement,'' said Mark Lemley, a visiting professor at
Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law and a professor at the
University of Texas law school, adding that ``fair use'' was a
strong argument. ``The consequences of holding an end user liable
for copyright infringement would be disturbing for the Net... It
might deter surfing. It might also give some unscrupulous groups
the power to suppress speech or critics.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey R. Kuester, an intellectual property lawyer with Thomas,
Kayden, Horstemeyer &AMP; Risley in Atlanta, said he was glad the
Bernstein case was withdrawn. He said he believes there should be
freedom to link on the Net, a right that is protected by the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that there might be exceptions to the rule if
there was strong evidence that a Web site, in bad faith, linked to
another site in a knowing effort to evade copyright law -- evidence
that he thought was lacking in the Bernstein case.
</P>
<P>
   The best solution, said Kuester, is for the injured party to go
after the pirate site, rather than the linking sites. ``The
wrongdoer here is the pirate site,'' he said. There should be
international treaties and conventions to punish people for posting
copyright-infringing material, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bernstein agreed that linking on the Net should be
encouraged. But he said he will continue his crusade for
``responsible linking'' in the court of public opinion via magazine
articles in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be a poster boy for hurting the Internet or
for trying to limit the freewheeling spirt of the Net,'' he said,
referring to his decision to withdraw his lawsuit. ``But a couple
of companies were trying to get away with murder.''

GATEWAY'S SOLO 2500LS PACKS IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm always amazed at what Gateway charges for its computers. The
company seems to bundle everything but the kitchen sink with their
systems and still charge rock-bottom prices.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the Gateway Solo 2500LS. The unit I reviewed
was a 233-Megahertz Pentium II with MMX technology. It has a 12.1
inch SVGA, TFT active matrix display, an enhanced TouchPad (more on
that later), a 4GB hard drive, 2Mb of video RAM, a CD-ROM, a floppy
disk drive, two USB ports, an NTSC external video connector (for
displaying the output of TVs, VCRs and camcorders,) a 56K modem,
Windows 98, Microsoft Office Small Business Edition and a quite
nice carrying case. I upgraded the memory from 32 to 64 Megabytes
of RAM (an additional $100). All of this was priced at $2,349.
</P>
<P>
   Price alone makes this an attractive laptop, but it also stands
out on its own merits as well. The 2500LS beats a couple of systems
I've reviewed that cost a whole lot more. I threw everything at it
and it more than held its own. I loaded it with all my standard
stuff -- three Web browsers, two e-mail packages, software for the
Palm Pilot, some proprietary software for connecting to The Times'
Atex system, Adobe PhotoShop, Gizmos98 (a real system hog,) and my
current crop of system-intensive games.
</P>
<P>
   The system didn't even seem to breathe hard. It even survived a
heart-stopping, totally unplanned drop test. Some rowdy school kids
bumped into me and the unit slipped off my shoulder and bounced
onto the concrete platform of the Times Square subway station. The
bag obviously provided some protection, but I know of a couple of
units that would not have survived the fall. The 2500LS booted
right up with no sign of any problem with the unit.
</P>
<P>
   The 2500LS is an all-in-one laptop. An all-in-one unit is one
that contains a built-in CD-ROM and floppy disk drive and often a
network connection. These units are heavier, but you don't need to
carry any external devices like a CD-ROM or a floppy disk drive.
Those two devices add a couple of pounds to a laptop. A light 4-lb.
unit goes up to 6-plus lbs. with the added external equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But if you need to run an application that requires a CD or want
to save information to a floppy, you have to carry them and their
cables and connectors with you. The weight ends up being the same
but with lots of extra stuff that is not necessary when the laptop
has everything integrated. The Solo 2500LS weighs 7.1 lbs. It's one
ounce over my 7 lb. limit for laptops, but in this case, I'll make
an exception.
</P>
<P>
   I have made no secret that I'm not a big fan of TouchPads. But
the new enhanced TouchPad that comes with the 2500LS is turning me
around. It may be that the documentation for how to use the
TouchPad is so good. This is the first time that I've had a
detailed explanation on how to use a TouchPad effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The enhanced TouchPad has new features that make it more
user-friendly. I'm a right mouse button user. I find the shortcuts
available through the right mouse button options increase my
productivity. Tapping with 3-fingers on the TouchPad brings up the
right mouse button options.
</P>
<P>
   The enhanced TouchPad also has a scrolling option along the
right side of the unit. Scrolling through Web pages or long
documents is a breeze with the TouchPad. I can't say enough about
the documentation provided with the 2500LS. The text is in English
and the graphics are clear and helpful.
</P>
<P>
   I can't let the 2500LS off with an entirely clean bill of
health. The tiny LCD screen that tells you of the system's status
battery life, hard drive/CD-ROM activity and whether you're using
AC -- is unreadable in low light conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Picky, Picky.

   The system didn't even seem to breathe hard. It even survived a
heart-stopping, totally unplanned drop test. Some rowdy school kids
bumped into me and the unit slipped off my shoulder and bounced
onto the concrete platform of the Times Square subway station. The
bag obviously provided some protection, but I know of a couple of
units that would not have survived the fall. The 2500LS booted
right up with no sign of any problem with the unit.
</P>
<P>
   The 2500LS is an all-in-one laptop. An all-in-one unit is one
that contains a built-in CD-ROM and floppy disk drive and often a
network connection. These units are heavier, but you don't need to
carry any external devices like a CD-ROM or a floppy disk drive.
Those two devices add a couple of pounds to a laptop. A light 4-lb.
unit goes up to 6-plus lbs. with the added external equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But if you need to run an application that requires a CD or want
to save information to a floppy, you have to carry them and their
cables and connectors with you. The weight ends up being the same
but with lots of extra stuff that is not necessary when the laptop
has everything integrated. The Solo 2500LS weighs 7.1 lbs. It's one
ounce over my 7 lb. limit for laptops, but in this case, I'll make
an exception.
</P>
<P>
   I have made no secret that I'm not a big fan of TouchPads. But
the new enhanced TouchPad that comes with the 2500LS is turning me
around. It may be that the documentation for how to use the
TouchPad is so good. This is the first time that I've had a
detailed explanation on how to use a TouchPad effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The enhanced TouchPad has new features that make it more
user-friendly. I'm a right mouse button user. I find the shortcuts
available through the right mouse button options increase my
productivity. Tapping with 3-fingers on the TouchPad brings up the
right mouse button options.
</P>
<P>
   The enhanced TouchPad also has a scrolling option along the
right side of the unit. Scrolling through Web pages or long
documents is a breeze with the TouchPad. I can't say enough about
the documentation provided with the 2500LS. The text is in English
and the graphics are clear and helpful.
</P>
<P>
   I can't let the 2500LS off with an entirely clean bill of
health. The tiny LCD screen that tells you of the system's status
battery life, hard drive/CD-ROM activity and whether you're using
AC -- is unreadable in low light conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Picky, Picky.

`ANTZ' CRAWLING WITH DETAIL, HUMOR WOODY ALLEN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Woody Allen has always been a funny little guy _ but
not this little.
</P>
<P>
   Woody turns up picnic-crumb size in the first of the season's
two animated bug movies, ``Antz.''
</P>
<P>
   You remember Woody's early movies, when his sole goal was to
make us laugh at the tribulations of his neurotic life? Movies like
``Bananas,'' ``Take the Money and Run,'' ``Play It Again Sam''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz'' is a throwback to those comedies, which means it's
likely to be funnier for adults than young kids.
</P>
<P>
   Allen provides the voice for Z, a common worker ant with an
uncommon problem: He's afraid of crowds, which he blames on the
fact that he was the middle child in a family of 5 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of verbal humor Woody dishes out as the computer
animation wizards create the life of an ant colony, wonderfully
imagined and amusingly realized. ``Antz,'' coming to us from Steven
Spielberg's DreamWorks Studio, proves conclusively that Disney
doesn't own all the artistic talent in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   As Z struggles to find himself, he becomes the accidental hero
in a war against the termites, kidnaps the princess (Sharon Stone),
and inspires a revolution when his best friend (Sylvester Stallone)
realizes that the worker ants ``control the means of production.''
</P>
<P>
   While Z and the princess dare the dangers of the outside world
searching for an insect paradise, the colony is threatened by a
general who wants to breed a race of superants.
</P>
<P>
   As in all animated films, it's the attention to detail that
makes the experience special. ``Antz'' is full of visual novelties
and clever humor that give us a telling bug's-eye view of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The film's writers have conceived Woody Allen shtick that only
occasionally rises to the best of the master's work but is
consistently amusing to see coming out of the mouth of a bug.
</P>
<P>
   It's also fun playing match-the-ant-to-the-voice, as the cast
includes Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Jane Curtin, Danny Glover,
Gene Hackman, Jennifer Lopez and Christopher Walken (all right, the
Walken ant you can't miss).
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz'' provides one other Hollywood first: Where else but in
an animated film would Woody Allen get to romance Sharon Stone?
</P>
<P>
   As the first of the two animated ant movies to reach theaters,
``Antz'' stakes out the territory and sets a high standard for
Disney's ``A Bug's Life'' to match or surpass when it's released
this November. But ``Antz'' does leave room if ``A Bug's Life'' is
geared more for younger kids than the sophisticated comedy of
``Antz.'
</P>
<P>
   Smart kids 10 and older should enjoy most of the verbal humor in
``Antz'' while finding the visual creations highly entertaining.
But younger children may be confused by Woody's patter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz'' is rated PG, rather than the G that nearly all animated
films receive. Why the more cautionary rating? ``Antz'' contains a
couple of mild profanities that some parents may find
objectionable. Also, the battle between ants and termites is
unsettling in its devastation, creating an anti-war message that
calls for peace among insects.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe right after we achieve peace among primates. 3 stars. &QL;

THE LOVE INTEREST HERE IS A CONTINENT

RULES OF THE WILD 
By Francesca Marciano 
Pantheon, 292 pp., $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer is decidedly over, and more's the pity. Francesca
Marciano's first novel would have made a fitting companion during a
day at the beach. At its strongest, ``Rules of the Wild'' strives
to capture the expatriate's sense of dislocation and estrangement
amid the sweep of Africa. Stripped of this expansive canvas, it's a
simple love story struggling to find its footing.
</P>
<P>
   Set in contemporary Kenya, ``Rules of the Wild'' tracks the
pilgrimage of its Italian heroine, Esme, as she is cast adrift in
an emotional desert after her beloved father, a Neapolitan poet,
dies of a brain tumor. Numbed by her state of mourning, Esme
travels to east Africa, oblivious to her surroundings until the
close of the trip, when geography stakes its claim on her:
</P>
<P>
   ``On day seven we moved to the middle of the Masai Mara, to a
luxury tented camp surrounded by more ferocious American tourists.
... I remember smelling the rain. I could see dark clouds heading
our way, thick lead against blue sky. That incredible sky, which I
was seeing at last, took my breath away. ... In the stillness
before the storm, the plains opened before my eyes. The gentle
shape of the acacias, the herds of zebra and wildebeest and buffalo
dotting the yellowing grass in the distance: it all came alive and
whatever had been dead inside of me slowly started to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   At the genesis of this nascent overseas life, the figure who
helps pull Esme out of the darkness is Adam, a handily named
Kenyan-born safari leader. The somewhat pat touch with names
continues when Esme's renewal through romance is complicated by
Hunter Reed, a stereotypic portrait of the enigmatic, driven
foreign correspondent who documents strife wherever it takes him _
Rwanda, Somalia, or Afghanistan. So even as she explores her newly
adopted Garden of Eden, she stumbles and becomes Hunted.
</P>
<P>
   The telling of this love story, this tortured triangle, never
quite transcends its geometric convenience. What does, however, is
Marciano's love for, and rendering of, the consuming geography of
East Africa. Perhaps the protagonist of ``Rules of the Wild''
should have been the continent rather than a heroine who, at her
worst, is allowed to verge on the vapid. In the throes of her
affair with Hunter Reed, witness the quote of a friend who notices
she is spending time with him: ``You two are both so cerebral.''
That's just lame, and Marciano should have been saved by an editor
from lines like it. Clearly, the allure of Africa moves the author
to write her better lines, to paint her most stunning portraits.
Next to that sensory richness, the foibles and frettings of a white
expatriate community register as utterly secondary.
</P>
<P>
   When Marciano turns a critical gaze squarely onto the culturally
dislocated, she manages more of a triumph:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, everyone does try to have a go at history here. ... Our
prestige depends on the assumption that this is the last outpost of
wilderness and we are the last batch of Romantic heroes. Most of us
have built our careers around this assumption, and now entire
families depend on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules of the Wild'' is a vexing book, engulfed with
contradictions: a palpable promise of depth battles with waves of
insipid romance, a tidal sweep of geographic grandeur and cultural
discord fights to overcome ripples of nonchalance. Yet there is
enough of a current here, a heat that draws me close, and I found I
was not willing to set the book aside.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian documentary filmmaker who splits her time between
Rome and Kenya, Marciano writes with consuming, abiding passion
about her second home. And it is all the more remarkable that she
gives voice to her story in English, which is not her native
tongue. It is this deft straddling of two worlds, and the respect
she accords this precarious dislocation, that allows her to sing
her song of Africa with grace. It's certainly not an easy universe
to inhabit _ the outsider's pitfalls of condescension and
imperiousness loom large _ but she navigates it commandingly.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the end, the love story of Esme, Adam, and Hunter and the
supporting story line of hacks and artists become secondary. What
is lasting is the sense that one woman embarks on a safari of the
heart, and pursues her solitary redemption amid the engulfing
soulscape of Africa. Let not the occasional stretch of banal
dialogue stall you.

IT'S ALL OVER FOR THE REFRESHMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - One of Tempe's most popular bands has come to an
unfortunate end, as the Refreshments called it quits due to a storm
of personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Gin Blossoms, the Refreshments helped define the
Tempe music scene on a national scale. Perhaps best-known as the
guys behind the theme song to TV's ``King of the Hill,'' the group
announced its breakup through a carefully worded news release
Wednesday that pointed out some of the turmoil that the Mill Avenue
Band has weathered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in a working band requires that everyone be in the best
of health and spirit,'' the statement reads. ``We regret that
(guitarist) Brian Blush has had troubles with addiction, and on
several occasions we've reached out in an effort to help him
overcome his struggles. In an attempt to force the issue, after
much contemplation and with heavy hearts, Brian Blush has been
dismissed from the Refreshments.''
</P>
<P>
   Blush was unaware of the release until it was read to him. He
didn't disagree with the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I had been expecting,'' Blush said. ``I'm in no
way, shape or form bitter. I think my dismissal is warranted.
That's not to say it doesn't completely break my heart. I live to
play in that band.''
</P>
<P>
   The Refreshments enjoyed a brief but impressive run in the
national music scene. The group's three albums collectively sold
more than half a million copies, establishing their picaresque
songs with music fans across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The group rose to rare heights for a local band. Formed in late
1993, the band hit the Mill Avenue scene the following year with an
irreverent sense of humor and colorful lyrics with a Southwestern
slant.
</P>
<P>
   The group's debut album, ``Wheelie,'' came out on local label
Epiphany later that year. The mammoth PolyGram organization took
notice of the band, signing them to a contract. The group's 1996
effort, ``Fizzy,'' ``Fuzzy, Big &AMP; Buzzy,'' sold more than 400,000
copies and produced a pair of radio hits in ``Banditos'' and ``Down
Together.''
</P>
<P>
   But the group's slide began with the second PolyGram release,
1997's ``The Bottle &AMP; Fresh Horses.'' Sales were disappointing.
After the ironically titled ``Good Year'' failed to click with
audiences, a secondsingle never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel a heavy responsibility for that effort failing,''
Blush said. ``I was the author of ``Good Year.'' It shouldn't have
been a single. The label chose it as a single, and the band never
wanted it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The group was dropped by the label after finishing a tour in
support of the album. Following a Cinco de Mayo concert earlier
this year, bassist Buddy Edwards chose to leave the band. Breakup
rumors began to swirl soon after.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pretty much 8,000 different reasons why I chose to
leave,'' Edwards said Wednesday. ``I guess it seems like it was
time. We made two (major label) records and had quite a run.
Everything in my life pointed me toward something more civilized,
more toward living like a civilian.''
</P>
<P>
   He left in June with plans to go back to school and work on a
novel _ ``It's not about rock and roll,'' he says. His departure
made the breakup nearly inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support Buddy's decision to leave the band and wish him the
very best, and success with future endeavors,'' the statement
reads.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my favorite things about a Refreshments show was
watching Buddy,'' Blush said. ``It wasn't about guitar virtuosity;
it was about style. I hated to see him go. If I told him that he
could drag me for four miles behind his pickup truck on my bare
belly to make him stay, I would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Blush's problems, he says he was called into a meeting by
two other band members, drummer P.H. Naffah and lead
singer/guitarist Roger Clyne. He was given an ultimatum about his
personal problems three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He admits his addictions but declines to discuss specifics. He
says he plans to enter a treatment facility Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that I can say is that I never missed a
Refreshments gig,'' he said. ``I played with all of my soul. If
they had to excavate me and step me up on stage, I probably still
could pull off the riffs and put on a decent show.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounded a bit bewildered about the band issuing a statement
to the press without consulting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're human beings,'' he said. ``They've been to my house,
and they've discussed these issues with me, but I don't know. . . .
Maybe they think they've run out of options, which I can
understand. But . . . these are guys that stood up at my wedding _
I'd rather not be told through the newspaper that I'm out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Refreshments' manager, Michael Lustig, who still handles
Clyne and Naffah, said the two will continue in the music industry.
Neither was available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   From the band's statement: ``The Refreshments was a unique
collaboration between four musicians. . . . Without all four
original members, the special collaboration that made up the band
would be inarguably different; therefore, we shall no longer use
the moniker `The Refreshments.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Blush agrees with those words, though he still sounds
shellshocked by the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bitter,'' he said. ``It would have taken death to get
me to leave that band. I hadn't planned on these circumstances. I
love the fans, and I'm grateful for the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the phone rang right now and they said that we had a
gig tonight, my stuff would be in the back of the truck, and I'd be
there. That's clearly not reality. . . . Reality is something I've
had to learn to take healthy doses of these days.'' &QL;

   From the band's statement: ``The Refreshments was a unique
collaboration between four musicians. . . . Without all four
original members, the special collaboration that made up the band
would be inarguably different; therefore, we shall no longer use
the moniker `The Refreshments.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Blush agrees with those words, though he still sounds
shellshocked by the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bitter,'' he said. ``It would have taken death to get
me to leave that band. I hadn't planned on these circumstances. I
love the fans, and I'm grateful for the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the phone rang right now and they said that we had a
gig tonight, my stuff would be in the back of the truck, and I'd be
there. That's clearly not reality. . . . Reality is something I've
had to learn to take healthy doses of these days.'' &QL;

REPUBLICAN AD CAMPAIGN COURTS HISPANIC, ASIAN VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Republican candidate for Senate has begun
airing a series of television commercials designed to chip away at
incumbent Barbara Boxer's turf, the Asian-American and Hispanic
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials are the first for the campaign of State
Treasurer Matt Fong, and the ads will air in Cantonese, Mandarin,
Spanish and English, stressing issues such as education and family.
</P>
<P>
   Fong campaign manager Sal Russo said the ads would air all over
the state, including the politically liberal San Francisco area, a
stronghold for Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce Herschensohn never advertised in the Bay area,'' Russo
said of Boxer's 1992 Republican opponent, a conservative
commentator who lost in a close race. ``He conceded a big chunk of
territory. We're not conceding any territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boxer campaign Wednesday announced the start of an Internet
advertising campaign. The campaign is putting banner ads on news
Web sites with links to the Boxer campaign Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very inexpensive way to reach people,'' said Boxer
campaign manager Rose Kapolczynski. The ads will cost several
thousand dollars, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Russo would not disclose how much the Fong campaign would spend
on the commercials. The first Spanish-language ads began airing
Tuesday in Sacramento, and the Chinese-language ads were to begin
in the San Francisco area on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some have questioned whether Fong could raise enough money to
compete on with Boxer on television, who aired her first commercial
on Sept. 11. This week, her campaign launched commercials attacking
Fong for not supporting new bans on assault weapons and so-called
``Saturday Night Specials.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If she had poured $4 million or $5 million into ads in June,
we couldn't have matched that,'' Russo said. ``Now that we're in
October, we have money to wage an effective campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials highlight some of Fong's positions on education,
including his support for mandatory testing of students, merit pay
for good teachers and the removal of violent and disruptive
students from classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish- and Chinese-language ads open with the line, ``Matt
Fong's highest priority is family.'' Russo said he expected the
spot to play well in Hispanic and Chinese-American communities,
which place a strong emphasis on family.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities were the key swing vote for Boxer in 1992. But Fong
appears to be making inroads, especially with Asian voters. An exit
poll taken during the June primary by San Francisco political
consultant Tom Hsieh Jr. showed that while more than 80 percent of
Asian-American voters in San Francisco voted for a Democrat for
governor, 76 percent voted for Fong. Only 20 percent supported
Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Kapolczynski said she expected little if any defection of
Asian-American Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Boxer has been very active on issues of great concern
to the Asian-American community, like public education and
Asian-American appointments ...'' Kapolczynski said. ``I think when
they compare the two candidates, Asian-American Democrats will
stick with Senator Boxer.''

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Diane Rose doesn't care to share.
</P>
<P>
   So instead she shreds.
</P>
<P>
   Canceled checks, credit card statements, outdated documents &UR; and
any other piece of paper containing her name and account numbers
that might prove profitable in unscrupulous hands.
</P>
<P>
   With an electrical gadget Rose keeps on her kitchen counter, the
Scottsdale housewife merrily makes mincemeat out of her private
papers before throwing them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love doing this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The object of Rose's affection is her new home-style paper
shredder, a convenience that's fast becoming almost as popular in
Arizona households as bread machines and espresso makers.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech shredding has been a rapidly growing security measure
for businesses disposing of sensitive information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of commercial shredding companies has doubled in
the last seven years,'' said Robert Johnson, executive director of
the National Association for Information Destruction, a
Phoenix-based trade association for commercial shredders.
</P>
<P>
   And now it is an equally vital practice for private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of my work I know people go through garbage and steal
credit card numbers,'' said Catherine Hughes, a Phoenix attorney.
``That's why I bought one for my personal use.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller and more affordable than commercial versions, the new
home models that both Rose and Hughes invested in sell for as
little as $25 at office supply outlets and are not much bigger than
a lunch box.
</P>
<P>
   More sophisticated home models range upward to $200 and include
crosscut shredders that turn paper into confetti for as little
$100. Heavier-duty motors account for higher prices, which in
general have decreased 15 to 20 percent for comparable models in
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; David Jordan, manager of a Phoenix Staples, said that customer
interest in home shredders is definitely on the upswing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just keeps rising and rising,'' he said. ``We're selling
three times as many now as we did 1{ years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   It's ditto at the OfficeMax in Tempe, Ariz., according to
manager George Parker. ``Seems like it's people past their 40s who
are buying most of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parker assumes that older shoppers are perhaps more aware of the
consequences of stolen papers because of a bad experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you can get stung really badly once someone commits
fraud with your information and it takes a lifetime to sort out,''
he said. ``It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Local law enforcement officials could hardly disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Vernon Busby of the Phoenix Police Department said that his
document-crime detail is besieged with mail-theft horror stories
and that victims' losses are rising dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losses used to range from $25 to $30,'' he said, ``but now
it's starting to be in six figures.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Busby said it's difficult to estimate how many of his fraud
cases relate to the misuse of personal information retrieved from
dumpsters because of the manner in which they are tabulated.
</P>
<P>
   But since a common scenario is to wash away ink on canceled
checks acquired through ``dumpster diving'' and then rewrite them
for large amounts, shredding of checks can only help to protect
potential victims.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-approved credit card application and home mortgage loans
also are worthy of thorough shredding.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is sign it, put in a change of address and
mail it back,'' said Karie Dozer, spokeswoman for the Attorney
General's Office and confirmed shredder. ``And crooks don't even
have to go sift through the coffee grounds to get them,'' she said,
referring to items in recycling bins.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't just checks and pre-approved credit applications
that crooks are after when they dumpster-dive.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``They call them identity-takeover thefts, and it's one of the
fastest-growing crimes of the '90s,'' said Leo Nolan, inspector for
the U.S. Postal Service. ``Thieves get your name, address, phone
number, driver's license number, Social Security number, mortgage
account numbers, credit card number and line of credit, and then
they go to town with all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But shredding may be only a temporary protection.
</P>
<P>
   With so much personal information now available on the Internet
and even more expected in the future, ``five or 10 years from now
shredding won't do any good,'' Busby said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rose will be hard-put to abandon the practice for a more
current deterrent to crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recycle the shredded paper on my ceramics because it's great
for when you're firing in the kiln,'' she said. ``It burns into the
finish, giving the pottery a Southwestern or Asian form.''
</P>
<P>
   And she also uses the shredding for packing gifts such as
delicate glassware and other breakables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds crazy, but I've always wanted this
shredder,'' she sighed. &QL;

REMOVING TATTOOS IS COSTLY, TIME-CONSUM ING AND IFFY  
 (ART ADV: PHOTO HAS BEEN SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DOUG CARROLL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Somewhere along the way, well past flared polyester
slacks but shortly after yuppie guys with earrings, we became
Tattoo Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Let's make this easy: Raise your hand if you (begin ital) don't
(end ital) have a tattoo, if you're (begin ital) not (end ital)
walking around with a Chinese dragon breathing fire down your
forearm or a barbed-wire motif guarding your ankle or a butterfly
flitting about your . . . well, ma'am, you know where that insect
is, and thank you for not sharing.
</P>
<P>
   Tattoos, once the province of sailors, soldiers and elements of
society that could charitably be described as ``fringe,'' are fully
mainstream now. And in American pop culture, you know what that
means: Sooner or later _ probably sooner than the freshly tattooed
can imagine _ they'll become passe.
</P>
<P>
   ``How '90s,'' people will say, perhaps in the disdainful tone
they now reserve for most things '70s.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike other fads that have come and gone, a tattoo
can't be dropped off at the church clothing drive or chopped off at
the hair salon. When it gets under your skin, that's where it stays
unless extraordinary measures are taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so ridiculously mesmerized by the whole fashion thing,''
says Dr. Jeff Ptak, a Phoenix plastic surgeon who removes tattoos
by laser treatment. ``Most of fashion is here today and gone
tomorrow, but this is one that's here today and here tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, it may become a widespread concern, and not just for
the gaudily decorated Dennis Rodmans among us. Tattoo removal has a
big downside: It's costly, time-consuming and not always completely
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Rosenberg, a dermatologist who also uses laser to
remove tattoos, insists that the trend hasn't peaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got back from Telluride, (Colo.), and I've never seen
so many people with new tattoos,'' Rosenberg says. ``People don't
see the big picture. They don't see that it might not be to their
advantage in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg refers to his office in north Phoenix as the ``Room of
Regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People live for the moment _ especially the young,'' he says.
``The mind-set is the permanence of it. They think they're
immortal, and then something happens to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like youthful feelings of indestructibility, body art is hardly
new. The word ``tattoo'' comes from the Tahitian ``tatu,'' meaning
``to mark something,'' and Egyptians used tattoos to indicate
social ranking as early as 2000 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese once used tattoos to mark convicted criminals, but
that changed around A.D. 1700, when only members of Japan's royal
family were permitted to wear embroidered clothing. Outsiders began
getting tattoos to adorn themselves without breaking that law.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the first electric tattoo machine was patented in
1891, tattooing began to catch on in the United States. In the late
1950s, it was outlawed for a time in New York City when a boy
contracted blood poisoning from being tattooed with an unsterilized
needle. A hepatitis outbreak in 1961 also resulted in a ban on
tattooing in parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona passed a law in 1996 requiring the presence of a parent
or guardian for those younger than age 18 wishing to be tattooed.
Even so, underage teens are getting tattoos, often from
less-than-reputable sources.
</P>
<P>
   Gang members make up a sizable percentage of this group, and
Ptak is involved in a Phoenix program designed to help them lose
the tattoos and find a positive direction in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a survival aspect to this (for gang members),'' Ptak
says. ``If you're branded, you're a target from now on. There's a
lot of indiscriminate violence because of tattoos.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, there are two options for altering a tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   The first is to have it covered over by another design. This
accounts for a fair amount of business at tattoo parlors,
particularly among lovelorn customers. (John has split up with
Nancy, but there's one big problem: He's still wearing her name _
and in a very private place.)
</P>
<P>
   The other option is to have the tattoo lasered off. Dr. Mark
Meyers, who works with Rosenberg at the Dermatology, Vein &AMP; Laser
Institute, says a tattoo of 4 square inches that cost $100 may cost
10 times that to remove.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of lasering is that it leaves little or no
scarring, unlike surgical excision (cutting the tattoo out),
dermabrasion (scrubbing the skin away), salabrasion (using salt to
abrade the tattoo) or chemical peels (using acid to burn away
layers of skin). Although not painless, there is considerably less
discomfort with lasering than with the other methods.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the process works: The laser emits a short pulse of
intense light, which passes through the top layers of skin, where
it is selectively absorbed by the tattoo ink. This breaks up the
ink into smaller pieces, which can be more easily excreted by the
immune system. Normally, the tattoo fades.
</P>
<P>
   Darker-skinned people may have a slight ``halo'' where the
tattoo was, although normal pigmentation usually returns, Meyers
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laser is the state of the art _ there is nothing better,'' he
says. ``The '90s lasers are really fine-tuned for the target.
They're very precise. The skin is spared as far as the technology
will allow.''
</P>
<P>
   Most tattoos require six to 10 treatments to remove, Meyers
says, and several weeks must be allowed between treatments for the
skin to heal and for the body to remove the maximum amount of ink.
</P>
<P>
   Dianna Workman _ tattooed from shoulder to wrist on both arms
and from knee to ankle on both legs _ has been going to Meyers for
treatment for five years and is far from finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say a tattoo is fine if it's in a place you can
readily cover in a social situation,'' Meyers says. ``But if it's
not, often you can't go anywhere in your career. I've had guys
working for major corporations who have been told, `You've got to
get that off, or you won't be promoted.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen tattoos everywhere _ and I mean everywhere _ on
people's bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Tattooed makeup is very difficult to remove, and eyeliner is
impossible because of the dangers involved in working so close to
the eye with the laser.
</P>
<P>
   All of which seems to be of little consequence to the customers
seen by Dick Goldman, proprietor of three Blue Dragon tattoo
parlors in the Phoenix area and Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   If tattoos are an acquired taste, most have acquired it well
before they become marked men and women, Goldman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people made up their mind a long time ago and are
prepared for it,'' he says. ``Most people who aren't prepared don't
get one.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory is that everybody should have at least one tattoo,
and preferably more.'' &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ One of America's newest embassy buildings has been
three decades in the making and tens of millions of dollars
over-budget.
</P>
<P>
   But don't blame simple government inefficiency, at least not
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The main culprit was Cold War spying.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-story chancery building rising above the U.S. embassy
complex in downtown Moscow is cloaked in white tarpaulins to mask
the work inside from prying eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The tarps also are a reminder of one of the biggest blunders in
the history of international espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1979 using Soviet workers and materials, construction
of the building proceeded apace until 1985. As the work was winding
down, mortified U.S. officials discovered the entire structure had
been laced with microscopic listening devices -- thousands of them.
</P>
<P>
   The red brick building was dubbed ``The Great Transmitter'' and
remained empty until work resumed several years ago with a target
completion date of late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstruction uses materials and construction workers are
imported from America and carefully screened by U.S. security.
Construction workers are not allowed to talk about their work or
even acknowledge the reason they are in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have lopped off the top two floors of what was an
eight-story building and are rebuilding four new floors on top.
They were unable to extract all the bugs from the lower floors, but
stripped much of what they could.
</P>
<P>
   The building, originally projected in 1979 to cost $72 million,
will cost U.S. taxpayers $240 million or more. An early proposal to
raze the building and start over was rejected as too costly.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 300 construction workers are housed in temporary
shelters on the site. It is not open to tours for the press or
public. Most embassy employees have never been inside either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unique for a working embassy. We have a construction
site in the middle of our complex that we can say very little
about,'' said embassy spokesman Michael Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the secrecy is to mask the components of a
building that will house America's spies. The Cold War may be over
but their work goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The new upper floors will be occupied by embassy staff
conducting classified business -- presumably the CIA, defense and
political analysts and the ambassador and other diplomats. The
lower six levels, which still may have listening devices embedded
in the concrete foundations, will be used by staff conducting
non-sensitive work.
</P>
<P>
   The delay had one positive effect. The new building will include
modern anti-terrorism security features -- including reinforced
walls, doors and windows -- that did not exist when it was
conceived.
</P>
<P>
   It also will have air-conditioning, which the current main
building at the complex does not. The original brick will be
replaced with a white limestone and glass facade.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy compound covers a city block near the Russian White
House and includes offices, living quarters for some diplomats and
their families and facilities for expatriate Americans, including a
day-care center, school and swimming pool.

   CAMP MCGOVERN, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ For U.S. Army Pvt. John
Wilbur, the difference between Fort Hood, Texas and his new station
here is simple. In Bosnia, he has to sleep on a cot.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect this 17-year-old Albany, Ga. native, who's been
in the Army all of six months, to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sleep anywhere,'' Wilbur says in a Southern drawl, while
downing a pizza at the Rose Garden Cafe near the center of this
camp. ``I'm in the Army ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur is one of about 5,000 soldiers from the U.S. Army 1st
Cavalry Division at Fort Hood deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina last
month to relieve peacekeeping troops from a several U.S. bases in
Germany -- the majority of a total force of 6,900.
</P>
<P>
   While canvas folding cots may be the first thing Wilbur noticed
about his new assignment, bombed-out buildings and boredom may be
what he remembers most from his tour in this war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
   If he's lucky, he may get a break from radio duty once in a
while to go out on patrols of the area. The patrols roam villages
and towns along the Zone of Separation (ZOS), a narrow
three-mile-wide strip of land that winds through Bosnia and
separates the former combatants. Armed with M-16 and .50-caliber
machine guns mounted on Humvees, the patrols cover a 9,000-square
mile area about the size of Maine to reassure the masses that NATO
will not let a war start again here.
</P>
<P>
   Around Camp McGovern, there are reminders of the suffering that
was a way of life here when war gripped this country for years.
Entire neighborhoods in the ZOS still lie in ruins. And even
several miles away, in Brcko (pronounced ``Burch-Ko''), the nearest
city, the once thriving downtown is riddled with blown-out
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. soldiers are among 33,000 NATO peacekeeping troops in
Bosnia enforcing the military provisions of the Dayton Peace
Accords which, in 1995, ended the four-year ethnic war caused by
the break-up of Yugoslavia. Immediately following the U.S.-brokered
cease-fire in December 1995, the International Stabilization Force,
or SFOR, disarmed the three combatants -- the Bosniak Muslims,
Croat Catholics and Serbian Orthodox Christians -- and began
working to rebuild the war-torn country and re-establish peace in
the once multi-ethnic society.
</P>
<P>
   That job may have been made all the more difficult by the
elections in mid-September that resulted in anti-Western candidates
making significant gains in the Serbian state that surrounds the
40-acre Camp McGovern -- one of six in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- on
three sides.
</P>
<P>
   But if Wilbur doesn't get on a patrol now and then, he may spend
the next six months inside the camp, never even getting a peek at
the local politics or the fall-out from the elections.
</P>
<P>
   He, and his comrades from Fort Hood, also may not get a chance
to see how the locals feel about the presence of U.S. soldiers
here.
</P>
<P>
   The one group that seems to make the biggest impression on the
soldiers are the children. And like so many of the soldiers from
Fort Hood, Staff Sgt. Lonnie Radabaugh worries about the children
he sees when he's out on patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the children all wave to us,'' he said during a
recent patrol. ``You wonder what they've gone through, how they'll
grow up in all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Few soldiers here who've been on patrol are not stunned by the
level of devastation. At the same time, however, they are just as
heartened by the efforts to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really interesting to see how hard these people are
working to get their lives back together,'' Pfc. John Brumley,
originally of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, said during a break on a recent
patrol. ``Every day when we go out on patrol, that's all they're
doing, working to rebuild their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   While some in the U.S. Congress argue about how long American
forces should stay in Bosnia, U.S. soldiers who have been living in
tents here since 1995 began to build wood huts a few months ago in
camps like McGovern. By the end of the year, Army officials here
expect to have the approximately 1,000 soldiers at McGovern living
indoors, just in time for the worst of the usually wet Yugoslavian
winter. (The remaining 4,000 Fort Hood troops are also expected to
move into wood huts.)
</P>
<P>
   The new officer in charge of the camp sees his mission as a
long-term one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just pull out, then general war starts again; and if
that happens and it starts spreading to other countries in Europe,
then we've got to come back in at great risk of loss of life,''
said Lt. Col. Mike Ryan, of New York City. ``It takes awhile. It's
not just cut and dried, 'OK, the war's over, now let's all get back
together.' It takes a long-term commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern isn't the only camp to get better accommodations for
soldiers in the past few months. Once President Clinton decided in
June to extend the troops' mission, the Army started improving
facilities all over Bosnia. A permanent dining facility is being
built at Camp Comanche, about 37 miles south of Camp McGovern, and
a larger and more permanent hospital facility at Eagle Base, the
main U.S. installation in Bosnia -- located in Tuzla, south of
Brcko.
</P>
<P>
   With the extension, Army officials said they're working hard to
keep the soldiers from getting too bored, or too homesick.
McGovern, for example, has a cafe, pool hall and gym. Soldiers,
also can take college courses and participate in basketball
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   There's no alcohol on the base, or at any of the U.S.
installations in Bosnia, however, so the soldiers have to settle
for the Army's idea of good clean fun. They can call home for 15
minutes every week for free and Ryan is having a computer room set
up so they can e-mail friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of young kids, separated from wives for first
time,'' said First Sgt. Kevin Kenneally, of Killeen, Texas, a
23-year Army veteran. ``Those are the ones you have to be careful
with. They will get bored if they don't do something.
</P>
<P>
   I've told my company, all staff sergeants and below will be
involved in correspondence courses,'' he said. ``It soaks up a lot
of their time, and it's good for their career advancement.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the limitations, most of the soldiers from Fort Hood
were surprised at how well they live at McGovern, compared to the
conditions for which they were trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as bad as what we thought it would be,'' said Pfc.
Ernest Curtis, of Austin, Texas. He said the extra pay he gets for
being in a hazardous area, and the experience of serving in a
peacekeeping mission are probably the best aspects of being
stationed in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no bad things,'' he said, pausing to think for a
moment. ``Well, there are no dance floors, no country bars and no
beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he plans to offer Curtis and the rest of the Fort Hood
soldiers a taste of home in the next few days by raising the Texas
flag under Old Glory.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After terrorist bombs exploded at two U.S.
embassies in east Africa, killing more than 250 people late this
summer, they set off demands for tighter security at American
outposts around the world and something else, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy is raising questions about how American diplomacy
should be conducted in the age of faxes, e-mail and 24-hour news
broadcasts. Some experts are asking if the United States still
needs highly visible and vulnerable embassies in almost every
nation, regardless of size or influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the world's only superpower, the U.S. needs to have a
presence in every country, but that does not mean having
full-fledged, costly embassies everywhere,'' said John Schall, a
senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The research center, with a steering committee that includes
several former cabinet officers and former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn,
is one of two groups expected to unveil proposals this fall on how
American diplomacy could jump from an embassy system rooted in the
horse-and-carriage era into the 21st-century of instant
communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have recommendations on what we call 'right-sizing'
embassy staffs'' and much greater use of communications technology,
said Schall.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, any attempt at a major overhaul is likely to meet
with resistance at the State Department, where the policy of having
an accredited embassy in every nation has long been treated as
sacrosanct when it comes to promoting U.S. interests abroad. In
addition, agency officials argue that it is not the
brick-and-mortar structure that is the true terrorist target, but
American ``ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the deadly Aug. 7 bombings of the embassies in Nigeria
and Tanzania suggest that changes could be crucial, Schall said.
``The question is not only, 'Is the building sufficiently secure?',
but secondly -- and Washington hasn't begun to grapple with this
yet -- 'Maybe we had too many people as a big target?'''
</P>
<P>
   The United States now operates embassies in 162 countries in
addition to about 100 consulate and other smaller overseas
missions, for a cost of more than $2 billion a year. Rebuilding the
demolished embassies and reinforcing security for others is
expected to add $1.8 billion more in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, an embassy requires at least one building, a
contingent of U.S. Marine Corps guards, and a staff of up to
several hundred Americans, usually including intelligence agents
working either tacitly in the open or undercover. That's in
addition to support staff, drivers, a motor pool, and a doctor or
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The overseas presence has hardly been reduced in the past
decade, despite the end of the Cold War and its ideological
struggle against communism that once extended to the remote corners
of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Cold War we had to make a statement about who we were
so that we could win hearts and minds'' and the votes of every
possible nation in the United Nations, said Charles A. Schmitz, a
retired State Department diplomat. That meant providing Peace Corps
volunteers, scholarships to U.S. colleges, as well as aid and
advice on issues ranging from currency to education, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now an international business consultant and president of Global
Access Institute, Schmitz is among 63 experts who are developing a
blueprint for ``diplomacy in the information age'' to be issued
soon by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
private Washington research group.
</P>
<P>
   Embassies are ``bloated with functions and personnel'' and still
relying on out-moded cables for official communications instead of
computer e-mail, according to Schmitz. He said that the United
States has resisted new information technology that could reduce
overseas postings.
</P>
<P>
   Budget cuts have, in fact, forced the State Department to cut
its overseas personnel by more than 2,500 over the past decade. But
the total number of U.S. personnel abroad has remained static
because domestic U.S. agencies have simultaneously increased their
overseas postings -- by 25 percent between 1988-1998.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement agents from the FBI and the Drug Enforcement
Agency are increasingly going abroad to investigate crime and
terrorism. The Agriculture Department is sending more workers
abroad to push credit sales of U.S. farm products, and Commerce
Department officials assist U.S. business interests overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, these disparate functions are housed at the U.S.
embassies, such as the one in Mexico City, which has so many U.S.
agencies that it is now a microcosm of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Schall defended some of the expansion abroad as necessary, but
added, ``Certainly a portion of this is some agencies ...
turf-grabbing. There's some over-staffing, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ideas that reformers say would improve the efficiency,
and perhaps the safety, for U.S. diplomats:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Regional hub'' embassies that could serve several countries.
The United States has experimented with that idea in Barbados,
where the ambassador has responsibility for seven nearby Caribbean
countries. Also, the British have ambassadors accredited to four
countries apiece in Africa. ``These could serve as models for a
U.S. diplomatic reorganization in other regions beyond the
Caribbean,'' said Benjamin F. Nelson of the U.S. General Accounting
Office, the investigating arm of Congress, in a report last year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A gradual shift from full-service embassies to much smaller
and less visible missions for many developing countries, including
several in Africa. ``By having a building and making it a big
symbol of ourselves with the flag and Marines, we're creating a
hostage for terrorists,'' Schmitz said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use of the latest communications technology to gather much of
the information that was once done by embassy staff.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats ``have only just scratched the surface of what
the information revolution makes possible,'' Schmitz said. The U.S.
government could hire private services to track developments in
smaller countries, rather than posting a highly paid foreign
service officer in an embassy to gather marginal information and
relay it to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A new mobile diplomatic team that could be sent to reinforce
small missions in times of emergency. That approach would mirror
the rapid deployment forces used by the U.S. military, Schall said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Scaling back big embassy staffs such as those in London and
Paris, now that the Cold War has ended some of the demand for
intelligence-gathering.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Leaving non-essential functions to private enterprise. For
example, the Uited States Information Agency and other government
news operations were part of the Cold War effort to ``sell'' the
American way of life. Now citizens of countries around the world
are buying Hollywood's movies and music, adopting American clothing
styles and tuning into American television programs and CNN's
international newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Those studying such changes acknowledged that it would take a
major effort to enact them over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an interview last week(CQ), Assistant Secretary of
State Patrick F. Kennedy rejected most of the ideas being examined,
starting with suggestions for reducing the overseas presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see that the State Department staff could be any
smaller than it is right now,'' said Kennedy, who oversees embassy
properties and security. ``These other agencies (with overseas
officials) have a mission which promotes U.S. national interests''
such as trade assistance for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said that the end of the Cold War meant adding more
embassies, 14 new ones for the countries that were in the old
Soviet empire. As for the suggestion that a lower profile for U.S.
outposts would be a reduced target for terrorists, Kennedy said,
``That's a ludicrous concept to say that size has anything to do
with it. Terrorists attack our ideals, and they will attack us
wherever we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy readily acknowledged that his department was
technologically backward, however. ``Over half of our computer
systems, our telephone systems, and our overseas radio systems are
antiquated,'' he said, adding that they would be updated as soon as
funding permitted.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of this backwardness, when Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright visited Moscow last year, she participated in an
interactive conversation with students on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is bringing us closer together,'' she wrote on the
computer screen, according to a news release. ``This will make us
all wiser, quicker to understand each other, and better able to
work together on the world's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony was that she was typing her message on computers that
belonged to the U.S. Information Agency because the State
Department's Moscow embassy had no link to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Updating the information systems as well as other updates for
U.S. diplomacy could be slow coming. ``You're dealing with a
culture,'' said Schall, whose Stimson Center study will be released
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' he said. ``The State Department needs to come
into the 21st century, and it's still in the 19th.''

allowed to sell to local consumers free of middlemen mark-ups and
other trade tariffs. The steps kept prices low and prevented
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Ayatskov, 47, identified by President Boris Yeltsin himself as a
rising young star who may be president someday, warned that if the
national government cannot fix Russia's problems ``undoubtedly the
governors will unite their efforts to solve the problems
themselves,'' he told the Cox News Service in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   The central authority of Moscow has been undermined by the
economic turmoil in Russia, prompting governors across the
country's 89 regions to usurp the role of the federal government --
and in some cases to defy it in mutinous fashion. Some regions have
threatened to withhold tax revenues from Moscow, print their own
currencies and commandeer
</P>
<P>
   industries.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Yvegeny Primakov summoned the
powerful regional governors to a meeting in Moscow and urged them
not to splinter the country. ``We must put an end to feudal
attitudes,'' Primakov told them, ``or we shall lose Russia as a
single state.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Russia break apart, as the Soviet Union did seven years
ago? The prospect seems unlikely, according to many political
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a rhetorical question increasingly pondered in Moscow.
The power shift has forced Primakov's still-fledgling government to
give regional governors -- who comprise the upper house of
parliament -- a more formal role in national policymaking.
</P>
<P>
   Rumblings from the regions began even before the shock of
mid-August and have been plentiful amid the uncertainty and
hardships since the ruble and banking system collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian consumers have been faced with massive price increases
and food shortages. The unstable ruble has plunged to half its
value since the crisis broke in mid-August. What's more, recent
government forecasts now show that inflation could reach 300
percent or more by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Lebed, the retired army general and governor of the
huge Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia, sent an open letter to Moscow
in late July demanding that servicemen at an intercontinental
ballistic missile base in his district be paid their back wages.
Lebed said he was ``seriously thinking'' of establishing
jurisdiction over the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in Krasnoyarsk are not rich yet,'' he wrote, ``but in
exchange for the status of a nuclear territory we could feed the
formation and become a headache for the world community along with
India and Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebed's younger brother, who is governor of the adjoining region
of Khakassia, was among at least six regional leaders who
threatened to withhold tax payments to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Samara Governor Konstantin Titov is building his region's own
gold reserve by bartering with the gold-producing Siberian region
of Sakha (formerly known as Yakutia), which in return gets food
shipments.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Russia's regions are poor, not rich. The number of
``donor'' regions -- those that contribute more to the federal
coffers than they get back -- fell from 20 in 1994 to eight this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the depressed Murmansk region of the far north, officials,
without consulting with Moscow, declared a state of emergency
earlier this month and appealed directly for international
humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Already there have been pledges of food aid due to be sent this
month from Norway, Finland and Sweden designated for orphanages and
pensioners. The area has relied on food aid, which have been
falling steadily, since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said vice-governor Igor Chernyshenko, is that
Murmansk is in the far north with a short growing season. ``Besides
potatoes, there is little that can grow here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worry is that Moscow continues its politics as usual while
the financial situation grows worse,'' added a Western diplomat in
Moscow. ``Were that to happen, I think we will see regions,
particularly the strong regions, attempting to assert their de
facto independence and the poor regions following them, not
Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, Saratov has been a region of relative
prosperity thanks to Ayatskov's tireless pursuit of foreign
investment to revitalize decrepit Soviet-era factories.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Case, the Wisconsin-based manufacture of farm
machinery, began negotiations in April with the regional government
in Saratov on a $140 million joint venture and, in the first step,
delivered 100 combines in June. But further progress on using a
factory
</P>
<P>
   in Saratov to assemble combines are on hold amid the economic
turmoil in Russia. ``We'd like to move forward as soon as we can.
The fit is right, but the economics are not,'' said Case spokesman
William Masterson.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Saratov is an attractive place for Western firms to do
business. But the economic crisis has for now forced Case to put
its plans on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Ayatskov complains that the current crisis has cost his region
$800 million in foreign investment that now will not come. Yet
Ayatskov claims no desire for independence or more economic
autonomy, only for a strong and unified Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good politician, he seems to be reading his
constituency well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of animosity. There is even more despair,''
said Lilya Chudaeva, editor of a local Saratov newspaper, Pokrovski
Vesti. ``And a lot of it is aimed at Moscow.''

 CORRECTION: Correcting the slug 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The announcement of the prestigious Mercury Music
Prize two weeks ago in London was a shock to everyone _ especially
the members of Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   The five young musicians, who recorded their award-winning debut
album on a shoestring in bedrooms and garages over the space of a
year, don't produce the Brit-centric pop of fellow nominees like
Pulp, Massive Attack and the Verve.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gomez is steeped in Americana, proudly pointing to such
landmark acts as Little Feat, the Band, Dr. John and Captain
Beefheart as signposts on the way to developing a unique sound.
</P>
<P>
   Tunes from Gomez's hard-to-pigeonhole album, ``Bring It On''
(Virgin), include ``Tijuana Lady,'' which could be an Eagles
outtake, and ``Free to Run,'' which late Little Feat leader Lowell
George would've been happy to call his own. The surreal-sounding
first single, ``78 Stone Wobble,'' recalls Beck.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very American feel to the record,'' admits Gomez
singer-keyboardist Tom Gray. ``It's almost exclusively American
music we listen to. But bands coming along and experimenting with
American music because they love it is a constant theme in British
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez _ the name was borrowed from the last name of a friend _
appears Saturday with Eagle-Eye Cherry at the El Rey Theatre in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were five guys bored with the contemporary music scene in
Britain,'' Gray said this week. ``And that's not a good thing for
five people who are in love with music. We couldn't find what we
wanted, so we went out and did it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The British rock weekly New Musical Express dubbed ``Bring It
On'' one of the most ``assured, poised, hilarious, out-there ...
enjoyable albums in living memory.''
</P>
<P>
   The five guys in Gomez, none of whom is older than 21, came
together two years ago, but at least two members have been friends
since their childhood in Southport, near Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   Holed up in a cold garage, huddled over their amps and tape
console, the group cut ``Bring It On'' before ever performing
onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened very naturally,'' Gray said. ``When we play
together, that's the sound that comes out. The recording was five
friends having fun. It was recorded in bedrooms, garages _ all over
the shop. We had a little old 4-track tape machine that was
half-broken and you had to balance a book on the power supply to
make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   After Gomez signed to Virgin, the tapes were taken to a
full-service studio, where the roughest parts were re-recorded. But
the slightly murky lo-fi quality adds to the disc's warm, bluesy
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs have always been the basis of Gomez,'' Gray said. ``We
love songs. I mean, we like to play with the structures, but I
think the most important medium in music is the song. Five years
ago, when the dance scene was at its height, people were saying
songs don't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today, even dance music has gotten very song-oriented.
That's because the song is too strong culturally. It means too much
to too many people. There's nothing better than a great song.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody picked ``Bring It On'' to bag the Mercury Prize. Among
the 12 competing albums were acclaimed efforts from such
top-selling acts as the Verve, Massive Attack, Portishead, Robbie
Williams, Asian Dub Foundation and Cornershop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just felt fantastic,'' Gray recalled. ``We weren't
expecting it. A lot of the people who work around us were willing
us to win, but certainly it came as a huge shock. It's difficult to
quantify what an award means to anyone. But it sure felt nice. This
was an album we made in our spare time for the love of it.''

CHINATOWN TENANTS SEEK ACTION AGAINST NEGLECT, FILTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Behind the facade of Chinatown's red lanterns,
roast ducks and herb shops is the real Chinatown _ the one where
residents live with filth, squalor and constant neglect.
</P>
<P>
   While unresponsive landlords must take some of the blame, tenant
advocates in San Francisco say the city is just as much at fault
for the substandard conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Mar, executive director of the Chinese Progressive
Association, said that if the Department of Building Inspections
``is here to enforce the housing code, they're not doing a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents on Wednesday delivered a list of more than 100 code
violations to the department in an effort to ensure that problems
such as cockroaches, rats, peeling paint and leaky ceilings are
handled properly.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was coordinated by the Chinese Progressive
Association, which conducted a housing survey in Chinatown last
summer. It found that 85.6 percent of the 208 randomly selected
residents reported at least one problem in their buildings. More
than 60 percent reported at least two.
</P>
<P>
   The most common problems were insect or rodent infestation,
peeling paint, lack of heat, no stove or a broken stove, and
leaking or broken toilets.
</P>
<P>
   While Mar did not charge the inspection department with
negligence in any specific cases, he said the department was not
doing enough in Chinatown and other low-income neighborhoods to
ensure safe living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The department ``is not being very aggressive or effective about
enforcing the code, so there's not a lot of motivation for
landlords to cooperate with tenants,'' Mar said.
</P>
<P>
   David Serrano Sewell, a spokesman for the Department of Building
Inspections, said all complaints are taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not ignoring Chinatown,'' he said. ``Any complaint is
responded to within one to three days.''
</P>
<P>
   The department has one building inspector for each of the 17
districts in the city. Besides responding to complaints, the
department inspects all buildings on a regular basis, Sewell said.
</P>
<P>
   The department gets about 4,000 complaints a year. So far this
year, 62 have come from Chinatown _ no higher or lower than other
neighborhoods, Sewell said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the department is not responsible for resolving
problems with vermin, broken stoves or lack of heat, a building
inspector would have to note such violations and refer them to the
appropriate city department, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinatown is one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in
the country and among the oldest in San Francisco. Sixty percent of
the housing consists of residential hotels, Mar said. Chinatown
residents are largely elderly and low-income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the broader housing crisis in San Francisco now, where
it is extremely difficult for people to find affordable housing,
the landlords do have a lot of power,'' Mar said.

TECHNOLOGY DAZZLES IN DREAMWORKS' `ANTZ' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DreamWorks Pictures' first animated feature, ``Antz'' is
certainly no ``Bambi,'' but it is a visually engaging and
moderately entertaining fantasy that makes another eye-popping
showcase for the fast-evolving art of computer animation.
</P>
<P>
   The first of two big-budget, computer-animated features about
humanoid insects on Hollywood's fall release schedule (the other is
Disney's ``A Bug's Life,'' due Nov. 25), it's short on heart, but
dazzling to the eye and filled to the brim with familiar movie-star
voices.
</P>
<P>
   Its rather flippant storyline is about an angst-ridden worker
ant (voice of Woody Allen), who can't quite get into the narrow
regimentation of colony life, and dreams of individuality and a
more meaningful and fulfilling existence.
</P>
<P>
   One evening at an ant dance hall, he meets the colony's slumming
princess (Sharon Stone), and falls in love with her. Desperate to
see her again, he illegally trades places with a soldier-ant pal
(Sylvester Stallone) so he can pass before the royals in a parade
of troops.
</P>
<P>
   For his trouble, he's thrown into an epic battle with a
neighboring termite, and a series of circumstances that finally
propel him and his princess out of the colony and into
``Insectopia'' _ the enticing-if-perilous upper world of New York's
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its benign PG-rating, ``Antz'' is not the greatest film
for small children. Its termite battle scenes are as explicit as
``Starship Troopers,'' the storyline is no Aesop's Fable and it
simply doesn't deliver the kind of cuddly characters that will make
a tot warm up to its rather cold vision of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Directors Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson and their team of writers
also go for a tongue-in-cheek, hip humor that seems aimed at an
older audience, or designed to show off the special talents of
Woody Allen and a star-heavy supporting vocal cast that includes
Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lopez, Anne Bancroft,
Danny Glover, Jane Curtin and Dan Aykroyd.
</P>
<P>
   But it's impossible not to be impressed with the technology that
has gone into this sumptuous computer-generated vision of insect
life _ which already seems to have advanced a generation or two
since 1995's ``Toy Story.'' In every way, the CG-imagery appears
amazingly fluid, less mechanical and more life-like than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the vast ant crowd scenes _ with seemingly hundreds of
thousands of individual figures, each doing a different thing in
the frame _ literally take your breath away. Whatever else you say
about ``Antz,'' it creates its own epic world, and it makes us
eager to see what the same studio will do with its even more
expensive, more ballyhooed, animated-Moses story, ``Prince of
Egypt,'' come Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Antz. Directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson. Screenplay by
Todd Alcott, Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz. Voices: Woody Allen,
Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Walken,
Jennifer Lopez. DreamWorks Pictures. 77 minutes. Rated PG for
insect violence.

DESPITE SOME EMOTIONAL IMPACT, `WHEN DREAMS MAY COME' DISAPPOINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any movie set almost entirely in the afterlife seems doomed to a
certain kind of failure from the start. There's simply no way to
deal seriously with the subject without wandering into the realm of
theology _ and making a quasi-religious statement.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Ward's ``When Dreams May Come'' might have had better
luck had it tried to be a more gentle, transcendental, even New Age
vision of the sweet hereafter _ or an audacious and original vision
like ``The Rapture,'' which left itself open to a variety of
interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Bass's script is so grounded in Hollywood imperatives,
and so intent on being acceptable to all denominations and points
of view, that _ despite its undeniably striking visuals _ the film
comes off as being weak and unconvincing on one hand, and shrill
and fundamentalist on the other.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of a New York doctor (Robin Williams) who, after
his two children have been killed in an automobile accident, has
painstakingly rebuilt his life and his relationship with his
grieving wife (Annabella Sciorra), an artist and art historian.
</P>
<P>
   When he is killed in a second car accident, he finds himself in
a pleasant if disorienting and wildly inconsistent heaven, where he
learns the ropes from his long deceased medical mentor (Cuba
Gooding Jr.), and gradually is reunited with his dead children.
</P>
<P>
   He soon learns, however, that, in her grief over losing her
entire family, his wife has committed suicide, thereby dooming
herself to an everlasting hell more gruesome than anything in the
Book of Revelations. From here, the hero's quest is to rescue his
wife's soul and fully reunite the family.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Ward, the New Zealander director of ``Vigil'' and ``The
Navigator,'' has a special penchant for the metaphysical in his
films, and a strong visual sense that has expressed itself here in
a succession of stunning images, many of them conjured from
medieval paintings.
</P>
<P>
   And based on the number of people weeping around me in the
film's Seattle preview last week, ``Dreams'' definitely will have
an emotional impact and inspirational effect on many _ especially
those who recently may have lost a loved one, or those who embrace
a traditional religious point-of-view.
</P>
<P>
   But it never really connects as the quest-adventure it sets out
to be. Since we never quite ``know'' the rules of this afterlife,
we never get caught up in the hero's efforts to beat the system;
and the inevitable Hollywood happy ending comes as something of a
non sequitur.
</P>
<P>
   The film also is rather flat as a romance. The doctor's love for
his wife is developed in an overly slick title sequence and then
frequently stated, but never quite felt. The script makes the case
that they're timeless ``soulmates,'' but it's hard to fully
understand why.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the filmmakers risk critical damnation by setting
their last act in an Old Testament Vision of Hell-with-a-capital-H
_ fire, brimstone, millions of shipwrecked souls, a God of
Punishment. It steers the movie right out of the New Age and right
into the domain of Oral Roberts and Stephen King.
</P>
<P>
   What Dreams May Come. Directed by Vincent Ward. Screenplay by
Ron Bass. Cast: Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Annabella
Sciorra, Max Von Sydow. Polygram. 113 minutes. Rated PG-13 for
mature themes.

`IMPOSTERS' DUE REPRIMAND FOR IMPERSONATING A MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's not much to say about a comedy that falls as flat as
Stanley Tucci's ``The Impostors.'' As hilarious as it may have
seemed on paper, the writer-producer-director-star fails to bring
off even a single scene. Sitting through it is a grueling
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci's idea, apparently, was to pay tribute to Billy Wilder's
``Some Like It Hot'' with a '30s period farce about two failed New
York actors (Tucci and Oliver Platt) who have to go on the run
after they inadvertently assault a famous Shakespearean actor
(Alfred Molina) in a barroom brawl.
</P>
<P>
   When they hide aboard a ship bound for Paris (which, by the way,
Stanley, is not on the ocean), it turns out the offended famous
actor is also on board. So, to avoid detection, the guys must
disguise themselves all through the voyage as stewards, buxom
women, etc.
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of his ``Big Night'' success, Tucci has managed
to assemble an impressive cast of American Indie stars to join him
out on this long, perilous limb: Campbell Scott, Isabella
Rossellini, Steve Buscemi, Lili Taylor, Elizabeth Bracco, Hope
Davis, Tony Shalhoub, Billy Connolly, even Woody Allen.
</P>
<P>
   All will live to regret it. No one comes off well: The humor is
so tortuously hammy and slapsticky it makes even the best of them
look inept. The very concept makes no sense: Who would go on the
run for offending a second-rate actor? And why would anyone rip off
``Some Like it Hot'' and leave out the Marilyn Monroe character?
</P>
<P>
   The one thing you can say about ``The Impostors'' is that it's
easy to know where to put the blame for its failure. Tucci not only
writes and directs abysmally, he also delivers the film's most
thoroughly unappealing performance. And he can't keep the camera
off his face. He clearly thinks he's just adorable.
</P>
<P>
   But the film's real casualty could be Oliver Platt. Arguably
Hollywood's top character actor of the late '90s, he's so smothered
in Tucci's ego and mugging guest stars here that even he looks like
an amateur. As the current front-runner for the 1998
supporting-actor Oscar (``Bulworth'' ``Simon Birch''), this misfire
could cost him dearly.
</P>
<P>
   The Impostors. Directed and written by Stanley Tucci. Produced
by Tucci and Beth Alexander. Cast: Tucci, Oliver Platt, Alfred
Molina, Lili Taylor, Steve Buscemi, Campbell Scott. Fox
Searchlight. 102 minutes. Rated R for no obvious reason.

`NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY' IS HARMLESS FLUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things move in waves at the movies, and disco currently is the
craze. Whit Stillman's ``The Last Days Of Disco,'' was first out of
the gate. All those flaring white bell bottoms and wide-lapel suits
came back into style and one could almost hear the ghost of Donna
Summer wailing, ``Love to love you baby,'' again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Night at the Roxbury,'' which is a whole lot more fun and
memorable than the current box office dud ``54,'' a ``tell-all''
about New York's drug-addled, elite celebrity haunt, is the
surprise in a less-than-memorable pack.
</P>
<P>
   And that's high praise for a film that has very little going on
other than to feel the beat and heat of two bumbling, badly
coiffed, gold-chained brothers, Steve and Doug Butabi (Will Ferrell
and Chris Kattan), who want to score big with the babes in L.A.'s
finest club, The Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a ``Saturday Night Live'' skit, the siblings, played by
SNL regulars Ferrell and Kattan, follow in a long line of big
screen schlubs pulled from the ailing, long-running late-night
show. Steve and Doug silently bump and grind against every
available female on the dance floor in hopes they might actually
persuade one of them to engage in a one-nighter (not that either
brother would know what to do with a ``willing babe''). So far
they're batting zero.
</P>
<P>
   And there's another red flag that keeps the Butabi boys from
reaching the nirvana of being admitted to The Roxbury: ``No one
gets in unless you're on the list,'' barks the formidable bouncer.
It's been a bumpy ride fraught with rejection, but where there's a
will, there's a way.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell and Kattan, who embody Steve and Doug Butabi with a
vengeance and goofiness fringing on embarrassment, have broadened
the borders of their reptilian low-life skit by adding parents
(played by a spitting, shouting Dan Hedaya and a somnambulistic
Loni Anderson), as well as a dream; they want to open their own
nightclub _ one that will rival the allure and glamour of The
Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Night at the Roxbury'' is a terrible movie for the first
half hour, but then surprisingly, it finds its heartbeat, pulse and
pace and blossoms into an engaging, silly delight.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of working in daddy's Beverly Hills silk flower store and
even more exhausted over the endless rebuffs they've received while
trying to gain entrance into their dream disco, Steve and Doug
finally hit gold; they're rear-ended by ``21 Jump Street'' star
Richard Grieco, a regular at The Roxbury, who promises the boys
entree into eden to avoid a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Butabi's are thrilled. Who cares about daddy's crunched car?
Once inside the club they discover the new world. They catch the
eye of two ripe babes who mistakenly take the guys for rich
entrepreneurs because they've fumbled their way into the attentions
of the club's wealthy owner, Mr. Zedir (Chazz Palminteri).
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys ultimately gain a potential business partner. Only
dad stands in the way. How can they make their plan come to life?
Well, there's some psychology 101 to wade through. But in the long
run, this is pretty funny cotton candy tinged with Freudian
dysfunction. It has the depravity to humorously touch on brotherly
incest and the conflict between parents and siblings and how
expectations tear a aprat family _ even one as goofy as this.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you can't take any of it too seriously. In the end ``A
Night at the Roxbury'' is just that _ a night out that fades into a
light, pleasant memory in the morning. And there's no hangover.
</P>
<P>
   A Night at the Roxbury. Directed by John Fortenberry. Written by
Steve Koren, Will Ferrell, Chris Kattan. Cast: Will Ferrell, Chris
Kattan, Dan Hedaya, Loni Anderson, Richard Grieco, Chazz

language, sexual content.

`LOLITA' ON SCREEN WAS BETTER THE FIRST TIME AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, Stanley Kubrick's ``Lolita'' would seem to be
the rare movie classic that could stand a remake. After all, in the
movie climate of 1962, Kubrick had to dance all around the subject
of a 37-year-old man's lust for a 14-year-old ``nymphette.''
</P>
<P>
   And devotees of the book's author, Vladimir Nabokov, never have
completely forgiven Kubrick for so playing up the book's humor that
he turned the story into a farce. Surely the time has come for a
more serious treatment of a serious novel.
</P>
<P>
   But the new ``Lolita'' has fared badly. First of all, the
filmmakers badly underestimated what an inflammatory,
hysteria-inducing subject pedophilia is in late-'90s American
society. Truly, it is our last taboo.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, after the film was completed last year, the major
distributors refused to touch it. It finally made its debut on
cable earlier this year (after months in movie never-never land),
and even now it's getting only a modest, art-house theatrical
release.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, as good as the film is in many respects, the concept
of a more ``serious'' treatment of Nabokov's novel has proven to be
less appealing on celluloid than it did on paper. The story seems
to demand a heavy sense of irony, even comedy. Without it, the film
is a long 137 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious difference between the ``Lolitas'' is, of
course, the explicitness of the love scenes. Where the relationship
was mostly suggested in 1962, here we see the two mismatched lovers
in more than a few moments of steamy passion.
</P>
<P>
   But the more profound difference between the two versions may be
in the way they treat the central character of Humbert Humbert _
the refined, if sexually warped, European professor who marries an
annoying New England woman so he can be close to her 14 year-old
daughter, Lolita (who is, by the way, only 12 in Nabokov's novel).
</P>
<P>
   James Mason played him in the original as a fairly contemptible
lecher _ a classic dirty old man. But Jeremy Irons makes us believe
Humbert is profoundly in love, and Stephen Schiff's adaptation
gives him a compelling, even sympathetic, psychological motivation
for his stunted romantic tastes in females ``between the ages of
nine and 14.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Lolita'' is also a period piece: set in 1947, largely
on the road as HH and Lo tour the country. As always with the films
of Adrian Lyne (``Flashdance'') the film is a visual feast. Indeed,
his vision of backroads America _ motels, gas stations,
greasy-spoon diners, nostalgic road signs _ deserves an exhibition
in a museum.
</P>
<P>
   The script, however, is considerably less authentic. Lolita
talks about ``zits'' and even has a ``See you later alligator/After
while crocodile'' exchange with a friend _ a full decade before
Bill Haley and his Comets popularized the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   The performances could hardly be better. Irons is agonizingly
believable as a man lost in a hopeless and destructive love affair;
and 15 year-old newcomer Dominque Swain is just as credible as the
selfish, shallow object of his affection. As a portrait of tragic
sexual obsession, the new ``Lolita'' recalls ``Of Human Bondage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film somehow pales in comparison with Kubrick's
sassier, less sexually explicit rendition. As misguided and
self-indulgent as he may have become in his later career, Kubrick's
filmmaking instincts were dead right in 1962: to fly as a film, a
grotesque subject like the love affair of ``Lolita'' requires a
sense of the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Lolita. Directed by Adrian Lyne. Screenplay by Stephen Schiff.
Cast: Jeremy Irons, Dominque Swain, Melanie Griffith, Frank
Langella. Goldwyn. 137 minutes. Rated R for sex scenes.

PREPARATIONS CAN MAKE A VISIT TO ST. PETERSBURG A TRUE DELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ As the guide marched us into a prized
temporary exhibit at The Hermitage in St. Petersburg, perhaps the
world's greatest art museum, she barked out a classic Russian tour
order: ``Ten minutes for the Cezanne. Ten minutes!''
</P>
<P>
   We begged 15 minutes and later negotiated a half-hour for the
incredible collection of French Impressionist paintings, much of it
confiscated from Czarist businessmen by Bolshevik authorities after
the 1917 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   There are no gains without pains, however. We were given less
than 10 minutes for the Dutch and Flemish masters, including the
museum's 25 Rembrandts. And we were made to march without stopping
through the Egyptian collection.
</P>
<P>
   Often called ``The Venice of the North'' for its architecture,
beauty and setting by water, St. Petersburg was founded in 1703 by
Peter the Great, who created out of a swamp the most northerly of
the world's great cities. The headstrong czar laid the foundation
after his victory over the Swedes in the Great Northern War.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 300 years later, in touring the city, Americans will feel
almost on a military timetable while visiting such famous
attractions as the Hermitage and the Peter and Paul Fortress.
</P>
<P>
   Dawdle to photograph reflections in the Neva River, or buy a Red
Army flask at a kiosk, and the guide will upbraid you in tones
reminiscent of those Marshal Georgi Zhukov upbraiding subordinates
while he was directing the defense that turned back Nazi armies at
the gates of the city in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   We spent about a week touring St. Petersburg and its environs in
mid-August, just as Russia's currency crisis began. Even in its
elegance, in the midst of baroque palaces and great neoclassical
buildings, visiting Russia's ``Window on Europe'' had the feel of
third-world travel.
</P>
<P>
   The international airport was dingy. Beaten-up cabs waited to
transport visitors at a fare to be negotiated. The streets seem to
have last been resurfaced when Stalin was in power. Hookers
inhabited lobbies of the few swank hotels. Beggars waited outside
the gate of Tikhvin Cemetery, where famed composers
Rimsky-Korsakov, Mussorgsky, Borodin and Tchaikovsky are buried.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we found the city enchanting. So will anybody who
remembers a quartet of informal guidelines used by adventure-minded
Americans to navigate in the globe's disorganized places.
</P>
<P>
   Advance preparation: Before you go anywhere near St. Petersburg,
invest in enough time to learn about the place. The Baedeker guide
is excellent for basic sightseeing. Harrison Salisbury's ``The 900
Days'' (Da Capo, 635 pages, $18.95) is indispensable for treatment
of the World War II siege of the city _ then called Leningrad _ in
which 1.1 million people died.
</P>
<P>
   Although out of print, Suzanne Massie's ``Pavlovsk'' should be
hunted up at the library. It tells the history of a great czarist
summer palace, its destruction at the hands of German occupiers,
and its painstaking 25-year restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Why do such work? Because you will know the origins of a faded
blue sign on Nevsky Prospect: ``Danger from enemy artillery.'' Or,
touring the Peter and Paul Fortress, you will come upon _ and have
some understanding of _ Mikhail Shemyakin's controversial
avant-garde statue of Peter the Great, with its tiny head, massive
body and spindly fingers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Russian Museum, you'll know where to find striking
paintings by Kandinsky, as well as paens to Stalin in the style
authorities dubbed ``Socialist Realism.''
</P>
<P>
   The get acquainted tour: Even if it means a forced march, take
an official tour to get a fix on what's located where. Once you
find out how not to get lost in The Hermitage, then you can return
on your own timetable and lose yourself in The Hermitage.
</P>
<P>
   A bus ride will identify wonderful walks. Just in back of the
Russian Museum, for instance, is the Church of the Resurrection _
commonly known as the Church on the Spilled Blood. It was built by
Czar Alexander III on the spot where his father, the reformist Czar
Alexander II, was assassinated in 1881. (During a visit to the
city, President Clinton took an unplanned walk here, much to the
consternation of his Secret Service detail.)
</P>
<P>
   After inspecting mosaics of this church, you can stroll down
Canal Griboedova to the neoclassical Kazan Cathedral, used during
Soviet times as a museum to celebrate atheism. Another block's walk
will take you to the vastness of Palace Square and a pose for
pictures at the foot of Alexander Column, built to commemorate the
victory over Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching out: Connections mean everything in Russia. Try to make
some even before your trip, or find ways to reach out once you are
there.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Washington state's prominent Democrats, ex-state chair
Karen Marchioro and Jeff Smith, learned the name of a superb guide
and were rewarded with not only a tour of the city but of nearby
czarist summer palaces and Lake Ladoga.
</P>
<P>
   (The guide was Olga Kornilova. Write to her at: Dolgoozernaya
13, A.P. 70, St. Petersburg, 197371, Russia.)
</P>
<P>
   Our group, from St. Augustine's-in-the-Woods Episcopal Church on
Whidbey Island, Wash., linked up with our sister parish, St.
Nicholas' Cathedral in Pavlovsk about 19 miles south of St.
Petersburg. Friendships were instantly made.
</P>
<P>
   A 21-year-old in our group, Jason Pierson, was taken in tow by
two 18-year-old girls and found himself at a town festival immersed
in conversation with English-speaking college students.
</P>
<P>
   The priest's daughter, Anna, took us to Catherine Palace in
Tasarkoe Selo, almost completely destroyed in 1944. Restoration of
such features as the Amber Room, looted by German occupiers, is
still under way.
</P>
<P>
   What if you go to St. Petersburg without contacts? Ask questions
and strike up conversations at places you visit. This can be more
rewarding in Russia than any place else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Russia is difficult and unpredictable _ and, during the
Soviet era, filled with facade and pretense. Intense conversation
is a form of national relief. Such talk with foreigners used to be
frowned upon, with the KGB making every effort to listen in. But
nowadays, everyone seems to have a story to tell. We exhausted
translators, and somehow managed to communicate by smiles and
gestures when words gave out.
</P>
<P>
   From such outreach, we heard the war stories of an 85-year-old
veteran who lost three fingers fighting the Nazis, and accounts of
rebuilding the Great Palace at Pavlovsk from an architect who
worked on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Team travel: St. Petersburg has a bit of a crime problem, so
Americans are wise to travel in twos or threes. The cyrillic
alphabet must be roughly understood. The subway system _ the St.
Petersburg Metro _ is a cheap, easy way to get around.
</P>
<P>
   If you are photographing the Samson Fountain and Great Cascade
at the Peterhof palace, west of the city, somebody needs to keep
track of when the last hydrofoil leaves for The Hermitage.
</P>
<P>
   The group is sure to come home with shared memories and
adventures. Inevitably, each person will commit a faux pas, about
which friends can rib him (or her) for years.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson has come up in the world for a boy from Aberdeen, Wash.
He graduated from Gonzaga University and had headed off to begin
graduate studies at Yale Divinity School. Pierson will, however,
need time to live down a Tikhvin Cemetery visit in which he
strolled up to Dostoevski's grave, decorated with a bust of the
great writer, and asked: ``Who is this dude?''

   WASHINGTON -- At the height of hostilities between Rome and
Carthage, Cato the Elder could not keep quiet. Every diatribe he
delivered in the Senate ended with the words Delenda est Carthago
-- ``Carthage must be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cato's battle-cry incited the Romans to invade northern Africa,
burn Carthage to the ground and plow salt into the enemy soil.
</P>
<P>
   Although James Carville, Bill Clinton's devoted pit-bull and
strategist, may not (yet) be advocating such extreme measures, his
hatred of the Republican establishment is no less venomous.
</P>
<P>
   With Catonian zeal, Carville declared last Sunday that he would
``roll into battle'' against Newt Gingrich, the House speaker, a
man he has characterized across the land as ``a sanctioned,
certified, adjudicated and confessed liar.''
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of a larger White House strategy to villainize
the president's foes. Evidently, Clinton's period of contrition is
over.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is not admitting this, of course. Clinton's
press spokesman, Mike McCurry, distanced himself from Carville's
comments and pledged that the president will maintain a ``careful,
dignified approach'' to White House relations with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the administration is clearly energized to fight, once
again, to save the president's hide. It has returned, in a sense,
to the thing it does best: campaigning. Employing the ``war room''
mentality that was so successful in 1992 and 1996 (in which
Carville always took a starring role), the president's advisers are
now taking on the Republican Congress as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Who could ask for a better opponent? In only three weeks since
the Starr report went to Capitol Hill, Republican leaders have
managed to deflate most of the impeachment momentum that had
gathered since Clinton's Aug. 17 address to the nation. A recent
New York Times/CBS News poll shows Clinton's approval rating rising
as fast as Congress's is falling. Fully 78 percent of Americans
believe the grand jury videotape should never have been made
public.
</P>
<P>
   Even more promising for the president, 43 percent think that
Congress should drop the investigation entirely, without even a
censure of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The day this poll was released, the president chose to pick a
fight on territory where he has had success in the past: the
federal budget. After signing a resolution to stave off a
government shutdown for a while, the president accused Congress of
``failing to meet its most basic governing responsibility'' and of
choosing ``partisanship over progress, politics over people.''
</P>
<P>
   Having won the political battle against Congress during the
1995-96 shutdown, the Clinton administration believes it can score
points by once again baiting the Republicans into a budget battle.
As one Clinton adviser said, a government shutdown would even be
``tonic for the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Having learned their lesson once, the Republicans are unlikely
to be lured into the perils of another budget showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, time is running out. By Oct. 9, the president must sign
the 13 spending bills that make up the 1999 budget, and most of the
bills are still being debated on Capitol Hill. He has already
threatened to veto seven of them: those that contain controversial
spending initiatives such as school vouchers, and other measures
(IMF funding, relief for farmers) which Clinton supports, but which
the Republicans have decked with unpalatable amendments.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a presidential veto, Congress is likely to send the
president only those bills he is sure to sign, pass a ``continuing
resolution'' to keep the government running, and tackle the
controversial issues after the November election.
</P>
<P>
   On the taxing side of the ledger, although the House has
approved an $80 billion tax cut (which Clinton also vows to veto),
Republicans may agree to a smaller cut to avoid a standoff.
</P>
<P>
   While the president's wonks are debating budget minutiae, his
lawyers are busy polishing another prong of the White House
campaign: settling the Paula Jones case. Lawyers for Mrs. Jones and
the president were wrangling over a settlement that would pay her
compensation in exchange for dropping the case. More important,
under the terms of the deal, Mrs. Jones would apparently not seek
an apology from Clinton, a demand that has stalled previous
settlement discussions.
</P>
<P>
   By freeing himself from Mrs. Jones's accusations the president
may gain some leverage on Capitol Hill. The White House could
argue, as Clinton did in his grand jury deposition, that the Jones
case was a bogus lawsuit fuelled by right-wing money, and that the
case built against him by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
over the Monica Lewinsky affair is built entirely on this unsound
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   This may be faulty legal logic -- the questions of perjury and
obstruction of justice are still relevant, even if the Jones case
is settled -- but White House officials are hoping that it will
shore up Clinton's political support among Republican congressmen
who are wavering over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   More than congressional Republicans, however, it is members of
his own party Clinton must worry about. Relations between the White
House and Democrats in Congress are cooler than ever, as the
president's behavior has dashed the party's hopes of reclaiming a
majority in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions were further strained when it was reported Tuesday that
the White House was promoting a plan to enlist labor unions and
civil-rights groups to donate money toward an advertising campaign
condemning the Republicans' handling of the impeachment procedure.
Democrats on Capitol Hill were quick to scorn the idea, arguing
that it would draw money away from their own campaign chests. The
White House dropped the plan the next day.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, congressional Democrats may not be mollified. Many
of them believe the president is placing his own political survival
over that of his party. His efforts have spurred a rebound in
public sympathy for him, but this may not translate into votes for
Democratic candidates on election day. Turnout is likely to be very
low and dominated heavily by Clinton opponents energized by the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it may be the magnitude of their party's slide on
Nov. 3 that will determine whether Democrats choose to fight for
their president.
</P>
<P>
   Given the opinion polls and the Republicans' penchant for
repeatedly shooting themselves in the foot, Clinton's offensive
campaign may just save his political skin. Even so, merely
surviving is no guarantee that he can salvage what he most cares

<P>
   OUTLOOK-AUTOMOBILES-BLOOM (Undated) _ The lower price discounts
and continued cost-cutting helped profitability for all three major
automakers. Still, Detroit automakers' earnings are increasingly
threatened by economic problems that are damping demand in Latin
America and Asia. By John Lippert.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-DEALS-LADN (Los Angeles) _ Consumers shopping for a new car
this fall are in for a dose of sticker shock. But it won't be
painful; indeed, they should leave the dealerships smiling and
maybe with some cash in their pocket. They will be reaping the
benefits of a rare autumn buyers' market as automakers offer
lucrative incentives on the last of the 1998 models and, on
numerous lots, are slashing prices on new 1999 models just hitting
showroom floors. By Gregory Wilcox.
</P>
<P>
   CIR-CAR-BUYING (Undated) _ A look at a new car buying service on
the Internet. By Michelle Krebs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-INSURE-LAWSUIT-NYT (Washington) _ When Mark Covington
drives his 1992 Chevy Cavalier at night, the beam of the left
headlight wobbles across the road, and in daylight, the red paint
on the hood shows an odd ridge on the left side. He blames his
insurance company: After his wife crashed the car into the back of
a pickup in April, he said, he took the car to one of the best body
shops in Laurel, Miss., but the shop had to use generic parts.
``State Farm just absolutely refused to put GM parts on it,''
Covington said. Lawyers are seeking to add him to a large
class-action suit against State Farm. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   PARIS-CAR-SHOW-BLOOM (Paris) _ More than a dozen cars will make
their debuts at the Paris auto show next week, which includes
displays by 50 companies. The show runs Oct. 1 to Oct. 11 at the
Porte de Versailles. By Brian Lysaght.
</P>
<P>
   BATTERY-VEHICLES-HNS (San Francisco) _ While the world's auto
companies struggle to create a viable electric vehicle, a small
swarm of electric bicycles and scooters are humming off the
assembly lines at Zap Power Systems, a company trying hard to seize
the tiny but growing U.S. market for electrified transportation. By
Matt Beer.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-SALES-OUTLOOK-BLOOM (Detroit) _ U.S. vehicle sales rose
about 7 percent in September on a surge in light trucks at Chrysler
Corp. and Toyota Motor Co., as well as General Motors Corp.'s
recovery from this summer's strikes. By Paul Gargaro.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-OLDSMOBILE-NYT (Undated) _ Oldsmobile is hoping that
the newest member in its lineup, the entry-level Alero, a compact
sedan and coupe just hitting the market, will generate up to
150,000 sales a year. It's a tall order for this small car. After
test-driving two versions of the Alero, I concluded that it has
many pluses, but wondered if they would be enough to take on the
world's heavyweights. By Michelle Krebs.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-COLUMN-AZR (Undated) _ Model year 1999 is an evolutionary
one for the world's automakers, with a tuck here, a tweak there,
and a couple of face lifts. Only a few models are brand new for
'99, plus the re-entries of a couple of old names, as the
manufacturers gear up for the new millennium. Corvette adds a
model, Oldsmobile adds a compact, Toyota adds a coupe, Buick loses
a coupe, and Infiniti resurrects its entry-level car. As usual,
trucks are huge. By Bob Golfen.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- At the height of hostilities between Rome and
Carthage, Cato the Elder could not keep quiet. Every diatribe he
delivered in the Senate ended with the words Delenda est Carthago
-- ``Carthage must be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cato's battle-cry incited the Romans to invade northern Africa,
burn Carthage to the ground and plow salt into the enemy soil.
</P>
<P>
   Although James Carville, Bill Clinton's devoted pit-bull and
strategist, may not (yet) be advocating such extreme measures, his
hatred of the Republican establishment is no less venomous.
</P>
<P>
   With Catonian zeal, Carville declared last Sunday that he would
``roll into battle'' against Newt Gingrich, the House speaker, a
man he has characterized across the land as ``a sanctioned,
certified, adjudicated and confessed liar.''
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of a larger White House strategy to villainize
the president's foes. Evidently, Clinton's period of contrition is
over.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is not admitting this, of course. Clinton's
press spokesman, Mike McCurry, distanced himself from Carville's
comments and pledged that the president will maintain a ``careful,
dignified approach'' to White House relations with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the administration is clearly energized to fight, once
again, to save the president's hide. It has returned, in a sense,
to the thing it does best: campaigning. Employing the ``war room''
mentality that was so successful in 1992 and 1996 (in which
Carville always took a starring role), the president's advisers are
now taking on the Republican Congress as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Who could ask for a better opponent? In only three weeks since
the Starr report went to Capitol Hill, Republican leaders have
managed to deflate most of the impeachment momentum that had
gathered since Clinton's Aug. 17 address to the nation. A recent
New York Times/CBS News poll shows Clinton's approval rating rising
as fast as Congress's is falling. Fully 78 percent of Americans
believe the grand jury videotape should never have been made
public.
</P>
<P>
   Even more promising for the president, 43 percent think that
Congress should drop the investigation entirely, without even a
censure of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The day this poll was released, the president chose to pick a
fight on territory where he has had success in the past: the
federal budget. After signing a resolution to stave off a
government shutdown for a while, the president accused Congress of
``failing to meet its most basic governing responsibility'' and of
choosing ``partisanship over progress, politics over people.''
</P>
<P>
   Having won the political battle against Congress during the
1995-96 shutdown, the Clinton administration believes it can score
points by once again baiting the Republicans into a budget battle.
As one Clinton adviser said, a government shutdown would even be
``tonic for the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Having learned their lesson once, the Republicans are unlikely
to be lured into the perils of another budget showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, time is running out. By Oct. 9, the president must sign
the 13 spending bills that make up the 1999 budget, and most of the
bills are still being debated on Capitol Hill. He has already
threatened to veto seven of them: those that contain controversial
spending initiatives such as school vouchers, and other measures
(IMF funding, relief for farmers) which Clinton supports, but which
the Republicans have decked with unpalatable amendments.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a presidential veto, Congress is likely to send the
president only those bills he is sure to sign, pass a ``continuing
resolution'' to keep the government running, and tackle the
controversial issues after the November election.
</P>
<P>
   On the taxing side of the ledger, although the House has
approved an $80 billion tax cut (which Clinton also vows to veto),
Republicans may agree to a smaller cut to avoid a standoff.
</P>
<P>
   While the president's wonks are debating budget minutiae, his
lawyers are busy polishing another prong of the White House
campaign: settling the Paula Jones case. Lawyers for Mrs. Jones and
the president were wrangling over a settlement that would pay her
compensation in exchange for dropping the case. More important,
under the terms of the deal, Mrs. Jones would apparently not seek
an apology from Clinton, a demand that has stalled previous
settlement discussions.
</P>
<P>
   By freeing himself from Mrs. Jones's accusations the president
may gain some leverage on Capitol Hill. The White House could
argue, as Clinton did in his grand jury deposition, that the Jones
case was a bogus lawsuit fuelled by right-wing money, and that the
case built against him by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
over the Monica Lewinsky affair is built entirely on this unsound
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   This may be faulty legal logic -- the questions of perjury and
obstruction of justice are still relevant, even if the Jones case
is settled -- but White House officials are hoping that it will
shore up Clinton's political support among Republican congressmen
who are wavering over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   More than congressional Republicans, however, it is members of
his own party Clinton must worry about. Relations between the White
House and Democrats in Congress are cooler than ever, as the
president's behavior has dashed the party's hopes of reclaiming a
majority in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions were further strained when it was reported Tuesday that
the White House was promoting a plan to enlist labor unions and
civil-rights groups to donate money toward an advertising campaign
condemning the Republicans' handling of the impeachment procedure.
Democrats on Capitol Hill were quick to scorn the idea, arguing
that it would draw money away from their own campaign chests. The
White House dropped the plan the next day.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, congressional Democrats may not be mollified. Many
of them believe the president is placing his own political survival
over that of his party. His efforts have spurred a rebound in
public sympathy for him, but this may not translate into votes for
Democratic candidates on election day. Turnout is likely to be very
low and dominated heavily by Clinton opponents energized by the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it may be the magnitude of their party's slide on
Nov. 3 that will determine whether Democrats choose to fight for
their president.
</P>
<P>
   Given the opinion polls and the Republicans' penchant for
repeatedly shooting themselves in the foot, Clinton's offensive
campaign may just save his political skin. Even so, merely
surviving is no guarantee that he can salvage what he most cares
about, his presidential legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Carville's war against the Republicans may succeed, but in the
long run it will be the American people who render judgment on Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It may be pertinent that when the Roman people memorialized Cato
the Elder with a statue in the Capitol, the inscription
concentrated not on his military triumphs but on his moral virtues:
He was the man who, ``by his discipline and temperance, kept the
Roman state from sinking into vice.''

<P>
   &UR; PLACES AND DESTINATIONS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MOUNT-KATAHDIN-HNS (Mount Katahdin, Maine) _ Indians called this
Katahdin, the ``highest mountain.'' Today, the mountain spirits _
one, a nasty creature with a terrible beak and claws; another, a
gigantic human form with stony eyebrows and cheekbones _ are quiet.
These mythical creatures do not throw storms of rain, snow or
sleet. They do not shroud the mountain with chilling fog or
blinding clouds. And they do not wrap the high peaks in a killer
hurricane. Instead, this day, Katahdin is but a whisper. Katahdin
is as calm as the two black ravens pecking about on nearby slopes.
On days like these, a hiker on the Knife Edge can talk downslope
with another some 2,000 feet below. By Fred Stetson.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-PEI-COX (Victoria, Prince Edward Island) _ Chasing down a
memory is always a risk. Revisiting a favorite seaside raises
questions: Will how it looks today erase your dreamy images of the
way it used to be? Can any coastal town escape the transforming
tides of ``progress'' and development? Happily, the tiny southern
seaport of Victoria, where I spent the summer of '64, has managed
to dodge both. By Eileen M. Drennen.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-NOVASCOTIA-COX (Off Digby Neck, Nova Scotia) _ Nova
Scotia is wonderful territory for anyone interested in an active
outdoor vacation, offering great cycling, hiking, birding,
beachcombing and whale watching. In one week, we pedaled through
remote areas on the Digby Neck, visited quiet fishing villages and
experienced hundreds of years of history in Annapolis Royal,
Canada's oldest European settlement. By Denise Prodigo-Herrmann.

</P>
<P>
   FOLIAGE-TOURISM-HNS (Albany, N.Y.) _ There's a buck to be made
in the changing of the leaves, and states are catching on. New
Hampshire and Maine doubled their advertising budget for fall
tourism this year. In response, Vermont took out television
commercials for their own well-known fall foliage. By Alan
Wechsler.
</P>
<P>
   BAHAMAS-NASSAU-COX (Nassau, Bahamas) _ This colonial port city
moves to a soundtrack. I always listen to the rhythms of the
island, and in one weekend I heard Junkanoo, reggae, rap, rock and
sexy soca. By Grace Blackerby.
</P>
<P>
   BAHAMAS-PARADISE-COX (Paradise Island) _ The huge Atlantis
resort on Paradise Island will soon be even more enormous. The
1,200-room, 17-story Royal Towers hotel, which dominates the
island's skyline, will open Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY-CRUISE-TEX-HNS (Port Canaveral) _ Forget the nit-picking.
Disney, having conquered the theme park, movie, cable TV and toy
industries, became the big fish in the cruise business the moment
Disney Magic's foghorn blasted out the first notes of ``When You
Wish Upon a Star'' and the ship's 83,000-ton bulk moved away from
the Port Canaveral pier in late July en route to the Bahamas. By
Jeff Guinn.
</P>
<P>
   LUNTS-MUSEUM-NYT (Genesee Depot, Wis.) _ Arts in America: In the
rolling farmland of southeast Wisconsin, Ten Chimneys, the
legendary and utterly peculiar summer retreat of Alfred Lunt and
Lynn Fontanne, for years the reigning couple of the American
theater, is to be come a museum. By Rick Lyman.
</P>

not-so-amateur photographers try to capture the brilliant gold-dust
morning of Death Valley. Despite its reputation as a desert
wasteland, Death Valley actually boasts diverse habitats and
experiences for visitors. By Syd Kearney.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-VALLEY-SIDER-COX (Amargosa Valley, Nev.) _ Ash Meadows
National Wildlife Refuge, located about 40 minutes from Death
Valley, is a 22,117-acre wetland and upland desert oasis with the

GAMBLING MAY BE A LOSER ON SEVERAL LEVELS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Betting made more money in the United States in 1996 than
baseball, movies and theme parks combined, according to a new book
on the gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates put legal betting in the United States at $585.6
billion in 1996, up astronomically from the $17.3 billion spent 20
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The torrent of cash that spews from our pockets and streams
through the corporate boardrooms and darker corners of America's
gambling establishments has created a commercial juggernaut,'' New
York Times reporter Timothy L. O'Brien writes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien tackles the pros and cons of this burgeoning industry in
his first book, ``Bad Bet: The Inside Story of the Glamour, Glitz,
and Danger of America's Gambling Industry'' (Random House, 339
pages).
</P>
<P>
   As more and more opportunities arise for betting _ from casinos
springing up nationwide to Internet sites making in-home betting
available _ gambling has seen an astounding revenue rise, O'Brien
reports. Even public entities are getting into the act, including
lotteries in 37 states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``As entrenched as gambling always has been in American life,
its raptures and demons have never been so easily accessible as
they are right now,'' O'Brien writes. ``Social taboos and laws that
once confined gambling's availability have been cast aside in a
national rush to embrace this most dangerous of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Although long established sites such as Las Vegas and Atlantic
City continue to grow, newer gambling centers are popping up in
such areas as the Mississippi Gulf Coast and American Indian
reservations, all in what O'Brien calls a desperate attempt to
rejuvenate economically battered communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The siren continues to enchant, because commercial gambling's
strongest appeal is to the desperate _ to small towns and cities
beaten into economic submission; to states stripped of federal tax
support and angling for ways to plug holes in their budgets; to
Native Americans banished to the outer rim of society,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien researched several gambling sites and examined whether
the industry provides the promised economic boon. He also includes
chapters on state lotteries, sports betting and the latest gambling
craze: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is against federal law for a U.S. Internet site to
offer real gambling, as in the transfer of money over interstate
phone lines, that is not stopping companies abroad, O'Brien
reveals.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gambling, or ``nambling'' as it is generally called, is
hot. One trade publication estimates that about $143 million in
sports bets were placed online in the United States in 1996. The
magazine estimates that the figure will rise to $760 million by
2000, O'Brien writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports betting ... has all the earmarks of being a killer
application ... on the Inernet because it is a favorite activity
among the computer-literate young men who like to surf through
cyberspace,'' O'Brien writes.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries, including Australia, Austria and those in the
Caribbean, allow Internet betting, and a number of companies are
jumping onto the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Even certain airlines, including British Airways and Swissair,
have tested in-flight gambling systems, O'Brien writes.
</P>
<P>
   Although gambling is increasingly available, O'Brien points out
repeatedly that the industry depends on relatively few hard-core
gamblers for its profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most gamblers bet within their budgets and treat a weekend in
Las Vegas as another social outing,'' he writes. ``But there is a
little secret lurking behind this truth: the gambling industry's
financial well-being depends on a small, hard-core group of
regulars, many of whom are compulsive or problem gamblers.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on interviews of casino executives and managers, O'Brien
suggests that as much as 80 percent of gambling revenues come from
about 20 percent of gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien does a decent job of covering an underreported subject,
but his style tends to be preachy, and his book lacks organization.
</P>
<P>
   However, he does present industry numbers, a boon for anyone
seeking a closer look at where U.S. gambling is headed.

BEAUTY AND THE BLOCKBUSTER ON VAN GOGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)Dear Theo,
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday I received your letter in which you say my pictures
make the rooms of your apartment in Paris look so gay. You
embarrass and hearten me. However, I must tell you about the most
incredible night that followed. I dreamed that I was coming to
visit you and Jo, but on your doorstep a terrible beast, a
Cerberus, barred my way. He called himself the Ticketmaster and he
said I must pay a toll or he would not let me pass _ and to see my
own paintings!
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's so ridiculous, I know. I had a fit after waking but
then fell into yet another terrible strange delusion in which my
unfortunate paintings had now been assembled in some vast marble
mausoleum. Thousands of people swarmed and shoved and jostled each
other before them. I want my pictures to touch people, but I never
conceived they would cause so many people to touch each other! They
must have been devil worshipers because I clearly heard the devil
speaking in strange tongues through horns clasped to their heads.
Can you imagine? I need rest.
</P>
<P>
   I hear there's a nice place at Saint-Remy.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The van Gogh exhibition opening at the National Gallery in
Washington on Sunday is a beautiful retrospective of 70 paintings
from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which is now closed for
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   There really isn't much to say about the show conceptually
speaking. It doesn't pretend to tell us anything new about him.
People will complain about the lack of the usual great hits and the
number of minor works, as if all van Gogh retrospectives should
look exactly alike. Actually, to the degree that the show stresses
less familiar pictures, even some bad ones, it makes his evolution
unfold freshly.
</P>
<P>
   A few random notes apropos of the show:
</P>
<P>
   We think of van Gogh as somebody whose art changed radically.
Critics love the cliche of the ham-fisted yokel turned genius, but
we see here how in important ways he really didn't change much at
all.
</P>
<P>
   His roots remained in the Netherlands. In Paris, for instance,
he painted a gem in the manner of early Netherlandish portraiture
(Memling and so on); it's a crisp self-portrait as boulevardier in
blue-trimmed jacket and big bow tie.
</P>
<P>
   In Arles, he gravitated to flat, patchwork fields that he
associated with Dutch landscapes by Ruisdael and to places like the
shore at Les Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, with its multicolored
fishing boats, which recalled Dutch seascapes.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote from Arles to his brother, Theo: ``I keep thinking of
Holland, and across the twofold remoteness of distance and of time
these memories have a kind of heartbreak in them.'' What he learned
in Paris, he said, was ``leaving'' him: ``I am returning to the
ideas I had in the country before I knew the Impressionists.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, ``The Harvest,'' an orderly Dutchlike scene of ocher
cornfields receding in ranks beneath a cobalt sky, and ``The Yellow
House,'' which echoes an early Dutch picture by him, ``The Vicarage
at Neunen.'' The house and vicarage are both silent, heraldic
places, the discrepancy of palette (muted gray versus peppermint
green and pink) making remarkably little difference in effect.
</P>
<P>
   It's curious how amusing some of van Gogh's pictures are. He
could be funny, though we don't ever think of him that way. An
early work, ``Flying Fox,'' with the animal backlighted, its
translucent wings extended, is clearly a macabre joke, paired here
with ``Skull of a Skeleton With Burning Cigarette,'' an even
funnier picture, and like the fox, lusciously painted in a way that
somehow reanimates the dead subject. It's an image straight out of
Gothic literature.
</P>
<P>
   We know van Gogh read Poe. He was a voracious reader. His
``Still Life With Books,'' painted on an oval Japanese tea tray,
reveals his literary taste. Having done muddy landscapes and figure
studies in the Netherlands, he moved to Paris to recast himself as
a modernist of high-key palette and Japanese style. The still life
is a little declaration of the conversion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He takes pains to indicate the books' titles, including Zola's
``Au Bonheur des Dames,'' the story of a certain Denise Baudu, a
virginal heroine fresh from the provinces who comes to Paris and is
corrupted by life in the metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh was the kind of reader who identified a bit too much
with the subjects of the books he admired, Zola's especially. Maybe
he intended to tell us something here: that, like Denise, he had
also become jaded about, and corrupted by, the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   He was savvier than most people think, after all. The catalog of
the show includes a chronology with a few useful reminders in it:
for instance, that he was the one who decided not to sell any
pictures until he had compiled a large enough group of what he
considered to be world-class paintings with which to announce
himself to the public; that in 1889, when he exhibited with the
Societe des Artistes Independants, he was well reviewed, and in
1890 Albert Aurier's article about him was published _ not bad for
a young painter who had been at it only a few years.
</P>
<P>
   He was clearly no madman when it came to his art. By now it's
trite to say this. He was, however, a visionary, which is a very
different matter. One of his visionary pictures is ``Almond
Blossom,'' painted at Saint-Remy in 1890, a gnarled scramble of
branches and buds against an azure backdrop, nearly abstract. Sky
fills the spaces between bits of unpainted canvas, the spaces, as
if in ghostly recession, becoming branches of the tree.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an amazingly flat and complex pattern of lines and
shapes recalling Japanese art but pointing ahead to Mondrian. It's
the essence of mature van Gogh: reality, painstakingly observed,
filtered through his peculiar style of drawing to produce an image
distinctly unreal.
</P>
<P>
   In his final letter, van Gogh wrote to his brother that his
paintings, ``even in the cataclysm retain their quietude.'' This is
true. ``Landscape at Twilight,'' one of the last works, is a prime
example.
</P>
<P>
   All the elements in the picture _ bottle-green pear trees, heavy
grass, citrine sunlight, blue chateau, clay road _ are broken down
into wet dashes that recombine in a swirl. The surface roils and
vibrates, but at its core the image stays remarkably calm.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, van Gogh's work is never as simple as it first
appears, and somehow it constantly looks new each time. That is the
thing about great art: no matter how often it is reproduced or how
trivialized it is by biographers and promoters, it manages to
retain its strange power.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar works here, when you actually stand before
them, still have an immediacy, an implacable aura, which is so
arresting that, temporarily, it even silences the noise about
blockbusters and pandering to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, despite the hype, the work is the only
thing you'll care about _ that is, if you can manage to see it
through the milling backs. &QL;

`ANTZ': A BUG'S-EYE AND PARTLY WOODY VIEW OF THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
(JT) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer animation has advanced to the point where it can make a
cute romantic couple out of Woody Allen and Sharon Stone, not to
mention back-slapping buddies out of Allen and Sylvester Stallone.
These and other surreal tricks are shown off in Dreamworks' funny
new insect picture, the first one out of the anthill.
</P>
<P>
   Striving for the clever anthropomorphism of ``Toy Story,''
``Antz'' recruits above-the-title voice talent to create tiny
characters with big personalities. Its shrewd computer animators
have great fun seeing the world from an ant's-eye point of view.
</P>
<P>
   However well it works at first, though, ``Antz'' winds up
overplotted in bizarrely grandiose ways. Must every child-friendly
adventure film boil down to a struggle for world domination? And
did this one really need to invoke genocide in its final reel?
Surely a threat of bug spray in the picnic basket could have done
the trick.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, which is substantial enough to make ``Antz''
at least as amusing for adults as for children, Allen sounds
wonderfully invigorated by the chance to play a guy with all those
legs _ and all those ant-specific reasons for angst. The film,
handily directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson, begins with
Allen's Z in therapy, lying on a leaf in a nutshell as he laments
being the middle child in a family of five million. He complains of
feeling insignificant, only to be told by his psychologist (Paul
Mazursky) that he IS. Allen's lines, delivered with his sharpest
comic timing, sound just like his own writing. (The screenplay is
by Todd Alcott, Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz.) He dismisses one group
of curly-antennaed ant females by saying: ``They're career girls.
They're obsessed with digging.''
</P>
<P>
   One night, breaking away from the crowd in what ``Antz''
pictures wittily as a totalitarian workers' paradise, Z meets
Princess Bala (extra imperious, as played by Ms. Stone) at a bar,
where they dance a la ``Pulp Fiction'' to suit the film's knowing
tone.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after this the ant colony is caught up in a war effort
against termites (``Why don't we just try to influence their
political process with campaign contributions?'' Z wonders), and
the film starts showing signs of a heavier hand. The military
leader General Mandible (Gene Hackman) has big dreams that involve
sacrificing the little people, to the point where ``Antz'' invokes
the Holocaust with jarring abruptness. The film can't comfortably
go from celebrating the bug's-eye glories of a full trash can to
expecting nice-guy ant heroes to save the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz'' works best just showing off its prodigious voice talent
(Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover, Jennifer Lopez and Christopher Walken
are also in the cast) and playing lightheartedly with the curious
possibilities of a buggy world. Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin fly
into the film as Chip and Muffy, behaving like the very WASPiest of
wasps, while at another point in the story, spaced-out teen-age
ants sit around oh-wowing about whether they're part of a larger
world. Ambitiously designed crowd sequences manipulate huge numbers
of tiny figures much more fluidly than other recent animated
features have done.

PAINTER PRODUCES MASSES OF ART FOR THE MASSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ What do you want from art?
</P>
<P>
   If you're like most people, you want art of something you can
recognize, in colors that please the eye.
</P>
<P>
   You want an affordable original, handmade by someone who is
sincere about his work.
</P>
<P>
   And you probably don't care if the art world doesn't like what
you like.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you could get the art you liked and could afford and
that any number of artists, curators and critics also admire and
collect?
</P>
<P>
   Then come on down to Rice University, where Stephen Keene has
turned an ordinarily austere art gallery into Art-O-Rama.
</P>
<P>
   ONE MAN, ONE ASSEMBLY LINE: Keene, 41, mass-produces highly
decorative paintings and sells them to anyone and everyone _ from
people who never visit galleries to the director of the
Philadelphia Museum of Art. Most of his pictures measure about 2
feet square and sell for $2. At the expensive end _ $15 _ he makes
paintings that are 4 feet square.
</P>
<P>
   He sells them for less than the price of most coffee drinks
because he works like a one-man assembly line. He sets up 20 or so
pieces of plywood on a long rack, then goes down the line, painting
the same stroke again and again, dipping his brush in another color
and painting another stroke again and again ... until he has
finished 20 vivid pictures that might be adapted from a cereal box
or a textbook or, um, just about anything.
</P>
<P>
   This unconventional technique, Keene's frequent combination of
words and pictures, his habit of painting on wood _ all that and
the initial influence of Georgia folk artist Howard Finster _ might
make him sound like an outsider to an art world centered on
precious objects and elite patronage. But Keene is by no means
naive, self-educated, insane or any of the other labels attached to
many artists working outside the mainstream. He us totally a
product of the complex, market-oriented art system that has evolved
over the past 25 to 30 years in America.
</P>
<P>
   Which may be why Keene, his art and his means of producing and
selling it can arouse suspicion, even fear and anger.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when Keene showed last December at the gallery at
Philadelphia's Moore College of Art and Design, several people
protested his activities there as ``mean-spirited and cynical,''
according to one ``Time'' magazine report.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being told they bought a piece of art, and they
haven't, which is condescending,'' one outraged academic said.
``It's a bad joke'' that ``has no merit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elsa Longhauser, who organized the show, paints a highly
positive picture of Keene. She calls him ``the Johnny Appleseed of
art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure people question his motives,'' she says. ``But
Stephen is a tremendously generous and skilled artist, and a very
aware conceptual and performance artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a conscious decision to work in multiples and make his
art accessible for almost no money. And, at Moore, he made his art
in public. People watched him go down a row, painting
stroke-by-stroke, which is beautiful and almost meditative to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, says Longhauser, Keene empowers people who are
otherwise disenfranchised from the art system, allowing to critique
the relative qualities of artworks, touch them, combine pictures as
they wish and then buy them.
</P>
<P>
   Keene, who is working 12- to 14-hour days at Rice, denies any
malice or cynicism. ``It wasn't like I had a career strategy, like
I was calculating all that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never intended my artwork to go this direction, either. But
over the years, it's gotten such a positive response that it has
become what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Keene's public production, display and sale of art has the
quality of a happening or a performance _ activities that are
sincere and serious, but also fun. Keene likens the artworks people
buy to souvenirs that can be kept, traded or given as gifts.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disciplined physically. I know what I'm going to do and
how, what brushes and what colors,'' he says. ``But, obviously, a
$30 painting for over the sofa is not Tintoretto.''
</P>
<P>
   ART AS WORK: Keene has worked in this vein for about seven
years. He mostly shows and sells in nightclubs. Moore was the first
art institution in which he had shown; Rice is the second.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, his story resembled those of untold other artists.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost half the artists in the United States, Keene holds a
degree in fine art. His masters degree in fine arts is from Yale
University, which gives him an edge over countless colleagues. But
Keene says that he, like most artists, ``was always
middle-of-the-road with what I did. I was never bold enough to go
straight to New York after graduate school.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent his first three or four years after school in Richmond,
Va. He painted representational scenes in a painstakingly bland
style, showed in some decent galleries and occasionally sold
something.
</P>
<P>
   He sent out packets of slides, with updated resumes, to curators
and dealers. He went to museums and galleries and read art
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   By 1991, however, Keene knew he needed to break with art-world
protocol. He had some sign-painter-style things he wanted to do,
which he knew the art world wouldn't like. But he also knew he had
absolutely nothing to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Keene and his wife, architect Star Keene, moved
to New York. Keene rented a studio in Brooklyn and set to work on
his production line. His art first started generating a buzz in
downtown Manhattan, home of New York's independent rock music
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Keene had worked as a DJ in college, had a lot of musician
friends and found it only natural to show in clubs and make art for
CD covers. Between doing well with one-night sales and getting
terrific word-of-mouth, he sold about 13,000 paintings between 1993
and mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   He sold a couple of thousand more paintings in Philadelphia and
some 1,200 on his first day at Rice.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain his inventory _ and to contribute to his household's
income _ Keene turns out maybe 90 small paintings in 12 to 14
hours. In theory, he spends perhaps eight minutes on each picture.
</P>
<P>
   His nose-to-the-grindstone process leaves Keene little time to
speculate on where his path will lead. In any case, he adds, much
of the project's integrity requires that he stay focused on the
task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for me to make the best art I can at any time
and not think ahead,'' Keene says. ``The harder I work, the more it
means to me and other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Keene's deliberate myopia doesn't mean he is insincere. And his
reactionary stance, vis-a-vis the system, doesn't mean he's mocking
it or other artists.
</P>
<P>
   His art is not about irony but about being ``out in the world,''
Keene says.
</P>
<P>
   THE KIDS LOVED IT: Keene has been at Rice since early September
and, from the start, his enterprise has caused a sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew just from hearing about it that Steve's work was right
for us,'' says Rice gallery director Kim Davenport, who learned
about Keene from a member of the gallery's advisory board. ``Our
mission is to primarily show site-specific installations _ and what
Steve does is to make an installation out of painting.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first day of sales, Keene blanketed the walls with
pictures, hung in layers from floor to ceiling. He had stacked so
many painted constructions and pieces of painted furniture on the
floor that people had to squeeze their way between things.
</P>
<P>
   There were landscapes _ from desert vistas to snowy mountains.
Flowers were everywhere, like daisies in May. Also scenes of
Houston _ from the downtown skyline to pictures from Bayou Bend _
Bible scenes, cutouts of the Alamo and cutouts of cute little
burros. And cutouts of Michael Jordan. The panels of a huge folding
screen at the front of the gallery feature a detail from Thomas
Cole's ``The Hunter's Return,'' from the collection of the Amon
Carter Museum.
</P>
<P>
   From his experience at Moore, Keene knew it would be tough
maintaining such a sense of flea-market density. So he planned not
only to produce on a daily basis; he also brought an initial supply
of 2,000 pictures with him from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, come closing time the first Sunday of sales, the place
was decimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wild, but in an organized way,'' gallery manager Jaye
Anderton says. ``We had more than 1,000 people come through between
noon and 5 p.m. People were smiling and having a good time, but
they were calm and very focused on what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part was the kids. There were a lot of children with
big smiles on their faces, picking out a piece of art for their
very own.''
</P>
<P>
   NEXT STOP: GERMANY: First Moore, then Rice. Now the Museum
Ludwig in Cologne has decided to include Keene in a group show this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean the art world wants to rehabilitate its mildly
prodigal son?
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, it needs Keene. Like the retail and entertainment
industries, the art world is always starved for fresh talent and
new products. And, anymore, almost anything can be considered
important contemporary art _ even paintings some might compare to
velvet Elvis paintings and other forms of parking-lot art.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such potential, Longhauser muses, ``Can Stephen
Keene remain Stephen Keene?''
</P>
<P>
   Longhauser may speculate. But Keene, looking to his own
integrity and not wanting to leave anyone empty-handed, is too busy
painting to answer that question.

A GENTLE PRAYER THAT SOARS ABOVE THE DIN OF POLITICS

<TEXT>
<P>
   For a nonbeliever, Verdi provided a fair imitation of Roman
Catholic ritual in ``Aida,'' an opera of processions and prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Aida herself is praying in most of what she sings, and the new
Aida in the Metropolitan Opera production, Maria Guleghina, prays
wonderfully. She can sound pure _ breathtakingly quiet, silvery in
tone, absolutely steady on the note _ and make purity sound like
sensuousness: poor Radames in the third act must feel he has been
ravished by a nun.
</P>
<P>
   Most strikingly, and very usefully in this opera, Ms. Guleghina
can rise from her gentle kind of delivery to be heard over a stage
full of chorus and principals, and can do so smoothly, with no
apparent exertion and no loss of tone, only a change from silver to
gold.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is of a zoom into a close-up in a crowd scene. This
bright, brave tone draws the audience's attention to Aida at times
when nobody else onstage knows what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guleghina's vivid singing does not exert command but rather
sympathy. Her prayer is that an individual's feelings should be
felt to matter above the noise of politics and war, and it is a
prayer that is answered.
</P>
<P>
   Also excellent at opening night, on Tuesday, was Robert Lloyd as
the high priest Ramfis, conveying, even while singing with imposing
strength, that the man's authority is smugly assumed and not
earned.
</P>
<P>
   Verdi did not like churchmen. Jeffrey Wells was a fine King, and
Gregg Baker made an excellent Amonasro: a striking figure, the most
believable onstage, he sang robustly and like a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Terentieva, as Amneris, began with a vibrato wide enough to
carry her, in some of her second-act music, comfortably from one
note to the next, but in the last act she was far more focused, and
could use her dark, rich voice powerfully to act out rage and
imprecation.
</P>
<P>
   Her fellow Russian Vladimir Bogachov, who was Radames, did not
hit lucky. His vibrato stayed, as did the muscular effort behind
his singing, and a couple of times (most crucially at the end) he
lost his voice.
</P>
<P>
   The conductor, who evidently knew this score very well and liked
it a lot, was Placido Domingo. He got eager and beautiful playing
from the orchestra, though consistently loud wind playing prevented
too much subtlety, and the chorus sang for him with great force.
</P>
<P>
   As for the processions, the costumes show with painful
authenticity how vulgar ancient Egypt must have been, and few of
the soldiers can march in step, even when they are coming round for
the third or fourth time. Those who can do so turn out to be
dancers, and the choreography is abominable.

`THE IMPOSTORS': SHENAGIGANS AS WACKY AS THEIR PERPETRATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
(JT) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a dozen of New York's finest actors ham it up with
such unrestrained glee in Stanley Tucci's period farce ``The
Impostors'' that it hardly matters if this swirl of cotton candy
disappears even before it touches the tip of your tongue. Playing
out-of-work actors posing as stewards on a 1930s cruise ship packed
with caricatures of bogus aristocrats and hissable villains, Tucci
and Oliver Platt evoke everyone from Laurel and Hardy to the Marx
Brothers as they skid from one absurd scrape to the next.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's earliest (and best) scenes find these starving
actors practicing their craft by doing melodramatic skits in public
places. At a Central Park cafe, they terrify the patrons by
pretending to be strangers at adjoining tables who get into a
squabble that escalates into a lethal knife fight. Tucci and Platt
play this scene over the film's opening credits in the best silent
clown tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The pair's real troubles begin after a Broadway performance of
``Hamlet,'' starring the world-famous English actor and notorious
drunk Jeremy Burtom (Alfred Molina). He overhears them trashing his
performance in a bar after the show, picks a fight and claims to be
gravely injured. He so panics Maurice (Platt) and Arthur (Tucci)
that they dash onto the nearest boat docked on the Hudson and cower
in a packing crate.
</P>
<P>
   As the vessel sets sail, they emerge dressed as stewards. But to
their horror their nemesis turns up as a passenger, still ranting
and raving, and they are forced to improvise new disguises while
dashing from stateroom to stateroom.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers make up an overstuffed roster of stock '30s movie
caricatures of the sort Peter Sellers used to play in his
man-of-a-thousand-faces heyday. Dana Ivey is a penniless grande
dame determined to marry off her terminally depressed daughter
(Hope Davis) to the first ancient millionaire who dodders into
sight. Richard Jenkins and Allison Janney are a gangster and his
moll plotting mayhem while posing as French aristocrats. Also on
board are a deposed queen (Isabella Rossellini), a suicidal band
singer (Steve Buscemi), a proto-fascist German steward (Campbell
Scott), a giggly African sheik (Teagle Bougere) and a Scottish
tennis pro obsessed with arm-wrestling and ``Greek love'' (Billy
Connolly).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Impostors'' crams too many characters onto this ship of
fools, and has a flat ending borrowed from Woody Allen's ``Radio
Days.'' (Allen puts in an unbilled cameo appearance as the world's
most hapless playwright). But the comic chemistry of Tucci's
nervous, wiry Arthur and Platt's portly, befuddled Maurice, who
eventually dons a gown and Shirley Temple wig to evoke the
``Charlie's Aunt'' era of movie drag, is sound. For a movie like
``The Impostors'' to succeed, you don't need much scintillating
dialogue. All you have to do is know how to look hopelessly inept
as stacks of luggage tumble from your grasp in a landslide of
flying suitcases and flailing limbs, leaving all pretenses to grace
and dignity forever shattered.

DENIZENS OF THE FRONT DESK, WAITING FOR A KISS GOODBYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.)

 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Thoreau wrote, ``The mass of men lead lives of quiet
desperation,'' he surely had in mind people like Sonny, the night
bellhop at the Hotel Stillwell in Tacoma, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   At 31, with eight years on the job, Sonny (Elias Koteas) hasn't
got much of a past or present. And like the Stillwell, which has
slipped from a three-star rating to two stars, he isn't looking at
a promising future.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny supplements his wages and tips by stealing and selling the
hotel's vodka and VCRs and arranging female companionship for
guests who ask.
</P>
<P>
   When he goes home after his dreary nights, his obese, retarded
brother, Leroy, is waiting in front of the television set in a
filthy, littered house, and the phone is ringing with threats from
a social worker to remove Leroy from Sonny's patient care.
</P>
<P>
   The stage is set for Sonny to become the protagonist in ``Hit
Me,'' a bleak, rewarding film noir. Adapted by Denis Johnson from
Jim Thompson's novel ``A Swell-Looking Babe'' and directed by
Steven Shainberg with a sure feel for the genre, ``Hit Me''
slithers amid Pacific Northwest rain and darkness through layers of
desperate hope, tempting beauty, deceptions and double crosses to a
slightly attenuated but appropriate conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   First comes the femme fatale, a hotel guest named Monique Roux
(Laure Marsac). She's trouble and troubled, but after Sonny deals
with her slashed wrists, he can't get her provocative beauty out of
his head.
</P>
<P>
   He calls her a four-star woman in a two-star hotel. And when
they make passionate love, he is ecstatic. Then she emits an
endless scream, as if raped, and Sonny sees himself faced with the
loss of what little life he has, miserable as it is.
</P>
<P>
   But in an instant, a devil ex machina pops up among the guests
drawn to the hall _ Sonny's old colleague Del, newly prosperous and
offering to set things right. And soon Sonny, despite his
misgivings, is a partner in a scheme proposed by Del (Bruce Ramsay)
to rob the Stillwell's safe deposit boxes of $700,000 in cash
deposited as stakes by participants in a major poker game organized
by the urbane Lenny Ish, the local underworld overlord.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, Sonny is going to be able to kiss the
Stillwell goodbye; bid a not very fond adieu to Stillwell, who is
not happy with Sonny's performance; get out from under the sadistic
hand of his creditor, the hotel security chief called Cougar, and
be off to Paris to live happily ever after with Monique and Leroy
(Jay Leggett).
</P>
<P>
   But if Thoreau furnishes the epigraph for ``Hit Me,'' then the
film's subtext is surely the one attributed to the ancient Greek
Palladas: ``There is many a slip 'twixt cup and lip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit Me'' brims with vivid characters _ not just the intriguing
Koteas and the sensuous Ms. Marsac, but also the pathetic Leroy,
Del, Cougar (Kevin J. O'Connor) and Bascomb and Billy (J.C. Quinn
and Haing S. Ngor in his final performance), who are Sonny's
colleagues at the front desk of the Stillwell.
</P>
<P>
   And not to be forgotten is the philosophical Ish (Philip Baker
Hall), who likes to gaze through a telescope at the distant stars
and grumble, ``Used to be a three-star hotel, used to be a
five-star country.''
</P>
<P>
   And for people like Sonny, a place to dream his American dream. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit Me'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian). It includes vulgar language, violence, bloodshed
and simulated sex. &QL;
</P>

VERDI MEETS ELTON JOHN IN OPERA A LA DISNEY
</HEADLINE>
 DISNEY-2000(2Takes)-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most of the people in the polite audience at the
Alliance Theatre were oblivious to the presence of one of the most
famous entertainers in the world sitting in the back row.
</P>
<P>
   Elton John, 51, sat quietly, practically underdressed in a red
warm-up jacket.
</P>
<P>
   John (Sir Elton, if you wish; he was knighted last year), was in
Atlanta for a performance of ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of
Aida,'' a new Disney musical he has written songs for, with a plot
frankly lifted, borrowed, stolen and inspired by Verdi's opera
``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney hopes to take the show to Broadway once it finishes
preview performances Nov. 8 in Atlanta, although there is no
guarantee and no announced date. If ``Elaborate Lives'' makes itto
Broadway, it will follow Disney stage hits ``The Lion King'' and
``Beauty and the Beast.'' ``The Lion King,'' which won six Tony
Awards, continues to be the biggest draw on Broadway, selling
nearly $1 million in tickets every week, according to Playbill. The
4-year-old ``Beauty and the Beast'' continues to sell more than
$500,000 worth of tickets every week.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Elaborate Lives'' is different: It's Disney's first
attempt to produce a live show not based on an animated movie. The
target audience, apparently, is middle-aged boomers with a newly
acquired taste for theater and a long-established fondness for '70s
rock.
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics for the show are by Tim Rice, who earned his place in
the history of music and theater with the arrestingly sacrilegious
take on the Holy Scriptures that he provided for composer Andrew
Lloyd Webber in ``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat''
and ``Jesus Christ Superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ``Elaborate Lives'' came straight from the top of
the Disney organization: Michael Eisner wanted to make an animated
feature based on ``Aida'' even before ``The Lion King,'' and even
approached John, who liked the idea. However, ``The Lion King,''
which also has songs by John and lyrics by Rice, moved ahead of
``Aida'' on the Disney development track.
</P>
<P>
   Stealing a traditional opera plot for a Broadway show is not
unheard of; Gershwin's ``Porgy and Bess'' and Bizet's ``Carmen''
have both appeared in trimmed-down musical versions. Jonathan
Larson used plot and characters from Puccini's ``La Boheme'' with
great success in ``Rent.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that can work _ as it did in ``Rent,'' with a
script that deals with homelessness, AIDS, generational alienation
and drug abuse in a meaningful manner. But, at least in previews,
``Elaborate Lives'' proves that not just any old opera plot can
work in a musical.
</P>
<P>
   COMPARISONS TO VERDI: Until now, Elton John has focused on
writing music for himself. ``Elaborate Lives'' is the second major
chunk of music, after ``The Lion King,'' that he has written for
others to perform. It's also his second collaboration with Rice, an
indication that a new long-term partnership may be developing.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who attended last month's Sunday matinee with John, seemed
almost overdressed in a suit and four-in-hand tie. He frankly
admitted that he wrote the lyrics for ``Elaborate Lives'' before
seeing Verdi's ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it for the first time in London about three months
ago,'' he said. ``It was in Italian, so I didn't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Elton, however, was slightly miffed when asked if he knows
the Verdi opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he said. ``That's what makes this project scary.
Everyone will compare it to Verdi.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Verdi had his strong points, and John has his. Verdi churned out
30 operas, four of which _ ``Aida,'' ``Rigoletto,'' ``La Traviata''
and ``Il Trovatore'' _ are universally renowned.
</P>
<P>
   John has written hundreds of songs and could convincingly set a
laundry list to music _ although even some critics say he has been
``overproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   Verdi, like John, enjoyed an immense international following and
lived comfortably most of his life after a tough start. Verdi
occasionally got tangled in a repetitive bass pattern, just like
John.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Verdi and John share that unexplainable,
unteachable ability to capture mood and character in music.
</P>
<P>
   `AIDA,' ROUGHLY TRANSLATED: Although it is inspired by one of
the most famous operas of all time, ``Elaborate Lives'' is not,
except in the broadest definition, an opera. But it is not an
old-fashioned musical comedy, either, since the end is tragic.
</P>
<P>
   What is it, then?

ATLANTA: is it, then?
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's basically a pageant, an excuse for some Elton John songs,
with a little more plot than an overproduced rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   And, although it's continually engaging, it's not really
effective as drama. In true Disney fashion, Linda Woolverton, who
co-wrote the screenplay of ``The Lion King'' and co-wrote the
``book,'' or basic plot line, of ``Elaborate Lives,'' has reduced
this lofty tale of ancient Egypt to a domestic soap opera _ in this
case, a teen romance.
</P>
<P>
   Amneris, the daughter of Pharaoh, comes across more as a prom
queen than a princess, and Ramades is more like the captain of a
football team than a mighty warrior. Aida, the Nubian slave who is,
unbeknownst to her captors, the daughter of the king of Nubia,
emerges as a streetwise girl from the wrong side of the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Act I, Ramades, Amneris and Aida are pretty much
Archie, Veronica and Betty, complete with a scene at the beach,
except in ancient Egyptian costumes.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental problem is how to draw this trivialized plot to
a close when Verdi's version calls for Aida and Ramades to be
locked in a tomb and starved to death. (Nothing like this happened
to Archie and Veronica.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Elaborate Lives'' preserves the tragic ending, but even with
fancy lighting and an attempt at spiritual apotheosis, the ending
clashes with the trivial spirit of the rest of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rice and John very nearly redeem it. Rice provides his
delightful limping couplets and cliches, and John responds with his
encyclopedic range of pop styles.
</P>
<P>
   True, there's nothing here that couldn't have been written in
1975; although one is tempted to classify ``Elaborate Lives'' as
just another musical in the Lloyd Webber idiom, remember that Lloyd
Webber's style originated in the 1970s rock of John and fellow
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The cast at the preview performances made the most of the
appealing lyrics and music. Princess Amneris, played by Sherie
Scott, is the central character and gets the best songs; and she
looks great in the pseudo-Egyptian costumes, unlike anyone else in
the cast. She also has lungs like Ethel Merman, only more refined.
</P>
<P>
   Her rollicking number ``Dress Has Always Been My Strongest
Suit,'' presents a fashion addict celebrating her wardrobe, in a
Motown style complete with two female backup singers. Her moment of
salvation arrives in ``I Know the Truth,'' a confessional aria in
the vein of Sondheim's ``Send in the Clowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather Headly, Nala in the Broadway production of ``The Lion
King,'' plays Aida as a Whoopi Goldberg type who gets by on her
wits, guilelessly winning the prince's love with her brains while
guilefully gaining Amneris' confidence through her insight from
being a princess herself.
</P>
<P>
   She gets the not-particularly-relevant title song, which will
probably show up three or four tracks into an Elton John CD
someday, but has a great vocal moment in the gospel-style chorus
``The Gods Love Nubia.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince Ramades, played by Hank Stratton, is a pretty standard
Disney prince, transforming early on from a mindless jock to a
sort-of-sensitive guy. He knows all the subtleties of the
Eltonesque vocal style, and nearly saves the role, in spite of a
costume that looks like drag.
</P>
<P>
   High priest Zoser (based on Verdi's Ramfis), who is also
Ramades' father in the Disney version, is a new incarnation of
Herod from ``Jesus Christ, Superstar.'' The duet ``Like Father,
Like Son'' that he shares with Ramades nearly duplicates John's hit
``Philadelphia Freedom'' _ but, after all, it is John's material to
begin with, and it works.
</P>
<P>
   One major additional character not in Verdi's version is the
Nubian urchin Nekhen, played winningly by 14-year-old Scott
Irby-Ranniar (who played the Young Simba in the Broadway version of
``The Lion King).''
</P>
<P>
   Director Robert Jess Roth and choreographer Matt West have not
come up with anything for the chorus and dancers to do except for
neo-Egyptian disco and some stiff poses a la tomb paintings.
</P>
<P>
   A large, movable pyramid that opens up to turn into a rolling
platform, or a set of stairs, is the central item of scenery; it
broke down in last Sunday's matinee. Phallic obelisks and smaller
pyramids and triangles rise from the stage floor or drop from the
ceiling, amid amulets and symbols vaguely suggestive of swastikas
and other fascist emblems; maybe the show could be called
``Elaborate Sets.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it's an aesthetic flop as a piece of theater, that's no
guarantee of failure in today's market. The music should make a
great cast album. With some more polishing, ``Elaborate Lives'' may
even make a halfway successful tourist attraction on Broadway, and
later on the road. The audience cheered sincerely at all three
performances I saw, and there was audible sniffing and quiet
sobbing every time at the end.
</P>

`WHAT DREAMS MAY COME': APPARENTLY, THE AFTERLIFE IS ANYTHING BUT
DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
(JT) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that love, in Hollywood-speak, was
supposed to mean ``never having to say you're sorry.'' ``What
Dreams May Come,'' one of the most elaborate metaphysical love
stories ever tackled by Hollywood, lays out a whole new set of
irritating catch phrases to define the quest for a love that
triumphs over death. These range from the blunt ``Never give up,''
which is repeated like a mantra throughout the movie, to portentous
utterances about winning when you lose and losing when you win.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dreams May Come,'' based on a novel by Richard Matheson
and directed by Vincent Ward, the New Zealand filmmaker noted for
his skill at creating lavish cinematic dreamscapes, represents the
uncomfortable collision of two ideas about filmmaking, one
commercial, the other eccentrically, ambitiously dreamy. On the
commercial level, it is an ecumenically canny exercise in pop
inspiration that's smart enough to drop the name ``God'' only once,
in a vague, nondogmatic reference.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the world's happiest couple, who after both dying
tragic deaths meet again in the afterlife, wants to be a more
grown-up, sophisticated ``Ghost.'' This feel-good allegory,
chock-full of celestial special effects and sentimental reunions,
comes with an uplifting triple-decker finale in the manner of
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams, with his Humpty Dumpty grin and crinkly moist
eyes dripping with empathy, is Chris Nielsen, a gifted
pediatrician, doting husband and father of two, who, in a feat of
metaphysical heroism, travels into the netherworld to rescue his
wife and soul mate, Annie (Annabella Sciorra), from eternal
damnation. Annie is a painter and museum worker who commits suicide
(and is condemned to live in hell for taking her own life) after
Chris is killed in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Four years earlier, the couple's two children, Marie (Jessica
Brooks Grant) and Ian (Josh Paddock), also died in a car wreck that
left both parents shattered. At that terrible moment, Chris'
devotion pulled Annie out of a near-suicidal depression.
</P>
<P>
   Working from a screenplay by Ron Bass, Ward has created a film
that at its most visually evocative portrays its characters' lives
and afterlives as a kind of hall of mirrors, in which the lines
between dream and reality, memory and eternity are continually
blurring as one gives way to another. At its most seductive, the
film portrays heaven as a magical, hallucinatory extension of the
physical world that has been left behind. It is a place flooded
with dim golden light and thick with flowers, of misty peaks and
crags, where people and objects float through the sky and great
distances can be breached with a single leap (of faith, of course).
</P>
<P>
   When Chris first arrives in heaven, he finds himself inside one
of Annie's Gothic romantic paintings. After crunching down in a
flower bed, he gets up to find himself covered with paint, as
though he had landed on a just-completed three-dimensional Renoir
canvas that was still wet.
</P>
<P>
   The underworld he visits with the help of a grim-faced guide
played by (who else?) Max von Sydow is a grim but PG-13-looking
place (when it comes to punishment and suffering) surrounded by
burning shipwrecks. In the most powerful image of hell, one that is
intensely claustrophobic, Chris is forced to run across a sea of
muttering heads all craning up through an endless expanse of mud.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their visual fascination, these images don't seem
connected to real people. Bass' screenplay is so clotted with
slogans, riddles and dime-store psychobabble that Chris and Annie
never coalesce into anything more than a pair of idealized
greeting-card parents with terrible luck. The movie doesn't give
them enough earthly screen time for us to get to know them. Brief
flashbacks find Chris arguing with his son about school, but they
try to cram too much information into too small a space for the
relationship to develop any substance.
</P>
<P>
   And all the weeping and hugging the characters do can't make up
for the film's fatal lack of texture and psychological nuance. Cuba
Gooding Jr. is glaringly miscast as an angel who guides Chris
through his first days in heaven and who turns out to be _ well,
you'll have to see the movie to find out.
</P>
<P>
   It's often been said that baby boomers think they can live
forever. ``What Dreams May Come'' is the movie that tells them,
yes, it's possible, at least in a solipsistic New Age sense, to
attain eternal life. That's because eternity, the movie soothingly
suggests, is whatever you imagine it to be. If you can conjure it
up, then on some level it must be reality. Just like ``Peter Pan.''
Close your eyes, snap your fingers and you can fly.
</P>
<P>

   WHEN TO GO:
</P>
<P>
   Barbados is a year-round destination, although most rainfall
occurs from June to October. Many hotels offer free accommodations
for children between mid-May and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO TRAVEL:
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines flies daily non-stop to Barbados from Miami
and New York. Round-trip fares (currently) start at about $328.
Taxis are plentiful and rates are generally fixed. Hourly rates are
about $16 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO EAT:
</P>
<P>
   The Waterfront Cafe near Trafalgar Square is a popular spot with
good food, live music, and people watching. Brown Sugar, on Bay
Street, offers excellent local cuisine and has a big buffet lunch
for about $17.50 a person. According to locals, the Cliff
restaurant ``is THE place to go.'' The high prices are worth it for
the well-prepared meals and a look at the elegant decor.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY:
</P>
<P>
   There are scores of hotels in Barbados ranging from basic to
deluxe. The island has more than 5,500 hotel rooms. Most are
clustered along the west coast and the south coast. The island's
top-rated hotel is Sandy Lane on the west coast, where rooms go for
several hundred dollars a night. However, the hotel is undergoing a
renovation and will be closed until October 1999.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO:
</P>
<P>
   Windsurfing and water-skiing are popular along the west and
south coasts. There's excellent snorkeling around the reefs and
coves at the beach at Folkestone, close to Holetown on the west
coast. Equipment can be rented on the beach. Catamaran tours go
along the west coast, providing food, liquor, and chances to
snorkel and visit deserted beaches. To get out of the sun, visit
caves and castles, restored homes and old forts. The Barbados
Museum, housed in a former British military prison in Bridgetown,
traces the island's history from pre-Columbus times.

   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados _ When travelers think Caribbean, they
think swaying palm trees, pina coladas under a glazing sun, and a
warm sea that's as clear as gin.
</P>
<P>
   The island of Barbados is all that, but it's also much more than
just a perfect spot to get a tan.
</P>
<P>
   Barbados is the furthest east of the West Indies, which arc from
South America to North America.
</P>
<P>
   The island is rich in history, with a variety of sites dating
back to early in the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   It's also rich in shopping, watersports, and tasty cuisine, with
a wide array of good restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   With names like Brighton Beach, Hastings, Worthing, and Dover,
this former British colony has the feel of a foreign country, but
it is not so exotic as to throw you off-center.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, this capital city -- though not much to look
at -- boasts some of the best nightlife in the region, much of it
centered in the one-room rumshops at Baxters(CQ) Road.
</P>
<P>
   Since most people live comfortably, what Barbados does not have
is a lot of the irksome hassle from street hawkers, or the poverty
that's so visible in shantytowns and rural areas in other parts of
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   But if it's the beaches you want, then beaches you can get,
particularly along the island's sheltered west coast, where
tame-as-a-kitten waves lap the smooth sands of some of the finest
beaches in the Caribbean, especially around Speightstown.
</P>
<P>
   Then for those who shun the beach, there's the rugged shoreline
on the Atlantic side, with its enticing caves, powerful waves,
jagged rock ridges, and an undertow that's so beastly there are
scads of signs to warn one against taking a dip.
</P>
<P>
   Though not frequented by swimmers, this side is quite popular
with surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Barbados is also a pleasant family destination. Children will
enjoy pirate ships, working mills and sugar plantations, as well as
tram rides past the stalagmites and stalactites of Harrison's Cave.
</P>
<P>
   The first Europeans to discover the island were the Portuguese,
who dubbed it Barbados, or bearded ones, after the Bearded Fig
trees that grew along the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   But English settlers came soon after and Barbados was a British
colony from 1627 to 1966, when it gained independence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the British influence is felt everywhere you go.
</P>
<P>
   Residents drive on the left side of the road. They speak English
with a lovely lilt. Cricket is the national sport.
</P>
<P>
   Many hotels are British-owned, offering afternoon tea served on
rattan-furnished patios alongside buttered scones.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgetown even comes to life around a Trafalgar Square, which
has a statue of Lord Nelson, sculpted by Sir Richard Westmacott and
predating its London equivalent by 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   The monarchy in England remains the head of state, while the
justice system and parliamentary style of government are both
borrowed from the United Kingdom. As an island steeped in
democratic tradition, the House of Assembly here is the third
oldest parliament in the hemisphere, celebrating its 350th
anniversary in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Today the 166-square-mile island supports a population of
266,000 people, many of whom are descendants of Africans brought
here as slaves to toil on vast sugar plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders call themselves Bajans (pronounced ``Bah-jonz''). They
are polite, friendly, and highly educated. The literacy rate of
nearly 98 percent is the highest in the English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   Like a small town, everyone here seems to know everyone else,
and drivers wave to one another as a matter of course. Bajans are
very religious, and the island has more churches than days in the
year. Surprisingly, they are also nutty about their horoscopes,
consuming them in their daily newspaper faster than the front-page
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the island's historical ties with Britain, children are
becoming increasingly influenced by American culture, with most
aspiring to be Michael Jordan when they grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Bajans are a people who appreciate their past.
</P>
<P>
   There's a strong preservation movement here and a dynamic
National Trust that has salvaged not only the forts, churches, and
plantation estates -- called ``great houses'' here -- of the
colonials, but the heritage of black national heroes as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Charles on Needham Point, which now forms part of the
gardens surrounding the Hilton Hotel, was the largest of the many
forts that guarded the island's south and west coastlines.
</P>
<P>
   St. Nicholas Abbey, dating from about 1650, is one of the oldest
domestic structures in the region, and one of only three surviving
examples of Jacobean architecture in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   There are two great houses near Six Cross Roads, where the
Easter Rebellion of 1816 took place.
</P>
<P>
   The Easter Rebellion was an uprising by slaves who mistakenly
thought that a bill had been introduced in the English parliament
granting them their freedom. The slaves destroyed many acres of
cane fields when they thought plantation owners were denying them
that freedom. Although no owners or their families were killed,
several hundred slaves were killed in a battle that quickly crushed
the rebellion, while other slaves were hanged afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   One great house in the area is Sunbury Plantation, some 300
years old. The house is elegantly decorated in Georgian style, and
most furnishings are mahogany. The other great house is Oughterson
Plantation, near the Barbados Zoo Park.
</P>
<P>
   The island boasts several impressive castles, notorious Sam
Lord's being among the most popular. This castle, built in 1820 and
since restored, was a hideout for the infamous pirate who,
according to legend, assembled a fortune by plundering boats that
became shipwrecked after he lured them onto Cobbler's Reef.
</P>
<P>
   Near Trafalgar Square, you can easily walk to St. Michael's
Cathedral, built in the 18th century. You can then stop by the
Synagogue, an early 19th-century building on the site of a
17th-century one, one of the two earliest in the hemisphere. You
can see the Gothic-style Parliament Building, built in 1872.
</P>
<P>
   About three miles away is the much-visited statue of a freed
slave that celebrates Barbadians' full emancipation from slavery
160 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But if you grow tired of all the statues and architectural
treasures, you can veer away from Trafalgar Square toward Broad
Street, where duty-free goods ranging from clothes to cameras are
sold.
</P>
<P>
   You can also savor mouth-watering cuisine and some of the best
fresh fish around.
</P>
<P>
   Flying fish come two or three to a plate, usually fried. Dolphin
-- the fish and not the beloved mammal -- is good and served at
most restaurants. Cou-cou (pronounced ``Koo-koo'') is a starchy
dish usually made with tree-grown breadfruit. Pumpkin is a staple,
served as everything from pumpkin soup to pumpkin fritters.
</P>
<P>
   So if you come to Barbados, it might be easy to stay at the
beach, sipping rum punch and soaking up the sun. But you'd be
missing a lot. When it comes to the Caribbean, Barbados is one
island where there's plenty to do, none of which has anything to do
with sand and surf.

anniversary in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Today the 166-square-mile island supports a population of
266,000 people, many of whom are descendants of Africans brought
here as slaves to toil on vast sugar plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders call themselves Bajans (pronounced ``Bah-jonz''). They
are polite, friendly, and highly educated. The literacy rate of
nearly 98 percent is the highest in the English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   Like a small town, everyone here seems to know everyone else,
and drivers wave to one another as a matter of course. Bajans are
very religious, and the island has more churches than days in the
year. Surprisingly, they are also nutty about their horoscopes,
consuming them in their daily newspaper faster than the front-page
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the island's historical ties with Britain, children are
becoming increasingly influenced by American culture, with most
aspiring to be Michael Jordan when they grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Bajans are a people who appreciate their past.
</P>
<P>
   There's a strong preservation movement here and a dynamic
National Trust that has salvaged not only the forts, churches, and
plantation estates -- called ``great houses'' here -- of the
colonials, but the heritage of black national heroes as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Charles on Needham Point, which now forms part of the
gardens surrounding the Hilton Hotel, was the largest of the many
forts that guarded the island's south and west coastlines.
</P>
<P>
   St. Nicholas Abbey, dating from about 1650, is one of the oldest
domestic structures in the region, and one of only three surviving
examples of Jacobean architecture in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   There are two great houses near Six Cross Roads, where the
Easter Rebellion of 1816 took place.
</P>
<P>
   The Easter Rebellion was an uprising by slaves who mistakenly
thought that a bill had been introduced in the English parliament
granting them their freedom. The slaves destroyed many acres of
cane fields when they thought plantation owners were denying them
that freedom. Although no owners or their families were killed,
several hundred slaves were killed in a battle that quickly crushed
the rebellion, while other slaves were hanged afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   One great house in the area is Sunbury Plantation, some 300
years old. The house is elegantly decorated in Georgian style, and
most furnishings are mahogany. The other great house is Oughterson
Plantation, near the Barbados Zoo Park.
</P>
<P>
   The island boasts several impressive castles, notorious Sam
Lord's being among the most popular. This castle, built in 1820 and
since restored, was a hideout for the infamous pirate who,
according to legend, assembled a fortune by plundering boats that
became shipwrecked after he lured them onto Cobbler's Reef.
</P>
<P>
   Near Trafalgar Square, you can easily walk to St. Michael's
Cathedral, built in the 18th century. You can then stop by the
Synagogue, an early 19th-century building on the site of a
17th-century one, one of the two earliest in the hemisphere. You
can see the Gothic-style Parliament Building, built in 1872.
</P>
<P>
   About three miles away is the much-visited statue of a freed
slave that celebrates Barbadians' full emancipation from slavery
160 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But if you grow tired of all the statues and architectural
treasures, you can veer away from Trafalgar Square toward Broad
Street, where duty-free goods ranging from clothes to cameras are
sold.
</P>
<P>
   You can also savor mouth-watering cuisine and some of the best
fresh fish around.
</P>
<P>
   Flying fish come two or three to a plate, usually fried. Dolphin
-- the fish and not the beloved mammal -- is good and served at
most restaurants. Cou-cou (pronounced ``Koo-koo'') is a starchy
dish usually made with tree-grown breadfruit. Pumpkin is a staple,
served as everything from pumpkin soup to pumpkin fritters.
</P>
<P>
   So if you come to Barbados, it might be easy to stay at the
beach, sipping rum punch and soaking up the sun. But you'd be
missing a lot. When it comes to the Caribbean, Barbados is one
island where there's plenty to do, none of which has anything to do
with sand and surf.

OVERNIGHT SENSATION TAKES THE YANKEES (AND TEXAS) BY STORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He is The Unnatural, an overnight sensation nearly
nine years in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer has the callouses on his hands as proof of the
dues he paid on all those hot afternoons in a batting cage. The
only thing that came naturally to Spencer was the stubbornness to
not go away until he had worn down the New York Yankees' resistance
to let him show what he can do.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer arrived at the Bronx by way of Tampa, Oneonta,
Greensboro, Norwich and Columbus. He had more than 2,800 at-bats at
those minor-league stops before he got his first invitation to
Yankee Stadium. He is 26, and he is playing as if he cannot endure
the thought of one more bumpy bus ride to a bumpier field to play
another game under dim lights.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre did himself the favor Wednesday of
finding a place in the lineup for somebody who ended the regular
season by hitting seven home runs in nine games. Less than an hour
and a half before Spencer took his place in left field for Game 2
of the American League Division Series, somebody asked what his
best baseball moment had been before reaching the big leagues.
Spencer didn't know what to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just every day, getting a chance to play,'' Spencer said. ``I
don't think I've had one yet. I haven't said, `OK, that's a great
moment.' I'm think I'm still waiting for one.''
</P>
<P>
   If Spencer keeps creating moments and memories the way he did
Wednesday night at the expense of the Texas Rangers, then
Cooperstown is going to have to clear some space for him. Mark
McGwire will refer to him as ``The Man.'' Hollywood will scramble
to the rights to tell his life story.
</P>
<P>
   Citizen Shane?
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 57,360 summoned Spencer from the dugout after his
first trip to the plate against Rangers right-hander Rick Helling
in the second inning. That's what happens when a rookie hits a home
run in the first playoff at-bat of his career to send the Yankees
on their way to a 3-1 victory. Spencer singled two innings later,
starting a two-run rally that turned out to be all the offense the
Yankees needed to move to within one victory of closing out the
best-of-5 series. One inning after that, Spencer rifled a throw
that arrived in time to nail Juan Gonzalez trying for a double, but
Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch dropped the ball trying to
make the tag.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, it was just another day in the life of a former
28th-round draft choice. Three at-bats. Two hits. Another home run.
Add that to his regular-season totals, and Spencer has homered 11
times and driven in 28 runs in 70 at-bats. Before long, Torre is
going to expect this kind of thing to happen every time he writes
Spencer's name on the lineup card.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope it does,'' Torre said. ``The thought of `Damn
Yankees' and Joe Hardy come to mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Damn Yankees is right, as far as the Rangers are concerned. The
Yankees were the best team in baseball before adding a cross
between McGwire and Roy Hobbs to the mix. Spencer's slugging
average during the regular season was .910. McGwire needed 70 home
runs to slug .752. And McGwire didn't hit three grand slams in nine
games, the way Spencer did to finish the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit three grand slams in 17 years,'' said Torre, a nine-time
All-Star who had 252 career home runs. No wonder teammates have
taken to calling Spencer ``The Wonder Boy.'' Lately, they've
teasingly scolded Spencer for making the game look ridiculously
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you one thing: He doesn't get cheated,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``He knows what that piece of wood is
for, and it isn't to clean off his cleats. My only question is:
Where has he been all year?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spencer started the season, as he always does, in the minors.
The Yankees had their reasons for not being in a hurry to take
notice of him. His home run totals in his first five minor-league
seasons: 0, 0, 3, 12 and 8. Spencer didn't get to Double-A until
'96, hitting 29 homers for Norwich. A .241 average with 30 homers
the next year at Triple-A didn't have the Yankees figuring out ways
to make room for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the minor leagues, I thought, `If I was with
another team, I would have a shot and can prove myself,''' Spencer
said. ``The way it worked out, this year I was ready. I'm glad I
made it with the Yankees. I made it with the best organization
ever, instead of a team that's going to be a .500 club.''
</P>
<P>
   An injury to Chili Davis earned Spencer his first call to the
majors _ finally _ on April 7. Spencer had four hitless at-bats
before getting sent down to Columbus on April 19. The Yankees
called up Spencer again in June, giving him two at-bats in 20 days
before sending him back to Triple-A. He replaced Dale Sveum on the
25-man roster on July 27 and got his first big-league hit the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after that, Spencer had a 5-for-5, two-homer game
against Kansas City. Ten days after that, the Yankees sent Spencer
to Columbus again to make room for Davis. The Yankees brought him
back on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden,'' Torre said, ``he kind of blossomed.''
</P>
<P>
   He slugged home run after home run, until Torre had to see if
the magic could continue in the playoffs. On Spencer's first at-bat
Wednesday, Helling froze him with a 1-2 fastball that home-plate
umpire Durwood Merrill deemed to be just off the inside corner.
Spencer took advantage of the reprieve on the next pitch. He
walloped a belt-high fastball down the middle just left of the
399-foot sign in left-center. The fans would not calm down until
Spencer came out for a curtain call. As Spencer left the field at
the end of the game, the fans chanted his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than getting out there and not doing good,''
Spencer said, ``and having them boo you off the field.''

   HOUSTON _ What do you want from art? If you're like most people,
you want art of something you can recognize, in colors that please
the eye. You want an affordable original, handmade by someone who
is sincere about his work. And you probably don't care if the art
world doesn't like what you like. But what if you could get the art
you liked and could afford and that any number of artists, curators
and critics also admire and collect? Then come on down to Rice

John, 51, sat quietly, practically underdressed in a red warm-up
jacket. John (Sir Elton, if you wish; he was knighted last year),

   UNDATED _ Betting made more money in the United States in 1996
than baseball, movies and theme parks combined, according to a new
book on the gambling industry. Estimates put legal betting in the
United States at $585.6 billion in 1996, up astronomically from the
$17.3 billion spent 20 years earlier. ``The torrent of cash that
spews from our pockets and streams through the corporate boardrooms
and darker corners of America's gambling establishments has created
a commercial juggernaut,'' New York Times reporter Timothy L.
O'Brien writes. O'Brien tackles the pros and cons of this
burgeoning industry in his first book, ``Bad Bet: The Inside Story
of the Glamour, Glitz, and Danger of America's Gambling Industry''
(Random House, 339 pages). By TERESA MCUSIC. Story has moved in

NO PLACE LIKE HOME, NOT EVEN HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ People talk about New York as a city of
neighborhoods, and they talk about it as a city of changing
neighborhoods, but it never really occurred to me that my
neighborhood would change, not while I was gone.
</P>
<P>
   I have an apartment just off the New York University campus, and
I've always thought of the few blocks north and south of Houston
Street on the west side of Broadway as my home turf, a
semi-fashionable, semi-shabby tract of the city that allows people
like me with ambivalent self-images to think of themselves as
leaning either way, not to mention as younger than we actually are.
</P>
<P>
   There have been changes over the years, particularly on Prince
Street, where the Guggenheim moved in, and restaurants like Jerry's
and more recently the Cub Room have made things considerably
hipper, but there was always Fanelli's and the Prince Street Bar,
where the traffic maintained its comfortable undressiness.
</P>
<P>
   So it was an interesting thing to do, after subletting my place
and living in Chicago for a year, when I had occasion to be in New
York a couple of times this summer, to stay in my home neighborhood
but not in my home. Instead, I stayed at the Mercer Hotel, the
upscale hostelry at the corner of Prince and Mercer, owned by Andre
Balazs, which opened with gradual fanfare between April and August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening Soonish,'' the sign on the outside said when I arrived
for my first visit at the end of May, somewhat offputting for
someone with a reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I knew from the gossip columns that the likes of Leonardo
DiCaprio and John Malkovich had already camped there and that
Calvin Klein had an apartment on the top floor. And it's a small
place, just 75 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   So I had that shamefully wonderful feeling of being accepted as
glamorous enough, even though I had registered under an assumed
name and couldn't be confused with my namesake, the photographer,
who is indisputably glamorous enough. And I was amused by the
unfinishedness, the sense of work in progress, of a happening to
be.
</P>
<P>
   In May, though there was no room service, I was told I could,
day or night, take the elevator to the basement kitchen for a
snack; but at 6 the next morning, padding downstairs in socks and a
fluffy bathrobe, I woke the busboy, who sleepily let me know I'd
been misinformed. Even now, there are no printed brochures; if you
ask for a rate card, you're given a hand-written slip of paper. I
think $325 a night and up is a more startling tariff to confront
when it's scrawled in pencil.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to keep in mind that I was in familiar territory,
viewing the city experience from a perspective only slightly south
of the one I was accustomed to, but just entering the lobby made
that difficult. It is high-ceilinged and, because the outside wall
is thickly draped, a little dim.
</P>
<P>
   It is designed entirely in pale solid colors; not a pattern or a
stripe to be found on the walls, the retro-plain (but comfortable)
furniture, the uniforms of the registration personnel or the
bindings on the books in the bookcases that line one end of the
room. (Were the books real? I don't know. Perhaps they'd had all of
Tolstoy rebound in orange and green, but the shelves were too high
to check.)
</P>
<P>
   The one prominent decorative artifact, a glass-mosaic sculpture
by the Finnish artist Stephan Lindfors, in the shape of a ship's
prow, hangs from the ceiling in the hall on the way to the guest
elevators, and it adds to the sense of coolly polished style.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the effect is beautifully bland, or maybe blandly
beautiful, and I had the distinct sense of walking into the pages
of a fashion magazine; before I checked in, I actually sniffed the
air, alert for that powdery perfumey odor that I associate with
Vogue and Vanity Fair. (OK, it wasn't there.) I know this sounds
arch and perhaps willfully unsophisticated; I don't mean it that
way. Well, maybe I do.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the air and manner of high fashion just felt
strange for a part of the city that I've always felt possessive
about, and that, with a New Yorker's hubris, I presumed was somehow
informed by my character.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't so much join the neighborhood when I moved there a
decade ago, I thought, as remake it in my image. And though I never
felt unwelcome or even out of place at the hotel, the lobby struck
me as a nexus of glossy worlds.
</P>
<P>
   It always seemed to be populated by lanky, unshaven, casually
dressed men just in from the coast and willowy women in snug black
sheaths on downtown leave from Conde Nast. This shouldn't be
surprising _ Balazs owns the Chateau Marmont on Sunset Boulevard,
after all, and his wife is Katie Ford, the modeling monarch _ but
to be in the midst of it is to shiver in the cool breeze of style.
In my experience, the neighborhood is warmer than that.
</P>
<P>
   Style, of course, does not preclude substance. And in the case
of the Mercer Hotel, it is there in the rooms, which, without
renouncing any cool at all, swaddle you in it rather comfortably;
imagine the snugness of an igloo but with vaulted ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The rooms are all different, but even the singles are, by New
York standards, sizable. They are airy, painted a bright white with
stunning dark trim around the elegant mirrors, and appointed in a
pristine luxury. A CD and tape player. A cellular phone and a
regular one. The cotton sheets were simply the most comfortable I'd
ever slept on.
</P>
<P>
   And the bathrooms are glorious, though not all come with tubs,
which are worth spending an extra few dollars for. I'm not a bath
person, maybe because I'm 6 feet tall and have never cottoned to
tucking my feet in under the faucet.
</P>
<P>
   But the tubs are the size of Jacuzzis, deep and long and
beckoning even to the likes of me. And the shower stalls, in
brilliant white tile, are roomy enough to wash a Volkswagen and
appointed with enough heads and shpritzers that you don't need to
turn around.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to me that this was the secret side of high style,
and I felt I could get used to it. Maybe I didn't have enough to
do, but one night I actually took a bath and a shower.
</P>
<P>
   This was on my last visit, in late summer, and by then the
Mercer Kitchen had opened _ the restaurant created by Jean-Georges
Vongerichten, the proprietor of two other bistros uptown,
Jean-Georges and Vong. (How (italics)does(end italics) he come up
with these names?)
</P>
<P>
   When I finally got cleaned up and went to dinner, I enjoyed
myself. The menu is hearty and unexotic (though the couscous was
notably tasty), with emphasis on grilled meats, fish and shellfish.
I had chicken; my two companions, lobster. Everyone was pleased.
With wine and tip and a shared dessert, the tab for three came to
about $200.
</P>
<P>
   The room itself is the real attraction, however, a kind of
high-end rathskeller. Below-ground, brick-walled, with a stairway
dividing the room in two (communal tables on one side, more private
dining on the other) and a low bar lining one wall with a softly
lighted glass-and-bottle rack glowing warmly behind it, the place
felt welcoming. With all the tables occupied and tipplers two deep
at the bar, it felt full but not crowded, and with everyone in full
conversation, there was a nice, convivial buzz; no one had to shout
to be heard. I don't know why that happens in some places but not
others; acoustics, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   The room was notable for another reason as well; it felt like a
hot place, a place to be seen. Necks were craning; who's over
there? The women, particularly, were dressed, if not to be seen,
then to be watched. And yet it was full of adults, thirtysomethings
(and up), rather than twentysomethings, which is probably another
reason the noise level was manageable, the air in the place alive
but not urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Like Daisy Buchanan's voice, the atmosphere had money in it, but
it was quieter, more confident money than one ordinarily encounters
in a lively new joint. It wasn't ostentatious; it didn't bug me.
</P>
<P>
   The next evening, I went for a walk around the neighborhood. I
stood outside my old apartment building, considering the perplexing
metaphor of looking in from the outside at a house you own that is
being inhabited by someone else. I felt a little undone, which is
why I walked back to Prince Street to grab a beer at my
longest-standing haunt, the Prince Street Bar. But it was gone.
Closed. Apparently for good. So I went back to the bar at the
Mercer Kitchen. Out with the old, in with the new.
</P>
<P>
   There, at the bar, I had a conversation with a former model who
had recently gone back to school. Now in her 30s, she was a
freshman, studying literature. She lived in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me show you what I like best about this place,'' she said.
And she walked into an adjoining alcove and pointed at the ceiling,
where light was streaming palely in from the sidewalk above,
through translucent glass. The shoes and legs of walkers could be
detected; it was a weird feeling of surveillance from below. ``It's
the same in the bathrooms,'' she said. ``I love New York.'' Me,
too, I thought. Even from a new perspective.

PAINTER PRODUCES MASSES OF ART FOR THE MASSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ What do you want from art?
</P>
<P>
   If you're like most people, you want art of something you can
recognize, in colors that please the eye.
</P>
<P>
   You want an affordable original, handmade by someone who is
sincere about his work.
</P>
<P>
   And you probably don't care if the art world doesn't like what
you like.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you could get the art you liked and could afford and
that any number of artists, curators and critics also admire and
collect?
</P>
<P>
   Then come on down to Rice University, where Stephen Keene has
turned an ordinarily austere art gallery into Art-O-Rama.
</P>
<P>
   ONE MAN, ONE ASSEMBLY LINE: Keene, 41, mass-produces highly
decorative paintings and sells them to anyone and everyone _ from
people who never visit galleries to the director of the
Philadelphia Museum of Art. Most of his pictures measure about 2
feet square and sell for $2. At the expensive end _ $15 _ he makes
paintings that are 4 feet square.
</P>
<P>
   He sells them for less than the price of most coffee drinks
because he works like a one-man assembly line. He sets up 20 or so
pieces of plywood on a long rack, then goes down the line, painting
the same stroke again and again, dipping his brush in another color
and painting another stroke again and again ... until he has
finished 20 vivid pictures that might be adapted from a cereal box
or a textbook or, um, just about anything.
</P>
<P>
   This unconventional technique, Keene's frequent combination of
words and pictures, his habit of painting on wood _ all that and
the initial influence of Georgia folk artist Howard Finster _ might
make him sound like an outsider to an art world centered on
precious objects and elite patronage. But Keene is by no means
naive, self-educated, insane or any of the other labels attached to
many artists working outside the mainstream. He us totally a
product of the complex, market-oriented art system that has evolved
over the past 25 to 30 years in America.
</P>
<P>
   Which may be why Keene, his art and his means of producing and
selling it can arouse suspicion, even fear and anger.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when Keene showed last December at the gallery at
Philadelphia's Moore College of Art and Design, several people
protested his activities there as ``mean-spirited and cynical,''
according to one ``Time'' magazine report.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being told they bought a piece of art, and they
haven't, which is condescending,'' one outraged academic said.
``It's a bad joke'' that ``has no merit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elsa Longhauser, who organized the show, paints a highly
positive picture of Keene. She calls him ``the Johnny Appleseed of
art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure people question his motives,'' she says. ``But
Stephen is a tremendously generous and skilled artist, and a very
aware conceptual and performance artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a conscious decision to work in multiples and make his
art accessible for almost no money. And, at Moore, he made his art
in public. People watched him go down a row, painting
stroke-by-stroke, which is beautiful and almost meditative to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, says Longhauser, Keene empowers people who are
otherwise disenfranchised from the art system, allowing to critique
the relative qualities of artworks, touch them, combine pictures as
they wish and then buy them.
</P>
<P>
   Keene, who is working 12- to 14-hour days at Rice, denies any
malice or cynicism. ``It wasn't like I had a career strategy, like
I was calculating all that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never intended my artwork to go this direction, either. But
over the years, it's gotten such a positive response that it has
become what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Keene's public production, display and sale of art has the
quality of a happening or a performance _ activities that are
sincere and serious, but also fun. Keene likens the artworks people
buy to souvenirs that can be kept, traded or given as gifts.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disciplined physically. I know what I'm going to do and
how, what brushes and what colors,'' he says. ``But, obviously, a
$30 painting for over the sofa is not Tintoretto.''
</P>
<P>
   ART AS WORK: Keene has worked in this vein for about seven
years. He mostly shows and sells in nightclubs. Moore was the first
art institution in which he had shown; Rice is the second.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, his story resembled those of untold other artists.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost half the artists in the United States, Keene holds a
degree in fine art. His masters degree in fine arts is from Yale
University, which gives him an edge over countless colleagues. But
Keene says that he, like most artists, ``was always
middle-of-the-road with what I did. I was never bold enough to go
straight to New York after graduate school.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent his first three or four years after school in Richmond,
Va. He painted representational scenes in a painstakingly bland
style, showed in some decent galleries and occasionally sold
something.
</P>
<P>
   He sent out packets of slides, with updated resumes, to curators
and dealers. He went to museums and galleries and read art
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   By 1991, however, Keene knew he needed to break with art-world
protocol. He had some sign-painter-style things he wanted to do,
which he knew the art world wouldn't like. But he also knew he had
absolutely nothing to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Keene and his wife, architect Star Keene, moved
to New York. Keene rented a studio in Brooklyn and set to work on
his production line. His art first started generating a buzz in
downtown Manhattan, home of New York's independent rock music
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Keene had worked as a DJ in college, had a lot of musician
friends and found it only natural to show in clubs and make art for
CD covers. Between doing well with one-night sales and getting
terrific word-of-mouth, he sold about 13,000 paintings between 1993
and mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   He sold a couple of thousand more paintings in Philadelphia and
some 1,200 on his first day at Rice.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain his inventory _ and to contribute to his household's
income _ Keene turns out maybe 90 small paintings in 12 to 14
hours. In theory, he spends perhaps eight minutes on each picture.
</P>
<P>
   His nose-to-the-grindstone process leaves Keene little time to
speculate on where his path will lead. In any case, he adds, much
of the project's integrity requires that he stay focused on the
task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for me to make the best art I can at any time
and not think ahead,'' Keene says. ``The harder I work, the more it
means to me and other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Keene's deliberate myopia doesn't mean he is insincere. And his
reactionary stance, vis-a-vis the system, doesn't mean he's mocking
it or other artists.
</P>
<P>
   His art is not about irony but about being ``out in the world,''
Keene says.
</P>
<P>
   THE KIDS LOVED IT: Keene has been at Rice since early September
and, from the start, his enterprise has caused a sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew just from hearing about it that Steve's work was right
for us,'' says Rice gallery director Kim Davenport, who learned
about Keene from a member of the gallery's advisory board. ``Our
mission is to primarily show site-specific installations _ and what
Steve does is to make an installation out of painting.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first day of sales, Keene blanketed the walls with
pictures, hung in layers from floor to ceiling. He had stacked so
many painted constructions and pieces of painted furniture on the
floor that people had to squeeze their way between things.
</P>
<P>
   There were landscapes _ from desert vistas to snowy mountains.
Flowers were everywhere, like daisies in May. Also scenes of
Houston _ from the downtown skyline to pictures from Bayou Bend _
Bible scenes, cutouts of the Alamo and cutouts of cute little
burros. And cutouts of Michael Jordan. The panels of a huge folding
screen at the front of the gallery feature a detail from Thomas
Cole's ``The Hunter's Return,'' from the collection of the Amon
Carter Museum.
</P>
<P>
   From his experience at Moore, Keene knew it would be tough
maintaining such a sense of flea-market density. So he planned not
only to produce on a daily basis; he also brought an initial supply
of 2,000 pictures with him from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, come closing time the first Sunday of sales, the place
was decimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wild, but in an organized way,'' gallery manager Jaye
Anderton says. ``We had more than 1,000 people come through between
noon and 5 p.m. People were smiling and having a good time, but
they were calm and very focused on what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part was the kids. There were a lot of children with
big smiles on their faces, picking out a piece of art for their
very own.''
</P>
<P>
   NEXT STOP: GERMANY: First Moore, then Rice. Now the Museum
Ludwig in Cologne has decided to include Keene in a group show this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean the art world wants to rehabilitate its mildly
prodigal son?
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, it needs Keene. Like the retail and entertainment
industries, the art world is always starved for fresh talent and
new products. And, anymore, almost anything can be considered
important contemporary art _ even paintings some might compare to
velvet Elvis paintings and other forms of parking-lot art.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such potential, Longhauser muses, ``Can Stephen
Keene remain Stephen Keene?''
</P>
<P>
   Longhauser may speculate. But Keene, looking to his own
integrity and not wanting to leave anyone empty-handed, is too busy
painting to answer that question.

   &UR; SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Raiders (2-2) at Cardinals (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Cardinals, 96.8 yards rushing/game
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Oakland Coach John Gruden has done a solid job with
this team, winning games the old Raiders would have lost. After
beating the Cowboys many Raiders players are actually feeling good
about themselves and it has been a long time since anyone could say
that. Great battle: Cornerback Charles Woodson against wide
receiver Rob Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 14-10
</P>
<P>
   Giants (2-2) at Buccaneers (1-3)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Kanell: 9-4-1 as Giants starter
</P>
<P>
   Comments: This is one of the biggest games the Giants will have
all season. Not because it's the Buccaneers, but because this is
the Giants' chance to show they have a killer instinct. Tampa Bay
is struggling, losing last week to a terrible Detroit team, 27-6,
on Monday Night Football. The Giants are good enough to put Tampa
Bay out of its misery. Right now, the Giants' defense is playing
with enthusiasm, the way it did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 20-14
</P>
<P>
   Eagles (0-4) at Broncos (4-0)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Terrell Davis, 659 rushing yards
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The only way the Eagles win this game is if the
Broncos forfeit it. Denver has won 18 straight at home and is 24-2
in the regular-season at home under Mike Shanahan, the most
ruthless coach in the league. There is little chance he will let
the Broncos get cocky. He's too good a coach. He also has his eye
on Jacksonville, also undefeated, and it could come down to those
two teams for home field advantage in the playoffs. Every game
counts.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 35-11
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks (3-1) at Chiefs (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   Key stat: Chiefs have won last 6 against Seattle
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The quarterbacks in this game should take out extra
health insurance. Kansas City's Derrick Thomas has seven sacks as
does Seattle's Michael Sinclair. The Chiefs have won 15 of last 16
against Seattle at Arrowhead Stadium. But the Seahawks' defense was
impressive last week against Pittsburgh. They again rise to the
challenge, this time against Kansas City. And Seattle running back
Ricky Watters has a huge game against a weak Chiefs run defense.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, 21-20

`SHOT THROUGH THE HEART': A CHILLING STORY OF SHATTERED
FRIENDSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like scores of other television movies, ``Shot Through the
Heart'' is based on real events. But unlike so many of the others,
this drama feels brutally real. That is so not only because the
film believably grabs its locale and plot from the news, but also
because it paints a memorable portrait of ordinary people
transformed by extraordinary circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The HBO film, to be seen on Sunday night, is based on an article
about the war in Bosnia by John Falk, a free-lance reporter, in the
November 1995 issue of Details magazine. Falk distilled the anguish
of sectarian warfare to the most intimate terms by describing two
men, friends since youth, whose bond is shattered by the bloody
conflict: one is a Serb, the other a Croat married to a Muslim. The
friends are champion riflemen who once won honor for themselves and
for Yugoslavia by firing harmlessly at target ranges. Now that
there is no more Yugoslavia, they have learned to train their
sights on the citizens of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the script, by Guy Hibbert, comes right out of
Falk's account. As the story opens, Vlado Sarzhinsky and Slavko
Simic are enjoying some friendly target practice. Slavko, the Serb
(Vincent Perez), has always been the superior shot. He is a
carefree bachelor who dotes on Vlado (Linus Roache), his wife,
Maida (Lia Williams), and their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   They all enjoy comfortable lives in their cosmopolitan city. But
this is 1992. Radovan Karadzic declares the establishment of a
Serbian nation. His army begins a wave of attacks, the
manifestations of long-simmering ethnic animosity. Slavko is
called, initially to train the Bosnian Serb army's recruits; he
tells his flabbergasted friend that he will report.
</P>
<P>
   Slavko also begs Vlado to get his family out of the country,
offering to help them escape to Vienna, Austria. Vlado refuses to
believe that he must abandon his home. ``We're Europeans, for God's
sake,'' he declares. ``The moment we walk away, we lose
everything.'' He soon understands how quickly everything can be
lost.
</P>
<P>
   But it's too late to escape, and Vlado watches as Sarajevo
deteriorates into a war zone. Serbian snipers kill people on the
streets and in their homes. Vlado and his rifle join the city's
defenders. When he is told that one sniper is able to shoot his
victims in the head from a tremendous distance, Vlado knows he must
stop the man. And he knows who the man must be.
</P>
<P>
   Considering its horrific subject, the film, directed by David
Attwood on location in Sarajevo and Budapest, Hungary, is
understated. The war assaults the viewer's consciousness through
the torturous accumulation of mundane losses.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable performance, Roache (``The Wings of the Dove'')
charts Vlado's transformation from self-satisfied middle-class
businessman to grizzled guerrilla, investing him with more regret
than vengeance. His scenes with Ms. Williams (a Tony nominee for
``Skylight'') quietly locate the shattered hearts of people whose
lives have been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   When their daughter's friend has been killed on her own
doorstep, Maida tells her husband, ``They can't bury her at the
cemetery.'' He asks why not, and she nearly whispers, ``It's
full.'' Ms. Williams turns those simple words into a chilling
pronouncement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Do you know where trials are won today?'' asks Norman Keane,
one slick defense lawyer, in ``Legalese (8 p.m Sunday on TNT). ``On
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman's scheme to prove his point in a high-profile case is the
dark heart of ``Legalese,'' which sets out to skewer the law and
the media and nearly succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Norman (James Garner) is called upon to defend Angela Beale
(Gina Gershon) after she fatally shoots her brother-in-law.
Although she says he attacked her, nobody really thinks that Angela
_ an actress who plays a lusty Eve in apple commercials (``Go
ahead, take a bite!'') _ is an innocent victim. But how to get her
off?
</P>
<P>
   Fate sends Norman an instrument for his deviousness: young Roy
Guyton (Ed Kerr), just arrived from the heartland. Norman decides
that the innocent-looking Roy is just the lawyer that
guilty-looking Angela needs, as long as Norman the shark is calling
the plays. He appoints his cool sharkette associate Rica Martin
(Mary Louise Parker) as Roy's personal handler, a directive she
takes literally.
</P>
<P>
   Right on cue, here come the media jackals, led by the ruthless
Brenda Whitlass (Kathleen Turner), who presides over a tabloid talk
show called ``Scandal Central.'' She and Norman are alternately
allies and adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   The film, written by Billy Ray and directed by Glenn Jordan,
starts out laughing ruefully at society's overwhelming voyeurism.
But it ends up with more ambition than wit, and when the dialogue
starts to get preachy, the deft tone turns sour.
</P>
<P>
   Garner, who gets craggier without growing older, is right at
home in Norman's fancy suits. Ms. Turner gets it just right as a
purring alley cat of a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Parker's Rica takes the country boy under her wing,
you're reminded of Jean Arthur doing the same to Jimmy Stewart. And
you can't help but believe Roy's surrender. Who wouldn't want to
dive into those eyes and swim laps?

CLINTON BRACES FOR IMPEACHMENT FIGHT BY NURTURING POLITICAL BASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 4)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is going back to basics to combat
the impeachment threat.
</P>
<P>
   He's busy raising millions of campaign dollars for Democrats
seeking seats in the House and Senate _ and collecting political
I-O-Us along the way from legislators who will decide the fate of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He's wooing traditional Democratic allies such as labor
activists, women, African Americans and Jews _ political
constituencies that have been the backbone of his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's classic Democratic politics,'' says Larry Sabato, a
political scientist at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville, Va. ``The White House calculates that as long as
the Democrats' basic interest groups stay will Bill Clinton, there
is zero chance of impeachment and conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabato adds: ``The strategy may not be enough to win favorable
treatment in the history books _ but it's enough to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   William Schneider, a political scientist at the American
Enterprise Institute in Washington, says Clinton is trying to avoid
becoming the lightning rod in the political campaigns leading up to
the Nov. 3 mid-term congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wants to motivate the Democratic base without
making the big splashy displays out on the campaign trail that will
stir up the anti-Clinton backlash,'' says Schneider. ``He's got to
get Democrats voted into Congress to help protect him against
impeachment without getting more Republicans elected in the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic gains _ or fewer Democrat losses than expected _ will
be seen ``as a mandate against impeachment,'' Schneider said. On
the other hand, ``Republican gains will be taken as a mandate for
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   After congressional Democrats complained, the White House
squelched a plan by People for the American Way last week to launch
a multimillion dollar nationwide advertising campaign on behalf of
Clinton. The campaign would have accused Republicans of
partisanship for pressing the scandal at the expense of progress on
national issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard to imagine how a national media campaign
would help individual candidates district by district,'' said White
House Press Secretary Mike McCurry. ``The president is most
concerned about helping Democratic candidates who are on the
ballot. Our focus is how can we elect Democrats on Nov. 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has helped to raise almost $45 million for Democrats so
far this year at events in more than a dozen states. He traveled to
Cleveland and Philadelphia on Friday to help raise campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 44 fund-raising events so far this year, 25 have taken
place in private homes beyond the reach of protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has abandoned _ at least for now _ the long
standing practice of scheduling public ``message events'' for the
president to tout his political agenda in cities where he also
holds private fund raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's final road trip before the Nov. 3 mid-term elections
is scheduled to be a West Coast trip that ends Oct. 21, leaving him
at the White House for the final two weeks of the campaign. Aides
said Clinton will probably take part in fund raisers in the
nation's capital during that period.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign money raised by Clinton is being used to benefit
Democrats seeking election or re-election to the House and Senate _
the two institutions that will decide his fate in the months to
come.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote Monday on
whether to seek House authorization for an impeachment inquiry
stemming from allegations of coverup, perjury and obstruction of
justice in the White House sex scandal. The House is expected to
vote Friday on the committee's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   If the committee later completes an impeachment inquiry that
recommends impeachment, the full House then would vote on whether
to impeach. If that occurs, the Senate would conduct the trial of
the president. If convicted by a two-thirds Senate vote, Clinton
would be automatically removed from office.

<P>
   Clinton, who carried 59 percent of union voters in 1996, dodged
a hot union issue last month by opting not to lobbying for ``fast
track'' trade negotiating authority. The AFL-CIO has opposed that
authority because it erases congressional powers to make changes in
trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also has pressed _ so far, without success _ for
congressional action to boost the $5.15 minimum wage to $6.15 by
2000. This is a another key goal of organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has repeatedly spotlighted issues that appeal to women,
hoping to sustain the female support he got in the 1996 when women
voters went for him over GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole, 54
percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The president has equally courted African Americans and
Hispanics. Clinton carried 84 percent of the black vote and 72
percent of the Hispanic vote in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He told the annual dinner of the 38-member Congressional Black
Caucus last month: ``I want to thank you for standing up for me and
understanding the true meaning of repentance and atonement.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif, chairwoman of the black caucus,
hailed Clinton's leadership. ``We support Bill Clinton at this
critical moment in his career,'' Waters said, adding that the
Congressional Black Caucus ``will be the fairness cops'' in the
fight over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   At the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute fund-raising
dinner recently. the president thanked the Hispanic caucus for
``being my friend, for standing with me on sunny days and in strong
winds.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also has taken fresh steps to address the concerns of
many Jewish voters, a politically powerful constituency that cast
78 percent of its vote for Clinton in 1996, according to exit
polls.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the 25th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War in
1973, Clinton invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian Authority leader Yassir Arafat to the White House last
week where he won their agreement to attend an October negotiating
marathon designed to break an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a statement last week marking Yom Kippur, said that
the Hebrew religion's annual Day of Atonement was an opportunity
for ``Americans of all faiths to live our lives according to our
beliefs, to have faith in God's mercy and to have the humility and
strength of spirit to begin again.''

`BELOVED' FROM DEMME  
 NO `DREAMGIRLS' MOVIE  
 SHARON STONE, MOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Jonathan Demme said he should be nervous, even a bit
panicky, about the opening of his new film, ``Beloved.'' But he's
surprisingly calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have zero nervousness,'' said the Academy Award-winning
director of ``Silence of the Lambs.'' ``My life has been `Beloved'
in the last two years, and I sort of feel satiated.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, an adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by
Toni Morrison about the shattering impact of slavery, runs nearly
three hours and opens Oct. 16. For Demme, making the movie was a
deeply personal journey that began after he made his last film,
``Philadelphia,'' in which Tom Hanks won an Academy Award for
playing a lawyer struggling with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Philadelphia' was such an emotionally draining experience,
and I wanted to do a comedy,'' Demme said. As one of only a few
A-list filmmakers, Demme, 54, is besieged with projects and can
more or less pick and choose. But this time the filmmaker found
that even his clout was limited.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Philadelphia,'' he spent about 18 months developing
``The Stopwatch Gang,'' a screenplay by the playwright Beth Henley
about a real group of Canadians who robbed banks in the United
States in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful, hard-to-characterize movie, not exactly a
comedy, not exactly a thriller,'' Demme said of that film. ``And it
proved to be the kind of movie no one wanted to finance. We had
Bono; we had Kate Winslet pre-`Titanic.' We had all the locations.
And the studios wouldn't make it without a giant star.'' He said,
with a bit of a laugh, ``My producers and I were humbled.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, which was two years ago, Demme was sent the
script for ``Beloved'' by Harpo Films, a division of the company
owned by Oprah Winfrey. Ms. Winfrey is also the star of the movie,
and its producer; she bought the rights to the novel and nurtured
the film project for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such top-quality material in every single way,'' Demme
said. ``I found it irresistible. To have a piece with so many
riches; it was a dream you never thought would come true.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Winfrey, Demme said: ``She made it clear from the
very beginning that she didn't want to be thought of as the
producer or the star. She considered herself an actress in the
film. And bringing the part to life would be a full-time job for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The making of it was such a collective high,'' he added. ``We
all felt so privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   Demme said executives at Walt Disney Co., which made the film,
never objected to its unflinching depiction of the characters'
lives. The film is somewhat uncharacteristic for mainstream Disney.
(It helps, of course, to have Ms. Winfrey as producer and star.)
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney Studios chairman Joe Roth recalled Demme's first
meeting with Ms. Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a list of directors, and the first person on the list
was Jonathan Demme,'' he said. ``I said to Oprah, `You never get
the first person on the list, and Demme only works every five years
or so.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A week later Oprah called me and said Jonathan Demme had read
the material and wanted to meet her,'' Roth said. ``I said: `Oprah,
you're not used to this, but you're auditioning for him, he's not
auditioning for you. So don't mess this up.' She laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   No `Dreamgirls'
</P>
<P>
   Joel Schumacher had only two words to say about the sudden
cancellation of ``Dreamgirls,'' the movie version of the 1981
Broadway musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm devastated,'' said Schumacher, the director of ``A Time to
Kill'' and ``Batman.''
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation, or postponement, as studio executives call it,
of the high-profile film is in some ways a case study of the
jittery way Hollywood operates today. A Warner Brothers project to
be produced by David Geffen, it was to cost about $35 million. The
film, based on the show directed and choreographed by Michael
Bennett, was about a singing group similar to the Supremes, who
rose from the Detroit projects to national fame in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   For years, between work on other films, Schumacher had been
shaping ``Dreamgirls'' with a production designer, costume designer
and choreographer. He had discussed roles in the film with Don
Cheadle and Andre Braugher as well as the fast-rising singer Lauryn
Hill, who was to play Deena Jones, the Diana Ross-like lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Warners, a studio that seemed to dominate Hollywood in the
1980s and early '90s, has been in a slump the last two years, with
some expensive mishaps like ``Father's Day'' and ``The Postman.''
This summer, ``The Avengers'' proved disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Known in the past for its lavish spending and deals, Warners has
backed off in recent months from some planned projects, including
an Arnold Schwarzenegger action film and Tim Burton's version of
``Superman'' with Nicolas Cage. (``Superman'' may fly again, but at
a lower price.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as with baseball teams, every studio in town falls on
hard times and eventually recovers.
</P>
<P>
   And Warners is banking on the success of several projects to be
released in the next few months, including Nora Ephron's ``You've
Got Mail,'' with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, and Luis Mandoki's
``Message in a Bottle,'' with Kevin Costner, Paul Newman and Robin
Wright Penn. By the time Warners recovers, another studio will
probably fall into the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   What led to the cancellation of ``Dreamgirls'' was the poor box
office showing this summer of ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love.'' That
film was about the brief meteoric career and tangled romantic life
of singer Frankie Lymon, who died of a drug overdose in 1968 at 25,
at which point three women claimed to be his wife. The movie,
released in late August, has grossed only $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   A Warner Brothers executive called the failure of the film, for
which the studio had high hopes, a ``painful experience.'' The
experience led Warners to take a second look at ``Dreamgirls.''
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the Frankie Lymon film and ``Dreamgirls''
have little in common. Yet both films deal with three black women
in the 1960s. And both are driven by a strong musical score of that
era. It is also common wisdom in Hollywood that films with minority
casts often fail at the box office overseas. All those factors left
the studio frightened about going ahead with the project.
</P>
<P>
   Would any other studio make ``Dreamgirls''? Unlikely. Many
Hollywood studios refuse to give up the rights to projects, even
after deciding not to make them. That is to avoid the embarrassment
of seeing a rival turns a cast-off project into a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers learned its bitter lesson in the late 1980s when
it put a project in ``turnaround,'' and 20th Century Fox picked it
up. It was ``Home Alone,'' one of the biggest moneymakers of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Stone, Mom
</P>
<P>
   More than any other actress today, Sharon Stone is the archetype
of the classic Hollywood star who flourished in the heyday of the
studio system. But Ms. Stone does not hide her dissatisfaction that
today's studios fail to offer the kinds of roles that gave career
longevity to stars as varied as Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn and
Lana Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only play the kinds of parts you're offered, and I'm
usually offered femme fatales,'' Ms. Stone (above) said. ``Frankly,
at my age I should do stunt pay for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old actress is now, quite happily, not playing a
femme fatale in an unusual (for her) role in a new film, ``The
Mighty.'' In the movie, she plays the strong-willed mother of a
smart handicapped boy (Kieran Culkin) who befriends a towering
youth who is slow in school and cannot find his way. Both outcasts,
the boys fearlessly live their own fantasies. The film, released by
Miramax, and directed by Peter Chelsom, will arrive in theaters
Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone initially signed on as producer of the film after she
read the script. Then she asked Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of
Miramax, to cast her in the unglamorous mother role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was blown away by the script: I thought it deserved to be
made, and then I spoke to Harvey about possibly playing the
mother,'' she said. ``I needed to play a normal person. I needed a
break from the lunatic pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone tends to get what she wants. She is also appearing in
``Antz,'' a computer-animated film from Dreamworks that opens
Friday. She plays a somewhat spoiled ant princess in Central Park
who is charmed by a neurotic ant played by Woody Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about the film and I got very brave,'' she said. ``I
started chasing Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg. I started
hounding them. I was obsessed with it. The idea was so funny and
charming. I had to do it!''
</P>
<P>
   How could Spielberg and Katzenberg refuse Sharon Stone?

`A NIGHT OF THE ROXBURY': A LUCKY BREAK FOR THE TERMINALLY UNCOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve and Doug Butabi have been silently bobbing their heads to
the music on NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' for three seasons now.
Week after week, they drive to the trendy clubs, appall the women
they try to dance with and deal with rejection by trying even
harder to look cool. As one unimpressed young woman tells Doug,
``You and your brother are ugly, pathetic losers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Butabi brothers movie, ``A Night at the Roxbury,'' is a lot
like the brothers themselves: undeniably pathetic but strangely
lovable. Still, do you really want to spend an hour and a half with
them in a dark room?
</P>
<P>
   Most people probably never gave much thought to Steve (Will
Ferrell) and Doug's (Chris Kattan) home life. It turns out that
they live in Los Angeles with their parents, a vacuous blonde who
enjoys cosmetic surgery (Loni Anderson) and the gruff owner of a
fake-plant store (Dan Hedaya). The house is expensive but largely
tasteless, and the cultural level is such that when the daughter of
friends is asked to sing, accompanied by the living room piano, she
does the theme song from ``Cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys reluctantly help out in the store, but, like John
Travolta in ``Saturday Night Fever,'' live for the nights. Their
pre-club ritual includes trimming their nose hairs and waxing each
other's backs. Their dream is to own their own super-hip club. Fat
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Or so you'd think _ until one night their luck appears to
change. They have a fender bender with their celebrity idol Richard
Grieco (the erstwhile star of ``21 Jump Street,'' playing himself),
and he gets them into the Roxbury, the chic club of the moment,
just so they won't sue him. Steve and Doug end up at the owner's
table, then at a wild pool party at the owner's mansion, where they
lose their virginity (simultaneously but in separate bedrooms) to
two miniskirted gold diggers who think the guys are important.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Emily, a longtime family friend (Molly Shannon, best
known as the hyperactive schoolgirl Mary Katherine Gallagher on
``Saturday Night Live''), is determined to win Steve's heart. This
drives a wedge between the brothers and culminates in an outdoor
wedding scene with moments reminiscent of ``The Graduate,''
followed by a quick hommage to ``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin Quinn turns up as the club owner's driver, and Dwayne
Hickman as Emily's father. Lochlyn Munro, whose role as a suicidal
fraternity-house alcoholic was one of the few bright spots in
``Dead Man on Campus,'' is memorable as Steve and Doug's gym
trainer, who worries about their triceps.
</P>
<P>
   The director, John Fortenberry, whose background is in
television, has probably done the best that can be done with
characters who were never meant to speak. But it may be tougher now
to see the Butabi brothers' sketches on television and project all
our combined insecurities and disdain onto them. We know too much.
We can't go back.

`EVENING': REVIEWING A FADING LIFE DEFINED BY DOOMED LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   All writers have certain preoccupations that feed their work,
certain techniques that tick beneath the polished face of their
fiction like the secret mechanisms of a clock.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Susan Minot, those themes and narrative
strategies are easily identified: a fascination with the
mathematics of familial and romantic love, and an easy familiarity
with upper-class manners and mores, all rendered economically in
elegant, polished prose. Her characters speak in spare, elliptical
dialogue that verges on the opaque, but their inner lives are
stripped bare in odd, epiphanic moments that reconfigure their
hopes and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In her stunning novel, ``Evening,'' Ms. Minot has taken the same
material and techniques employed in her earlier books and fashioned
a powerful story, a story that cuts back and forth in time to give
us both the defining moment in a woman's life and an understanding
of how that moment has reverberated throughout the remainder of her
days.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most unconventional of Ms. Minot's works, ``Evening''
is more suspenseful than her earlier fiction _ it pivots around one
fateful weekend involving a doomed love affair and a tragic car
accident _ and more daring in form.
</P>
<P>
   Simply told, Ms. Minot's story concerns the life and approaching
death of Ann Grant Lord, the thrice-married mother of four
children, a woman who has learned, at the age of 65, that she is
dying of cancer and has only a few months to live. As she lies in
bed, surrounded by family and friends, Ann lets her mind wander
mazily back across her life, to a long-ago weekend when she was 25
and visiting friends at their island house off the New England
coast.
</P>
<P>
   It was the weekend her best friend, Lila Wittenborn, got
married, the weekend Ann fell in love with another wedding guest
named Harris Arden, a charming cad reminiscent of Walter, the
insincere Don Juan in Ms. Minot's last novel, ``Folly.'' Love, as
it so often is in Ms. Minot's fiction, is arbitrary and contingent
in this novel. ``Why was it this man?'' Ann wonders. ``It could
have been anyone. Two days ago she didn't even know him. Why wasn't
he someone else. Like so many things in life there was no
explaining it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris not only introduces Ann to a Lawrentian passion that will
crack the brittle facade of her self-control, but he also
insinuates himself so forcefully in her memory that she will look
back on her weekend with him as ``the highest point'' of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Such memories would doubtless shock those gathered around Ann's
sickbed. To them, Ann is a careful, correct person, not the sort to
harbor ``any deep dark secrets.'' Her nurse thinks of her as ``one
of the ones who didn't weep.'' Her doctor's wife sees her as ``a
little distant and cold.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Minot gradually makes clear, however, Ann's detachment is
the painful product of the disappointments she has suffered over
the years: not just the crashing realization that she will never
see Harris again, but also the hurt she has sustained in three
unsatisfactory marriages (one to a man who abandoned her, the
second to a violent bully, the third to an older man who left her a
widow) and the grief of losing her 12-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Although such events may sound contrived, even melodramatic in
summary, Ms. Minot seamlessly weaves them into Ann's reminiscences,
making the reader experience them in fragments, as Ann _ often
reeling from pain and dizzy from medication _ reviews her life, the
continuum of her existence turning into a Moebius strip of events,
trivial and momentous, generic and idiosyncratic.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of the different houses Ann shared with her different
husbands _ in Manhattan, in East Hampton, in Connecticut, in
London, in Provence and in Florence _ are juxtaposed with memories
of the one night she spent with Harris on the island, while
memories of daily life _ frying bacon, buying a dress at Bonwit's,
sponging kitchen counters, picking lint off her children's sweaters
_ are juxtaposed with intimations of mortality and the realization
that ``her life had not been long enough for her to know the whole
of herself, it had not been long enough or wide.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Ms. Minot's efforts to capture Ann's state of mind
fall into mannerism _ several passages written in run-together
sentences read like poor imitations of Molly Bloom's soliloquy in
``Ulysses'' _ but her evocation of her heroine's passion for Harris
is so convincing, her depiction of the world she inhabits so
fiercely observed, that such lapses are quickly forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, ``Evening'' is a kind of emotional bookend to
``Monkeys,'' Ms. Minot's first collection of stories, published in
1986. Whereas the interlinked tales in that earlier volume were
told from the perspective of a child about to set forth into the
world, ``Evening'' is related from the point of view of a woman
about to leave it. In ``Monkeys,'' a group of children struggle to
come to terms with the death of their mother and their own emerging
identities; in ``Evening,'' a woman on her deathbed struggles to
come to terms with her family and her memories of who she was.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two books _ the first, a finely tuned
but miniaturist portrait of a family; the second, a complex
portrait of a woman, told in fractured, fragmented takes _ attests
to Ms. Minot's growing ambition and assurance as an artist.

   NEW YORK _ It is 12:30 p.m. on a Wednesday on West 46th Street
in Manhattan. Cars with suburban license plates pull into nearby
garages. Charter buses unload streams of tourists who set out
trolling for pre-theater lunch deals.
</P>
<P>
   And inside the Lunt-Fontanne Theater, the strains of a lone
clarinet float up from the orchestra pit, just one of a very
different set of rituals under way in preparation for the matinee
performance of ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, the gangplank _ emblazoned with ``White Star Line'' in
black on blinding white canvas _ is lowered from where it hangs in
the wings and pinned into place for the opening number. Ginger ale
is poured into the wine bottles and stored on the prop shelf, next
to the boarding passes, binoculars, stateroom towels and telegrams.
</P>
<P>
   Cloth napkins are folded on the long first-class dining table.
And the hydraulic elevator that lifts the lower portion of the
stage to create two levels and tilts to simulate a sinking ship is
tested to make sure that its computerized signals are cued up and
functioning.
</P>
<P>
   So begins a day in the life of a Broadway show. Audiences
generally know a production by its stars, story, music. Rarely do
they get a glimpse behind the scenes, where the set and costume
changes can be as intricately choreographed as the dancing, where
the relationships may be as intense as those the actors portray
onstage, and where the unexpected crises can be even more
suspenseful than the plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic'' offers a particularly compelling example of the
magnitude and the minutiae of this backstage drama. To begin with,
the show is a beast of a production. There are 44 actors: 21 men
and 15 women in the cast, plus 8 understudies who step into a
variety of roles.
</P>
<P>
   The production is technically elaborate, involving everything
from smoking coal bins to a sliding piano to a precarious crow's
nest from which the lookout spots the iceberg. Because there is so
little storage space in the wings, about 40,000 pounds of scenery
and lights are hung in the fly loft and move during the show.
</P>
<P>
   The entire stage is raked at an angle, which makes high heels
something of a challenge and has given several actors and
stagehands chronic backaches. And handling all the technical
elements, including rapid scene and costume changes, requires a
substantial backstage crew that is both quick and calm, strong yet
graceful.
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 carpenters, 7 prop men, 3 sound engineers, 2
electricians, 1 light-board operator, 3 follow-spot operators, 2
men who run the automation computers and 3 flymen who pull the
ropes that move the nonautomated pieces in and out.
</P>
<P>
   Coordinating all of this are four stage managers led by Leigh
Catlett, whose even temper and gentle manner somehow make the whole
operation look effortless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great team of stage managers, and the stagehands are
a great, efficient bunch of people,'' Catlett said. ``So they
actually make my job really easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The upkeep of the show between performances is a formidable
undertaking. It includes the maintenance of 71 wigs, all made of
human hair; every one needs to be reset after each performance,
constantly brushed and occasionally shampooed. To handle all of
this, the show has five hair and wig dressers.
</P>
<P>
   In the wig room on this day, Gary Martori, hair supervisor, and
Chris Calabrese, his assistant, prepare the wigs for the afternoon
performance: ``Grecians'' for the first-class passengers,
``Gibsons'' for second class, single braids for third.
</P>
<P>
   The captain's beard comes in four sections _ chin, two chops and
mustache _ and has to be replaced about every five months; the
mustaches for other men in the cast wear out faster, particularly
because they often have to be ripped off and reapplied at top speed
during quick changes. Each actor has about 20 rapid costume changes
during the show.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 180 costumes, every one of which was custom
made for each actor. More than 275 hours are spent on costume
maintenance a week, including the washing, starching and pressing
of about 300 shirts. Juggling all this are 14 wardrobe people, 1
for every 3 actors.
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 p.m., the show is technically ready to go. The crew has
run through every special effect, checked the lights and the sound.
Backdrops that unfurl from the ground during the production have
been loaded into the floor. The smoking room has been rolled out
and the radio room rolled in. The porthole in the radio room has
been switched to a day sky from a night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Suitcases are lined up neatly underneath the stairwell. A
wardrobe person walks by with an armful of life preservers, copies
of the actual vests worn on the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   The cast arrives for the half-hour call. An actor who is late is
obligated to call and alert one of the stage managers. If a cast
member still has not shown up by the 15-minute mark, a swing, an
actor who substitutes for several roles in the show, steps in.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens today. At 1:30, Christopher Wells, who plays
Jim Farrell, the young Irishman on whom a steerage passenger, Kate
McGowan, sets her sights, calls to say he is running late. By 1:45
p.m., he still has not shown up, and Jonathan Brody, a swing, is
tapped to go on.
</P>
<P>
   Brody has not played the role of Farrell in nine months, yet he
seems surprisingly unperturbed. He hurriedly shaves, gets into his
costume, looks over his lines and goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The swing who shares his dressing room, Romain Fruge, blithely
continues sewing a quilt he brought in to pass the time. He will
not be stepping in for anyone today. After the scene known as
``lifeboats'' toward the end of Act 2, the swings are free to go.

CENSUS FINDS MORE ASIAN-AMERICAN KIDS IN TWO-PARENT FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Asian-American children are more likely to be
raised in families with two parents present than are children in
other racial and ethnic groups, according to a Census Bureau report
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The new Census Bureau statistics also reinforced the connection
between education and wealth. Asian Americans have the highest
median family income of all major census groups _ $49,100 a year _
and they are most likely to have college degrees, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that 84 percent of Asian-American children live
in households in which both parents are present. That compares with
77 percent of non-Hispanic white children, 67.4 percent of Hispanic
children and 32.8 percent of African-American children.
</P>
<P>
   About 42 percent of Asian Americans age 25 and older have at
least a bachelors degree, making them the best educated of any
census group, according to the report. By comparison, 26 percent of
non-Hispanic whites have such degrees, while 14 percent of African
Americans and 10 percent of Hispanic Americans do, according to the
data.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Waters, a Harvard University sociologist, said one reason
for the high income is that single-parent households tend to be
poorer than married couple households. With more Asian-American
families intact, it follows that their median family incomes would
be higher.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Lee, associate professor of sociology at Portland State
University in Portland, Ore., said another reason Asian-American
families have relatively high family income is that there are more
family members employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asian-Pacific households tend to be bigger and they tend to
have more people working,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new statistics show that 38.8 percent of Asian-American
families have two earners and 12 percent have three earners,
compared with 35.6 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, for
non-Hispanic white families.
</P>
<P>
   Waters attributed the high rate of intact families in part to
the traditional family-oriented culture from which many
Asian-American families come.
</P>
<P>
   That culture places a strong emphasis on keeping the family
together even through trying times.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much greater disapproval of divorce and single
parenthood,'' said Lee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the family is viewed as a economic tool. ``There is
great emphasis on the family being the primary basis of support,''
said Lee. ``So if you are a family member, you are supposed to be
contributing and helping the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Klineberg, a sociologist at Rice University in Houston,
said Asian-American immigrants often arrive with higher educational
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume that all immigrants come to America and start at the
bottom and, by virtue of hard work and family values, work their
way up,'' Klineberg said. ``But many Asians came from educational
and economic backgrounds that are far superior to those of the
average American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are scientists, doctors and engineers from some of the
poorest countries in the world, the children of the elite in those
countries, who come over here already with college degrees and
advanced degrees,'' Klineberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have immigrants come from those sorts of
backgrounds in such numbers,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Better educational backgrounds have allowed Asian immigrants to
obtain well-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Andris Skreija, an anthropologist at the University of Nebraska
at Omaha, suspects there is a generational dimension to the high
rate of intact families in the Asian-American community.
</P>
<P>
   The more recent the immigrant, the more likely he or she is to
subscribe to the traditional family-oriented culture, according to
Skreija. As younger generations become more Americanized and as
older generations die off, the younger generations undergo a
transformation: They suffer a higher divorce rate and lower
performance in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would predict that in another 20 years, the number of intact
Asian American families will go down as a result,'' Skreija said.
</P>
<P>
   Waters cautioned against over-generalizations about affluent
Asian Americans, noting that many people who trace their heritage
to Cambodia and Laos have some of the highest poverty rates in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian-American census category includes Americans who trace
their ancestry to China, the Philippines, Japan, Korea, Vietnam,
India, Thailand, Pakistan, Laos, Cambodia and Pacific island
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The new data are based on a March 1997 current population
survey.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Asian Americans number about 10 million, or about 4
percent of the U.S. population.

   Backstage, the first notes of the overture crackle through the
dressing room speakers. Actors waiting in the wings as the opening
number begins watch the conductor on a backstage monitor, so they
can keep tempo during their offstage singing and make their
entrances on cue. &QL;

<P>
   Kevin Stites, the musical director, said the show was one of the
most difficult to conduct, in large part because the music was
practically continuous. Stites, who recently left the show to work
on the forthcoming revival of ``On the Town,'' said he got only a
two-minute break in Act I and a one-minute break in Act II. He said
his favorite part was the opening sequence, when all the passengers
are introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps building,'' Stites said. ``It doesn't let down.''
</P>
<P>
   After the lengthy opening sequence, the men dressed as the
Titanic's crew members start stripping as soon as they hit the
wings to change into their second-class passenger costumes,
replacing their officers' caps with bowlers, pulling pin-stripe
trousers on over their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the scene in the captain's bridge, flown down from
the rafters, begins up above.
</P>
<P>
   On the stage, carpenters attach the boiler room boxes for the
next scene, and one of them fills each box with a puff from a smoke
gun. Farther upstage, behind the scrim and out of sight of the
audience, long tables are lowered from the wings covered with
cloths, dishes and glasses, the salt shakers and silverware
attached by Velcro. ``Titanic'' is under way.
</P>
<P>
   The matinee performance starts smoothly. The backstage crew is
clearly comfortable with the production, having done it for a year
and a half. Everyone seems to know where he should and should not
be. So do the cast members, none of whom are allowed onstage during
scenery shifts. The quick scene and costume changes have to work
like clockwork. And they do.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, after the number ``What a Remarkable Age This
Is!'' and before ``Lady's Maid,'' with only one song in between, 27
men have to change from first-class into third-class passengers.
All in one corridor. All at once. They charge offstage. A blur of
black and white tuxedoes quickly degenerates into a locker room of
underwear, and somehow the actors re-emerge four minutes later as
working-class stiffs in wool trousers, jackets and boots.
</P>
<P>
   Without the hyperconsciousness the stage managers demand, the
set can be life-threatening. Actors often have to exit from high
levels in the dark. When the elevator part of the stage rises to
its full height during the lifeboat scene, there is a 20-foot drop
to the basement. The actors have been instructed to hold onto two
people at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm really tired, I have to rest before the lifeboat
scene,'' said Victoria Clark, who has played Alice Beane, the
second-class passenger who aspires to first-class grandeur, since
the beginning. ``There is no railing up there. I have to say: `Wake
up. Pay attention.' You can never walk though the show. If you're
feeling under, you have to find the energy from somewhere because
it's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's dance captain, Mindy Cooper, said a big part of her
job was teaching new cast members how to fit into this harrowing
backstage puzzle. ``The first day of rehearsal, I say to them,
`Backstage is more choreographed than onstage because this theater
is not big enough for this show,' '' she said. ``I also say, `This
is a set that can kill you, and you can't be in the wrong place at
the wrong time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   During this matinee, Brody does a commendable job as Farrell,
although Jennifer Piech, who plays his love interest, Kate McGowan,
later confides that she often has to nudge such replacements into
position to keep them from colliding with other cast members.
</P>
<P>
   During intermission, Brody practices the part in the second act
when he has to hang out from the wings on a harness to simulate
leaning over a stairway rail as the boat is filling up with water.
</P>
<P>
   The day's next mini-crisis, after Wells missing his call, is a
technical one: Several of the 38 wireless microphones worn by the
actors are picking up interference. The stage managers say the
problem might be the construction site next door, but there is no
time to figure that out now.
</P>
<P>
   Microphones with clear signals are taken away from actors with
less singing and given to actors who have more. The production
typically goes through more than 1,000 AA batteries each week.
</P>
<P>
   The show is not frenetic for everyone all the time. There are
periods, for example, when members of the female chorus lounge
quietly in their dressing room. One studies lines for a different
show. Another plays an electronic game of solitaire. Another does
needlepoint.
</P>
<P>
   The men tend to be a little more raucous. Joseph Kolinski, who
plays the first-class passenger Benjamin Guggenheim, tells his
dirty joke of the day. (It is unprintable.)
</P>
<P>
   Like most theatrical productions, ``Titanic'' has its backstage
rituals, which cast members tend to repeat at every performance.
Rather than tire of these little traditions, the actors seem to
treasure their familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of each act, for example, all the cast members
touch the fake pregnant belly of Christine Long, who plays
Madeleine Astor, for good luck before they go on.
</P>
<P>
   In Act II, actors cluster at the bottom of the stage-right
stairs for what they call ``tea time'': paper cups of water from
the water cooler. One of them brings a cup to the conductor in the
orchestra pit. Stites, the musical director, saved every one of
those cups. By the time he left the show, a tall stack of them
teetered next to his music stand.
</P>
<P>
   At the same point during every performance, Ms. Clark and Hal
Davis, who play Alice and Edgar Beane, sit on the same backstage
staircase talking, and Davis ties Ms. Clark's life vest just before
they enter for the lifeboats scene.
</P>
<P>
   Although the actors kid around backstage _ ``Bye, time to die''
_ onstage they seem to inhabit their characters and say they take
their roles very seriously. For example, to prepare for her part as
Ida Straus, the philanthropist who insists on going down with her
husband, Isidor, Alma Cuervo said she read through Straus' personal
papers and researched the character's Jewish roots.

   At 4:20 p.m., cast members come onstage behind the curtain to
take their places for the lifeboat scene, and the elevator
underneath them begins to rise. But today, the elevator jams. There
is a moment of confusion as the stage crew tries to figure out what
has gone wrong and decides to stop the show.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a voice comes over the loudspeaker to make an
announcement to the audience: Because of technical difficulties,
there will be a slight delay.
</P>
<P>
   The stage managers try to lower the elevator into place, and it
bangs into the stage. The cast is evacuated from elevated side
ramps. The typically calm production stage manager, Catlett, is
suddenly in high gear, darting around backstage, directing various
crew members on his headset.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Cousens, an assistant stage manager, remains up on the
elevator, pacing. At one point, she holds her head in her hands; at
another, she puts her palms together in prayer. It turns out that
the computer that runs the automation had gotten out of sync with
the actual apparatus. The last time something like this happened
was December.
</P>
<P>
   Though the delay lasts only 10 minutes, it feels like forever.
Finally, the problem is corrected, the cast re-enters and the show
resumes.
</P>
<P>
   One would think such incidents would shake most actors, make it
difficult to pick up where they left off. But this group has been
through worse.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that ``Titanic'' had one of the most difficult
gestation periods in Broadway history. With a budget of $10
million, the show was too expensive and technically elaborate to
try out on the road, so the director, Richard Jones, had to make
his mistakes in New York, in front of preview audiences. Sometimes
the show was even booed.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the cast and crew laugh now when they recall those
trying days, when the show was constantly changing, when they went
through countless different endings _ people jumped overboard in
one, the ship split into two parts in another _ when lines were cut
and others added, when they wondered if the production would ever
be finished, much less successful. ``We did a different show every
night,'' said Ms. Cooper, the dance captain.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the bad word of mouth, the tittering about how a
musical about the Titanic was a contradiction in terms. The
technical glitches. And the bad reviews. But then came the Tonys:
five of them, including best musical of 1997. (The show also won
for best book, score, orchestrations and set.)
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly ``Titanic,'' with story and book by Peter Stone and
music and lyrics by Maury Yeston, was a hit. No original cast or
crew member, many of whom are still with the show, will forget that
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We screamed for about 24 hours,'' Ms. Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the musical opened well before James Cameron's film
``Titanic,'' starring Leonardo DiCaprio, the frenzy the movie
created gave the Broadway show another welcome boost.
</P>
<P>
   The depths and heights of the experience, people involved in the
show say, make the cast and crew unusually cohesive. Every person
interviewed marveled at the level of support and generosity that
has pervaded the production from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so clobbered that we felt like we went through the
wars together,'' Moran said. ``The gratifying experience of coming
out the other end and being accepted and being enjoyed and loved,
that was very bonding.''
</P>
<P>
   Snapshots of the children of cast and crew members are taped up
in the wings. One male dressing room features the first resume
pictures of every member of the cast. People do things together
when they are not working.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from having weathered hard times, ``Titanic'' veterans
say, their closeness has to do with the ensemble nature of the show
itself; while there are principal parts, there are no stars. ``The
responsibility for telling the story is really distributed
throughout the company,'' Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   And because the musical strength of the show lies in its choral
singing, Stites said, ``there is no room for any diva attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   As the matinee lets out at about 4:45, a few autograph seekers
hover expectantly at the stage door. The cast and crew disperse for
their dinner break. Some of them rush home to say hello to their
children or simply to grab a bite in the neighborhood. They have to
be back at the theater by 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   The evening show is considerably less eventful. Technicians
worked on the elevator through the break, and this time it behaves.
The microphone problem persists, so some actors are still singing
without amplification. But Wells is back in his role as Jim
Farrell, and the curtain comes down on a smooth performance.
</P>
<P>
   The crew prepares the stage for the next day. The actors take
off their makeup, change back into their street clothes and leave
through the stage door. There are no admiring fans outside this
evening. Just the post-theater traffic on West 46th Street and
audience members trudging back to the parking lots or charter buses
with ``Titanic'' Playbills tucked under their arms, bending their
heads against an early-autumn wind.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway musical ``Titanic'' is performed at the
Lunt-Fontanne Theater, at 205 West 46th Street, on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and
8 p.m., and Sundays at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are $50 to $75; $20 tickets for students and the elderly
are available on the day of the show at the box office.
Information: (212) 307-4100.

   Larry: ``That was a Tuesday. I was sore all over because on
Sunday I ran a road race. What I remember most was how much pain I
was in. As for Kevin, yeah, I told him at the time he made a big
mistake by not going for 60.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Boston Garden. May 22, 1988
</P>
<P>
   Shootout At OK Corral
</P>
<P>
   It was as good a mano a mano duel as the NBA playoffs have ever
seen. Fourth quarter, Game 7, Eastern Conference quarterfinals,
Larry Bird vs. Dominique Wilkins. For three quarters, it was an
even, high-level battle. In the fourth, ``They each put their teams
on their backs and said, `Let's go,''' said Atlanta coach Mike
Fratello. Dominique had 15 of his 47 in the fourth, but Larry
trumped him by shooting 9 for 10 and scoring 20 of his 34 in the 12
minutes as the Celtics won, 118-116. In one phenomenal stretch,
they matched hoops on six consecutive possessions, three for Larry
and three for 'Nique. Larry had the left hand going for three of
the baskets (a banked scoop, a jumper, and a lefty drive) and he
also found a streaking Danny Ainge for a 50-foot lefty touchdown
pass. The Bird summation: ``Hell, this is my building.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry: ``To me, that was a one-quarter game. I really hadn't
played well until that point. I remember stealing the ball a couple
of times and getting some open jumpers to get my rhythm going.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Boston Garden. June 8, 1984
</P>
<P>
   In The Heat Of The Night
</P>
<P>
   There was never, ever a night like it, not in this town, anyway.
Game-time temperature: 97 degrees. Atmosphere: part revival
meeting, part Mardi Gras. In ridiculous, almost inhuman physical
conditions, Larry shot 15 for 20 en route to 34 points and 17
rebounds as the Celtics take a 3-2 series lead over the hated
Lakers. ``It was a 48-minute steam bath,'' snorted Pat Riley. Also
a quintessential Bird performance in which mind triumphed over
matter. Bird set the tone with 8 points and 9 rebounds in period
one. Bird invigorated the crowd with three 3-pointers. Bird had the
Lakers reaching for the superlatives. ``He did let down once,''
joshed LA assistant coach Dave Wohl. ``He didn't run to the bench
during a timeout.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry: ``Everybody complained about the heat, but I felt great
out there. I remember running by the Laker bench and seeing them
sittin' there sucking in oxygen and I felt like I could run
forever. The crowd was really into it that night.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Boston Garden. June 8, 1986
</P>
<P>
   Here, There, And Everywhere
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had been pushed around by the Rockets in Game 5, and
they asked Larry what to expect in Game 6. ``I think everything's
gonna be just fine,'' he declared. Game 6 started and Larry Bird
plugged himself into every aspect of the game. He shot. He
rebounded. He passed. Most of all, he harassed. He was never more
of a total defensive pest than on this particular afternoon. The
final totals of 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 12 assists do not begin
to reflect the scope of his utter ubiquitousness in this game. (He
even won a jump ball from Hakeem Olajuwon.) ``I saw him take on
five guys by himself,'' gushed Houston's Jim Petersen. It was the
ultimate all-around basketball ``How-To.'' Reflected Larry, ``That
was the only game I thought I was totally prepared for.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry: ``I may have come out too pumped up. You know, the Game 5
fight, Bill Fitch, and all that. I was so pumped I even missed two
early free throws. Defensively, that definitely was one of my
better games. By that time we knew their stuff, and they were going
to Hakeem a lot. I was able to anticipate.''
</P>
<P>
   1. Boston Garden. May 5, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Can't Leave Those Guys Out There All By Themselves''
</P>
<P>
   Injury-wracked, he was already deep into the autumn of his
career. He had hit Indiana with a triple-double in Game 1 before
checking into New England Baptist Hospital to go into traction for
his aching back. And now, with 4:23 remaining in the second quarter
of a deciding Game 5, he had stumbled going after a loose ball and
had smacked his head against the hallowed parquet. ``He's coming
back in the second half, and they'll go crazy,'' Indiana coach Bob
Hill warned his team. Right he was. Bird jogged through the runway,
they indeed went crazy, and Bird took over the game, throwing in
jumpers and post-ups while starting three fast breaks with rebounds
and outlets. He finished with 30 points while shooting 12 for 14 on
twos, and for sheer drama it was, and is, untoppable. ``All I know
is that they'll be talking about him for a hundred years,'' sighed
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Larry: ``When I hit the floor, I thought I broke my jaw, because
I couldn't move my mouth. I was in a lot of pain, but I could hear
the crowd out there and I thought, `I can't leave those guys out
there all by themselves.'''
</P>
<P>
   And what about Larry? Which game's memory brings a smile to his
face?
</P>
<P>
   Richfield, Ohio. April 25, 1985
</P>
<P>
   You Talkin' To Me?
</P>
<P>
   A bad elbow kept him in the Holiday Inn while his teammates lost
Game 3 to the Cleveland Cavaliers. That was bad enough. But when
the Cleveland fans and moronic electronic media had the audacity to
cry, ``We want Bird!'' Larry needed no more motivation to suit up
for Game 4. ``They don't know what they're saying,'' he snarled.
``They don't want me. They don't want no part of me. I'm gonna
throw both barrels at 'em.'' It was vintage WWF. It was vintage
Larry Bird. He made sure he came out early for warmups. He waved to
the crowd. He took a lap around the floor. And then he buried the
Cavs with 34 points, 14 rebounds, and 7 assists. Talk about John
Wayne clearing the room ... ``I loved it,'' he said. ``I loved
every minute of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry: ``I remember one of the referees came up to me before the
game and said that if the crowd came out of the stands they would
protect me. Oh, I had the fans riled up, but I knew we'd play well
because I knew the other players would back me up. I was ready to
play that night.''

BIRD AMONG SEVEN TO BE INDUCTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ Yes, there actually are some others who
will join Larry Bird as Hall of Fame inductees Friday night. A
couple even have Celtic ties.
</P>
<P>
   Bird will be one of seven inductees, gaining entrance in his
first year of eligibility. Each inductee must choose a member of
the Hall of Fame to ``present'' him for enshrinement. Bird's
choice: Bill Walton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill has been a good friend,'' Bird said. ``I had so much fun
playing with him because all he cared about was winning. I had
always admired him as a player and it was fun to be around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird's immediate family _ his wife and their two children _ will
be in attendance. But he said he was disappointed that his mother,
who died before Bird was elected, could not be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad, because she couldn't wait until this happened,''
he said. ``She was more excited about this than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird chose former Celtics head coach Bill Fitch to be the second
of his two presenters. Bird has always credited Fitch with helping
him adjust to the NBA and developing his game.
</P>
<P>
   Bird bypassed Celtics majordomo Red Auerbach as a presenter.
Bird wanted a player and a coach, and said this past May that he
rarely communicates with Auerbach anymore. Auerbach will be there
anyway, however. Lenny Wilkens, being inducted for a second time,
has selected Auerbach to present him. Wilkens, already enshrined as
a player, is being honored as a coach. He broke Auerbach's record
for coaching wins two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another Celtic Hall of Famer, guard Sam Jones, will present
University of Texas women's coach Jody Conradt, who is being
honored as the all-time winningest coach in women's college
basketball history. Her 1986 Texas team went 34-0 to win the NCAA
title.
</P>
<P>
   The other inductees are coach Alex Hannum, Marques Haynes, Arnie
Risen, and Alexsandar Nikolic.
</P>
<P>
   Hannum coached two NBA title teams: the 1958 St. Louis Hawks and
the 1967 Philadelphia 76ers. Those are the only teams to defeat a
Bill Russell-led Celtics squad in the postseason. Hannum also
coached the 1969 ABA champion Oakland Oaks. His Hall of Fame
presenter will be Wilt Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes is being honored as the first Harlem Globetrotter and one
of the greatest ballhandlers of all time. In his stint with the
Globetrotters and later with the Harlem Magicians (a team he
founded), Haynes played in more than 12,000 games in 97 countries
while logging more than four million miles.
</P>
<P>
   Risen is the selection of the Veterans Committee. He was a
member of the 1957 Celtics title team and was one of the top
centers of the 1950s, though overshadowed by George Mikan. He also
won a title with Rochester in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolic is the international honoree. He is known as the father
of Yugoslavian basketball and was the first coach to lead
Yugoslavia to a medal in international competition. Among the
players from Yugoslavia who have played in the NBA are the late
Drazen Petrovic, Vlade Divac, Dino Radja, Stojko Vrankovic, and
Toni Kukoc.

BIRD DESTINED FOR THE HALL FROM THE OUTSET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He wasn't Michael, OK?
</P>
<P>
   He did not take off from the foul line and dunk the basketball.
He did not blow by defenders with extraordinary quickness or
perform incomprehensible acrobatics in midair.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael wasn't Larry, either. You've never seen Michael
Jordan throw bounce passes between defenders' legs to a cutting
teammate for a layup. You've never seen Michael Jordan redirect
long rebounds to someone underneath for a dunk, thereby picking up
both a rebound and an assist in the same motion. You've never seen
Michael rack up triple-double after triple-double after
triple-double. And you've never seen Michael Jordan challenge an
entire state and live to tell the tale, the way Larry Bird did in
Ohio back in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing the pecking order of greats and greatests makes being a
sports fan fun. Most of these arguments are irresolvable. But there
are some absolutes, and when a man such as Larry Bird presents
himself to Hall of Fame voters for their perusal, there is no time
wasted on discussion. Larry Bird was a Hall of Fame player from his
first minute in a Celtics uniform, and Friday night, in
Springfield, it will be made official.
</P>
<P>
   Before there was Michael's Time, there was Larry's Time, and
what a time it was. From 1979 through 1987, Larry Bird played on
three championship teams and won three Most Valuable Player awards,
and in the 1987 exhibition season and the first six games of the
1987-88 regular season, he may have been at his all-time artistic
peak. But in the seventh game of that season, he wrenched both
ankles on a play against the Cleveland Cavaliers, and after that he
was never really the same physical being again. If it wasn't his
heels, it was his back. Or his elbow. In one memorable game against
Indiana in 1991, it was his head, Larry having used it as a point
of contact with the famed parquet in pursuit of a loose ball. It
was always something, and as disappointing as it was for the team
and the fans, imagine how frustrating it must have been for Larry
Bird himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was feeling good,'' he says, ``the game was easy. But
when injuries caught up with me, it was another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry was feeling just fine in the months of February, March,
April, May, and June of 1986. He was the focal point of the very
best of all Celtics teams. The back and elbow problems of the early
season were forgotten. In February, he went on a West Coast
rampage. In March, he put on the greatest 3-point shooting
exhibition ever seen, sinking 25 of 34 attempts in one stretch, and
this was from the original 3-point line, which was more challenging
than the one we have today. And in April, May, and June, there was
one great playoff performance after another, culminating in a
phenomenal demonstration of all-around basketball prowess in the
sixth and concluding game of the Finals against the Houston
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   He and his basketball soulmate, Magic Johnson, were the twin
terrors of the NBA. They were the standards of excellence, and no
one was more respectful of the pecking order than a young talent in
Chicago by the name of Michael Jordan. When Jordan threw in those
63 scintillating points in a losing double-overtime effort against
the Celtics in the second game of the 1986 playoffs, Bird declared,
``I think he's God disguised as Michael Jordan. He is the most
awesome player in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the many tributes strewn his way on that Sunday afternoon,
the young Michael Jordan was most taken by those words from Larry
Bird. As reported in the current issue of Vanity Fair magazine, in
which there is an excerpt from the forthcoming book ``For The Love
Of The Game,'' Jordan was absolutely dazzled to hear those words
coming from Bird's lips. (itals)I remember reading what Larry said
about the game. I really couldn't believe he would say something
like that. Here was a guy who had been in the league seven years
and who was in a class I was trying to enter ... Larry Bird's
comments gave me credibility.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   In this sound bite world we live in, memories are short. The
latest is all-too-often assumed to be the greatest. But, as Duke
Ellington would say, it ain't necessarily so. If you wanted to see
just exactly how basketball could, and perhaps even should, be
played, all you had to do was watch Bird in his physical prime.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal,'' he said on the occasion of his retirement, ``was
control. By control I mean a little bit of everything. Start at the
defensive end. Rebound. Dribble the ball up. Hit a three. Get back
on defense and help double-team somebody to make him throw the ball
away. Come back to the offensive end and make a great pass. Rebound
again. Throw a baseball pass for a score. Just do one thing after
the other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is the greatest talent ever to play the game; no
question,'' admits Magic Johnson. ``Michael has more ability than
Larry and me put together. We played a different type of game. We
could not dominate a game the way Michael can, but he can't
dominate a game the way we could, either. If we all tried to
reverse roles, it wouldn't work. No one can score at will the way
Michael can. Larry and I dominated games with triple-doubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry liked to score. Who, aside from Dennis Rodman, doesn't?
But the really great Bird games encompassed more than the mere act
of putting the basketball in the hoop. Passing was always his great
pleasure. As far back as high school, when his passes as a junior
helped make teammate Danny King into an all-state player, Larry
Bird recognized the therapeutic value of passing to a team.
</P>
<P>
   Passing, Bird understood, was contagious. What Bird did in
taking an otherwise mediocre Indiana State team to the 1979 NCAA
title game was nothing less than the greatest individual
achievement in the history of college basketball, and that team's
calling card was the pass. Players who, if left to their own
devices, would never even have thought about making an extra pass
made extra pass after extra pass for an entire season because they
had been inspired to do so by The Man himself. It was no different
at the next level. As long as Bird was in uniform, the Boston
Celtics were, by definition, a team of great passers.
</P>
<P>
   Bird was capable of doing something clearly beyond the reach of
the great Michael Jordan: On many occasions he dominated basketball
games at the offensive end without ever taking a shot. He could do
this because in addition to being the greatest passing forward
ever, he was a consummate individual offensive threat. The
possibility that he might shoot was sufficient to create passing
angles and lanes for him to exploit. Is there any wonder,
therefore, that he and Robert Parish were the best pick-and-roll
duo ever to play? No defender could ever outthink Larry, so no
matter what the man wearing the other uniform did, Bird was able to
figure out something to do _ and then go out and do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry understood that passing is all about timing and
angles,'' Magic explains. ``First of all, Larry anticipated better
than anybody. He knew when DJ was going back door. He knew just
when Kevin was ready to receive his entry pass. He knew when Robert
was going to take off. Most guys hit people when they're already
open. Larry had such a great feel for the game. He knew when a
teammate was about to get open.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird simply had no peer as a passing forward. He compiled 140
career double-figure assist games. But 140 is a number, and no
number can explain the truly great athlete. The how is always far
more interesting than the what. Bird really and truly did things we
have never seen before or since. Some of them took place in venues
such as Marshfield High School on a hot August night during rookie
camp, or Hellenic College during any one of a hundred selected
scrimmages with naught but a writer or two in attendance. His
teammates saw things the rest of you will never, ever see again.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious to everyone that Larry was a magician with the
basketball in his hands, but the prevailing folklore holds that he
was a liability when the other team had the ball. Not so. He was no
one-on-one stopper, but in the NBA team defensive scheme he was a
killer. On at least one occasion the illegal defense rule was
rewritten to curb Larry's roaming (call it the original Larry Bird
exception).
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael, Scottie, DJ, they were great individual defenders,''
says Magic. ``But there was no one better than Larry on team
defense. To win championships, you need a great team defense, and
Larry was the greatest team defensive player ever.''
</P>
<P>
   He shot, he passed, he rebounded, and he defended, but it never
stopped there. He was a leader in every way. As much as any player
in history, he understood what it took to win games and
championships in the world's greatest basketball league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Bird taught Michael how to win,'' lauds Magic. ``He
taught him that just scoring 50 points wasn't going to beat the
Boston Celtics. He taught Michael how to include the other players
in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird was never just a technically brilliant player, and that
really was the fun of it all. Even if a future player somehow
approximated the physical package, there is not going to be a Larry
Bird II. Period. He's not going to have the peculiar Indiana and
peculiar personal background. He's not going to have the wit. He's
not going to have the sheer physical toughness. He's not going to
have the basketball prescience and foresight. He won't have the
capability and inexplicable inspiration to take, and make,
lefthanded shots when he really didn't have to (check out the
fourth quarters of both Detroit Game 7 in '87 and Atlanta Game 7 in
'88). And he is surely not going to have the connection with the
fans that made Larry Bird a one-of-a-kind basketball icon in this
city.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. We had our chance. If we didn't fully appreciate what we
had when we had Bird in our midst, the joke's on us. There was only
going to be that one chance.
</P>
<P>
   And now the time has come to confirm the completely obvious.
Does Larry Bird belong in the Basketball Hall of Fame? Well, duh.
Could Sinatra sing? Could Basie swing? When are we going to get to
the hard questions? Bird going into the Basketball Hall of Fame is
a Given's given, even if the man himself doesn't exactly know what
to make of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I ever wanted to do was be the best player on my high
school team,'' he says. ``I've never really thought much about
going into the Hall of Fame. My feelings are the same as I had when
they had the night for me five years ago. I really don't know how
it will hit me until I get up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can tell you is that the NBA life was the greatest
thing in the world. I smelled the roses all along, and people
didn't know I was doing it. I remember all the feelings I had
before big games, right back to high school. I loved it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Basketball loves him right back, as he will find out Friday
night.

FAMOUS AS A CELTIC, CHERISHED AS A DOWN-HOME BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Undeniably, he is now theirs. He may have made
his fame and fortune as a Celtic, but the Indiana Pacers now can
legitimately claim favorite son Larry Bird as their own.
</P>
<P>
   In one short year as the head coach and unmistakable public
persona for the Pacers, Bird may have pulled off the unthinkable.
He may well have supplanted high school basketball and Indiana
University basketball and made the Pacers the epicenter of Hoosier
hoops. This is a state that takes its basketball seriously and Bird
was the serious-man's player. He had the flawless fundamentals, the
proper respect for the Coach, the hoop heritage that can only be
developed in Indiana. It's a match made in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``There absolutely is nobody better that you could have brought
into the state of Indiana to associate with this franchise than
Larry Bird,'' says Indiana president Donnie Walsh. ``We couldn't
have hired anyone better with the impact that Larry Bird has in the
state of Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day, Walsh reports to his office at Market Square Arena
and pinches himself to ensure that, yes, it is still thus. He is
one of many people in all parts of the United States who cannot
understand why the Celtics let Bird slip away. He provided Bird
with money, job flexibility, more money, and the rest, as they say,
is history.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night Bird will be enshrined in the Basketball Hall of
Fame for the deeds he accomplished as a Celtic. The entourage from
Boston, said to be more than 40, will dwarf that of the four-man
Pacer contingent. But while he will enter the Hall as a Celtic, he
will leave it as a Pacer, returning to Indiana (on a charter, of
course) to resume his duties as head basketball coach and
credibility shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Bird likes it in Indiana. The people leave him alone. He can
wash his car every day (which he does, weather permitting) and mow
his lawn every day (which he does, at least when the grass
threatens to grow), and no one gawks or whips out a poster to sign.
He can dine in peace if he chooses to eat out, with even more
tranquility and comfort if he's not picking up the check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never spent much time here,'' he said of Indianapolis.
``I'd come up with some buddies in the summer and play golf, but
that was about it. I had no idea how great a place it is. I really
enjoy it and my kids love it.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is mutual. The Pacers are his Pacers in much the
same way the Celtics are Rick Pitino's Celtics. Very few coaches
(Pat Riley would be another example) cast such a large and luminous
presence that make them bigger than the players they coach. In one
season, Bird did that and more.
</P>
<P>
   The more the season progressed, the more the Pacers realized
just what they had. Bird had always been an Indiana icon, ever
since the days when Logotee was the big game. What better person to
have on the front lines for the next millenium and the move into
what may be the best new arena in the NBA?
</P>
<P>
   The building will be called, simply, The Fieldhouse. It is now
sprouting from a downtown hole in the ground and it will have the
retro look and feel of Indiana basketball, complete with old-style
billboards, slat-back chairs, pull-out bleachers, and exposed steel
trusses that will create, deliberately, a few obstructed view
seats. It's a building with Indiana basketball in mind, the way
Indianans think of the sport, the way Bird thinks of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different here,'' Walsh says. ``It's what makes it
special here. People here grow up with organized basketball. Not
the schoolyard stuff. And Larry is a product of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The building will open in the fall of 1999. All the suites are
spoken for and the club seats will be sold out as well. ``It's
going to be unbelievable,'' Bird says. ``It's a building for
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Pacers bring in potential sponsors to watch a
seven-minute sales pitch film on the building, they can look around
the room to see exposed brick, a black-and-white photograph of a
game in the old Madison Square Garden, and a picture of Bird. It's
not there by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this going before he got here,'' says Pacers general
manager David Kahn. ``But with him here, everything is so much
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is reluctant to tap into Bird-as-pitchman. He hired him
strictly as coach, he says, although his nose looks a little longer
everytime he insists, unconvincingly, that he didn't have something
more in mind. Bird may hawk hamburgers and fries with his voice,
but his presence is all that's required for the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   In the promotional video, Walsh notes the bond between
basketball and Indiana and how everything will be just so in the
new building. ``The addition of Larry Bird will help, too,'' he
says matter-of-factly. In the package of information geared to
sponsors, only one individual associated with the Pacers has a page
all to himself. You guessed it. The page is headlined ``Larry
Legend'' and has two pictures of Bird, one as the coach of the
Pacers and the other as a player at Indiana State.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the sidelines, Bird's work ethic will have a decided
effect on his team, creating a game that will thrive in the
Fieldhouse,'' reads one sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Bird, as you might expect, is acutely aware of how the selling
game goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is,'' he explains, ``they brought me in here, but
they didn't use me. I know with me being here, it's a lot easier. I
understand that. And I can listen to Donnie talk all day about me
not being involved, but I am to an extent and I knew that going in.
I knew that was part of the package. These people have watched me
my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   They are watching him in his second career now. He agreed to
coach for three years, but the deal is open-ended. At some point,
he'll move into Walsh's chair (probably when he senses a downturn)
and anoint his successor (Rick Carlisle?). One of the key
ingredients in his decision to move was a piece of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to it, Celtics fans, Larry Bird is here to stay.
Indiana lost him once and won't let it happen again.

<P>
   LONDON _ The year's first snow soon will fall on Kosovo. Then
there will be no debate about the enemy: It will be starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months of fierce civil war have forced more than 250,000
civilians, mostly women and children, to flee their homes with what
they could carry on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer and early autumn, Serbian police and Yugoslavian
military forces engaged in a village-to-village struggle against
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a guerrilla force seeking
independence for the province of 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   In its attack on the KLA, the heavily armed government forces
have been accused of burning farms and leveling towns suspected of
being sympathetic to the rebels. In some cases, civilians have been
jailed or summarily executed, diplomats and other officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the bodies of 18 women, children and elderly members
of one family were discovered near the town of Gornji Obrinje with
bullet wounds in their heads. Some had their throats cut, and
others were mutilated with their noses and ears slashed off, said
witnesses who viewed the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Horrified villagers said the attacks were carried out by masked
men wearing Serbian military uniforms. Within a few hours,
residents of the village of Golubova five miles to the south
reported that Serb forces surrounded a pocket of refugees and
killed 13 men. There has been no independent corroboration of these
attacks, and Yugoslavian officials denied their forces were
involved if they did occur.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the images of the bodies and shocked relatives pointing
mournfully at the familiar shoes and clothing of their loved ones
dominated television screens Wednesday ind Thursday, prompting a
fresh wave of revulsion. ``This was not an act of war,'' British
Foreign Minister Robin Cook said of the killings. ``It was plain
cold murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Such discoveries, which have been all too frequent in recent
months, fueled the already pronounced fears of ethnic Albanians,
who comprise as much as 90 percent of the population of Kosovo.
They worry that the Serbs, who for centuries have viewed Kosovo as
their spiritual homeland, may be moving to repeat the ``ethnic
cleansing'' campaigns of Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 100,000 have sought shelter in the mountains and
forests of Kosovo and neighboring Albania, their homes destroyed in
the fighting. Many are believed to be stranded out in the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Even as relief organizations prepare for their winter offensive,
the scale of the task of feeding and caring for so many vulnerable
people in such severe conditions makes it all but inevitable that
some, perhaps many, will die.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Paddy Ashdown, the leader of the British Liberal
Democratic Party, returned from a tour of Kosovo and expressed
alarm at what he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   Outside one village, he said encountered 700 refugees seeking
shelter in the forest. ``They were so frightened, they would not
come out,'' Ashdown said. ``They wouldn't show themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're living off berries and what they could gather from the
woods. They said to me, 'We will die where we lie,' and they lie in
the most miserable conditions in the deep woods of Kosovo because
they're not prepared to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim here.)
</P>
<P>
   The themes of the struggle for Kosovo are as old as
civilization. The province, though now populated by mostly Muslim
ethnic Albanians, once was the heart of the medieval Orthodox
Serbian empire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1395, the Serbs lost a pivotal battle in Kosovo to the
Ottoman Turks, leading to the collapse of the Serb Empire.
Ironically, the defeat elevated Kosovo in the eyes of Serbs to the
status of a holy land. Their ancient monasteries and cathedrals dot
the countryside today.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yugoslavia of Marshal Tito began to come apart after
the dictator's death in 1980, Serbs led by Slobodan Milosevic, now
the Yugoslavian president, began to dream out loud of a Greater
Serbian homeland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Kosovo, then an autonomous region of Yugoslavia, was
the site of important moments in Milosevic's political ascendancy.
In a dispute between the Serbs and ethnic Albanians, Milosevic shed
the ostensible neutrality of a government official to side with the
Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered the power of Serbian nationalism and has rode its
wave to power. In 1989, he brought Kosovo and the autonomous region
of Vojvodonia under direct Serb authority.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Milosevic has exercised strict, and arguably
repressive authority over the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim here.)
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the republics of Croatia and Slovenia
declared their independence from Yugoslavia. In Croatia, ethnic
Serbs supported by Serbia entered into a civil war involving
Croatian forces. Serbia also provided arms to ethnic Serb fighters
in Bosnia. More than 200,000 people werd killed in years of
fighting in both countries. Serb forces captured huge amounts of
territory in Bosnia and Croatia and began ``ethnic cleansing,'' the
term for the process displacing non-Serbs to make room for new
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   After Serbian aggressions won world condemnation, the United
Nations in 1992 imposed sanctions on Yugoslavia to end the
bloodshed. In 1995, the Dayton peace accord brought an end to the
conflict and was signed by leaders of Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all Kosovo, where dissident ethnic Albanians were
lead by a pacifist leader opposed to full independence, remained
attached to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts were surprised when Kosovo didn't opt out of its
union with Serbia seven years ago. ``We all thought it was going to
explode then because the conditions were right,'' said Michael
Clarke, the executive director of the Centre for Defense Studies at
King's College, London. ``It has been a tinder box for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion was finally touched off in February when KLA
forces ambushed and killed four Serbian policemen. This provoked a
Serbian retaliation, which led to a KLA counter-offensive and a
continued escalation of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA proved surprisingly successful, and at one point during
the summer claimed control over 40 percent of Kosovo. The
Yugoslavian government denies the rebels captured so much of the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats began to fear the upstart KLA was contributing
to regional instability by its very success while provoking harsher
reprisals from the Serbs. Most unsettling, they could find almost
no identifiable chain of command within the group and consequently
no one with which to negotiate. ``The group has a very shadowy
leadership, that not even very many ethnic Albanians know much
about,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Rugova, the respected leader of the Kosovar Albanians,
has little influence with the guerrillas. A pacifist who supports
Kosovo's return to more autonomy but remaining part of Yugoslavia,
Rugova advocates passive resistance to Serbian authority.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Western officials have been unable to forge a
political solution because they could not offer to use their
influence to restrain the KLA. Without such a concession, the Serbs
were being asked to implement a unilateral cease-fire, which they
refused to do.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated that they could not get a handle on events in Kosovo,
Western diplomats began increasing their support for threatened
military action to force the Serbs to end their attacks on the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials depict the KLA as terrorists seeking to foment
rebellion. Therefore, an official at the Yugoslavian embassy in
London argued, the country has been well within its sovereign
rights to use whatever force it needed to suppress such an
uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavians draw parallels between the KLA and Irish Republic
Army (IRA), the armed group that campaigned for years to end
British rule over Northern Ireland. Just as Britain has the right
to send soldiers into Belfast to confront rebels, Yugoslavia has
the right to stop the KLA, their argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   That argument underscores a fundamental problem for the West in
dealing with Kosovo. The conflict is taking place within
Yugoslavia's national borders and the legal arguments justifying
force are thornier than when a nation attacks another -- as when
Iraq attacked Kuwait sparking the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   It is also perilous for Western powers to pick sides in what
amounts to an internal rebellion, said Spyros Economides, a foreign
affairs expert at the London School of Economics. ``They're faced
with this major dilemma of not being able to support any kind of
independence group in Kosovo because they will never be able to
support changing borders by the use of force,'' he said. ``That's
something that is completely against the grain of what is happening
in terms of international relations today.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as complex as the problem is, Economides and other
political experts fault Western powers -- particularly the United
States -- for failing to come to terms with the situation in a
timely fashion, allowing months of misery and instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``One the one hand it is a completely complex problem,'' he
said. ``I don't think it's a lack of will that has prevented a
solution. It's an inability to deal with it, the inability to find
the right tool to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest concern is that the conflict could spill
over into neighboring Albania, already near anarchy, and Macedonia,
where the frail government probably wouldn't survive.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bob Dole, who visited Kosovo early last month,
reminded U.S. officials of this concern after his return. ``As
terrible as the war in Bosnia proved to be, the war that both the
Bush and Clinton administrations feared most was in Kosovo -- where
it seemed inevitable that conflict would spread easily into
neighboring countries, thus destabilizing the entire region,'' Dole
said in a speech to the International Republican Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Dole said his visit convinced him that the Serbs were brutally
attacking civilians in Kosovo. ``Based on what I saw, there should
be no doubt that Serbia is engaged in major, systematic attacks on
the people and territory of Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned that the fighting could spread if action by the
West isn't taken soon to stop Serbian attacks and find a solution
to the complex crisis. ``In the blink of an eye, violence could
spread into Macedonia and tear that fragile democracy in two,''
Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before winter, conditions for refugees were severe, aid
workers say. Diarrhea caused by contaminated drinking water and
resulting the dehydration is already causing deaths, especially of
children. In addition, health workers worried that conditions were
ripe for epidemics of respiratory illnesses and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit. Dole reported seeing similar problems. ``The
children in particular are already showing signs of a vitamin
deficient diet, they have sores on their mouths and most have
scabies or other skin ailments resulting from a lack of sufficient
hygiene,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 U.S. and European aid groups are distributing food,
medicine and other necessities to refugees. Each week, about 500
tons of food are distributed. That amount is expected to increase
eight-fold by the end of the month. Washington has approved $22
million in food aid, and the United Nations World Food Program has
issued an appeal for governments to provide an additional $16
million for food.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian officials say the extent of the need is being
exaggerated but nevertheless have pledged not to interfere with the
distribution of food.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Serbs said the uprising had been crushed and they
began withdrawing their tanks and armored personnel carriers for
the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe the pause will allow the KLA to regroup and
prepare for a spring offensive buoyed by increased support from the
West. Yet, unless something in the political mix is altered, the
cycle of violence almost certainly would reignite.
</P>
<P>
   While the West, moved by the fresh scenes of bloodshed, seems
ready to act now to end the violence, concerns remain about whether
the action will be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to ask ourselves why we have got to the stage that
at the beginning of October 1998 we're now starting to consider the
refugees in Kosovo when this thing started blowing up in our faces
six months ago,'' Economides said. ``Have we really learned the
lessons of Bosnia?''

BIRD'S TOP 10 GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What you or I might consider to have been a Larry Bird
masterpiece game might not have occurred to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always think in terms of points,'' he says, ``but I
think some of my best games were ones in which I did things other
than just score points.''
</P>
<P>
   No question. Larry Bird, like his on-court soulmate Magic
Johnson and unlike Michael Jordan, had long periods of games in
which he was destroying the opposition without even thinking about
taking a shot. He could dominate games by lurking menacingly on
defense. He could dominate games by rebounding. And he could surely
dominate games by passing.
</P>
<P>
   But in the very best of the best Larry Bird games, scoring was a
major factor. Any short list of Bird games will feature almost
unimaginable bursts of offense.
</P>
<P>
   Fully recognizing that a more appropriate tribute would be the
Top 100 Larry Bird games, here are 10 everyone will agree ranked
among his most memorable.
</P>
<P>
   10. Salt Lake City. Feb. 18, 1985
</P>
<P>
   ``I Already Did Enough Damage''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the fourth period, K.C. Jones came to Larry with some
news. He had just been informed that Larry had 30 points, 12
rebounds, 10 assists, and 9 steals in three quarters. Would he like
to go back in to get that 10th steal and thus be able to tell the
grandchildren about his quadruple-double? ``Nope,'' he said. ``I
already did enough damage. Why go for it when we're up by 30?''
Larry abused the Jazz for 12 points, 9 rebounds, 5 assists, and 4
steals in the first period alone as the Celtics jumped to a 34-10
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Larry: ``I remember saying it was no big deal about the
quadruple-double. I said I could get one any time if I wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the 10 steals?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was before they changed the rules. Lots of times I had
five or six.''
</P>
<P>
   9. Portland. Feb. 14, 1986
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ambidexterity
</P>
<P>
   As if 47 points, 14 rebounds, 11 assists, and the game-winning
basket with three seconds left in overtime weren't enough, Larry
spiced this one by making seven lefthanded shots. Memorial Coliseum
was always one of his favorite arenas, but this was his Northwest
Picasso. So what was the deal with all the southpaw baskets? ``I'm
savin' my right hand for the Lakers,'' he said, alluding to the
Celtics' next opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Larry: ``I told 'em I was workin' on that lefthand shot all
summer to go at Michael Cooper, and I was just tryin' it out.''
</P>
<P>
   8. Milwaukee. May 17-18, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, a doubleheader. Games 3 and 4 of this playoff series with
Milwaukee showcased the entire Bird package in one 24-hour spurt.
On Saturday, he had seven assists in the first quarter en route to
a 19-16-13 triple-double that included a phenomenal dive into a
pile and sitting-on-the-floor feed to Kevin McHale for a dunk. ``He
gave me at least five baskets where I didn't have to do a thing,''
marveled McHale. ``All I had to do was stand there.'' On Sunday, he
blew the Bucks away with four straight fourth-quarter 3-pointers to
seal the series sweep. ``I hope,'' said Milwaukee coach Don Nelson,
``the other Celtics realize what a privilege it is to play with
Larry Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry: ``K.C. said if we swept we'd have three days off, and
that's all I needed to hear. When the game was over, I drove
straight to French Lick and I was fishing all day Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   7. Los Angeles. Feb. 11, 1981
</P>
<P>
   He Also Cleaned The John And Parked Some Cars
</P>
<P>
   36 points. 21 rebounds. 5 assists. 5 steals. 5 blocks. One
stretch of 15-for-17 shooting. Was there anything else? As a matter
of fact, yes. Larry also stopped a couple of 3-on-1 fast breaks.
With Magic Johnson (injured knee) watching from the LA bench, Larry
put on a majestic basketball clinic at the Forum in what was
supposed to be a hopeless game since the Celtics had lost an OT
affair in Seattle the night before and hadn't arrived in LA until
five hours before game time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was going do it,'' said Magic. ``He said,
`Sorry, you're hurt. I want you to sit back and watch. I'm going to
put on a show for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Larry: ``No question that was a great game for me. I remember
having rebounding rhythm and being just generally very active.
Didn't I have five steals? I was all over the place that night.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Boston Garden. May 13, 1984
</P>
<P>
   ``His Performance Was Without Description''
</P>
<P>
   It was Game 7 of a heated, emotional series with the Hubie
Brown/Bernard King Knicks, and Larry was ready. Wrote Dan
Shaughnessy, ``Call it a quadruple-double: 43 points, 12 rebounds,
10 assists, and a dozen standing ovations.'' Larry hit a 16-foot
baseline fallaway some 14 seconds into the game, and that was the
signal he was in complete control. Seven minutes later he got
successive conventional 3-point plays on a) a lefty banker high off
the glass, and b) a 21-foot swisher. ``I knew I had it then,'' he
said. ``I just wanted to keep going.'' Hubie wished he had kept
going out to North Station. ``His performance was without
description,'' rhapsodized the Knicks' mentor.

</P>
<P>
   5. New Orleans. March 12, 1985

<P>
   They Fell Off The Atlanta Bench
</P>
<P>
   Background: On March 3 McHale set a Celtics scoring record with
56 points. ``He should have gone for 60,'' Larry said. Five games
and nine days later, Larry torched the Atlanta Hawks for 60, not
including a 3-pointer that was waved off. How hot was he? Larry had
one blitzkrieg of 32 points in 14 minutes. How outrageous were some
of the shots? On one, a couple of astonished subs fell off the
Atlanta bench. He had continually fed McHale en route to his 56,
and Kevin twice reciprocated, first by fouling Doc Rivers to stop
the clock with 27 seconds left and Larry stuck on 56, and then by
grabbing an offensive rebound and firing it back to Bird for a
buzzer-beating foul-line jumper. ``When I'm shooting like that,''
Larry shrugged, ``no one can stop me.''

 &HT;    OFFICIAL STORY OF KING ASSASSINATION 'DIDN'T ADD UP,' SON SAYS
 &HT;    Cox photos to illustrate this story have been placed in the
National folder on the Cox server.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``It just didn't add up,'' said Dexter Scott King,
explaining why he has rejected the official conclusion that his
father, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., was assassinated by James Earl
Ray, a racist gunman acting alone.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a forum Thursday on the Justice Department's recent
decision to reopen the investigation of the 1968 killing in
Memphis, the son of the slain civil rights leader said no specific
piece of evidence convinced him and his family that ``there was
something more to this than the official version.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a prison visit persuaded him that the ``trigger man''
was not Ray, a career criminal who confessed to the killing shortly
after his capture but then spent three decades claiming innocence
right up until his death this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's ``plea bargain'' to avoid the electric chair is
``different from a confession,'' King explained.
</P>
<P>
   King said his family ``felt a moral obligation to press on''
with the investigation even after 30 years. There is no statute of
limitations on murder, he said, or on the emotional loss of a
family.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the notion that there is some benefit for his
family in advancing the conspiracy theories that have sprung up
around the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in this for anything other than the truth,'' said
King.
</P>
<P>
   King said he accepts the promise of Attorney General Janet Reno
to follow the evidence where ever it leads in the renewed
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Others on the panel expressed considerably less trust in the
government. Indeed, in a free-wheeling two-hour discussion, vague
connections were drawn between Ray and not only the CIA, the Mafia,
and the FBI, but also Jack Ruby, the Dallas nightclub owner who
killed Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of President John F.
Kennedy, and a mysterious agent named Raoul.
</P>
<P>
   Ray was a ``patsy'' who knew little about the powerful forces at
play with and around him, explained William P. Pepper, his attorney
and author of ``Orders to Kill,'' a book detailing this alleged
conspiracy to assassinate King. Pepper maintains there was even a
backup team of U.S. Army snipers in Memphis in case a hidden,
never-identified shooter missed King on a motel balcony.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first suspicions were that there was more to this than met
the eye,'' echoed the Rev. Walter Fauntroy, the former
congressional delegate from the District of Columbia who headed the
House assassination subcommittee that concluded in the 1970s that
Ray was the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Fauntroy said he had questioned Ray and came away convinced that
this ``small-time, ineffectual criminal'' was not smart enough to
have pulled off the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing skepticism from the other side was George Curry,
editor in chief of Emerge: Black America's Newsmagazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like the ant at this picnic,'' he said, pointing to a
confession, fingerprints and other evidence tying Ray to the murder
scene and the likely murder weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that Ray may not have acted alone, Curry he is
dismayed by ``this orchestrated effort to absolve'' the admitted
assassin. ``There is an abundance of evidence to show he was a
racist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are enough lingering questions to justify a renewed
probe, there is not yet enough to establish the veracity of a
conspiracy, agreed Todd Lindberg, editorial page editor of the
Washington Times. Sometimes ``coincidence and incompetence'' can
``look like a conspiracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion was moderated by Kojo Nnamdi(cq), host of Public
Interest, a National Public Radio program.

 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's not true that nasty partisan exchanges over
presidential philandering and the impeachment process evoke the
only political outrage in the Washington, D.C., area these days.
</P>
<P>
   Public anger in a Maryland suburb less than 10 miles from the
White House recently exploded over something more important that
really arouses Americans' emotions: their pets.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs are famous for having their day, but not this time. We are
talking cats here.
</P>
<P>
   Not Socks, either. Ordinary cats owned by ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular pet in the country is the cat. According to a
Simmons Market Research Bureau poll last year, Americans owned a
record 68 million purring felines. Take that, bow-wows. There are
only 56 million of you.
</P>
<P>
   A Montgomery County, Md., official of little acquaintance with
cats or their doting caregivers recently pulled a classic boner
that reverberated through the region. He rashly proposed a law to
control the beasts by restricting them to their owners' property
unless they are on a leash, controlled by voice command or
otherwise restrained.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for this absurd notion is that cats spread disease
and are a menace to other small creatures, preying on birds, mice
and insects. This got into the political dialogue because it is
being pushed by the American Bird Conservancy, which has mounted a
``Cats Indoor'' campaign. The organization objects to the cat
position in the food chain, somewhere below dogs but above birds.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC is not similarly upset that some birds also eat other
smaller creatures, such as fish, mice and insects. Perhaps it
should also mount a ``Birds Indoor'' campaign to preserve fish
life.
</P>
<P>
   As for the leash question, the White House puts Socks on a long
leash, but that's a special case, and the circumstances of his
existence are as strange as that of his owners. The rest of the
world couldn't get a cat to walk on a tether if a million dollars
rode on the achievement.
</P>
<P>
   And voice control _ here, kitty, kitty _ is an impossible dream.
Just try to get a cat to come when you call if he isn't in the
mood.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to walk my cat once on a leash and found myself dragging
a limp body on its back down the sidewalk. The strategy was very
effective. I gave up before the neighbors could call me a cat
torturer.
</P>
<P>
   A leash is not a cat's way. Cats are not dogs, who can be
trained to obey certain commands, wag tails happily when a leash
appears and generally behave in human-approved slavish ways. Cats
are, well, cats.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is fond of saying that trying
to coordinate his GOP charges is something like herding cats, who
stick their tails in the air and go off in all directions. He's
right about the cats, and probably about the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The hapless official involved here, County Executive Douglas
Duncan, a Democrat, obviously has a poor sense of history. Over the
years the question of restraining cats has risen periodically
across the country. Every single time, the idea has been swiftly
defeated and its sponsor figuratively clawed to bits.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan is no exception. After the outcry, he promptly backed
away from his proposal to keep offended cat owners from tossing him
out of office in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   This reaction is so predictable that certain newspaper editors
have been known to invent a spurious cat-restraint movement in dull
seasons, certain that the ``letters to the editor'' space would
promptly overflow.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago Gov. Adlai Stevenson, vetoing an Illinois measure that
would have restricted feline freedom, wisely observed, ``It is in
the nature of cats to do a certain amount of unescorted roaming.''
Herblock, the cartoonist and social satirist, once wrote an ode to
the fact that cats owned him rather than the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Some community pet controls are of course useful. Mandatory
vaccinations and voluntary spaying and neutering make good sense.
So does encouraging dog walkers to clean their animal's poop from
public spaces, although anyone who walks on a city sidewalk knows
that is virtually impossible to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   And not all cats are range-rovers. Some comfortably grow up
indoors as house pets, content to sit on window sills and look at
birds from a distance. One third of households with a cat keep the
cat indoors.
</P>
<P>
   I have an indoor version myself. He prefers to be near his food
bowl, and it is not outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   But a cat likes to decide the indoor-outdoor issue himself. If
he is of a disposition to roam, the wise owner will let him have
his way. The cat will be happy and the community unharmed. And a
clever bird will fly away if the cat gets too close.

 NOTE: Full-length article (3,100 words) available on request  
 &HT;    On the left stands Buzzcut, a walking robot whose Weed Eater
motor drives a byzantine assembly of rods and rubber belts. Three
vicious-looking circular saw blades are mounted at the front,
another three rotate at the rear, and the whole apparatus is
supported by eight rubber-tipped aluminum legs driven by two
separate electric motors.
 &HT;    On the right is KMM, a very different robot, its machinery
protected under a rounded golden shell of graphite woven with
Kevlar. KMM sports a pair of crablike metal pncers to grab its
foe, which it then hammers into submission with a spiked metal
tail.
 &HT;    Techno music pounds from giant speakers as the machines are made
ready in an asphalt arena. Banks of bleachers are packed with fans,
who pay up to $30 admission. The robot owners retreat to safety,
clutching their radio-control units. Atop a rickety wooden
platform, three judges wearing earplugs signal that they are ready
for combat to begin.
 &HT;    Action! KMM zooms forward, snapping its pincers. Buzzcut revs
his motors, whirls his saw blades and starts hopping around on his
bouncy rubber feet. The contest is beyond bizarre.
 &HT;    Buzzcut tries to climb on KMM's back, but his legs and drive
belts get tangled. KMM's tail swings, and its spike pounds one of
Buzzcut's green electric motors. Two of Buzzcut's rubber feet are
torn off, forcing him to dance in circles.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the judges reach their verdict. KMM is the winner!
The crowd roars with approval.
 &HT;    Now imagine this kind of contest repeated in 100 different
variations throughout two whole days, and you have Robot Wars, the
annual monster slugfest in which lovingly crafted machines duke it
out. The concept made its debut in 1994 as an obscure ``art
event.'' It quickly gathered a fanatical following, and by '97 had
spawned a six-week BBC-TV series.
 &HT;    Some robots are primitive metal boxes improvised by high school
students in basement workshops; others are as sleek as race cars,
crafted by professional model makers at Hollywood movie
special-effects (f/x) houses.
 &HT;    Mark Setrakian, for instance, developed some of the creatures
for ``Men in Black.'' At the 1997 Robot Wars he exhibited a huge
steel snake, 13 feet long, that writhed and crashed across the
arena, rousing a standing ovation from the capacity crowd.
 &HT;    Why did Setrakian suspend his lucrative business and spend huge
amounts of time and money developing this monster? ``I like
building robots,'' he says simply.
 &HT;    For Marc Thorpe, it's not simple at all. Thorpe is a bony,
worried-looking, 50-year-old model maker who used to work at the
venerable Industrial Light &AMP; Magic studio but now describes himself
variously as a promoter and a performance artist. He invented Robot
Wars, manages it and justifies it with a long, rambling,
philosophical manifesto.
 &HT;    ``It's a theater of survival, a microcosm of our own dilemma.
... when a child builds a sand castle and knocks it down, this does
not mean an innate desire for warfare.''
 &HT;    In fact, Thorpe goes on, why couldn't robot slugfests steal part
of the audience from contact sports? It's so much, well,
psychologically healthier for us to see machines getting clobbered
than people. Ideally he'd stage regional events across America,
televised, leading up to the national finals.
 &HT;    Is he onto something? Fans will cheer costumed wrestlers bashing
each other with folding chairs. Why not Robot Wars?
 &HT;    Then again, audiences who actually witness the Robotathon may be
unconvinced by Thorpe's earnest assurance that the spectacle is
benign and irrelevant to real-life warfare.
 &HT;    At the weighing-in session preceding Robot Wars, clusters of
nerds show off their robots in ``The Pit,'' an area cluttered with
folding chairs, power tools, cables and battery chargers. The hall
echoes to the sound of metal and the smell of solder as builders
make last-minute modifications to machines sprouting spikes,
wheels, hammers and chain saws.
 &HT;    To the casual observer it looks like boys with their toys, and
the toys are lethal.
 &HT;    Peter Abrahamson, who by day freelances creating animatronics
and puppets for Jim Henson's Creature Shop, spent eight hours a day
for four months building his robot for the 1997 event. ``But even
if it gets hammered,'' he commented beforehand, ``and hydraulic
fluid is all over the place, and a battery catches fire _ it's
totally OK. I'd love that, going down in a big blaze of glory.''
 &HT;    Robot Wars has the same primitive appeal as any schlock sci-fi
movie in which spaceships are vaporized or cities are reduced to
rubble. But that's the least of it. In a world of sleek, boringly
efficient gadgets that are becoming increasingly sophisticated and
intimidating, it's fun to watch retro robots that are designed to
fight. In fact, their fallibility gives them a sense of innocence
and even charm.
 &HT;    ``You would think that a bunch of machines bashing each other
would be utterly devoid of emotion,'' comments John Knoll, who
codeveloped the first version of Photoshop, Adobe's legendary
graphic arts application. ``But when you're there, you are keenly
aware of the very human personalities.''
 &HT;    Knoll, an ILM visual-effects supervisor, is working on the new
``Star Wars,'' but he always takes time out to build something for
Robot Wars.
 &HT;    The robot personalities create intense drama, especially in the
heavyweight division.
 &HT;    Robot Number One is Blendo, a metal dome like a giant hubcap,
concealing a gasoline-powered lawn-mower motor that turns a
120-pound flywheel. Two blunt steel blades protrude at the rim,
reaching a rotational speed of 70 miles per hour. In test sessions,
Blendo has destroyed surplus office furniture with ruthless
efficiency.
 &HT;    The machine's builder, Jamie Hyneman, wears a black beret and
stands like a Special Forces veteran.
 &HT;    Blendo is unashamedly ugly, like a sullen kid with pimples who
beats up other kids because they're nicer looking or get better
grades. ``It's low tech,'' Hyneman agrees. ``But we're proud of
that. We invested less money and effort than anyone in our weight
class, and we made a more dangerous robot. I think that means we're
smarter.''
 &HT;    In fact Blendo was so powerful, he was evicted from the 1995
Robot Wars when shrapnel torn from one of his opponents landed in
the audience. Hyneman didn't attend the 1996 event, but Marc Thorpe
felt compelled to strengthen the arena so that the deadly spinning
dome could be invited back for 1997.
 &HT;    Alas, despite the modifications, history repeated itself. When
Blendo faced his first opponent, a hapless aluminum box named
Hercules, he ripped off a piece of armor and threw it across the
arena, carving a two-inch gash in the bulletproof glass. If the
trajectory had been a few feet higher, the jagged-edged metal would
have hurtled into the crowd with potentially nightmarish
consequences.
 &HT;    Once again, safety officials banished Blendo. This roused a
collective sigh of relief among most other participants _ but not
all. Greg Munson and Trey Roski were seriously angry about it,
having spent the entire previous year actively planning a showdown
with the seemingly invincible monster robot.
 &HT;    Munson, 32, is lean and manic, with an intent look in his eye.
Roski, his cousin, is a year older, less talkative, but equally
obsessed. By day they run a digital design business in San
Francisco, but robots are their all-consuming passion.
 &HT;    ``When we were kids,'' Roski says, ``Greg and I always messed
around with radio-controlled cars, helicopters and model rockets.
And we always blew up our toys at the end.''
 &HT;    Munson nods. ``That's common among robot people.''
 &HT;    ``It feels better to blow it up yourself than have it break,''
Roski explains.
 &HT;    Munson does most of the engineering work, while Roski, a former
helicopter pilot, deals with the driving _ and the destruction.
 &HT;    ``Nothing compares with being in total control of a robot,
facing another guy's robot, and destroying it,'' he says, smiling.
``I don't know what it's like to be a rock star, but _ competing in
Robot Wars has to feel something like when Pete Townshend smashes
his guitar. A total adrenaline rush.''
 &HT;    What if his robot is the one to be demolished?
 &HT;    ``We don't have Builder Syndrome. That's when people get so
involved with the thing they build, they can't bear to see it
broken,'' Munson explains.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, we don't care,'' Roski says. ``On the night before Robot
Wars, we take all the remote-controlled cars and airplanes that
we've made during the past year and smash them up, to get rid of
Builder Syndrome.''
 &HT;    They entered Robot Wars originally in 1995 as upstart amateurs
with a cheap $600 middleweight named La Machine. Her simple wedge
design won no awards for good looks but was so effective at
knocking adversaries out of the ring, she won not only in her own
category, but in the heavyweight category as well.
 &HT;    Still, they wanted to come up against Blendo. The one thing they
didn't count on was Hyneman getting disqualified again, removing
his Blendo from the contest and leaving La Machine facing a very
different adversary: BioHazard.
 &HT;    Built by Carlo Bertocchini, who does mechanical design for a
company in Menlo Park, Calif., BioHazard is a gleaming flat slab of
stainless steel, titanium, magnesium and aluminum just 4.5 inches
high, edged with hinged fender skirts that brush the floor.
Underneath the armor, wheels, motors, batteries and wires fit
together with exquisite precision, like something fabricated by
NASA.
 &HT;    Technically and artistically, BioHazard is a thing of beauty.
Designed primarily to be invulnerable to attack, BioHazard has only
one offensive tool: a jointed arm terminating in a shovel blade
which slides under other robots and tips them over.
 &HT;    ``BioHazard in 1996 was disabled when I got a good sideswipe
that bent the arm,'' Bertocchini says, sounding sad. ``But in 1997
I made it a lot stronger. Formerly, this lever was made out of
magnesium; now it's titanium. I went from four-wheel drive to
six-wheel drive, and added the fender skirts. There's not much they
can damage. Even the motors have hardened cases.''
 &HT;    Sure enough, in 1997 BioHazard was impervious to all comers _
including La Machine. Immediately before their confrontation, Roski
and Bertocchini stood side by side, elbow to elbow, oblivious to
each other as they held their radio-control units, ready to duel
vicariously via their metal children in the arena.
 &HT;    As soon as the match began, Roski thought he saw an opening _
but suddenly found his robot pinned against the wall. BioHazard's
articulated arm slid out, the shovel blade slipped insolently under
La Machine's metal skirt. Within 15 seconds Bertocchini trivialized
a year of research and development and thousands of dollars in
corporate sponsorship. La Machine was flipped onto her side,
stranded ignominiously at the edge of the arena, while Roski stared
in disbelief.
 &HT;    A couple minutes later, back in The Pit, a British TV crew asked
Munson if he was disappointed. ``A little,'' he said, looking
shattered.
 &HT;    The interviewer turned to Roski. ``How do you feel?''
 &HT;    He stared back at her. There was a long silence. ``I don't
know,'' he said finally.
 &HT;    Atill, on the very night of their defeat, the former champions
started plotting their comeback. A couple days later, their usual
in-your-face attitude reasserted itself, and they started sounding
like Don King.
 &HT;    ``We're going to turn BioHazard into an art piece,'' Munson
boasted. ``The only thing Carlo will be able to do with it, after
we've finished with it, is hang it on the wall.''
 &HT;    To prevent La Machine from being tipped over, they installed a
giant suction cup that would clamp itself to the floor, resisting
as much as 1,000 pounds of upward force. They abandoned this
concept, though, because it immobilized their own robot as well as
the opponent.
 &HT;    ``We've figured out a much better solution,'' Munson now claims.
``I can't say exactly what we have in mind, but if we get tipped
over this year, we won't stay tipped over. That's for sure.''
 &HT;    Still, aside from the inherently unpredictable nature of Robot
Wars, this spectator sport is technology-driven, and the technology
is very young. Human ingenuity has already yielded some bizarre,
baroque, mind-boggling robots, but, without a doubt, the ultimate
potential in this arcane art form is still waiting to be
discovered.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `THE AVENGERS,' starring Uma Thurman, Ralph Fiennes, Sean
Connery and Eileen Atkins. Directed by Jeremiah Chechik (PG, 100
minutes). Sometimes major movie studios SHOULD be afraid to screen
expensive fiascoes for the press, but they go ahead anyway. ``The
Avengers'' is Warner Brothers' would-be blockbuster that actually
had its light hidden beneath a bushel until opening day, and no
wonder. With pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin Powers
blush and with so many shades of ``Howard the Duck'' that one scene
depicts man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a conference
table, it's a film to gall fans of the old television series and
perplex anyone else. I can't remember another Friday morning show
where I heard actual cries of ``Ugh!'' on the way out the door
(Janet Maslin).

   `BLADE,' starring Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Traci Lords and
Kris Kristofferson. Directed by Stephen Norrington (R, 120
minutes). Vampires are plotting to take over the world, and the
only person who can save the planet is a vampiric half-human
superhero named Blade. So much fake blood drips, gushes, explodes
and congeals in this hyperkinetic science-fiction horror film
adapted from a popular comic book that there's barely a scene that
isn't drenched in red. Snipes' Blade is a low-rent Arnold
Schwarzenegger imitation dressed in a ludicrous mixture of black
leather and what look like car seat belts. There's lots of morphing
and Hong Kong action movie-style acrobatics. Dorff is the bratty
leader of the young vampire rebels. The visuals are garish, the
acting wretched (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `54,' starring Ryan Phillippe, Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell, Mike
Myers, Lauren Hutton and Michael York. Directed by Mark Christopher
(R, 89 minutes). Christopher's botched history of Studio 54, the
notorious late-'70s disco and celebrity hangout, should have been a
depraved Manhattan answer to ``Saturday Night Fever.'' Instead, it
is a juiceless mishmash that can't decide whether it's a nightclub
history, a comedy (Myers' crude ``Saturday Night Live''-style
caricature of Steve Rubell) or a contemporary variation on the
fable of the prodigal son. Phillippe, playing a 19-year-old Jersey
City nobody who ascends from busboy to star bartender at the club,
does throw off an occasional spark. But the movie is so afraid to
confront the character's self-promoting bisexuality that he never
really comes alive (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `LOLITA,' starring Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain. Directed by
Adrian Lyne (R, 137 minutes). At last, Lyne's fine, deeply felt
adaption of Nabokov's diabolical masterpiece can been seen in the
large-screen format it truly deserves. Why go out? Because the
detail and texture of this lavishly produced film shine
theatrically in ways that weren't possible on Showtime, and because
the film's mostly unalloyed subtlety (except in its opening and
closing sections) rewards a closer view. Lyne's direction is the
best work of his career. Irons' splendid performance conveys a
tragicomic blend of ardor and conscience, while Ms. Swain plays the
title role as a startlingly unpredictable adult-child hybrid. For a
culture so dangerously obsessed with youth and beauty, this
haunting ``Lolita'' is a fascinating sign of its times (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `NEXT STOP WONDERLAND,' starring Hope Davis and Alan Gelfant.
Directed by Brad Anderson (R, 111 minutes). Will Erin (Ms. Davis),
an attractive, introspective night-shift nurse, and Alan (Gelfant),
a plumber and aspiring marine biologist who was obviously meant for
her, collide on the streets of Boston and live happily ever after?
The setup of this romantic comedy about dating in the '90s may seem
cliched, but the witty, beautifully acted and edited film refreshes
the genre with the acuteness of Anderson's observations about
people and middle-class urban life in general. Ms. Davis creates a
wonderfully complex portrait of an idealistic introvert coping with
loneliness, disappointment and pressures from all sides, including
(in the movie's funniest scenes) some ardently self-centered
suitors who answer a personal ad. A rich Brazilian bossa nova score
gives the movie the mood of bittersweet longing (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `ONE TRUE THING,' starring Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and
William Hurt. Directed by Carl Franklin (PG-13, 120 minutes). This
film adaptation of the novel by Anna Quindlen _ a former columnist
for The New York Times _ about an ambitious New York journalist
forced to move back in with her parents to care for her dying
mother strikes a sad and universal chord. And Ms. Streep and Ms.
Zellweger are beautifully matched as a mother and daughter who
achieve a grown-up understanding during this anguished time. But
the movie treads the line between soap opera and serious drama and
has far too many cute and sentimental touches. Its structure _ the
story is told in flashbacks that make the mother's death a kind of
whodunit (she dies from an overdose of morphine) _ also cheapen the
movie without ruining it (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `PECKER,' starring Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci, Martha
Plimpton and Lili Taylor. Directed by John Waters (R, 87 minutes).
Waters, the Trash King of Baltimore, does his best to puncture New
York art-world pretensions in a film whose biggest joke is its
title, though plenty of winking smaller jokes are here, too.
``Flavor of Month Causes Tizzy in Art World'' reads a headline
summarizing the career of the title character, a Baltimore
shutterbug who just won't quit snapping friends and neighbors. In
the film, fame and fortune threaten Pecker's trashy esthetic and
gross-out chic. Waters' own style hasn't had to sacrifice these at
all (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PERMANENT MIDNIGHT,' starring Ben Stiller and Elizabeth Hurley.
Directed by David Veloz (R, 85 minutes). As Jerry Stahl recounts in
his 1995 memoir, drug addiction turned him into a skittish,
distracted, hugely self-involved individual. Since he happened to
be working as a television writer in Hollywood, no one really
noticed. The film version of his story plunges fearlessly into the
self-inflicted humiliations that went with this story. In a
first-rate, rivetingly caustic performance, Stiller plays a man on
a fashionably decadent slide all the way to rock bottom. The
character's clearest sign of dysfunction is his inability to
appreciate Elizabeth Hurley as his ravishing, high-powered wife
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `RONIN,' starring Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Stellan Skarsgaard,
Natascha McElhone and Jonathan Pryce. Directed by John
Frankenheimer (R, 121 minutes). Directing like a world-weary
Hitchcock with a taste for the breathless car chase, Frankenheimer
propels this intrigue tale through its tightly plotted paces so
expertly that he even makes an action hero of De Niro. European in
both its brooding tone and beautiful French settings, this story of
double-dealing mercenaries in pursuit of a metal suitcase features
a tough, expert cast and some sensational action sequences.
Frankenheimer directs them in fast, efficient, no-frills fashion
because no extra frills are needed (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ROUNDERS,' starring Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Malkovich,
John Turturro and Gretchen Mol. Directed by John Dahl (R, 120
minutes). Though this tale of poker fever finally adds up to less
than meets the eye, what does meet the eye (and ear) is
mischievously entertaining. Inspired by Martin Scorsese's brand of
irresistible lowlife and aided by a splendid rogues' gallery of a
cast, the director of ``The Last Seduction'' takes his audience
into a poker demimonde of abundant color. As the actors make the
most of rascally roles (Malkovich has a field day with a Russian
accent), the story leads to settings as varied as the Elks Hall in
Binghamton and a Russian Turkish bath. Dahl may not have new
thoughts on the gambler's life, but he makes this guided tour worth
the trip (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,' starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom
Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg. Directed
by Steven Spielberg (R, 168 minutes). Spielberg's soberly
magnificent new film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning
back the clock to restore passion and meaning to the genre, he
works in a spirit of urgent communication to look at war as if it
had not been looked at before. Tour-de-force battle scenes are
frank without sensationalism, and the same great storyteller who
made you believe there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the closet
has made this an irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale. Hanks
continues to astonish with admirable modesty, and the rest of the
casting is comparably inspired. As he did with ``Schindler's
List,'' Spielberg has made a landmark film of devastating power
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER NEVER CRIES,' starring Leelee Sobieski,
Kris Kristofferson, Barbara Hershey and Anthony Roth Costanzo.
Directed by James Ivory (R, 120 minutes). Working without a classic
at hand, the Merchant-Ivory team adapts a novel by Kaylie Jones,
James Jones' daughter, into a colorful panorama weakened by
autobiographical sprawl. With no real narrative shapeliness and a
loosely anecdotal pace, it vividly recalls the coming of age of a
sensitive young woman who (though well played by 14-year-old Ms.
Sobieski) remains a more slender, peripheral figure than the film's
ambitions require. Moving from Paris to America, it succeeds more
at evoking detail and atmosphere than in finding the heart of her
story (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,' starring Cameron Diaz, Ben
Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (R,
119 minutes). Sometimes Western civilization declines in
deliriously funny style. Hence this proudly obnoxious comedy is a
hoot in every sense, deserving a smidgen of disapproval and a whole
lot of helpless laughter. Set in motion by a prom, a crush and a
cruel, cruel zipper, this paean to low humor works ridiculously
well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all
appearances) authentically inane. The principal cast is bright and
appealing, with Ms. Diaz at her most beautiful and blithe. Do note
that this film strives hard for something to offend everyone, and
that a tolerance for the Farrellys' zit jokes is unfortunately
required (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `WITHOUT LIMITS,' starring Billy Crudup, Donald Sutherland and
Monica Potter. Directed by Robert Towne (PG-13, 118 minutes). In
telling the story of mercurial track star Steve Prefontaine, a
screenwriter known for enriching screenplays with unruly,
unpredictable life creates a surprisingly resonant portrait. Thanks
to Crudup's charismatic performance as a runner with the attitudes
of a rock star, this can be watched as one more sports film,
complete with exciting race sequences. But it's not truly about
winning, losing or even playing the game; instead, Towne considers
the philosophical distance between the brash Prefontaine and his
formidable coach, Bill Bowerman (expertly played by Sutherland).
The film's wisdom lies in its thoughtful way of balancing these two
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,' starring Jason Patric, Ben
Stiller, Aaron Eckhardt, Catherine Keener, Amy Brenneman and
Nastassja Kinski. Written and directed by Neil LaBute (R, 100
minutes). Three men obsessed with one another's sexual performance
are at the core of this second film from the director of ``In the
Company of Men.'' The new movie is so blunt at times, and so
unrelievedly talky and dark at others, that it cries out for the
velvet glove of ``Manhattan,'' a much more seductive film about
sexual opportunism and urbane cruelty. Yet even when LaBute's
material feels mannered or unremittingly sour, it sustains a
psychic ferocity that commands attention. The intricate web of
lies, failures and brutal revelations here is strong stuff, and
it's the work of an original filmmaker who takes no prisoners
(Maslin).

CALDER WORKS ON THE MOVE  
 HERMITAGE WEST  
 WELCOME, PLEASE STAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Colo., Calif.)   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Calder Foundation is the latest suitor to make a
play for 2 Columbus Circle in Manhattan, that white marble building
with the slender arches and round holes that Edward Durell Stone
designed to be the Gallery of Modern Art in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander S.C. Rower, a grandson of the artist Alexander Calder
and the director of the foundation, said he believed it was time to
move the operation from its headquarters in Woodstock, N.Y., to
Manhattan. He has spent the last six months looking at sites large
enough to house a Calder museum as well as the foundation's
archives and library.
</P>
<P>
   Though 2 Columbus Circle would be an ideal spot, the fate of the
city-owned building appears uncertain. In July 1996, the city asked
for sealed bids from interested buyers. But three months later,
after the deadline for bids, no selection was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were waiting to see who would be selected to develop the
Coliseum site,'' said Charles Millard, president of New York City's
Economic Development Corp., referring to a building on the west
side of Columbus Circle. ``We wanted a selection that would be
compatible. The real estate market has changed and we're evaluating
the situation. None of the bidders have been rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Millard declined to name the bidders, the Dahesh Museum
has made public its interest in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a wonderful addition to the city to have a Calder
museum,'' said Randall Bourscheidt, president of the Alliance for
the Arts, an advocacy organization in Manhattan. ``Calder had a
strong identification with New York and quite a following here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rower said he had been working with Schuyler G. Chapin, the
city's cultural affairs commissioner, to find a city-owned building
that would be suitable for the Calder Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking everywhere from Battery Park City to
Chelsea, TriBeCa, the West Village and a few sites in midtown,'' he
said. He confirmed that 2 Columbus Circle was on his wish list,
even though the foundation began to consider it after the bidding
had been closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked to be able to put in a bid anyway, but the city
hasn't gotten back to us yet,'' Rower said. ``Schuyler Chapin
thought we should go for it.'' A spokeswoman in Chapin's office
said the commissioner declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has large holdings, with some works owned by
family members and others by foundation supporters. The art
includes about 300 sculptures, 55 monumental outdoor works and more
than 3,000 works on paper, many not publicly seen since 1943.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was a large lender to the exhibition ``Alexander
Calder: 1898-1976,'' which opened in March at the National Gallery
of Art in Washington and is now at the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art. The foundation also has extensive archives, with
more &UR;  &LR; than 100,000 documents.
 &UR;  &LR; ``We've spent the last 11 years working on the artist's catalog
raisonne and have 16,000 works documented,'' Rower said. Though he
was not sure when the catalog would be published, he said it would
be about 35 volumes. ``It will be an encyclopedia,'' he said. &QL;

   The State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, may be
short on cash, but not on vision. The latest of its many plans is
to transform a home for the elderly in Amsterdam into a satellite
of the Hermitage.
</P>
<P>
   The building, the 17th-century Amstelhof Nursing Home on the
Amstel River, belongs to a church, which wants to sell it to a
buyer that would make it into a cultural center.
</P>
<P>
   Why not a Russian cultural center in Amsterdam, asked Dr.
Mikhail B. Piotrovsky, director of the Hermitage. ``It would have
permanent exhibition space to show two shows a year, one that would
be up for a year and the other for six months,'' Piotrovsky said.
``We would also like to exhibit works from other Russian museums.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides giving the Hermitage another site for showing its vast
collections, Piotrovsky said, an Amsterdam location would make it
easier for people to see the museum's treasures. It could also
become a good source of much-needed revenue. ``I'm very optimistic
about the project,'' he said. ``We're beginning to do feasibility
studies.''  &QL; 
 &QL;

<P>
   The long-awaited Berger Collection of British art is opening at
the Denver Art Museum on Oct. 10. Originally the exhibition, which
includes more than 200 works by artists like Reynolds,
Gainsborough, Constable and Sir Alfred Munnings, was to have gone
on view in November, when the museum reopened its European and
American galleries after a seven-year facelift.
</P>
<P>
   But the collection was too big for the space. So now the museum
has stored part of its permanent collection to make room for the
British art.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in just three years by William M.B. Berger, founder of
the Denver-based Berger Group of mutual funds, the collection takes
up about 10,000 square feet, the entire seventh floor of the
museum. It will be on display for six months. The works span 600
years and, in addition to paintings, include the Bute Book of Hours
and a Nottingham alabaster altarpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the Berger Collection was assembled too quickly
to have the depth of the Yale Center for British Art or the
Huntington Library Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San
Marino, Calif. But Berger defends his collection, saying that
``even the Tate can't boast of having 600 years of British art.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum hopes the collection will never leave. ``I think
whenever a museum is able to host a show like this, it hopes to get
the collection,'' said Lewis I. Sharp, director of the Denver Art
Museum. ``Our European holdings are small, so for this institution
it would be a great gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger isn't so sure: ``I tell the museum, you put up the
gallery first and then we'll see what happens.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A warning for those with delicate constitutions:
don't eat before seeing ``The Mystery of Irma Vep.''
</P>
<P>
   You've never heard of projectile laughing? It's a serious
concern at ``Irma Vep,'' far and away the funniest two hours
unfolding anywhere today on a New York stage. The revival of the
Ridiculous Theatrical Company's 1984 hit, played with a consummate
sense of timing by that old Ridiculous hand Everett Quinton and a
bright newcomer, Stephen DeRosa, is just about all one could hope
for in outrageous Gothic spoofing that incorporates such dainty
comic devices as leering Egyptian mummies, blood-soaked oil
portraits and bald men in bustles.
</P>
<P>
   Fiends are on the loose in the misty bogs (or is that the boggy
mists?) of Mandacrest, where much of the play takes place. But it
is the cockeyed spirit of Charles Ludlam, author of ``Irma Vep''
and founder of the Ridiculous, who died in 1987, that most
assuredly inhabits the chintz-filled English manor house, which
evokes a thousand atmospheric movie thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   This commercial version, directed by Ludlam's former partner and
longtime co-star, Quinton, parts with Ridiculous history, upgrading
the company's traditionally (and intentionally) slipshod production
values from economy to first class, yet it retains Ludlam's tart
worldview. The jokes are so blatant, so wickedly retro, they're
almost reprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   But even when the gags are cheap _ this is a show that manages
11 or 12 laughs out of a set of false buck teeth _ they're never
flimsy. The play, which opened Thursday night at the Westside
Theater, is solidly built on a lightning-fast series of costume
changes by the two actors, who equally divvy up eight major roles.
Half the fun is anticipating the rapid exits and entrances;
Quinton, in one amazing instance, plays both ends of a tussle in a
doorway and DeRosa, in another, runs off as Lord Edgar Hillcrest,
in tweed waistcoat and riding pants, and back on as the
chambermaid, in curly wig and voluminous aprons, in 13 seconds
flat.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the pleasure is not so easily quantified. It's the
reflexive aspect of comedy, the yielding to the power of an
imagination that bends language and ideas into shapes you can't
anticipate. How, for instance, does Quinton, playing a
double-dealing tour guide to the Pyramids, turn ``sarcophagus''
into the most hilarious word in the English-Egyptian dictionary? He
repeats it three or four times in a preposterous Middle Eastern
accent, the twist of the tongue that forces the emphasis onto the
most egregious-sounding syllable. (Almost as funny: his describing
a potion as being ``form-ED from the OO-rine of lynxes.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Irma Vep'' is made up of dozens of such blissfully wacky
interludes. The story is patched together, a la Frankenstein's
monster, from this, that and the other; the literary and
pop-culture references range from the Brontes to Mel Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Edgar's insecure second wife, Enid, is now installed as the
hostess of Mandacrest, and like Joan Fontaine in ``Rebecca,'' she's
haunted by the reminders everywhere of the first lady of the house,
the mysterious Irma Vep, whose portrait glares down at her from its
honored perch above the fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   Quinton, wrapped, like a garish Christmas present, in William
Ivey Long's perfectly insane billowing gowns with clashing collars
_ all the costumes are divine _ plays Enid as if he were a member
of British stage royalty who was unaware of being way too big and
way too old (not to mention way too masculine) for the part. He
doesn't glide or float across the stage, he flounces, like a panda
in a tutu. He gives the kind of self-conscious performance that
effortlessly gets laughs on lines like, ``When I had completed my
beauty ritual. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Lady Enid's sparring partner is DeRosa's sweet-and-sour
chambermaid, Jane, who wears the brittle, private smile of an
embittered servant bearing some ancient, festering grudge. DeRosa,
in the less showy performance, is consistently smashing, impressive
in everything from Jane's country English accent to Lord Edgar's
heroic swagger. He's Tim Conway to Quinton's Harvey Korman; they're
affectionately matched pros, challenging one another to play at
their peak.
</P>
<P>
   Like Conway and Korman, too, DeRosa and Quinton, clearly working
hard but loving their jobs, have to struggle not to break character
and crack up. When, on the sixth or seventh occasion, Quinton
lumbers on as the stableman Nicodemus Underwood, he of the wooden
leg with visible tree rings and teeth so rotten they should be
taken into custody by the American Dental Association, DeRosa
nearly loses it. It's the cumulative effect of experiencing
Quinton's slobbering efforts to enunciate through a set of dentures
that don't come close to fitting.
</P>
<P>
   John Lee Beatty's lavishly tacky sets are elaborate jokes unto
themselves, and there is a lovely designers' convergence when Lady
Enid, in her umpteenth costume change, enters wearing the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   An Egyptian tomb to which Lord Edgar repairs for a wisely
gratuitous change of locale is a marvel of stage technology and
space management: imagine trying to squeeze a turbine generator
into a studio apartment and you'll have some idea of the
engineering feat involved in moving a sphinx into an Off Broadway
playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Along with its secret passageways, werewolves, vampires, mummies
and sarcophagi, ``Irma Vep'' piles allusion upon allusion. Ludlam
had a terrific ear not only for the uproarious turn of phrase, but
also for a precise movie cliche; when a character speaks of the
``third crowing of the cock'' or declares, ``I'll see you hanged
first!'' we know instantly what genre, what particular film even,
Ludlam has in mind.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is as easy as it looks. How fleetingly ``Irma Vep''
would flame out in less devilishly clever hands and in scenes that
did not come off like clockwork. Quinton and DeRosa insure that the
Ridiculous colors are flown as ludicrously as humanly possible. And
what more meaningful gift could Ludlam bequeath than to leave them
eternally laughing?

OPENING A COVETED PHOTO ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Next week's major photography auctions at Sotheby's,
Christie's, Phillips and Swann Galleries may change the meaning of
``photo op.'' At these sales, the opportunities are for collectors,
not shooters.
</P>
<P>
   One Manhattan photography dealer, Jill Quasha, estimates that
the pictures for sale are worth $10 million. ``There's a plethora
of marvelous material,'' agreed another dealer, Jonathan Hallam, of
the Hallam &AMP; Swope gallery in Hudson, N.Y. ``What's great about
photography is that it's accessible and open to everybody at every
price range.''
</P>
<P>
   Art photography has broad appeal. ``It's the same way we are all
film critics now,'' said Daniel Wolf, a dealer who caters to
museums and institutions. ``Photography is the easiest thing to
collect. If you like a work, you buy a book, learn the history of
photography, study other photographs and buy the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The photography market has been booming. Sotheby's sale on April
7 totaled $3.4 million, its most successful various-owners
photography sale ever. The next day, Christie's New York set a
world record for a photography auction with a sale that reached
$4.6 million. Swann Galleries' auction the same month brought in
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Who's buying?
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, `Who isn't?' '' said Rick Wester, of
Christie's. ``We've had 30 to 40 percent new buyers in each sale in
the last two and a half years. It's an image-specific,
print-sensitive market; people have to be seduced by the images.''
Collectors include Elton John, Richard Gere and Diane Keaton.
</P>
<P>
   The big question next week is whether the market can absorb so
many important pictures in such a short time.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these auctions in Manhattan, Phillips' 20th-century
photography sale, on Sunday at 4 p.m., is the most daring because
all the works are in color. ``No one has done an all-color
photography sale,'' said Nancy Lieberman, of Phillips. ``We are
taking a risk so the estimates are reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale features pieces collected since 1983 by Joshua P.
Smith, the curator of a 1989 exhibition at the National Museum of
American Art in Washington titled ``The Photography of Invention:
American Pictures of the 1980s.'' The show commemorated the 150th
anniversary of the invention of photography.
</P>
<P>
   There are 84 lots in the Phillips' sale. Smith is selling 10
dye-transfer prints by William Eggleston, the quirky Memphis art
photographer who was given the first exhibition of color
photography at the Museum of Modern Art in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The lots include three well-known Eggleston images: ``Elvis and
Kennedy,'' a 1983 interior of Graceland in Memphis, and two
colorful 1972 roadside snaps in the Mississippi Delta, ``Tennessee
(Gulf Sign)'' and ``Tennessee (Bozo Cafe).'' Each is expected to
sell for $4,000 to $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Why buy contemporary photographs at auction when there are so
many good dealers? ``Egglestons don't come up that often,'' Wolf
said. ``Eggleston is in the pantheon, so it doesn't surprise me
he's in an auction. The pictures are classic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan dealer James Danziger added, ``Editions of certain
pictures can be completely sold out, so you have to go to auction
to buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   The most talked-about sale is ``The Image as Object: Photographs
From the Collection of Barry Friedman,'' which includes 152 photos
taken from 1910 to 1936 that Christie's is auctioning, on Monday at
6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman has collected photography since 1987, and until last
year owned a photo gallery with Edwynn Houk that specialized in
pictures from the 1930s, including the Constructivist period.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam, the dealer, who worked with Friedman in the 1980s, said:
``Barry latches on to things like photography, becomes passionate
about them, learns about them, then applies his extraordinary eye
and makes it work. He's an incredible presence on the New York
gallery scene because he has explored and taken risks.'' Friedman
said he was selling all but 10 of his photographs because he had no
place to store them.
</P>
<P>
   The sale includes several iconic images, like Margaret
Bourke-White's 1930 gelatin silver print of a gargoyle on the
Chrysler Building ($60,000 to $80,000) and El Lissitzky's ``Study
for the U.S.S.R. Russian Exhibition,'' a photomontage of two
overlapping faces of Russian youths, circa 1929, that was later
used for a famous poster ($40,000 to $60,000).
</P>
<P>
   The most excitement, however, is over Friedman's diptych by the
Surrealist Man Ray, ``Noire et Blanche, Paris (Positive and
Negative).'' This pair of prints first appeared in Paris Vogue in
May 1926. It depicts Man Ray's muse and lover, Kiki of
Montparnasse, with eyes closed, holding a dark African wooden mask
of a woman's face. The positive print is paired with a negative
print of the same image, which enhances the striking composition.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate of $600,000 to $800,000 indicates that Christie's
thinks pairs of vintage prints of positive and negative images are
extremely rare. The price, however, is not. Peter MacGill of the
Pace Wildenstein MacGill gallery in Manhattan said he sold pictures
in the $300,000-to-$400,000 range ``with regularity.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Wolf noted: ``Man Ray has always been the lead
photographer in terms of price because you get the crossover market
from the modern art collectors. Man Ray always commands more than
Stieglitz, Steichen or Weston.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Monday sale, at Swann Galleries beginning at 10:30 a.m.,
has 547 lots, few with estimates over $10,000. Civil War-era
photographs include one of soon-to-be emancipated slaves ($4,000 to
$5,000).
</P>
<P>
   There is also a 1939 silver print, a striking abstract study of
windows, by William Keck, a modernist and colleague of Moholy-Nagy
at the New Bauhaus in Chicago ($7,000 to $10,000).
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's sale of 488 photographs, on Wednesday beginning at
10:15 a.m., includes about 40 works de-accessioned from the Gilman
Paper Co. collection. Works from the collection were exhibited
under the title ``Waking Dream'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
in 1993. There are works by Atget, Man Ray, Robert Frank, Paul
Outerbridge Jr., Paul Strand and Walker Evans, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The icon here, however, is Dorothea Lange's portrait of a
migrant mother and her three hungry, dusty children, ``Migrant
Mother, Nipomo, Calif.'' (1936). Lange took the picture for the
Federal Resettlement Administration, signed it and added an
alternative title: ``Facing Starvation.'' (Estimate: $100,000 to
$150,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Collectors with that kind of money might want to spend it on the
photographs that Picasso and Dora Maar took of themselves, each
other, their studios and their friends from 1906 to 1946. They will
be auctioned by Piasa, an affiliate of Phillips, in Paris on Oct.
28 and 29. They are from Maar's collection and are enchanting,
romantic, historic _ almost worth a trip to Paris.

HOME VIDEO NOTES AND NEWS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Noted for its successes in the so-called urban niches _ black,
Latino, gay and lesbian _ New Line Cinema obviously hasn't hurt its
reputation lately with ``Rush Hour,'' Brett Ratner's karate
kickfest of a movie that combines not one niche, but two, with the
black comedian Chris Tucker and Asian action star Jackie Chan. To
date, the film has earned almost $70 million at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   But for another measure of New Line's track record in the urban
genres, look for the video of a little movie called ``Friday.'' In
1995, Gary Gray's film, described by Caryn James in The New York
Times as a ``ruder, cruder version of the hip-hop movie `House
Party,''' had its theater run and moved on to video, where it has
spent 93 weeks on Video Business magazine's best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   Only ``Braveheart,'' at 100 weeks, has been on the list longer.
Asked to explain the film's staying power, Michael Karaffa,
executive vice president of New Line Home Video, cited its two
stars, Ice Cube and Tucker (then on the ascendancy); a good story
that keeps its sense of humor amid guns, drugs and other realities
of the streets, and a score that features Dr. Dre and Cypress Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie delivers,'' he said. ``And the soundtrack was
unstoppable.'' Critics also generally liked the film. ``A
fascinating glimpse of the way street life enters pop culture,''
Ms. James wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``House Party'' (1990) is another New Line property, as are
``Menace II Society'' (1993), ``Hoop Dreams'' (1994) and ``Money
Talks'' (1997), also with Tucker. Better-known New Line films in
the gay and Latino niches include ``Love! Valour! Compassion!''
(1996) and Gregory Nava's acclaimed ``My Family: Mi Familia''
(1994).
</P>
<P>
   None of those have matched ``Friday's'' run on best-seller
lists. Along with its broad appeal, Karaffa said, the movie, owing
in no small measure to its soundtrack, possesses the one ingredient
required of all best sellers: repeatability.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Programs and Profits &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This week the television and movie producer-directors Marshall
Herskovitz and Ed Zwick completed a groundbreaking deal with ABC
and Fox to waive up-front fees for new series they develop in
return for a share of the shows' future profits. A day or two
later, Herskovitz talked about an old series of his and Zwick's and
the vagaries of whether shows like it get a future at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started off slowly and it needed to build an audience like
`Hill Street Blues' or `Seinfeld,''' he said. ``People had to get
used to what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The show was ``My So-Called Life,'' six episodes of which will
be released by BMG Video on Oct. 15. On ABC briefly in 1994, the
series was a heady brew of growing pains faced by a teen-age girl
(Claire Danes). After 19 episodes it disappeared. ``In 1994
teen-age girls as a constituency weren't visible to the networks,''
Herskovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Now he and Zwick, who produced ``Thirtysomething,'' are working
on their first project under the new agreement. But deal or no
deal, any show has to stand on its own. ``Sometimes it finds an
audience, sometimes it doesn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW RELEASES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder
</P>
<P>
   When the choice comes down to love or money in Andrew Davis'
sleek, chilly update of Alfred Hitchcock's ``Dial M for Murder,''
it's strictly no contest. Caught in an affair with the young wife
(Gwyneth Paltrow, left) of a shady Wall Street bond salesman
(Michael Douglas), an artist and convicted con man (Viggo
Mortensen) accepts her husband's offer of $500,000 to kill her. But
then she survives a spectacularly botched murder attempt and
carries on with a story that overcomes strained dialogue and,
Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, has ``enough twists and
tantalizing clues for its ingenious mechanics to remain engaging.''
1998. Warner. $104.16. 105 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release
date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Prisoner
</P>
<P>
   Befitting a David Mamet film, the situation seems somehow out of
whack. On a business trip in the Caribbean, an inventor named Joe
Ross (Campbell Scott) learns from his boss (Ben Gazzara) that he
isn't about to collect the pile of money he expected from an
invention called the Process. Enter Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin), a
mysterious stranger, who glides up to the resort in his seaplane
with vaguely defined intimations of better times for Joe, including
an introduction to his beautiful, tennis-playing sister. Brushing
off the advances of an oddly off-kilter secretary (coyly portrayed
by Rebecca Pidgeon), Joe falls for Jimmy's blandishments in Mamet's
``craftiest and most satisfying cinematic puzzle'' (Janet Maslin).
1997. Columbia Tri-Star. $99.36. 112 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.
Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two Girls and a Guy
</P>
<P>
   Waiting outside the same apartment house to surprise their
boyfriends, Lou (Natasha Gregson Wagner) and Carla (Heather Graham)
are themselves surprised to discover that they are sharing the same
lover. ``The truth is, I meant everything I said to each of you at
the time I said it,'' says Blake (Robert Downey Jr.) after they've
all gotten acquainted with the awkward confluence. Gradually,
though, it doesn't matter so much since both women seem content to
carry on with the bristling, clever fellow, who is vastly more
formidable and interesting than his lovers ``as far as this agile,
three-character movie is concerned'' (Maslin). 1998. Fox. $100.96.
92 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   Hush
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to Martha Baring (Jessica Lange), a neurotic widow who
runs a Kentucky horse farm. During a Christmas visit by her son
(Jonathan Schaech) and his girlfriend (Gwyneth Paltrow), Martha
sabotages the young woman's birth control as part of a plan to get
her impregnated, kill her and keep the baby. But instead of a
gloves-off psycho-killer romp, Jonathan Darby's film ``hasn't the
foggiest notion whether it's a soap opera or a horror film and
wanders around in a generic fog'' (Stephen Holden). 1998. Columbia
Tri-Star. $105.77. 96 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release at one time or appeared on television.
</P>
<P>
   HAPPY TOGETHER and FALLEN ANGELS. Two releases by the popular
Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai reflect his frenetic and vibrant
style. In ``Happy Together'' (1997, 98 minutes, Mandarin and
Spanish with English subtitles), which earned Wong the best
director prize at the Cannes International Film Festival, two
lovers (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Leslie Cheung) try to salvage their
relationship by transporting themselves to Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   The zanier ``Fallen Angels'' (1995, 97 minutes, Mandarin with
English subtitles), an offshoot of the director's ``Chungking
Express,'' tells two interwoven stories about a woman who books
assignments for her lover who is a hit man, and an ex-convict who,
interestingly enough, makes a living by opening stores that have
closed for the night and forcing people to buy the merchandise.
Kino. $79.95 each. Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   PEPPERMINT FRAPPE and DEPRISA, DEPRISA (``Fast, Fast''). In
``Peppermint Frappe'' (1967, 92 minutes), the first of two films by
the Spanish director Carlos Saura, a doctor and devout Catholic
obsessed with his friend's wife explores the conflict between
desire and his religious roots. A documentarylike study of Madrid
street life, ``Deprisa, Deprisa'' is the story of three young
thieves who team up with a sharpshooting waitress to commit a
robbery. No easy money here, however, just disaster. (Befitting the
cinema-verite milieu, the stars, who were nonprofessionals, were
arrested off the set for separate criminal offenses.) Home Vision.

HEDGE? THAT'S EASY TO EXPLAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  By BRUCE GOTTLIEB 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newspapers report that Long-Term Capital Management _ the
high-profile hedge fund run by a hotshot bond trader and two Nobel
laureates _ nearly plunged the world into financial ruin last week.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just journalists who say so. Intent on forestalling
global financial disaster, a group of big-money Wall Street banks
convened by the Fed ponied up almost $3.5 billion to bail out the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   What are hedge funds? Why are their meltdowns so spectacular?
</P>
<P>
   A hedge fund is nothing more than a pool of money which a
manager invests for a group of wealthy investors (minimum buy-in is
often $10 million). Hedge funds promise an investment strategy that
makes money when the market rises and when it falls. The hedge fund
manager takes 15 to 20 percent of profits, the rest goes to
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term's manager, backed by a star-studded research division,
dealt in so-called derivatives. Derivatives are financial creations
whose value is based upon, or derived from, the price of some
underlying item, like stocks, bonds, commodities or currencies. For
example: Stock options are a wager on the future price of, say,
AT&AMP;T stock; commodity futures are a wager on the future price of,
say, pork bellies.
</P>
<P>
   Derivatives permit a fund manager to reduce certain kinds of
risk. Suppose the manager is holding a portfolio whose value rises
when interest rates rise but falls when interest rates fall. Adding
an appropriate derivative _ one which bets for an interest rate
fall _ to the portfolio mitigates losses if, in fact, interest
rates fall. (Hence the name ``hedge funds'' _ one investment
position offsets, or hedges, another investment position.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course hedge fund managers do more than just bet both for and
against some outcome. At the end of the day, they must bet on
something, right? It seems that Long-Term was betting on the yields
of bonds from G-7 countries (no one is sure since Long-Term won't
disclose details of its dealings). By analyzing historical data,
Long-Term developed predictions about the relative rates of return
on different countries' bonds. The firm used a series of
hedges--which means buying derivatives _ to make sure that they
were insulated from general rises and falls in interest rates,
stock exchanges etc... That's the beauty of hedging with
derivatives _ they let you bet on precisely what you want to. In
theory, other perturbations are not supposed to affect your assets.
</P>
<P>
   One key feature of derivatives is they can get you in a pot of
trouble very quickly. If you buy stock, and its price falls by 10
percent, you've simply lost 10 percent of your money. But if, for
instance, you buy a so-called call option (which is a bet that the
stock will rise) and the stock falls by 10 percent, you may lose
all your money. (A call option allows you to buy the stock at a
specified price, known as the strike price. If the market price
falls and stays below the strike price, then the option is
worthless.)
</P>
<P>
   There are even derivatives _ such as futures contracts _ with
which you can lose more than your original investment if you bet on
the wrong horse. No one but Long-Term really knows what Long-Term
held, but the fund's asset pool has reportedly shrunk to one-tenth
the size it was in January.

ON STAGE AND OFF: TECHNICAL TORTURE; NONPROFIT, BUT ...; FAMILY
BUSINESS; OH, GOSH!; ALONG THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Any veteran of a theatrical load-in, the installation
of a production, will tell you the experience is commonly known as
``tech hell.'' But for two Broadway shows, the past week has been
especially abysmal.
</P>
<P>
   Producers for ``Footloose'' and ``Little Me'' both announced
this week that their first previews would be delayed for several
days because of ``technical difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Richard Rodgers Theater, a 40-member crew for
``Footloose'' was struggling to find space in the slim backstage
area for 16 tractor-trailers' worth of equipment shipped from the
musical's tryout at the Kennedy Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kennedy is literally 13 or 14 times as deep as this
theater,'' said Peter Fulbright, the show's technical supervisor.
``It's like putting a 10-pound show in a 5-pound box.''
</P>
<P>
   In the theater's occasionally leaky basement, computer equipment
had to be hoisted onto 8-inch-high platforms in case of sudden
flooding. Upstairs, workers are demolishing a backstage shower to
make room for the cast of 37 to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Things weren't much better at the Roundabout, where technicians
for ``Little Me'' hauled gear in the front door, up a pokey
escalator and into the theater's crammed main stage. ``This is
about two and a half times larger than anything we've ever done,''
said Ellen Richard, the Roundabout's general manager. ``We're
really pushing the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal challenge was a balky 33-foot-wide turntable used
to shift scenes. ``We've managed to get it to jog right and left,
but it still isn't coordinated,'' said Michael Curry, the theater's
production manager.
</P>
<P>
   The official opening for ``Little Me'' has been delayed two
weeks, until Nov. 12. The producers for ``Footloose'' insisted they
would make their scheduled Oct. 22 opening. Each show could lose at
least $100,000 in sales for the canceled previews.
</P>
<P>
   Michael David, a ``Footloose'' producer, played down the delay,
which follows mediocre reviews in Washington and the recasting of a
central role: ``What some people call trouble is what we call doing
our work.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit, but ...
</P>
<P>
   If Broadway is stumbling, off-Broadway is sprinting, with five
shows opening in the next week.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more surprising entries is ``Duet! A Romantic
Fable,'' opening on Tuesday at the Actor's Playhouse. The show, an
off-off-Broadway hit for the Adobe Theater Company last fall, has
been moved with the financial backing of a major Broadway player,
Dodger Endemol Productions, known for musicals like ``Titanic''
and, yes, ``Footloose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just really like these kids,'' David said of Adobe. (Maybe
it's the small set.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite a $190,000 budget, the production remains low-key, with
beer sold from a cooler before shows and after-show parties on the
set. But tickets for the 75-minute play now run $45, with Tuesday
night tickets discounted to $19.98.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the higher prices square with the Adobe's mission
statement, which derides ``prohibitively expensive'' theater, the
artistic director, Jeremy Dobrish, said: ``We don't see this as an
opportunity for a profit. We're just rewarding the people who made
this happen, like the actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Family Business
</P>
<P>
   Writers examining their families are nothing new, but in
``Hesh,'' a Naked Angels production that opened on Sunday at the
Intar Theater, the formula is being given an intriguing twist.
</P>
<P>
   The play, by Matthew Weiss, tells the story of two brothers and
their father, a wisecracking ne'er-do-well. The catch? Weiss, 33,
portrays the older sibling, while the younger brother is played by
his younger brother, 30-year-old Marcus Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   The play's plot also hews closely to the Weiss family history.
The character Hesh is based on Harvey Weiss, a concert promoter who
suffered from a bad leg and a drug problem. Also true to life is
the sons' separation from and attempted reconciliation with their
father, who is played by Ned Eisenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest Weiss never saw the play; he died of cancer in 1996.
But shortly before his death, the brothers read the script to him.
``He kept closing his eyes and shaking his head,'' said Matthew.
``He didn't like to remember some of the things. But he laughed a
lot, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Gosh!
</P>
<P>
   In the ongoing hunt for the theme of the fall season, another
contender has emerged: spoofing the sacred. In addition to ``Corpus
Christi,'' two other productions involve sensitive religious
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The first, ``The Cardinal Detoxes,'' by Thomas M. Disch, a poet,
is a 35-minute monologue about an archbishop who has killed a woman
while driving drunk. In 1990, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New
York demanded that a production of the play stop performances at a
church-owned building in the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the play was remounted by the Worth Street Theater
Company at the TriBeCa Playhouse. Jeff Cohen, the director of both
productions, said the restaging was not a stunt to attract
attention. ``This really is political theater,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Zwilling, the spokesman for the archdiocese, said his
office had received no calls about the show.
</P>
<P>
   On a less weighty note, there's ``The Most Fabulous Story Ever
Told,'' Paul Rudnick's new comedy about a gay couple in Eden _ Adam
and Steve _ due to begin performances at New York Theater Workshop
in November. Don Summa, a spokesman for the show, said the theater
had received no complaints. ``We're Old Testament,'' he said. ``We
figure we're safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ The Classic Stage Company's coming production of ``Waiting for
Godot,'' with John Turturro and Tony Shalhoub, just got quirkier.
Christopher Lloyd, perhaps best known as oddball Jim Ignatowski on
the television series ``Taxi,'' has been signed to play Pozzo, the
clown. The show opens Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Joseph Papp Public Theater has another opening to
announce: Joe's Pub, a bar and restaurant on the theater's ground
floor. The bar's inaugural act, on Oct. 12, will be Audra McDonald,
the three-time Tony winner.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frost will cover patches of the landscape from the western Great
Lakes to the northern Ohio Valley on Friday morning. High pressure
stretching from Manitoba to West Virginia will promote mainly
sunny, but very cool conditions in the Northeast quarter of the
nation, with afternoon temperatures mostly in the 50s and 60s. A
pool of very cold air at 15,000 feet over western New England will
cause clouds and a few showers to develop in the hilly terrain.
Brisk breezes from the northwest will gust over 25 miles an hour in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Drier and cooler air will circulate into the Southeast behind a
stalled front in the Gulf states. A few thundershowers will attend
the front in northern Florida and southern Georgia. High pressure
in the central Gulf of Mexico will direct very warm and humid air
into the southern Plains and lower Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   As sultry air pushes northward into the Plains, it will be
further lifted by a strong jet stream disturbance over Nebraska and
the result will be widespread clouds and showers. A cold rain will
dampen the lower Missouri Valley with showers developing farther
north. Several strong thunderstorms may form in west-central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A wedge of warm, dry air will cover the Southwest. More chilly,
moist air will sweep into the Northwest behind a strengthening cold
front in the northern Rockies. Showers will fall from the Cascades
to the coast. Gusty winds will accompany showers in the
Bitterroots. The central Rockies should notice increasing clouds as
the front approaches.

   Rainfall at Mobile, Ala., totaled 24.12 inches in last month,
marking the city's wettest September on record. The previous mark
for September rainfall was 15.5 inches, set in 1913. Moreover,
September's total was 18.21 inches above the average for the month.
Such inflated rainfalls along the Gulf Coast in September can only
occur when tropical systems are involved. During September, the
tropical trio of Hurricane Georges, Hurricane Earl and Tropical
Storm Hermine each dumped substantial rains on Mobile, boosting
last month's total to its highest total in 85 years. &QL;

WHY WASHINGTON IS STUCK ON FLYTRAP 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone in Washington has a theory about why we are frothing
about a scandal that no one else much cares about.
</P>
<P>
   I have counted at least 20 of them, speculation about everything
from Washington's innate prudery to its unconscious desire for
parliamentary government.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the theories, or at least most of the convincing ones,
fall into one of five categories, presented here in ascending order
of relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Law: In a recent National Journal article, Jonathan Rauch makes
the case that Washington's Flytrap rage partly stems from our legal
culture. The majority of D.C.'s opinion elite, I would bet, holds
law degrees, and legalism is the city's lingua franca. This makes
D.C. especially susceptible to Flytrap, because the scandal looks
worse to lawyers than to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lied under oath: In legalistic D.C., that is more than
enough cause to damn him. The rest of the country, which doesn't
share our legal fixation, has the good sense to recognize that some
kinds of lies (even under oath) are more innocent than others.
</P>
<P>
   Moral One-Upmanship: In its soul, Washington is no more upset
about adultery and fooling around with interns than the rest of the
country is. But we are extremely sensitive to charges of moral
laxity: We're terrified of being depicted as licentious, godless
hedonists who tolerate a Caligula. So we fake outrage, certifying
our moral credentials by acting holier than thou.
</P>
<P>
   Geography: Or, rather, proximity. At a distance, the Clinton of
Flytrap is an everyday sinner. But at a pore's-eye view, with six
years of his lies fresh in your memory, he seems pathologically
manipulative, deceptive, and sex-crazed. The more we learned about
Flytrap--cigars, phone calls, etc.--the worse he seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Furthurmore, elite Washington, by virtue of proximity to
Clinton, takes Flytrap personally. Outside the Beltway, no one
knows who John Podesta is or cares that Clinton lied to him. But in
Washington, Clinton's lies to aides were a slap, a betrayal of one
of us.
</P>
<P>
   Economics: Flytrap serves Washington's economic self-interest.
As Watergate made the careers of scores of pols and journalists, so
investigative reporters (Michael Isikoff), editorial writers
(Howell Raines), pundits (you name 'em), and politicians (any
Republican on the House Judiciary Committee) have hitched their
wagons to Flytrap. Hence, we have every incentive to keep the tar
boiling.
</P>
<P>
   Sociology: The least appreciated reason for D.C.'s Clinton mania
is the city's peculiar social organization. Nicholas Lemann, who's
writing a book on elites, argues that Washington in the '90s is
America in the '50s. The rest of the nation has become
entrepreneurial and individualistic, but Washington, says Lemann,
is still home to the organization man. In D.C., we work for big
institutions, believe in them, and expect wisdom from the smart,
honorable people who rise to the top of them. By Washington's
standard, then, Clinton's greatest crime is not that he lied or
leched. It is that he shamed our institution. If government and the
presidency are embarrassed, then we are diminished. Our self-worth
depends on the worth of our institution.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans, fortunately, couldn't care less. They are too
busy getting and spending for themselves to worry much about the
respectability of Clinton and the strength of his organization.
It's not their institution that's being disgraced. It's not their
loyalty that's being tested. It's not their problem.

GREENSPAN'S UNSURPRISING MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At some point in the last couple of weeks, it became a foregone
conclusion that the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee would
announce an interest-rate cut Tuesday afternoon. In fact, it became
such a foregone conclusion that investors began speculating
about--and in some cases anticipating--that the rate cut would not
be a mere quarter-point cut, but rather a half-point cut. Hopes of
that probably contributed to a run-up in stock prices Tuesday, and
to a more generally bullish tone on the Street in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes were, of course, dashed at 2:15 p.m., when the FOMC
announced that, as expected, it would be trimming the Fed Funds
rate by a quarter point.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for the half-point cut were essentially idle ones, since
Greenspan's reputation for caution is well-deserved and since the
Fed remains populated by inflation hawks, even in these
deflationary times.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, there was an unhealthy undertone to much of
the pleading for a larger rate cut. This undertone suggested that
the Fed would be well-served to give U.S. stock prices a boost in
these turbulent times, and that a half-point cut would send the
signal that the bull could resume its run.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Greenspan has no interest in propping up still
historically-high stock valuations, and the dreams of a rate-cut
rally smacked of the lamest sort of pie-in-the-sky thinking.
</P>
<P>
   From one angle, in fact, if the Fed had instituted a half-point
cut (or if it had cut the discount rate instead of the Fed Funds
rate), investors would have a better reason to sell than with the
quarter-point cut. A half-point cut, after all, would have been a
sign that the Fed thought real trouble was just around the corner,
and that only a flood of credit into the economy could save it from
recession.
</P>
<P>
   What the quarter-point cut sends instead is the message that
we've grown accustomed to Greenspan sending: Things are dicier than
they've been, but the United States is still in good shape. It's a
message you can disagree with, but it's not a message anyone should
have been surprised to hear.

HOWARD STERN IS OBSOLETE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JEFFREY GOLDBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past year, I've learned three new things about Howard
Stern: He's possibly the tallest Jew in the world; he carries a
gun; and, as a cultural phenomenon, he is very much over.
</P>
<P>
   For this last, most pertinent, fact, he has the Office of the
Independent Counsel to thank.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's new TV program, ``The Howard Stern Radio Show,'' which
appears Saturday nights on an ever-shrinking number of CBS-owned
and affiliated stations, is a nonstarter. (Two stations--one in
Arizona and one in Texas--have dropped the Stern show since it
premiered Aug. 26, citing offensiveness. Its ratings hover just
above zero.)
</P>
<P>
   The show's problems go deeper than bad writing or crappy
production values. Imagine watching Lenny Bruce perform in 1990.
That's what it's like listening to Stern today. He was the Vasco da
Gama of porn radio, a man who sailed fearlessly into the uncharted
sea of lesbian mud wrestling and jigaboo jokes. He was--and this
seems so quaint--enemy No. 1 of the Federal Communications
Commission and of middle America.
</P>
<P>
   But time has passed him by. What Starr can say, Stern can't. Now
that the insertion of cigars into female genitalia is a
prosecutable offense, sex is no longer funny. And if sex is no
longer funny, Stern is no longer funny.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's technique is to bully second-tier celebrities into
revealing embarrassing facts about their sex lives; Starr's
technique is to bully Starr-created celebrities into revealing
embarrassing facts about their sex lives in exchange for
transactional immunity. It is the promise of immunity, I think,
that makes Starr's interviews so much more raunchy.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the Clinton deposition videotape aired, I
watched on tape this exchange between Stern and a woman named
Kendra, described by Stern as ``the chick in the tabloids who slept
with Jerry Springer'':
</P>
<P>
   Stern: You grabbed his crotch?
</P>
<P>
   Kendra: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Stern: Over his pants?
</P>
<P>
   Kendra: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Stern: You didn't put your hand down his pants?
</P>
<P>
   Kendra: Yes, I did.
</P>
<P>
   Stern: Oh, that's so sexy. You are a bad girl. ... Did he put
his hand under your dress?
</P>
<P>
   Kendra: Yeah, I think so.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an exchange between President Clinton and a member of
Starr's staff, Solomon Wisenberg (far too weighty a name for a man
engaged in such bawdy proceedings):
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg: The question is, if Monica Lewinsky says that while
you were in the Oval Office area you touched her breasts, would she
be lying?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton: That is not my recollection ...
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg: If she said that you kissed her breasts, would she be
lying?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton: I'm going to revert to my former statement.
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg: OK. If Monica Lewinsky says that while you were in
the Oval Office area you touched her genitalia, would she be lying?
And that calls for a yes, no, or reverting to your former
statement.
</P>
<P>
   And so on.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw of Stern's show is not that it's offensive but that
it's boring. The problem is apparent early on: It's impossible to
listen to Stern in a stationary position. Like many bands--have you
ever tried to listen to Aerosmith in your living room?--Stern can
really only be enjoyed while driving or doing something else, like
washing your car.
</P>
<P>
   But about the gun, which brings us to the outmoded idea that
Stern is a dangerous force in society:
</P>
<P>
   Early this spring, while I was transacting a piece of
journalistic business at New York Police Department headquarters,
the police commissioner, Howard Safir, asked me if I wanted to meet
Stern. I was raised on Long Island, and the only island celebrity I
had previously met was Dee Snider from the band Twisted Sister, so
how could I say no to Stern?
</P>
<P>
   There was quite a buzz of anticipation running through police
headquarters--New York City cops, particularly those residing on
Long and Staten islands, make up the hardest core of Stern's fans.
But police brass, like most conservative, middle-aged men, tend to
</P>
<P>
   view Stern as a subversive force worthy of surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I say to this guy?'' the commissioner asked me, as if
I should know. It turned out that Safir was only vaguely aware of
Stern's mission, which was to thank the NYPD for renewing his gun
license.
</P>
<P>
   Stern was escorted into the commissioner's office, and the two
men shook hands. Stern looked, not to put too fine a point on it,
dirty, and I noticed that Safir steered him clear of the shiny oak
desk once used by Teddy Roosevelt. I also noticed that Stern is
incredibly tall, taller even than Safir, who was, at that point,
the tallest Jew I thought I had ever met. Height, a first name and
a tribe are all they had in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you get your license?'' Safir asked Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good. No one can blame me,'' Safir said, and you know he meant
it.
</P>
<P>
   Stern was rattled: ``I get all nervous around here. Lot of
cops,'' he told the commissioner. Stern explained that fear of
unstable fans had led him to seek a gun permit. They talked for
another minute, and then Stern escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the elevator, the commissioner said, ``I half expected
that guy to show up in handcuffs,'' and he was serious. I could
tell that Safir, like many other adults, misinterprets Stern's role
in society. Stern is not a subversive but a clown, and a tired
clown at that. To him, sex is a joke. The real subversives are
those who use sex to destroy people's lives. Howard Stern can't
compete with that.

PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW: THE EROTIC AS ANOTHER SORT OF WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For her unflinching portraits of people caught in the
savage ``little'' wars of the last 20 years, notably in Central
America, the Magnum photographer Susan Meiselas has won many of the
top prizes awarded members of her profession, including the
Overseas Press Club's Robert Capa Gold Medal in 1979 (for ``best
published photographic reporting from abroad requiring exceptional
courage and enterprise'') and a MacArthur fellowship in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bracketing her war photography are two little-known projects,
and photographs from them are on view at the Leica Gallery in Soho.
In the early 1970s, she spent three summers photographing strippers
at rural New England fairs. Then, over three weeks of 16-hour days
in 1995, she photographed the women who worked at Pandora's Box in
Manhattan, a self-styled ``Disneyland of Domination,'' and the
well-heeled men who frequented it.
</P>
<P>
   Strip joints and domination palaces are their kind of war zone.
All three have long been the subjects of photographers, but as Ms.
Meiselas does with her pictures of war, she brings a special
sensibility to her portraits of strippers and dominatrixes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their high esthetics, the pictures are
ideologically and emotionally complex, leaving the viewer to figure
out what Ms. Meiselas' point of view might be. One aspect of her
photography is never ambiguous. Like Larry Burrows in his pictures
of the Vietnam War for Life magazine, Ms. Meiselas insists on
seeing people as people, no matter where they find themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that her pictures are easy to look at.
</P>
<P>
   Superficially, her black-and-white photographs of carnival
strippers offer a painful look at women (few with fine physiques)
who bare all in cheesy, cramped settings. There are the usual male
barkers, men counting money and men grabbing at the strippers
onstage. But Ms. Meiselas manages a subtle visual sleight of hand
when she shows an audience's amazement at a stripper's removing her
clothes, quite as though she had done something magical.
</P>
<P>
   In this, her first photographic project, Ms. Meiselas' signature
artful reporting is very much in evidence. In ``Lulu and Debbie,
Tunbridge, Vt., 1974,'' a seated woman, cigarette in hand and
biting her lower lip, seems a world away from a woman next to her
who is drawing aside a dirty curtain and about to show her naked
form. In the triangular space between the curtain and the wall is a
glimpse of the audience, a young man in the front row looking
expectantly at the emerging figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lena, Barton, Vt., 1974'' is deceptively innocent. In the
foreground and in deep shadow are men's backs. In the background is
a valentinelike tableau, the spotlight falling on a young woman
with short blond hair and a fragile face standing against a stage
backdrop of bold diagonal lines and twin hearts pierced with an
arrow.
</P>
<P>
   The most singular images in the stripper series are two nude
studies that are compositionally classical and gritty versions of a
Rubens or a Matisse _ portraits of women with less-than-perfect
bodies who are comfortable in their skin.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Returning Backstage, Essex Junction, Vt., 1973,'' Ms.
Meiselas catches a stripper stepping over a naked woman stretched
out on the floor. Behind the upright woman is a dirty curtain, to
one side of which is a wooden wall with patterns that form an
unexpected and striking modernist abstraction. In ``Between Shows,
Fryeburg, Me., 1975,'' torsos frame a seated young woman with a
thin wrap around her hunched shoulders and a sublime Mona Lisa hint
of a smile on her face.
</P>
<P>
   Taken almost 20 years later, Ms. Meiselas' ``Pandora's Box''
series in deep, rich colors could be read as hard-edged
post-modernism that is in line with Cindy Sherman's increasingly
unappetizing photographic personas and Nan Goldin's portraits of
the downtown drug milieu.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meiselas was told about Pandora's Box by a film director who
knew of her ``Carnival Strippers'' series, and her photographs show
a ``fantasy land'' with rooms full of ersatz period furnishings and
dungeonlike places with vaguely sinister torture racks and cells.
Men in grotesque costumes, usually with leather masks over their
heads, submit to various ``tortures'' by women in black fetish wear
and impossibly high heels.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meiselas' impeccable eye takes in a client in a black suit
seated on a black sofa in a room with maroon walls and carpeting, a
blue door keeping his face from view. Another client's chest is
bared, his head encased in a black mask with spikes at the crown.
His medieval torture-chamber presence is starkly at odds with the
seemingly opulent scene behind him, with its red-and-gold
carpeting, gold curtains and a large painting of a naked woman with
cupids. A dominatrix in a silver ensemble is seated nonchalantly on
a gold upholstered chair set on a raised marble platform.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men, who pay large sums to be humiliated or tortured
or both, are masked. In ``Foot Worship, the Role Play Room,
Pandora's Box, New York, 1995,'' only the client's eyes are visible
through the mask, and they are bloodshot, their expression one of
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Photographing at Pandora's Box, Ms. Meiselas said, gave her
nightmares. As she photographed men who chose the weapons and
duration of torture, images from Central America ricocheted through
her head, images of Nicaraguans and Salvadorans who were tortured
and who had no choice in the matter. The artificial dungeons in
Pandora's Box, she said, revived memories of prison cells in
Nicaragua and El Salvador and people bearing the dreadful scars of
torture.
</P>
<P>
   As she never did when she photographed the carnival strippers,
Ms. Meiselas seemed at times to avert her uncompromising gaze at
Pandora's Box. With these pictures of trussed-up men, of men in
fright masks and women's clothes or with shorts pulled down around
the legs, her mind seems to have gone into suspension while the
camera clicked away, and the results veer uncomfortably toward the
promotional.
</P>
<P>
   When she appears fully engaged, the images are extraordinary. In
two photographs that have a certain Mistress Delilah in them, Ms.
Meiselas first shows her laughing at a tied-up cross-dresser. But
in ``Solitaire and Delilah, the Dressing Room, Pandora's Box, New
York, 1995,'' a different face emerges. Here, a dominatrix in full
regalia, leather mask and all, takes up one side of the frame; on
the other side is Delilah looking utterly spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan Meiselas, Intimate Strangers: Carnival Strippers
1972-75, Pandora's Box, 1995'' remains at the Leica Gallery, 670
Broadway, at Prince Street, Soho, through Oct. 24.

`THE GENERAL': A SLY THIEF AND ALL THAT HE PLUNDERED

<P>
   No doubt John Boorman's canny, elegant new film ``The General,''
about the notorious Irish thief Martin Cahill, hits unusually close
to home for the filmmaker. The real Cahill actually DID hit
Boorman's home some years ago, and he stole the gold record that
had been awarded the director for ``Dueling Banjos,'' from
``Deliverance.'' Now Boorman has his chance to return the favor,
and what a chance it is. He tells this tale of an Irish underworld
original with an unerring instinct for the captivating detail. And
he presents this film (photographed by Seamus Deasy) in such
seductively beautiful black and white that it has the visual
precision of a photo essay. The black-and-white tones (shot on
color stock) are so rich that the ski masks of burglars wind up
looking like velvet.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman begins this story, a much more familiar one in Ireland
than it is in the United States, with the brutal end of Cahill's
career. (He died in 1994, caught not by the police who had dogged
him for years but by the Provisional IRA.) He then deftly traces
the basis for Cahill's formidable reputation. Nicknamed after
General Douglas MacArthur, he showed a taste for larceny at an
early age (and is played as a boy fleetingly by Eamon Owens, fiery
young star of ``The Butcher Boy''). Cahill's biographer, Paul
Williams, maintains that when Cahill tried to enlist in the Navy at
15, in 1964, and filled out an application: ``Martin chose the
position of bugler. Unfortunately, due to his difficulties in
school, he misread the word as `burglar.''' Somehow a star criminal
was born.
</P>
<P>
   Always fascinated and sometimes aghast, ``The General'' watches
Martin develop his trademark style. As played magnificently by
Brendan Gleeson, who bears an amazing resemblance to the real
Cahill, he had a modus operandi often bordering on pure mischief.
Cahill went to such great lengths to hide his face from public view
that he is most often seen in photographs hiding inside the hood of
a ski parka. He presided over an unusual two-house domestic
arrangement that involved both his wife (Maria Doyle Kennedy) and
her sister, Tina (Angeline Ball), presented here as understanding
and even understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most films based on true stories whose real participants
are alive, well and legally represented, ``The General'' doesn't
seem to pull its punches about its surviving characters. Boorman,
working in top form with a keenly acerbic overview, has written the
film so sharply that the facts speak well for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   With his police nemesis, Inspector Ned Kenny, beautifully
embodied by Jon Voight as a staunch, weary Javert who knows all
Cahill's tricks, Cahill becomes for Boorman a figure of compelling
controversy as well as a source of great crime tales. So the beauty
of a jewel heist, which is presented here in all its crafty
planning, is carefully placed in the shadow of its larger
implications.
</P>
<P>
   As Kenny tells Cahill, he may be a smart thief but he has put
100 employees at the jewelry company out of work. In one of the
film's most startling juxtapositions, Cahill punishes one of his
own men so savagely that the act becomes part of his legend. Then
he takes this same man to a hospital, having decided that the
punishment was unwarranted. Boorman's great skill in unifying ``The
General'' lies in creating a big, blustery, most unlikely hero
whose nature so easily embraces both these extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky crime sequences here are especially well staged, and make
fine use of Cahill's rampant contradictions. The most brazen (and
famous) of these found Cahill playing the art lover, and with his
band of henchmen spiriting off a cache of treasures, including a
Vermeer, offering their own priceless opinions about the artwork,
and carefully leaving the ``Please Do Not Touch'' sign undisturbed.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Any veteran of a theatrical load-in, the installation
of a production, will tell you the experience is commonly known as
``tech hell.'' But for two Broadway shows, the past week has been
especially abysmal.
</P>
<P>
   Producers for ``Footloose'' and ``Little Me'' both announced
this week that their first previews would be delayed for several
days because of ``technical difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Richard Rodgers Theater, a 40-member crew for
``Footloose'' was struggling to find space in the slim backstage
area for 16 tractor-trailers' worth of equipment shipped from the
musical's tryout at the Kennedy Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kennedy is literally 13 or 14 times as deep as this
theater,'' said Peter Fulbright, the show's technical supervisor.
``It's like putting a 10-pound show in a 5-pound box.''
</P>
<P>
   In the theater's occasionally leaky basement, computer equipment
had to be hoisted onto 8-inch-high platforms in case of sudden
flooding. Upstairs, workers are demolishing a backstage shower to
make room for the cast of 37 to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Things weren't much better at the Roundabout, where technicians
for ``Little Me'' hauled gear in the front door, up a pokey
escalator and into the theater's crammed main stage. ``This is
about two and a half times larger than anything we've ever done,''
said Ellen Richard, the Roundabout's general manager. ``We're
really pushing the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal challenge was a balky 33-foot-wide turntable used
to shift scenes. ``We've managed to get it to jog right and left,
but it still isn't coordinated,'' said Michael Curry, the theater's
production manager.
</P>
<P>
   The official opening for ``Little Me'' has been delayed two
weeks, until Nov. 12. The producers for ``Footloose'' insisted they
would make their scheduled Oct. 22 opening. Each show could lose at
least $100,000 in sales for the canceled previews.
</P>
<P>
   Michael David, a ``Footloose'' producer, played down the delay,
which follows mediocre reviews in Washington and the recasting of a
central role: ``What some people call trouble is what we call doing
our work.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit, but ...
</P>
<P>
   If Broadway is stumbling, off-Broadway is sprinting, with five
shows opening in the next week.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more surprising entries is ``Duet! A Romantic
Fable,'' opening on Tuesday at the Actor's Playhouse. The show, an
off-off-Broadway hit for the Adobe Theater Company last fall, has
been moved with the financial backing of a major Broadway player,
Dodger Endemol Productions, known for musicals like ``Titanic''
and, yes, ``Footloose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just really like these kids,'' David said of Adobe. (Maybe
it's the small set.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite a $190,000 budget, the production remains low-key, with
beer sold from a cooler before shows and after-show parties on the
set. But tickets for the 75-minute play now run $45, with Tuesday
night tickets discounted to $19.98.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the higher prices square with the Adobe's mission
statement, which derides ``prohibitively expensive'' theater, the
artistic director, Jeremy Dobrish, said: ``We don't see this as an
opportunity for a profit. We're just rewarding the people who made
this happen, like the actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Family Business
</P>
<P>
   Writers examining their families are nothing new, but in
``Hesh,'' a Naked Angels production that opened on Sunday at the
Intar Theater, the formula is being given an intriguing twist.
</P>
<P>
   The play, by Matthew Weiss, tells the story of two brothers and
their father, a wisecracking ne'er-do-well. The catch? Weiss, 33,
portrays the older sibling, while the younger brother is played by
his younger brother, 30-year-old Marcus Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   The play's plot also hews closely to the Weiss family history.
The character Hesh is based on Harvey Weiss, a concert promoter who
suffered from a bad leg and a drug problem. Also true to life is
the sons' separation from and attempted reconciliation with their
father, who is played by Ned Eisenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest Weiss never saw the play; he died of cancer in 1996.
But shortly before his death, the brothers read the script to him.
``He kept closing his eyes and shaking his head,'' said Matthew.
``He didn't like to remember some of the things. But he laughed a
lot, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Gosh!
</P>
<P>
   In the ongoing hunt for the theme of the fall season, another
contender has emerged: spoofing the sacred. In addition to ``Corpus
Christi,'' two other productions involve sensitive religious
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The first, ``The Cardinal Detoxes,'' by Thomas M. Disch, a poet,
is a 35-minute monologue about an archbishop who has killed a woman
while driving drunk. In 1990, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New
York demanded that a production of the play stop performances at a
church-owned building in the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the play was remounted by the Worth Street Theater
Company at the TriBeCa Playhouse. Jeff Cohen, the director of both
productions, said the restaging was not a stunt to attract
attention. ``This really is political theater,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Zwilling, the spokesman for the archdiocese, said his
office had received no calls about the show.
</P>
<P>
   On a less weighty note, there's ``The Most Fabulous Story Ever
Told,'' Paul Rudnick's new comedy about a gay couple in Eden _ Adam
and Steve _ due to begin performances at New York Theater Workshop
in November. Don Summa, a spokesman for the show, said the theater
had received no complaints. ``We're Old Testament,'' he said. ``We
figure we're safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ The Classic Stage Company's coming production of ``Waiting for
Godot,'' with John Turturro and Tony Shalhoub, just got quirkier.
Christopher Lloyd, perhaps best known as oddball Jim Ignatowski on
the television series ``Taxi,'' has been signed to play Pozzo, the
clown. The show opens Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Joseph Papp Public Theater has another opening to
announce: Joe's Pub, a bar and restaurant on the theater's ground
floor. The bar's inaugural act, on Oct. 12, will be Audra McDonald,
the three-time Tony winner.

(Jonathan Rosen is culture editor of The Forward and the author of
the novel ``Eve's Apple.'') 
 By JONATHAN ROSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not long ago, I stood in Straus Square, a little
island in the middle of East Broadway, paying my respects to the
Forward building, which will soon be converted into condominiums.
At 10 stories, it's still the tallest thing on the block, though
imprisoned by scaffolding so that I had to cross all the way to
Seward Park and peer up to see the enormous rust-red letters still
spelling out the name ``FORVERTS'' in Yiddish at the top of the
building. I had to come closer to make out the four faces _ Karl
Marx, Friedrich Engels, Karl Liebknecht and Ferdinand Lassalle _
looking out in humorless relief above the entrance, like gargoyles
meant to scare away superstition and the imprisoning past to which
they now themselves belong.
</P>
<P>
   I have been told that the Chinese characters that have been
added to the building's facade, by the nondenominational church
that now operates there, declare that ``Jesus Saves,'' which must
infuriate the four terra cotta heroes of European socialism, not to
mention the ghosts of old Forward staffers whose secular, socialist
passions left them, despite a strong sense of peoplehood,
ambivalent about religion of any sort. To add insult to injury, I
myself have come to the Lower East Side not to visit the building
that once housed the Jewish Daily Forward but to take a tour of the
Eldridge Street Synagogue, a five-minute walk away. But having
taken the F train to the East Broadway stop near the newspaper
building, I am drawn to it and find it difficult to pull away.
</P>
<P>
   I should confess at this point that despite the requisite Hebrew
school trip, many visits in later life and at least one walking
tour, the Lower East Side has always been an emblem not only of
topographical confusion (I don't do well where streets are named,
not numbered), but also of a larger sort of confusion. I've never
been sure what, if any, relationship the neighborhood has to me. (I
understand this is a Jewish problem. I never find myself wondering
what relationship SoHo or TriBeCa have to me.) But on the walk west
along Canal to get to Eldridge, I pass streets whose very names _
Essex and Orchard and even the once-sinister Allen, where the El
and the prostitutes were _ sing with a certain suggestion of
meaning, even if I'm not quite sure what that meaning is. This
neighborhood was once so crowded with Jews _ in 1895, its
population density was second only to that of Bombay _ that their
lingering impression seems to have rubbed itself into the very
stones as well as the larger culture. There are even tenements on
East Broadway, designed by the Herter brothers (who built the
Eldridge Street Synagogue), that are engraved with Jewish stars.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I have what may be an American-born, suburban-bred
resentment of the way writers have used the Lower East Side, and
neighborhoods like it, as touchstones of Jewish authenticity _ as
if to be an immigrant was to be most fully Jewish, with all later
generations merely representing the diminution of a primordial
state. But the truth is, so many of the contradictions of Jewish
life were carved in stone here that the Lower East Side has a sort
of irresistible allegorical feel, so much so that when I wrote my
novel ``Eve's Apple,'' I had my narrator, who is obsessed with
immigrants, get lost as he roams the area _ a dislocated,
sentimental soul-seeking connection.
</P>
<P>
   But connection to what? Ambivalence is virtually baked into the
Lower East Side, where the urge to preserve old ways and the wish
to throw them off, to make a home and to run away are still felt. I
cannot speak for the Chinese immigrants who now fill the
neighborhood with bursting vitality, but it was certainly true of
the Jews who once lived here. One has only to read one of I .B.
Singer's American novels _ serialized in The Forward _ to
experience the multiple impulses to belong and to remain different.
Singer hung out, along with Yiddish poets and leftists and
journalists, at the Garden Cafeteria _ now the Wing Shoon diner _
at East Broadway and Rutgers, just down the street from the Forward
building. One can imagine the debates about the future, about
Communism and Socialism, American capitalism and the death of
religion, conducted in Yiddish, the-thousand-year-old language of
the Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   The debates have changed, but at their core will always remain a
tension in some sense embodied by the newspaper and the synagogue.
One institution preached redemption through politics, the other
left messianic rectification of the world to God. Which brings me
to Eldridge Street and the grand, beautiful, dilapidated synagogue
between Canal and Division, which, like the Forward building, now
lives behind scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1887 to rival the elegant Reform synagogues uptown, the
Orthodox Eldridge Street Synagogue was the first house of worship
in America built by Eastern European immigrants. Its founders were
the sort of capitalists railed against by The Forward: Isaac Gellis
(the hot dog man) and Sandor Jarmulowsky, whose high-rise bank
still stands on Canal Street a few blocks from the Forward
building. Nevertheless, many of the 1,000 worshipers who packed
into the sanctuary during High Holiday services were working-class
immigrants, experiencing a taste of Old World religious grandeur
financed by American capitalist zeal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The two buildings are in some sense physical emblems of opposite
impulses. The narrow, towering Forward building _ once topped by an
electric sign _ thrust itself into the New York skyline, a symbol
of progress, a beacon to workingmen and women eager to master the
ways of American society and to improve that society with their
political passions. Crowned with a large clock, it was a building
by which one literally told time. The Western facade of the
Eldridge Street Synagogue presents the visitor with a gigantic rose
window, fashioned of 12 interlocking circles, a clock telling only
eternal time. Inside, the soaring walls and ceiling, painted in
part with a false sky and stars, suggest the wish for a world
apart. The upstairs gallery for women, the rich dark wood, the
Moorish windows of stained glass, the hanging brass chandeliers,
were evocative of any place but America.
</P>
<P>
   The opulent interior has taken a terrible beating, but if
anything the power of the place has only been enhanced by the
passage of time. The building reflects the slow decay of a
dwindling community but suggests as well something much more sudden
and dramatic _ a kind of Pompeian calamity. What in fact happened
was that in the 1950s, the depleted congregation simply locked the
doors of the main sanctuary and took up permanent residence in the
basement, where services continue to attract about 25 worshipers on
the Sabbath, a number that doubles on the holidays. In the 1970s, a
scholar and tour leader unlocked the doors, gaping up at the
70-foot, rain-ruined ceiling where pigeons roosted in the women's
section.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Eldridge Street Project has spent some $3
million stabilizing the building and hopes to raise some $5 million
more to complete the renovations. Fortunately, the sanctuary still
has about it a state of half-forgotten reality, like a dream the
basement sometimes had about the grand upstairs world and the days
when Cantor Yossele Rosenblatt prayed on the High Holidays and
mounted policemen patrolled Eldridge Street to control the crowds
and the young Eddie Cantor (who lived at 19 Eldridge St.) sang in
the choir. There is also an added poignancy in the knowledge that
so many of the European synagogues that inspired the Eldridge
Street Synagogue were destroyed in the Holocaust; what was once
merely the echo now seems the lonely voice itself.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is clear that the rose windows and other
architectural flourishes were as much intended to make the
synagogue a competitive counterpart to Christian churches as to
evoke Old World Orthodoxy. Now, however, the patched and peeling
walls and ceiling, the grand windows plugged with factory glass,
the chandeliers merely implied by dangling ropes, the refurbished
Ten Commandments above the ark (which had been reduced to five
until a local workman carved another tablet), all give the space a
sort of post-modern contemporaneity, perfectly suited to its new
use as a place for readings and exhibits. In the same way the empty
Forward building, with its landmark status, its Yiddish and
Chinese, its 20th-century aspirations and 19th-century heroes, is a
sort of palimpsest more complicated than its once monolithic facade
conveyed.
</P>
<P>
   It's these unexpected reversals that make the neighborhood so
complex and so appealing and, I realize, give it its enduring
relevance. In its own way, the Eldridge Street Synagogue was a
modern enterprise: its first rabbi wanted to incorporate English in
the service to encourage participation. The Forward, for all its
secularism, had a weekly commentary on the Torah portion for years.
The newspaper, a Lower East Side fixture, moved uptown in the 1970s
and, despite its Yiddishist origins, created the English newspaper
where I work. Though a traditional congregation still prays in the
basement of the Eldridge Street Synagogue, it is dedicating its
renovated sanctuary to cultural programs, one of which is even
called the Garden Cafeteria, named for the old hangout that once
thrived next to The Forward.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense it may be a blessing that, at the end of the century,
some of the starker distinctions bred by early immigrant struggles
at the beginning of the century have grown less keen. Neither the
newspaper nor the synagogue has established hegemony in America and
that is perhaps a good thing.

 &HT;    PENTAGON BILL FOR VIAGRA: $50 MILLION
 &HT;    By RUSSELL CAROLLO and JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The Department of Defense will spend an estimated
$50 million this year to provide Viagra, the new drug for sexual
impotence, to soldiers, sailors, flyers, retirees and their
dependents.
</P>
<P>
   Defense health officials said an original cost estimate, based
on the number of requests for Viagra the department was receiving
at military clinics and hospitals, was $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The figure was pared to $50 million _ roughly equivalent to the
cost of three F-15 Air Force fighters or 15 Army Blackhawk
helicopters _ after the Defense Office of Health Affairs restricted
prescriptions to men who suffer from a diagnosed disorder, penile
erectile dysfunction, and ruled that no user could get more than
six pills a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of money,'' said Marianne Coates, a Pentagon
spokeswoman, adding that the actual cost ``could be higher. It
could be lower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are, in fact, people who suffer from clinical
dysfunction,'' she added, and people who want simply to have a
``good time'' will not get the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, John Mazzuchi, deputy assistant
secretary of defense for health affairs, cited the anticipated
Viagra expense as an example of the problems involved in planning
health care costs for the military.
</P>
<P>
   When the Defense Department's budget for health costs was being
written last year, Viagra did not exist. It appeared on the market
this year and overnight became one of the largest-selling
prescription drugs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Army, Navy and Air Force hospitals and clinics provide medical
care for roughly 1.2 million troops and another 5.3 million active
duty dependents, retirees and their dependents.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons general of the Army, Air Force and Navy appeared
before a House subcommittee last week to say that the funds
originally were provided for the fiscal year that began Thursday
would be $600 million short of the cost of providing acceptable
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Their budgets subsequently were increased by shifting funds from
other Department of Defense programs.
</P>
<P>
   A chief problem in preparing health program budgets, all three
surgeons general told the House National Security subcommittee on
personnel, is a budgeting policy that prohibits consideration of
``technology and intensity of treatment'' factors.
</P>
<P>
   This refers anticipated costs from new medical technologies and
drugs - such as Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance before the Senate Armed Services Committee
earlier this week, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the
services are underfunded by billions of dollars and cited ``quality
of life'' issues, such as pay, housing and medical care, as the
most pressing problems they face.

`LA SEPARATION': SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``In a couple, one suffers and the other one's bored,
and vice versa.'' This bitter little epigram, spoken near the
beginning of ``La Separation'' and repeated later, sets the tone of
this small, exquisitely acted French film that traces the
deterioration of a marriage gone stale.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre (Daniel Auteuil), a book illustrator, and Anne (Isabelle
Huppert), a businesswoman, appear to have a serene domestic
partnership until one night while at the movies Pierre caresses his
wife's hand and she impatiently pulls it away. When they arrive
home, he asks her what was wrong and she tells him he was bothering
her.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't so much the words that are exchanged as the actors'
facial expressions and body language that tell the sad story of
Pierre and Anne's unraveling partnership. Ms. Huppert's Anne is a
glum, shifty-eyed enigma. In those rare moments when she can bring
herself to meet Pierre's pleading gaze, she stares back him with a
clenched jaw and a look of blank, defiant fury. Pierre, on his
part, is initially fearful, abject and courtly. But when Anne
spills the beans and announces she has fallen in love with another
man, his hurt pride and jealousy begin to simmer. It takes weeks
before they reach full boil in a harrowing scene of domestic
violence reminiscent of the battle royal in Ingmar Bergman's
``Scenes From a Marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple have a little boy, Loulou, who is 15 months old when
the movie begins. Brief sections of the film consist of Pierre's
home videotapes taken of his baby son while he delivers an
impromptu voice-over narration.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Separation'' doesn't pretend to be an in-depth exploration
of Pierre and Anne's relationship. We are never shown Anne's lover,
nor is his identity revealed. And except for her remembering an
early date in which he cooked dinner for her, there are no
recollections of Pierre and Anne's better days.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by Christian Vincent, who wrote the
screenplay with Dan Franck, gives only a flavor of the nagging,
petty conflicts that have accumulated into a crisis. They are
annoyances as small and recurrent as Pierre's forever forgetting to
turn off the lights and the television set.
</P>
<P>
   We never observe Pierre and Anne in bed, nor does the film give
any sense of the couple's physical chemistry or lack of it. Even
after Anne claims to have fallen in love with someone else, she
insists that she hasn't stopped loving Pierre, although there are
few signs to support that assertion. When she embraces him, she
seems to be reaching out to console him rather than to express any
love. The film's biggest flaw is its lack of evenhandedness. The
movie is clearly on Pierre's side.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a reason the movie leaves out so much crucial
information. By not giving a marital history, it forces us to see
for ourselves what is the matter. It has to do with a lack of
communication.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many couples _ maybe like most couples at some points in
their marriages _ Pierre and Anne have settled into a routine in
which everything is taken for granted and nothing discussed. Petty
grievances, brushed away in the interests of maintaining the
comfortable status quo, are stored up. But once one partner begins
exacting revenge, a destructive chain reaction is set off that is
impossible to control.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Separation'' shows us a hundred small failures of
communication that have created the gulf: the small gestures of
refusal and disgust, the meaningful looks that are not followed up
with words and the negative power that comes from withholding,
evading and keeping the lid on.

A KLEZMER INNOVATOR LISTENS FOR GRANDMA'S VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When David Krakauer was a clarinet student at the
High School of Music and Art, and later at the Juilliard School, he
envisioned a life of playing Brahms and Dvorak with chamber groups,
with perhaps some orchestral work and jazz improvisation to round
out his schedule. He has done all that, with considerable success,
and his versatility and brilliant technique have made him a
valuable player on the new-music scene as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the one kind of playing Krakauer never imagined doing _
klezmer, the Eastern European Jewish dance music that in its
current form has a strong undercurrent of American jazz _ has won
him his biggest audience.
</P>
<P>
   Krakauer's klezmer career has a split focus. He started out
playing this music at weddings, and he still does that, performing
classic klezmer pieces in a traditional, straightforward way. He
adheres to rhythmically vital traditional dance forms like the
terkisher, doina and hora, which all have their roots in Romanian
folk music, as well as the lively freylekh and the slower chosidl.
And the dominant influence on his lilting clarinet lines, with
their bent pitches, modal accents and dynamic subtleties, is
clearly Eastern European.
</P>
<P>
   But in concert and on his recordings, he is creating an updated
klezmer style of his own, drawing freely on his experience with a
variety of other forms, including avant-garde jazz, African
drumming, Latin dance rhythms and rock.
</P>
<P>
   His latest project is a nine-movement, 29-minute suite in which
he suggests a fantasy encounter between two of his heroes: Naftule
Brandwein, a klezmer clarinetist who flourished in the 1920s, and
Sidney Bechet, the jazz clarinetist. The work, ``A Klezmer Tribute
to Sidney Bechet,'' will be the centerpiece of Krakauer's concert
with his band, Klezmer Madness, at Symphony Space on Sunday
afternoon. The suite is also featured on Krakauer's newest CD,
``Klezmer, N.Y.,'' which is to be released this month on the Tzadik
label.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bechet and Brandwein both came here in the late teens or early
'20s,'' Krakauer explained, ``Brandwein from Ukraine, Bechet from
New Orleans, and they shared the wild energy of 1920s New York.
There is something about the way they both approached the clarinet
_ the sound, the cry, the inner cry in the tone _ that intrigued
me. I thought, `They're really musical soul mates.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was also fascinated to read, in John Chilton's biography of
Bechet, that when Bechet lived in France, he included `A Yiddishe
Momme' in his repertoire. I thought, wow, that's pretty neat. So I
just imagined a musical meeting between them. There is no
documentation to suggest that they actually ever met. But I think
that if they had, they would have been very interested in each
other's styles of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for one traditional melody and a piece by Dave Tarras, a
klezmer clarinetist who wedded klezmer to swing in the 1920s,
Krakauer composed the suite, basing its movements on traditional
klezmer dance forms. But he also expanded the sound palette beyond
what one typically hears in a klezmer performance.
</P>
<P>
   Several movements depict Bechet telling Brandwein about musical
life in New Orleans, including references to the African drumming
in Congo Square as well as French opera. For the opera section,
Krakauer recorded brief samples of operatic singing, usually single
notes, and wove them into a wild, unpredictable blend of electronic
and acoustic textures.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bechet and Brandwein might have looked askance at some of
these pieces. In fact, traditionalists may find that Krakauer's
experimentation stretches klezmer's limits too far. For example, in
his concert sets, he sometimes improvises, in klezmer style, on
themes from ``The Twilight Zone,'' ``Car 54, Where Are You?'' and
``The Munsters.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Funky Dave,'' a track on ``Klezmer Madness,'' his band's
debut album, also on Tzadik, he supports a wailing clarinet line
with a slinky guitar and a tight bass and drum accompaniment,
transforming Tarras' ``Heimisher Sher'' into a summit meeting
between the jazz avant-gardist John Coltrane and the soul duo Sam
and Dave. ``Bogota Bulgar,'' on the same disk, combines a dance
from Brandwein's repertory with a percussion section enlivened by
Latin cross-rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that one came about by chance,'' Krakauer said of this
last piece. ``It was born at a wedding I played at, in which the
groom was Jewish, and the bride was Colombian. There were two
bands, actually, mine and Los Macondos de Colombia, a group of
wonderful vallenato musicians. And we were switching off until at
one point we played together. We did a huge klezmer and vallenato
dance medley, and when it was over, the groom's father came up to
me, completely flushed with this incredible dancing, and said he'd
never heard anything like that. People really felt as though the
two cultures had come together at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of his cross-cultural experiments doesn't bother
Krakauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that in doing klezmer music, I consider myself a
preserver of a traditional art form,'' he said. ``But I don't want
to keep it in a museum. Any music, to be healthy, has to keep
moving forward. And I'm sure that there were people a generation or
two before Tarras and Brandwein who kvetched about what THEY were
doing to klezmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who come to my concerts get a full sense of what
klezmer is. I'll play a bunch of tunes exactly as I'd play them at
a wedding, pretty straight, and then I'll play something that
examines something more intense. I think people are ready for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Krakauer, who turned 42 last week, grew up in Manhattan and
began playing the clarinet when he was 10. His first teacher, Joel
Press, played both classical music and jazz and introduced him to
the highlights of both worlds. When he was 14, Krakauer began to
study with Leon Russianoff, who remained his teacher through his
time at Juilliard, where he completed his master's degree. He also
studied at Sarah Lawrence College and the Paris Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to New York from Paris, Krakauer became a
freelancer with an increasingly busy workload. He was the principal
clarinetist in the New Haven Symphony and for the Martha Graham
Ballet, and he played regularly with New York Philomusica and in
new-music concerts by Continuum, Speculum Musicae, the Da Capo
Chamber Players and, as he put it, ``probably every new-music group
in town.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the Aspen Wind Quintet, which won the
Naumburg Competition in 1984. He taught at Vassar for 10 years, at
Bard for one (a course in jazz history) and has been on the faculty
at the Manhattan School, the Mannes College of Music and Queens
College since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to klezmer music kind of by accident,'' he told a
listener who wondered where klezmer fit into all this. ``I grew up
very assimilated. My grandparents spoke Yiddish, mainly when they
wanted to say things that they didn't want my parents to
understand. My parents spoke a smattering of Yiddish. But by the
time it filtered down to me, there wasn't much Yiddish culture left
in my family.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I was studying with Leon Russianoff, he gave me some
pieces by his teacher, Simeon Bellison, who had played Jewish music
in czarist Russia before he moved to the United States and became
the principal clarinetist of the New York Philharmonic. So that
gave me some early exposure to Jewish music.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there was a series of coincidences. I had a chance
meeting with Alicia Svigals of the Klezmatics, and she said, `You
ought to play klezmer clarinet, there might be a demand for it.'
And then I ran into someone else who was looking for a klezmer
clarinetist and thought I could recommend a student. But I said,
`Oh, I want to do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very spontaneous decision, and it took some chutzpah.
When I started to play, though, I thought: `This sounds familiar.
This sounds like my grandmother speaking.' It felt so easy, so
natural.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, around 1987, Krakauer thought of klezmer as a
musical hobby, something outside his regular career, and a way of
exploring his Jewish roots. In 1989 he joined the Klezmatics, one
of several young American ensembles that have given the klezmer
revival much of its momentum. He appears on two of the group's
albums, ``Rhythm and Jews'' and ``Jews With Horns'' (both on the
Piranha label), and in the group's set on the first of Itzhak
Perlman's klezmer albums, ``In the Fiddler's House'' (on EMI).
</P>
<P>
   By the time Perlman made that recording, and its related
television special, in 1995, klezmer had become a veritable growth
industry, not only in the United States, but in Europe as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's no coincidence that this interest really took off
in the late 1980s, coinciding with the fall of the Berlin wall,''
said Krakauer, who has made five trips to Poland to perform and to
teach klezmer to mostly non-Jewish students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they began to wonder, `What WAS life like when there
was a Jewish culture thriving here?' This summer I was teaching
classes sponsored by the Borderland Foundation, which is a group
located in the northeastern corner of Poland, where the borders
between Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Lithuania have shifted back
and forth over these many years. And the director of the
foundation, who is not Jewish, said they have the sensation of
living on the ruins of an old civilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel a need to understand Jewish culture, and they
believe that the way to understand it is to live in it. So klezmer
is something they really want to get deeper into. It helps fill the
hole left by what was torn out in the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Krakauer left the Klezmatics in 1996 to pursue his own vision of
klezmer. But he has kept up his career in other corners of the
musical world.
</P>
<P>
   He performed and recorded with the downtown composer and
saxophonist John Zorn, who in 1995 started Tzadik as an outlet for
what he calls ``radical Jewish culture.'' With the Kronos Quartet,
Krakauer recorded Osvaldo Golijov's ``Dreams and Prayers of Isaac
the Blind'' (on Nonesuch), a vivid, richly hued work about a
13th-century Jewish mystic that is well suited to Krakauer's
flexible, expressive technique. And there has also been more
conventional work; recent collaborations include a Weber Quintet
with the Tokyo String Quartet, and performances of Brahms chamber
works with the Lark Quartet and the Eroica Trio.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, klezmer dates increasing fill Krakauer's calendar. In
December, he is starting a series of weekly Sunday afternoon
klezmer concerts at Tonic, a club on the site of the old Kedem
Kosher Winery on the Lower East Side. And with the second Klezmer
Madness album about to be released, he is sketching out ideas for
the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to do now,'' he said, ``is look at the klezmer
forms and see where I can go with them. And the balance I walk is
to not go so far that it doesn't sound like klezmer anymore. It has
to have that Yiddish feeling in it, that way of phrasing a melody,
and ornamenting it. It has to have my grandmother's voice in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'll stretch it and stretch it, to the point where I
have to ask, `Is it klezmer or isn't it?' Sometimes it isn't, and
when I've created something that doesn't work, I throw it out. But
I don't mind when there's some ambiguity. In fact, I like that.''
</P>

MLB, NETWORKS LINE UP GAME ANNOUNCERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, well, well. There will be a fourth, and possibly a fifth,
game between the Red Sox and Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   With the best-of-five American League Division Series tied at
1-1 going into Friday's 4 p.m. game at Fenway Park, Major League
Baseball and the three networks covering the playoffs released the
weekend schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Buck and Tim McCarver call the 4 p.m. game Saturday at
Fenway on Fox (Channel 25).
</P>
<P>
   If the New York Yankees close out the Texas Rangers tonight or
Saturday, and the Sox and Indians need a fifth game Sunday, that
deciding game will be shown on Fox at 7:30 p.m. There is a
possibility that Fox will show the Atlanta Braves-Chicago Cubs Game
4 at 7:30, but that is extremely unlikely for one reason. A Game 5
is always better than a Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees need a Game 5, it would be shown on Sunday at
7:30 on Fox. The Red Sox-Indians Game 5, if necessary, would be
shown at 1 p.m. on ESPN, directly against the CBS telecast of the
New England Patriots-New Orleans Saints game.
</P>
<P>
   Competitiveness of a series is one factor networks use to
determine game times. Major League Baseball makes the ultimate
decision, but the networks have considerable input, especially the
two prime-time carriers this year _ NBC and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and NBC chose to air the Yankees' games in prime time for
obvious reasons: The team set an American League record for
victories, and it's New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are clearly the Goliaths of this year's playoffs,
and whether they win or lose, their rise and fall is a definite
story. Add the undeniable fact that the Yankees have a national
folowing and it becomes apparent why networks eagerly lined up to
air those games in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The games shown on ESPN are a little different. Since the
Division Series began three years ago, ESPN has wanted a chance to
air playoff games to round out its array of exhibition and
regular-season games and baseball news and feature programming. The
network's contract with MLB calls for it to air the afternoon and
late-night first-round games.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN has much more flexibility than Fox or NBC. The two
over-the-air carriers have to worry about preempting prime-time
scheduling and are almost precluded from interrupting daytime
programming. All-sports ESPN doesn't have that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Take NBC's decision to air Braves-Cubs Saturday at 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   NBC spokesman Ed Markey said the network had to make a decision
last night and couldn't wait until the outcomes of Friday's games.
NBC officials predicted that the Yankees would more than likely win
tonight. If Texas wins, Game 4 of the Rangers-Yankees series will
be shown Saturday at 1 p.m on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Market size is always a factor but not a major one. ``It's
incidental,'' Markey said. ``If everything else is equal, then the
bigger market would be preferable. A 20 rating in New York is more
viewers than a 20 rating in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   More important factors are time zone differences, especially for
ESPN. The network doesn't want to air the games of a West Coast
team at 1 p.m. EST or the games of an East Coast team at 11 p.m.
EST.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we can tell the teams or the major leagues that
we want this game to start at 2 p.m. and another game to start at 6
p.m.,'' said ESPN spokeswoman Diane Lamb.

HARU REISCHAUER, JOURNALIST WHO WROTE ABOUT LIFE IN JAPAN; AT 83 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Haru (Matsukata) Reischauer, an author and journalist who was
the widow of the former US ambassador to Japan, died Sept. 23 in La
Jolla, Calif. She was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reischauer's career bridged the cultures of her native
Japan and the United States. She reported on her homeland for the
Saturday Evening Post and the Christian Science Monitor and was the
wife of the late Edwin O. Reischauer, who was ambassador to Japan
from 1961 to 1966 and a longtime member of the Harvard University
faculty. The university's institute of Japanese studies is named
after him.
</P>
<P>
   She was the author of the memoir ``Samurai and Silk: a Japanese
and American Heritage,'' which was published in 1986, and had been
honorary chairwoman of Harvard's Policy Advisory Committee of the
program of US-Japan Relations since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reischauer's paternal grandfather, Prince Masayoshi
Matsukata, was prime minister of Japan in the late 19th century.
Her father graduated from Yale University and her mother, though
Japanese, was born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reischauer's childhood in Tokyo was spent under the
supervision of a series of English governesses. She attended the
American School in Japan. She graduated from Principia College in
Illinois in 1937 and spent summers during her undergraduate years
with her maternal grandparents in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to Japan in 1937 to find her homeland embarking on
the period of war that led to its devastation eight years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, she married Reischauer, who was a member of the faculty
at Harvard. They settled in Belmont, Mass..
</P>
<P>
   During her term as an ambassador's wife, Mrs. Reischauer was the
second most popular woman in Japan, after the crown princess,
according to a 1962 article in the Christian Science Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1966 Globe story, she said that being the ambassador's wife
meant ``associating with Japanese women, bridging the gap between
the countries, and talking with the wives of American servicemen
who were stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese women,'' she said, ``think that Americans are very
militaristic because of our tremendous military buildup and the
Vietnam War. And, at the same time, American women in Japan needed
to understand the Japanese woman and the Oriental mind. When
anti-Western riots would break out, I would visit the Army bases
surrounding Tokyo to help explain the reasons why. ''
</P>
<P>
   She said the aspects of the position she found most demanding
were learning to make public speeches, forfeiting the academic life
in which she had plenty of time to read, and moving into the realm
of the women's clubs. At one time she was a member of 14 women's
groups.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves a son, Robert D. of Bethesda, Md.; two daughters, Ann
Heinemann of La Jolla and Joan Simon of Larchmont, N.Y.; two
sisters, Naka Rawsthorne of Los Angeles and Mari Bruck of Studio
City, Calif.; nine grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

 &HT;    BIOPSY IN ATLANTA WATCHED ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While about 100 people watched on closed-circuit
television in a House caucus room, a woman underwent a breast
biopsy in Marietta, Ga., to demonstrate a new, non-invasive
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel a thing,'' said 47-year-old Judith Degen,
chatting with surgeon Richard Fine at the end of the 25-minute
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Members of breast cancer advocacy groups, congressional staff
members and five female members of the House and Senate put aside
lunches of sandwiches and potato salad and watched a television
monitor as Dr. Fine pushed a swizzle stick-sized needle through a
small incision in the side of Degen's right breast and began
extracting tissue for examination.
</P>
<P>
   When the procedure was over, she sat chatting with Dr. Fine, and
willingly opened her hospital gown to reveal an inch-long bandage
placed over the incision in which the needle had been inserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel a thing,'' she said. ``I highly recommend it.''
</P>
<P>
   A mammography had shown that she the breast contains
``microcalcifications,'' Dr. Fine said before doing the biopsy. In
10 to 15 percent of cases, the tiny white dots on X-ray film
represent a very early stage of breast cancer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new procedure became available, Degen would have
faced an operation in which she would have been put to sleep and an
incision made into her breast.
</P>
<P>
   The biopsy was performed at The Breast Center in Marietta and
used by the technology's manufacturer, Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc.,
and the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations to promote
findings of a poll indicating that most women with positive
mammograms are not informed of the biopsy options available to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The poll and the lunch served at the Thursday meeting were paid
for by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, a spokeswoman said.

RED SOX HAVE A LOT IN COMMON WITH EVERYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky and Nomar Garciaparra were both born on July 23,
1973, in California _ she in San Francisco, he in Whittier.
</P>
<P>
   There. You have more proof that there is a Red Sox connection
with everything that happens in life.
</P>
<P>
   You think I am kidding? I am not kidding. We don't need six
degrees of separation or Kevin Bacon to link the Red Sox with every
major person and event of the century. Just try me.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest two stories of America's summer of 1998? Easy.
Sexgate and the Great Home Run Chase. The Monica-Nomar connection
covers our top story, and naturally, the Sox have a link to the
Home Run Chase. Mark McGwire's 70th and final home run was hit off
Carl Pavano _ the onetime Sox prospect who was dealt for Pedro
Martinez. In 1961, when Roger Maris hit No. 61, the pitcher, of
course, was Red Sox rookie righthander Tracy Stallard.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, name the topic, I'll give you the Sox connection.
</P>
<P>
   --The Titanic _ Too easy. Fenway Park was dedicated the same
week that the White Star ship sank to the bottom of the North
Atlantic. Leo DiCaprio wore a Red Sox cap when he attended Game 6
of the NBA Finals last spring.
</P>
<P>
   --The Yalta Summit _ No problem. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was
the cleanup hitter at Yalta. FDR went to the same high school
(Groton School) as Peter Gammons.
</P>
<P>
   --The Kennedy-Nixon debates _ Way easy. John F. Kennedy's
grandfather, John ``Honey Fitz'' Fitzgerald, threw out the first
ball for the first game of the 1912 World Series. The Red Sox have
had three players named Nixon _ Russ, Otis, and Trot. The Sox also
had a shortstop named John E. Kennedy and a manager, Kevin Kennedy,
who had a Johnson (Tim) as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   --Michael Jordan _ Played with Nomar in the Fall Instructional
League in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   --Cal Ripken _ Drafted with a pick acquired from the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   --Marilyn Monroe _ Said to have preferred DiMaggio over
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   --Matt Damon _ Never mind all the Carlton Fisk stuff in ``Good
Will Hunting.'' Go see ``Rounders.'' Damon plays a New York City
law student with a penchant for poker. Damon's character gets
cleaned out of $30,000 in a high-stakes, underground game at the
beginning of the movie. When he returns to the site at the end of
the film _ intent on reversing his misfortune _ he says, ``I felt
like Buckner going back into Shea.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Cheers Bar _ Barkeep Sam Malone, played by Ted Danson, was
a pitcher for the Red Sox, a guy who gave up the long home runs.
His nickname was ``Mayday Malone.''
</P>
<P>
   --Hank Aaron's 715th _ Aaron was originally property of the
Boston Braves. His record-breaking homer was hit over the head of
Dodgers left fielder Bill Buckner and was caught by Tom House, who
was later traded to the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   --Bill Clinton's Girlfriends _ In 1992, presidential candidate
Clinton visited the Houston Astros' spring training site in
Kissimmee, Fla. The Astros were playing the Red Sox that day, and
Clinton exchanged a few words with Wade Boggs. Nice photo op. Both
of their mistresses (Gennifer Flowers and Margo Adams) wound up in
Penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   --The O.J. Trial _ Kato Kaelin moved in with Charlie Sheen after
he left O.J. Simpson's digs. Sheen is the man who paid $93,500 for
the baseball that trickled through Buckner's legs on the final play
of Game 6 of the 1986 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   --The late Jackie Kennedy Onassis _ Attended Billy Rohr's
one-hitter during the first week of the 1967 season with son
John-John. Jackie O had Rohr sign a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   --The Pope _ In 1978, the College of Cardinals assembled at the
Vatican to elect a pope. Boston television journalist Clark Booth
covered the event and was mildly surprised when the late Humberto
Cardinal Medeiros sought him out to ask how the Red Sox had done
the previous day. Booth remembers, ``I was standing in a courtyard
next to St. Peter's. I was waiting for them to come out. Finally,
there was a recess and Medeiros came out and asked, `How are the
Red Sox doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   --``Psycho'' _ Two connections. Anthony Perkins, who played
Norman Bates, also played Sox outfielder Jimmy Piersall in ``Fear
Strikes Out.'' And then there's Steve Lyons, the latter-day Psycho.
</P>
<P>
   --Wilt Chamberlain _ Tussled under the basket with Red Sox
starting pitcher Gene Conley.
</P>
<P>
   --John Glenn _ Flew missions with Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   --``Field of Dreams'' _ A scene was filmed at Fenway. Remember
Moonlight Graham?
</P>
<P>
   --World War I _ Shortened the Sox' 1918 season and put them in
the World Series on Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   --World War II _ Took Williams, Johnny Pesky, and Bobby Doerr
away.
</P>
<P>
   --Walking On The Moon _ Happened on July 20 _ the same date that
the Red Sox led the Yankees by 14 games in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   --The Who _ Wrote anthem for Sox fans: ``Won't Get Fooled
Again.'
</P>
<P>
   --Jackie Robinson _ Went through a sham of a tryout at Fenway in
1945.
</P>
<P>
   --``Ally McBeal'' _ Shot scenes from first 1998 episode at
Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   --The Kennedy Assassination _ Debbie Clemens, then an infant in
her mother's arms, was in Dealy Plaza Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   --The Beatles _ Breakthrough album, ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band,'' released in 1967, the year the Red Sox regained
the love of New Englanders.
</P>
<P>
   --Watergate _ Carl Yastrzemski gave his 1967 MVP trophy to
Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   --Boston Globe _ Formerly owned by Taylor family, which built
Fenway Park and named team ``Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   --Woodstock _ The site was Max Yasgur's farm. Known here as
``Yaz-gur's'' farm.
</P>

THE RED SOX' DYNAMIC DUO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every once in a while, they'll have a flashback. Mo will look at
Val, or vice versa, and instead of being at Fenway Park or Yankee
Stadium, they'll be back in South Orange, N.J., or Pawtucket, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``Val and I have been through a lot together,'' says Mo Vaughn.
``Sometimes I look over at him and I think about how we used to
wash out our own uniforms when we were in college, and then think
about the life we're leading now. The big league life is very
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps somewhere in major league baseball, there is a duo who
can match Mo Vaughn and John Valentin for shared experience, but I
doubt it. Consider the resumes: two years together at Seton Hall,
parts of two minor league seasons together at Pawtucket, and major
league teammates as far back as 1992 and straight through since
1993 with the Red Sox. That's a lot of 6-3s, 5-3s, and even 4-3s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen often,'' says Valentin. ``Two guys playing a
large part of their major league careers on the same team after
playing together in college. Believe me, there have been a lot of
times when we've sat down and laughed about the whole situation.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Vaughn arrived on the Seton Hall campus, Valentin
was the starting shortstop on a team that included future major
league All-Star Craig Biggio and future cup-of-coffee major league
pitcher Kevin Morton. ``It was a really good team,'' asserts
Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo had a little transition period. We had a fall season, and
he did struggle a little bit. But when the spring season came, it
was boom-bam. He hit something like 27 or 28 home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did it as a designated hitter. ``Mo didn't even play
first base right away,'' Valentin explains. ``We had a guy named
Martese Robinson playing first, and Mo had to DH.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo would eventually take over at first base and leave Seton Hall
as the all-time school leader in average (.417), home runs (57),
and runs batted in (218). He was a three-year All-American, the Big
East Player of the Decade, and one of two Red Sox first-round draft
picks (No. 23 overall) in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin was not exactly ticketed for athletic greatness. He
arrived at Seton Hall as an unheralded 150-pound shortstop, and he
batted ninth. No one could have projected him into a fifth-round
draft pick or a future major leaguer capable of routinely hitting
40-plus doubles annually while driving in as many as 102 runs in a
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was always willing to work, and he was always willing
to do things the right way,'' says Vaughn. ``He has overcome
tremendous odds to get where he is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin happens to be white and Vaughn happens to be black.
This, to them, is an irrelevancy. ``We were close right away,''
says Mo. ``When you go to war with somebody as often as we have,
there is a bond. It doesn't matter what color you are. I think our
friendship shows people that in life, a thing like that doesn't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just so happens that he's black and I'm white,'' Valentin
maintains. ``To me, it's as much a fact that we're both East Coast
guys as anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is from Norwalk, Conn. Valenin is from Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin finds it a curiosity that each wound up being drafted
by the Red Sox. ``I've often thought about it,'' he says. ``I have
nothing to base this on, but I'm wondering if the fact that (Seton
Hall's) Rick Cerone was with the Red Sox at the time had anything
to do with us both being drafted by this organization. Did he put
in a good word for us? I do remember scouts coming up to me when I
was in A ball in 1988 and asking me what I thought of Mo as a
ballplayer. Kevin Morton, too.''
</P>
<P>
   They were first reunited as professionals in 1991 with the
Pawtucket Red Sox. Vaughn got a call-up that year, hitting four
home runs (one of which came very close to becoming only the second
ball ever to leave Baltimore's Memorial Stadium) while batting
.260. He split time between Boston and Pawtucket the following
season.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin got his first taste of big league action in 1992 (.276,
5, 25 in 175 at-bats spread over 58 games). He became a full-time
major leaguer the following year, save for a two-game injury rehab
stint in Pawtucket. He did not have a straight-line path to the
bigs, either. There had to be some questions about him when he hit
.218 at Double A New Britain in 1990. But he never lost faith in
himself. He got into the weight room and he paid attention to every
detail. He never stopped believing he was destined to be a major
leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn needed some humbling and some adjusting before he became
the marquee player he is today. He admits that the big home run in
Baltimore gave him the wrong idea about what to do at the plate,
and he rededicated himself to mastering the inside-out swing that
produced the vital three-run homer in Tuesday's big win over the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Each remains president of the other's fan club. ``What Mo has
done this year is tremendous,'' says Valentin. ``To be honest, I
see a lot of things in the clubhouse you'll never see. He was able
to fight through so much this year to put up those numbers. I just
don't understand why he isn't signed. I can't think of any player
of his stature who wouldn't already have been re-signed by his
team. I don't know who we could ever bring in here to do what he
does for us, and do it in Fenway Park and in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo returns the compliment. ``Val has conquered so much to get
here, and the reason is he wants to be the best and he has always
been willing to do it the right way. Here's a guy who can play
short, third, and even second, and who can hit with power.''
</P>
<P>
   This right way/wrong way thing is important to Mo. ``What I'm
proud of is that we both had a plan,'' Vaughn says. ``We didn't
just want to get to the big leagues and then sit back and have a
good time. We wanted to get there and make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin will bat second and play third base Friday in Game 3 of
the American League Division Series. Vaughn will play first and bat
third. They're in the playoffs. They make a difference. In more
ways than one.

DIMINISHING SALES FOR `BRILL'S CONTENT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Brill is gone. That horrible pun may explain decreasing
newsstand sales of the new ``Brill's Content'' magazine of media
criticism. Buoyed by founder Steven Brill's brilliant marketing
campaign for its ``Pressgate'' story, which alleged an unholy
collaboration between independent counsel Kenneth Starr and the
Washington press corps, the debut August issue received massive
media attention and flew off the newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brill's estimates, he sold between 275,000 and
290,000 copies of the first issue with 120,000 copies coming off
the newsstand. The September issue (with Bill Gates on the cover),
sold about 215,000 copies with about 60,000 of that representing
newsstand sales. No numbers are in yet for the October issue with
its cover story on TV magazine shows.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Shull, divisional merchandise manager for periodicals at
Borders bookstores, said ``demand was crazy'' for the initial
issue. ``The second issue was still very good,'' he added, ``but
nothing like the first one.'' Fred Cohen, the general manager at
Harvard Square's Out of Town News, is more blunt. ``We've displayed
it prominently, but without that media exposure, (sales have)
really tapered off,`` he said.

   No media outlet has a more experimental bent than The Orange
County (Calif.) Register (364,000 circulation), which bills itself
``the biggest community newspaper in the country.'' The paper _
known for enrolling staffers in a community awareness curriculum
and for putting suggestion boxes in local Starbucks outlets _ is
embarking on a technological and journalistic revolution dubbed
``The Dynamic Publishing System,'' scheduled for completion on
Valentine's Day 2000. (The paper has a mind-boggling 130 newsroom
people sitting on committees brainstorming on this.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what's happened with a lot of newspapers is that
they've clung to the way that works and the way they're organized
... because of technology that's outdated,'' said executive editor
Ken Brusic. ``As a consequence, it really affects the way people
think.''
</P>
<P>
   The Register is not only replacing the computer system for the
news and advertising departments, it is rethinking the traditional
concept of the newsroom. The goal is to create a series of
alternative newsrooms distributed throughout the circulation area.
(Brusic doesn't like to use the term ``bureaus'' because it implies
a heirarchical beat system.)
</P>
<P>
   The Register's secret weapon? The plan _ which is being tried in
a pilot program _ calls for the staff to be dispersed out of the
newsroom, with each reporter equipped with a laptop computer and
cellphone, what Brusic calls ``a sort of 21st century version of
the notebook.''

   Supporters and staffers are worried about the fate of The Daily
Free Press _ the 28-year-old student-run Boston University
newspaper that's been a training ground for countless journalists _
after a jury awarded a former employee almost $163,000 earlier this
week. According to the Free Press, the employee, Karen Miranda,
alleged she'd been fired from her job as office manager in 1994
because she was suffering from cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the award stunned Free Press editor Gene Johnson,
who said the paper might be forced to declare bankruptcy and
reorganize. ``Regardless, we really have to start squeezing things
as much as we can,'' he said. One immediate casualty is the Free
Press's once-a-semester magazine, Ink, which will cease
publication.
</P>
<P>
   According to Johnson, the Free Press has $140,000 in its
treasury, and an annual operating budget of around $450,000. The
paper had authorized a settlement with Miranda of up to $70,000,
but was clearly unprepared for the size of the judgement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lawyers kept telling us it was going to be settled,''
Johnson said. As the Free Press ponders its next move, its lawyers
are headed back to court to seek a reduction of the judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The cover of Rolling Stone magazine lately seems much more
interested in flesh than Phish. A brief review of some recent cover
shots finds Janet Jackson falling out of her bikini top, ``Dawson's
Creek'' sweetheart Katie Holmes in a come hither pose, ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer'' star Sarah Michelle Gellar flaunting an S&AMP;M
outfit, model Laetitia Casta posing nude, and singer Shania Twain
having a major problem keeping her top on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we have female flesh on the Rolling Stone cover,''
responds mildly annoyed magazine spokeswoman Cathy O'Brien,
insisting this pulchritude doesn't reflect a new attitude. ``The
(cover) decision always is who's the most newsworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, when the music industry isn't making big enough
headlines, Rolling Stone relies on more basic marketing appeals.

   DENVER -- In Las Vegas there are fewer Asians at the baccarat
tables; in Hollywood the independent film producers are selling
fewer films to Asian distributors; in Colorado, the Merix Corp. is
to close its Loveland factory because of lower Asian demand for
high-tech circuit boards; in New Mexico, Japan's problems have
forced Fulcrum Direct, a mail-order firm in Rio Rancho, to shut and
have persuaded Intel, Philips Semiconductor and Sumitomo to delay
their expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   Are these signs that ``Asian flu'' has crossed the Pacific and
will soon lay low the American West?
</P>
<P>
   At first glance it seems unlikely. After all, America remains in
robust economic health, and it is the western states that have led
the nation's prolonged economic boom. From Arizona to Washington
jobs have multiplied and investment has risen.
</P>
<P>
   California, for example, was deep in recession in 1990-93; now
it leads the nation in high-tech jobs, employing more than 720,000
people at an average wage in 1996 of almost $58,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, personal incomes per head were 90.9 percent of the
national average in 1992; by last year, they had risen to 96.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from Seattle to San Diego the common complaint -- partly
answered by a congressional vote in September to allow more visas
for foreign computer nerds -- is of skilled-labour shortages. Since
only Wyoming, with its tiny population and declining oil and gas
revenues, has lagged behind on the western states' journey to
ever-greater prosperity, their economists are surely entitled to
describe the potential impact of Asia's problems as ``a bump in the
road'' rather than a damaging pot-hole.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, second glances are less reassuring. One reason is an
above-average dependence on Asia for export markets. Whereas around
30 percent of America's merchandise exports conventionally go to
Asia, the share for Oregon is almost two-thirds and for California,
the nation's biggest exporter, just over half.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas most of America hangs on every word from Alan Greenspan,
the chairman of the Federal Reserve, westerners tend to worry more
about the nuanced statements of Japan's latest prime minister,
Keizo Obuchi. After all, Japan is both the single biggest market
for most of their high-tech exports and the now-sputtering engine
of Asian economic growth. As long as Japan remains in recession, so
will the western states' other export markets in East Asia and
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A second reason for worry is that economic diversity provides
little immunity. High-tech exports may be affected by slumping
demand and sliding currencies in Asia, but so too are agricultural
products and minerals.
</P>
<P>
   Washington apple-growers had been anticipating a growing
appetite in Japan; instead, they have seen their exports in the
past year drop by a third. In Seattle the Boeing aircraft company,
normally the country's single biggest exporter, is having to adjust
to the fact that Asia's airlines are now flying almost empty.
</P>
<P>
   Exports of coal, copper and other minerals from Utah, Wyoming
and Montana are beginning to slip because of falling demand in Asia
and price competition from Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if the investors who have fled Asia and Russia abandon
Latin America, too, then the West will really be in trouble:
Mexico, for example, is California's biggest market after Japan.
</P>
<P>
   All this prompted a sobering warning at a recent conference in
Denver from Kelly Matthews, chief economist of Utah's First
Security Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deflationary impact of Asia on the world's economy,'' he
said, ``in all likelihood will be more severe and prolonged than
current consensus expects.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Matthews a Cassandra, or will history prove him wrong? The
optimists can mount some powerful arguments. Boeing, for example,
is used to rescheduling aircraft deliveries for hard-pressed
customers (cancelling a firm order can cost a customer dear).
Similarly, many high-tech Asian companies, however strapped for
dollars, will have no option but to keep buying parts and software
from American companies.
</P>
<P>
   As for the western states' mineral and farm exports, they will
surely grow over time as less developed Asian countries such as
China, Vietnam and Indonesia increasingly industrialize and switch
to more meat and grain in their diets.
</P>
<P>
   Too optimistic by half? Maybe so. But in the meantime, to the
relief of the potato farmers of Idaho and Washington, there is one
export so far holding its share of the Asian market: the American
``french fry.''

BOUCHARD ASSAILS STORES' PLANS TO USE ENGLISH SIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A venerable downtown department store has become the
latest flashpoint in Quebec's escalating language wars.
</P>
<P>
   This city's substantial English-speaking minority has mounted an
aggressive campaign to convince the Eaton store _ a 102-year-old
fixture in the heart of Canada's second-largest city _ to post
signs in English as well as French.
</P>
<P>
   But Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard Thursday called executives of
four leading North American retail chains onto the carpet, warning
Eaton, Sears, Wal-Mart and The Bay that any move toward English,
even in stores serving mostly anglophone customers, would
``jeopardize linguistic peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to know that it is completely unacceptable,'' said
Bouchard.
</P>
<P>
   But infuriated anglophones, as English-speakers are called,
renewed threats to launch a national boycott of Eaton stores and
possibly other retail chains to force the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to send a message that English is not a social
disease,'' said William Johnson, head of Alliance Quebec, the
province's top English rights group. ``English is not pollution. We
should be proud of our language.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Canada has enshrined both English and French as the
nation's official languages, Quebec refuses to abide by the dual
language standard, insisting French must predominate everywhere in
the public life of the restive province, from government documents
to restaurant menus.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, it is legal to use English in public displays, but
only if accompanied by equivalent French words printed in
characters at least twice as large and in a bolder hue. In reality,
any use of posted English _ except in a few neighborhoods much
visited by American tourists _ is likely to result in harassment
from the province's hyper-vigilant language police as well as
broken windows and spray-painted graffiti by Quebec nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec is the the only Canadian province in which
French-speakers form the majority of the population, about 80
percent of 7.3 million people. Most of the province's 800,000
anglophones live in and around Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, Quebec's English-speakers have been a passive
bunch, opposed to the drive for independence led by Bouchard's
governing Parti Quebecois, but more or less resigned to
second-class linguistic status. Even the name ``Eaton'' indicates
the degree of acquiescence; the department store was ``Eaton's''
for more than 75 years _ and so it remains in the rest of Canada _
but the chain removed the offensive apostrophe ``s,'' not used in
French, as a sop to Quebec's language purists.
</P>
<P>
   Whether known as Eaton or Eaton's, the company is Canada's most
famous chain and the store on Montreal's Rue Ste-Catherine is a
national landmark. Once a bastion of English Montreal, today every
sign on the premises _ whether marking men's socks or cosmetics
counter _ is in French only,
</P>
<P>
   But anglophone activists are demanding that retail outlets
serving a heavily English-speaking clientele, as is the case with
Montreal's Eaton, use signs in their language, in addition to
French.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we are seeking is respect for our community,'' said
Johnson, a former newspaper columnist who has emerged as the most
vocal champion of anglophone rights in a province where English
hospitals and other essential services have been shuttered by the
separatist government in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual protest, several hundred English-speaking
demonstrators gathered outside the downtown Eaton store last week
to vent displeasure with the ``French only'' sign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The anglophones were met by jeering, egg-hurling toughs from the
ultranationalist Mouvement de Liberation Nationale du Quebec, a
fringe group descended from bomb-planting terrorists of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadians go home!'' the nationalists chanted. ``Quebec for
Quebecois!''
</P>
<P>
   Although English is seldom heard in most of Quebec, Montreal has
boasted a large, thriving community of British-Canadians, Jews and
other anglophones since the 1700s and the city retains a uniquely
bilingual character.
</P>
<P>
   Most Quebec separatists are resolutely peaceful and despise the
Liberation Nationale movement's tactics of intimidation. But
provincial leaders pointedly declared Thursday that the push for
English signs could cause a dangerous backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Bouchard warned retailers against bending to the wishes
of English Quebecers. ``This is a provocation to our society,'' he
said. ``People who would make such a decision would show a profound
ignorance of Quebec's social landscape and Quebec's history.''

   Until 1996, California did not stage its primary election until
June -- three months after Iowa and New Hampshire -- by which time
the nominations had already been sewn up. In that year the state
moved its primary forward to March 26, only to find that other
states had leapfrogged over it. Bob Dole had already secured the
Republican nomination before Californians went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   That is now about to change dramatically. Last Monday, amid
great fanfare in Sacramento, California's governor, Pete Wilson,
signed a bill that will move the state's primary to the first
Tuesday in March, three weeks earlier than the current date and the
earliest date that is allowed under the arcane rules that govern
such things.
</P>
<P>
   Five other states -- including New York -- have also moved their
primaries to the same day, and more are expected to follow. This
will create a new landmark in the political calendar, a giant
national primary that will henceforth seal the fates of aspiring
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   This will undoubtedly be good for California. A state that
accounts for one in every eight delegates to national political
conventions will at last have a say in whom those conventions
nominate. That will put California at the center of the national
debate and increase the chance that one of its candidates will
reach the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the whole of the west coast may benefit. Oregon's
secretary of state, Ralph Munro, has already set the machinery in
motion to move his state's primary so that it coincides with
California's, and Washington state may do likewise. That would
create a West Coast primary that would account for almost a quarter
of the votes needed to select the Democratic Party's nominee and
over a fifth of those needed to select the Republican Party's.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrangements will probably be popular with the press
corps which, come March 2000, will be able to swap the snow of
Manchester, N.H., for the sun of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But will it be good for the country? Sean Walsh, Wilson's
spokesman, argues that giving more prominence to New York and
California, with all their diversity and dynamism, will force
candidates to address national issues rather than focusing on
parochial concerns or pandering to the political extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so sure. The new primary schedule will compress
the nomination process into about four weeks, with more than half
America's states and three-quarters of its population voting in a
feverish eight-day spell in March. This will give a huge boost to
well-known candidates who already have giant political and
fund-raising machines in place. But it will all but rule out the
wild cards who used to be able to seize national attention on the
strength of their performances in Iowa or New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson would dearly like to add his name to that list of
well-known candidates. Come January 1999, he will be without a job
in politics for the first time in more than three decades. His
political ambitions recently received a boost from a Los Angeles
Times poll that showed his approval ratings at record levels.
</P>
<P>
   The change of date for the primary plays into his hands,
allowing him to concentrate on the East Coast while his rivals have
to campaign on both coasts at once. It will also allow him to spend
his time wooing liberal voters in the Northeast rather than fending
off attacks from hard-line Republicans in the heartland who loathe
his pro-choice views on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Such a view is too optimistic, however. Even with the state's
economy booming, Wilson is less popular in California than the
scandal-ridden Bill Clinton. Two-thirds of the Californians polled
by the Los Angeles Times said that they did not want him to run for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if Wilson's own presidential ambitions are destined
to come to nothing, he will now go down in history as the governor
who finally allowed California to throw its weight around in
presidential politics.

   CHINA-COMMUNISTS _ BEIJING _ For anyone who thinks that the
Chinese Communist Party is about to wither away and usher in a new
era of Chinese capitalism and democracy, events of the last month
must come as a stunning disappointment. As China celebrates the
49th anniversary of the Communist takeover on Thursday, President
Jiang Zemin has launched a Mao-like propaganda campaign to
celebrate the ``glorious'' achievements of the Chinese Communist
Party and of its military wing, the People's Liberation Army. Talk
of economic reform abounds in this multi-media blitz, but no one is
mentioning politicial reforms that might pave the way for democracy
and dilute the party's power. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service).
ETA: Noon.

   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   MCCURRY _ WASHINGTON _ Michael McCurry, the mild-mannered,
wisecracking White House press secretary who has stood at the front
lines of President Clinton's troubles over this year's sex and
deception scandal, left his high-profile post on Thursday, saying
''frankly, the president misled me too.'' McCurry, a 43-year-old
father of three young children, signed off after 539 White House
news briefings and some 250 others given on the road, saying he
plans to spend time with his children, play golf and ''make a
little money.'' (Deans, Cox News Service 350).
</P>
<P>
   BLACK-FARMERS _ WASHINGTON _ A report issued Thursday by the
Agriculture Department's inspector general says the department's
civil rights division is in disarray, has ``no decisive
leadership'' and is making no progress in clearing up a backlog of
discrimination complaints by black farmers. (Moscoso, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS _ WASHINGTON _ A fundraising letter from a major GOPAC
contributor on behalf of the Southeastern Legal Foundation has
raised concerns among some Democrats that the foundation may have
abused its tax-exempt status. The foundation is challenging the
Clinton administration's plan to use statistical sampling in the
2000 census. A court has ruled sampling illegal in a separate
lawsuit filed by Speaker Newt Gingrich. (Sherman, Atlanta

Clinton-Lewinsky grand jury probe on Friday, TV will be there to

   CLINTON-PEROT _ WASHINGTON _ Checking the reaction, both pro and
con, to Ross Perot's announcement that he is launching a nationwide
petition drive asking President Clinton to resign. (Malone, Cox

</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-VIAGRA _ WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon expects to spend $50
million this year on the anti-impotence drug Viagra for military
personnel and veterans, a spokesman said Thursday. The expediture _
about half of what was requested _ comes at a time when military
chiefs are pressing Congress for more operational funds and when
the military health service is cutting back services for reasons of
economy. (Nesmith and Carollo, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   KING _ WASHINGTON _ Dexter Scott King, son of the assassinated
civil rights leader, led a forum Thursday on why he believes James
Earl Ray was ``not the trigger man'' in the assassination of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., and why the nation needs to re-examine the
circumstances of the 1968 shooting in Memphis. (Dart, Cox News
Service).

of breast cancer, a women's health group presents a televised
needle biopsy of an Atlanta woman during a press conference here.

<P>
   SPERLING _ WASHINGTON _ Set between the silverware and plates of
eggs benedict are tape recorders, which the diners dutifully punch
into action when the genial host, Godfrey ``Budge'' Sperling,
announces as always: ``The only ground rule here is that we're on
the record.'' Once again, a national newsmaker will barely find
time for a sip of coffee while answering questions at a Sperling
Breakfast _ a Washington institution that celebrates its 3,000th
session Friday. (Dart, Cox News Service 600&AMP;add).

   PEDESTRIAN-FATALITIES _ ATLANTA _ A two-day national conference
in Atlanta on preventing childhood pedestrian fatalities discussed
``traffic calming'' features _ such as speed humps, curb extentions
and refuge islands. But the most obvious pedestrian aid, which is
only now debuting in some suburban Atlanta neighborhoods, and is
still nonexistent in many others, is the sidewalk. ''We need
policies that say the sidewalk goes in as soon as the street gets
built,'' said Dan Burden, a Florida based pedestrian advocate and

be filed against company executives in such cases, much less murder

HONG KONG ANNIVERSARY OVERSHADOWED BY WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ China celebrated 49 years as the communist People's
Republic Thursday with performances, fireworks and speeches, but
regional economic turmoil and devastating floods cast a shadow over
this year's festivities.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech in Beijing, Premier Zhu Rongji praised
socialism's ``superiority and vitality,'' but acknowledged the
``international financial market has brought difficulties and
pressure to bear on China's growth.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, the rich capitalist enclave that returned to
Chinese rule last July 1, the 15-month-old Asian crisis cast a
broader shadow over festivities than in mainland China, which has
been largely insulated from the economic storm.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's open markets have been severely rattled by the
crisis, with property values dropping around 50 percent and the
stock market down over one-half from last year. Unemployment is at
15-year-high of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   China, however, has been spared some of the crisis' damage
because of its closed capital markets. Zhu asserted that China is
expanding foreign trade and industrial production and will have a
strong harvest despite the floods.
</P>
<P>
   But many economists say the weakened economies and currencies of
China's neighbors, as well as the costly damages brought on by
flooding, will make it impossible for China to meet this year's
target growth rate of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The target is considered the baseline necessary to create enough
jobs for tens of millions of workers who are losing cradle-to-grave
benefits as state-owned enterprises restructure. Meanwhile, the
International Monetary Fund this week cut its growth forecast for
China to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Outside analysts worry that Zhu, the strongest proponent of
swift and sometimes painful reforms, has recently backslid on
promises to privatize housing and trim the debt-ridden state
sector.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the flooding that swept south-central and
northeastern China this summer _ the worst since 1954 _ officially
claimed 3,004 lives and cost more than $36 billion in losses. The
government has said the disaster could shave between half and one
percent off gross domestic product projections.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, officials emphasized the positive Thursday,
praising soldiers involved in flood relief and launching lavish
celebrations in Tiananmen Square under the portrait of communist
China's founder Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Hong Kong's bad news compounded as car distributor
Dah Chong Hong and industrial group Chen Hsong Holdings announced
layoffs, as did Cathay Pacific and filmmaker Golden Harvest.
Retailer Dickson Concepts Ltd. announced its third pay cut this
year, affecting 1,600 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, several hundred workers organized by the Hong Kong
Federation of Trade Unions marked through downtown shouting angry
slogans urging the government to take action. The government has
already intervened in the stock market, using an estimated $18.7
billion of public money to buy blue-chip shares.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa used his National Day
speech not to answer critics, but to promote patriotism and
cooperation with leaders in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But some locals said they were more concerned with Hong Kong's
bottom line than with talk of brotherhood with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have Chinese blood, but honestly I have penetrated
Western culture,'' said Francis Yau, 36, a computer salesman who
was watching a patriotic show by PLA forces. ``Hong Kong people
still don't totally agree with everything China is doing.''

STOCK MARKET FALL DOES SERIOUS DAMAGE TO NISSAN'S FINANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The destructive impact of Tokyo's tumbling stock market
on corporate Japan turned apparent Thursday when Nissan Motor Corp.
announced a severe decline in the value of its securities
portfolio, which will likely erase profits for the six months that
ended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Japan's second-largest car maker, said it would
record a 76 billion yen paper loss, about $553 million at current
exchange rates, because the value of certain marketable securities
it holds had fallen below the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Before the announcement Thursday evening, Nissan's shares had
sunk to a 15-year low of 315 yen, or $2.33, on heavy volume. Rumors
that the troubled auto manufacturer, struggling to reduce some of
the 4 trillion yen in debt it will have at the end of this fiscal
year in March, would fail to post a profit contributed to the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In May, when the benchmark Nikkei 225 index stayed largely in
the 15,500-point range, the company predicted its profits in the
first six months of the fiscal year would roughly equal last year's
net income for the period of 38.5 billion yen. On Thursday the
Nikkei closed at 13,197.12, the latest in a series of 12-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   While Nissan was one of the first to report the extent of the
stock market's damage to its finances, Nissan's disclosure is only
the tip of the iceberg. Trading companies and steel companies, in
particular, have large portfolios, as do insurers.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Japanese companies have carried their securities
portfolios at book value, rather than at current market prices. But
in 2000, they will be required to adopt what's known as
mark-to-market accounting, which will better reflect the real value
of their holdings, and some corporations have moved to adopt the
standard ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of Japan's debt-laden financial institutions are
now haunting those companies. Many companies hold bank stocks as a
result of the keiretsu system, the system of cross-shareholding
that has created powerful clusters of businesses financed by a core
bank or banks. Bank stocks have collapsed, and with them, the
portfolios of a good part of corporate Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In Nissan's case, the market has punished the car company not
only for its own problems but that of its main bank, Fuji Bank,
regarded by analysts as one of the most troubled in Japan.

RALLY IN BONDS CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury prices surged again Thursday for the fourth
consecutive session and pushed yields down to levels not seen since
1967, reflecting a growing investor migration out of stocks and
into the safety of government securities.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in bonds was also helped by a monthly report from the
nation's factory purchasing executives that showed further weakness
in American manufacturing _ the fourth consecutive month of
decline. Bond investors regarded that report as fresh evidence that
economic turmoil abroad is slowing the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond rose 1 10/32 to a price of 109 26/32. Its
yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.88 percent
from the previous 31-year low of 4.97 percent set on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treasury securities continued on their moonshot,'' said Donald
Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. Worldwide
alarm over falling stock prices, he said, means that ``demand for
Treasury securities is coming from all quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine said he believes the Federal Reserve's decision Tuesday to
lower interest rates by one-quarter point was merely the first step
in the easing process; another quarter-point reduction will likely
come at its policymaking committee's next meeting in November, he
said. Lower rates would increase the value of bonds already in
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market may also have derived some strength from
expectations that the September employment report, scheduled for
release Friday by the Labor Department, will show that job growth
slowed because of weakening demand for American exports, which
depressed manufacturing production and employment.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists have forecast that the economy added 195,000
jobs last month following a gain of 365,000 during August. They
also have predicted that the unemployment rate for September held
steady at 4.5 percent.

 &HT;    Non-profit agency works to get seperated families together
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Beda Warrick decided to trace her roots about a year
ago, searching for the parents who had put her up for adoption as
an infant.
</P>
<P>
   She found her birth father in Maine, her birth mother in New
Jersey, and a passel of biological siblings in between. Now the
39-year-old Atlanta accountant is trying to help others who wish to
find a child or birth parents. She's organizing Georgia's version
of RegDay, an event that draws attention to the International
Soundex Reunion Registry, the world's oldest, largest and most
successful free mutual-consent registry.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone separated from a blood relative by adoption, divorce or
war can sign up. If the non-profit agency mets a match, it puts
both parties together. Since 1975, the Carson City, Nev.-based
group has matched up 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Like tens of thousands of adoptees and birth parents, Warrick
had to plow through official roadblocks designed to seal adoption
records permanently. She found her birth parents not through the
registry but her own hard work _ and a lot of luck. All but three
states _ Kansas, Tennessee and Alaska _ seal records, and adoptees
can get birth certificates bearing only their names and the names
of their adoptive parents. Birth parents can't get information,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Although Georgia's only RegDay site is at a Roswell Wal-Mart _
where volunteers will distribute registry forms and answer
questions _ anyone can register by phoning 702-882-7755.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of names are in the ISRR computers, and
more than 1,000 new registrations are processed monthly, says
Anthony Vilardi, its registrar.
</P>
<P>
   For most adoptees and birth parents, he said, curiosity begins
early and never ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I processed a woman this week who was adopted in 1904,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Motivations vary, from curiosity, to finding a way to deal with
guilt, to a driving need to know about family genetics, heritage
and history, said Dr. Richard Winer, a Roswell psychiatrist who
counts adoptees and birth parents among his clients
</P>
<P>
   ``I see more adoptees who are very curious than the other way
around,'' Winer said. ``It's an idea of wholeness.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick was adopted when she was four days old. She decided to
search for her roots, in part to know something about family
heritage and medical history. She found out her birth mother and
father had never married, and as was the custom of the day, her
birth mom had come South on a train to surrender her for adoption
in West Palm Beach, Fla. ``We all have the idea that our biological
parents didn't want us, and we want to know why,'' Warrick said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, she said she's getting along well with her biological
parents, and says her search strengthened her relationship with her
adoptive mother.

 &HT;    High hopes of `Antz' flawed by predictable script
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When our nebbishy hero, Z, frets to his shrink about being
``middle child in a family of 5 million,'' the voice is instantly
recognizable as Woody Allen's. The body isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting six legs, a set of antennae and a bulbous posterior, Z
looks exactly like his gazillion neighbors. But he's about to make
a very distinct impression, as he literally decides to walk (and
dance) to his own beat in ``Antz.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest visually remarkable, computer-animated feature
that, like ``Toy Story,'' finds witty human satire in the least
human places.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Z is a reluctant worker in a totalitarian culture, an ant
colony plastered with pointed banners (``Let's Work!'' ``Conquer
Idleness,'' etc.). While his fellow miner Azteca (Jennifer Lopez)
and soldier pal Weaver (Sylvester Stallone) are content with their
lives, Z isn't at all.
</P>
<P>
   In a Disney film, this would be the cue for the
someday-I'll-find-my-place-in-this-world song.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't a musical. And ``Antz'' is from DreamWorks, which
is getting a head-start on Disney's similarly themed computer epic,
``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Z isn't the only ant dissatisfied with his life.
Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) also chafes at her royal duties. But
as the Queen (Anne Bancroft) reminds her, ``Everyone has their
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a thesis statement screaming to be disproved.
``Antz'' spins an elaborate ``be yourself'' theme by sending Z and
Bala outside the anthill, where they encounter vicious killer
termites, fatal magnifying glasses that shoot burning sun rays,
gummy human feet and a place of rotting food and spilled colas,
known to the ants as ``insectopia.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the script of ``Antz'' is sometimes as
predictable as its visuals are not. It's a one-joke movie.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's 30-year-old, neurotic-dweeb shtick only underscores the
sense that the flick is constructed of secondhand or recycled bits.
Lacking the moments of giddy joy, surprise and wit that made ``Toy
Story'' a marvelous blend of technology and storytelling, ``Antz''
can feel pre-programmed. It lacks the kind of individuality that
its hero is striving to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Sylvester
Stallone. Directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson. Rated PG. 1
hour, 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A visual picnic that's marred only by a so-so
script.

 &HT;    Exquisite `Dreams' is heaven-sent
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's payback time.
</P>
<P>
   Having sat stone-faced and unmoved through ''Simon Birch,'' I
now find myself choking up at the mere memory of certain scenes
from the new fantasy drama ``What Dreams May Come.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a doctor who, near the beginning of the
movie, is killed in an automobile accident. Although the bulk of
the movie takes place after he enters the afterlife, the film's
true focus is on matters of life, not death. Especially on how the
ways we live in the here and now can affect the hereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Which, according to director Vincent Ward, is a glorious visual
feast. As in the little-seen 1984 picture ``Made in Heaven,'' this
movie says we create our own private heaven. Thus, for Williams,
whose grieving widow (Annabella Sciorra) is a painter, heaven is a
radiant smorgasbord of painterly images _ the impressionists, the
Hudson Valley school, Maxwell Parrish. There's even a populist dash
of Disney's ``Fantasia.'' Other heavens resemble Venice in the
Renaissance, a court masque or a sumptuous opera set.
</P>
<P>
   Hell also figures in the film. Its gates are a graveyard of
wrecked ships; its imagery is borrowed heavily from Bosch and Dore.
</P>
<P>
   But hell isn't other people, as Sartre insisted in ``No Exit.''
Rather, hell is the nightmare prison of anguished self-involvement
and depression. ``Hell isn't fear and pain,'' says one character.
``The real hell is your life gone wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dreams May Come'' is a hybrid _ a tear-jerker
phantasmagoria. The title is from Shakespeare, the plot has echoes
of Greek mythology (Orpheus and Eurydice) and the look is as
extravagantly fantastic as anything Ken Russell or Terry Gilliam
has ever dreamed up. But the tone and theology are pure Hollywood,
closer to ``Ghost'' than ``The Seventh Seal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the emotional issues are direct and powerful. The death of
children. The death of a spouse. Even the pain of putting an
elderly pet to sleep. We are reminded again and again that
simplistic is sometimes just a hairbreadth away from primal.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is effective in the central role. He rarely lapses into
his smarmy side, and he has been lucky in his supporting cast _
Sciorra, Cuba Gooding Jr., Max von Sydow. Still, he lacks emotional
complexity, which, unfortunately, mirrors the film's own lack
thereof.
</P>
<P>
   That said, I wouldn't have missed ``What Dreams May Come'' for
anything. My advice: Check your cynicism at the door and bring a
box of Kleenex. Better bring two.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dreams May Come''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra and Cuba Gooding Jr.
Directed by Vincent Ward. Rated PG-13 for emotional and visual
intensity. 1 hour, 46 minutes.
</P>

 &HT;    This `Pigeon' more like a turkey
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's happening. Low-budget independent films are becoming as
generic and self-cannibalizing as some Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
   First came a string of interchangeable big-city, coffeehouse,
should-I-leave-my-boyfriend gabfests among young professionals
(``Walking and Talking,'' ``Naked in New York,'' ``Celeste Calls
Up,'' etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Now come all the Quentin Tarantino/Coen Brothers clones,
throwing in serial killers, small-town crackers and general bad
taste. (Some examples looming on the horizon: ``Very Bad Things,''
and a bigger-budget exploration of the same territory, ``A Simple
Plan.'')
</P>
<P>
   The newest from this mold, ``Clay Pigeons,'' has the imprimatur
of three indie regulars, Vince Vaughn, Joaquin Phoenix and Janeane
Garofalo. They're the best things going in a movie that has both
too much and too little going on.
</P>
<P>
   The flick kicks off outside small-town Mercer, Mont. Enjoying an
afternoon of target practice, Earl (Gregory Sporleder) aims the gun
at his pal Clay (Joaquin Phoenix), accusing him of sleeping with
Earl's wife, Amanda (Georgina Cates).
</P>
<P>
   Instead of killing Clay, though, Earl shoots himself. That way,
he figures his death will be pinned on Clay.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, I wouldn't give away a plot twist like this one. But
it's only the first in a series of implausibilities. If you buy
this revenge-by-suicide notion, you might enjoy ``Clay Pigeons.''
It mixes murder and rural eccentricity with little attention paid
to logic. By the time a serial killer shows up, you'll hardly
notice, since the town's entire population seems to be borderline
insane.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn plays Lester, a drifter with a good-ol'-boy enthusiasm
and a goofy laugh; it's a terrific performance that's squandered on
this material. Same goes for Garofalo, playing a federal agent
tracking the killer. She puts her reliable deadpan spin on
insignificant lines and perks up the action, but can't save the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clay Pigeons''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joaquin Phoenix, Vince Vaughn. Directed by David
Dobkin. Rated R for violence, sexuality, language. One hour, 44
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A ``Fargo'' clone too self-conscious for its own
good.

 &HT;    Surprise! `SNL' skit works on the big screen
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Saturday Night Live'' has taken a lot of hits over the years,
none more persistent than this: So many of its skits just aren't
funny, people complain. And even the ones that are humorous, aren't
after going on for too long.
</P>
<P>
   So how much hope could there be for ``A Night at the Roxbury,''
the feature-film version of that already almost-stretched-too-thin
``SNL'' skit about a pair of clueless, head-bopping and
nightclubbing brothers? It's a one-note joke _ actually, it's the
first few notes of Haddaway's ``What Is Love?'' that always drown
out the TV brothers' lame pickup lines _ one that clearly seems
destined to play out as the next ``It's Pat.''
</P>
<P>
   Except it's not. Oh, ``A Night at the Roxbury'' is silly, all
right. It's so silly, it's downright embarrassing, but only because
you're laughing so hard at certain points, you're afraid they'll
send in the head usher to remove you from the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be tragic, because then you'd miss the picaresque
tale of the Brothers Butabi, high school graduates (it only took
them seven years each) and reluctant employees of their nouveau
riche pop's Beverly Hills silk plant boutique.
</P>
<P>
   But only by day. By night, Steve (Will Ferrell) and Doug (Chris
Kattan) have a dream. At first, it's just to gain admittance to
L.A.'s coolest nightclubs, with the coolest of them all being the
Roxbury. If it weren't the coolest, why would former ``21 Jump
Street'' star Richard Grieco _ playing a slightly older, more
bloated version of himself _ be such a cherished guest there?
</P>
<P>
   But what the Butabi boys really want to do is create their own
cool club! Nothing can deter them _ not rude rejections from club
bouncers and bodacious babes, and not the constant attempts of
their father (Dan Hedaya) to squelch their dream and create a
retailing dynasty by marrying Steve off to the daughter (Molly
Shannon) of the lamp store owner next door.
</P>
<P>
   And not their own social ineptitude, which _ like the boys'
seemingly endless supply of shiny suits _ anyone can spot a mile
away. Anyone except Steve or Doug Butabi, that is.
</P>
<P>
   They strut confidently down the beach, blissfully unaware that
their black thong bathing suits are on backward. They're never at a
loss for words _ ``Just what I thought, `Made in Heaven,''' Steve
coos to a startled woman after checking out the label on the dress
she's wearing _ even when they really, really should be.
</P>
<P>
   If it's memorably goofy lines and the silly fun of the ``There's
Something About Mary'' variety you want, ``Roxbury'' has it all.
But there's also something sweetly innocent about the way the
brothers support each other and react with genuine surprise when a
couple of great-looking women seem to fall for them.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a fairly coherent story line that wraps everything up
in less than 90 minutes, and the result is a better-than-average
comedy _ from the minds of ``SNL'' writers or anyone else, for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Doug Butabi would say when trying to re-create a pleasant
mood: ``Puppies and candy canes, all right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Night at the Roxbury''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Ferrell, Chris Kattan, Dan Hedaya, Molly Shannon.
Directed by John Fortenberry. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual
content. 1 hour, 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A night to laughingly remember.

COMMENTARY: THEY WILL FIND OUT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Very soon millions of people persecuted, arrested and tortured
for their religion will find out whether the United States has
finally confronted persecuting governments with a permanent
searchlight and the threat of penalty.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday or next week the Senate will vote on a bill, fought
out for almost two years, that creates a bipartisan congressional
commission to investigate the persecution of religious minorities _
numerically now heavily Christian. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commission will then recommend action to the president _
from political denunciation to withholding arms and loans. The
president will have 90 days to act _ and if not, he must explain
why. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It will not take long for the persecuted to find out how
Congress voted and whether President Clinton has squelched his
threat to veto because of his distaste for annoying the persecuting
dictatorships. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mouth to ear they will find out in underground Protestant and
Catholic churches in China and in prisons run by expert torturers
for those refusing to pray in government-run churches.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The persecuted will find out in the Sudan wilds and deserts
where Christian and animist refugees starve or die under government
attack. They will find out in Pakistani villages where Christian
homes have been set afire. Or in the village south of Cairo, Egypt,
where Coptic Christian clergy are sending frantic word that 1,000
Copts were tortured by Egyptian police.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have visited prisons in Asia, Eastern Europe under Communism
and in the Soviet gulag. They were all designed to cut prisoners of
conscience off from the world. But the prisoners somehow always
knew who in the free world remembered them and what they did. Their
knowledge became their embrace, instant and lasting.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It should have been simple _ a bill monitoring religious
oppression, and exacting some price from the persecutors, not as
high as a single hour in the cells.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill was eventually passed overwhelmingly in the House. It
had been held up there, and then blocked for months in the Senate,
by the huge lobbying funds of the China trade, and intense White
House pressure against the legislation. Supporters of the bill hope
the president will feel that he has enough problems these days
without also taking on millions of Americans fervently supporting
it.
</P>
<P>
   They organize days of prayer. They threaten not to vote for its
congressional opponents come November. In both Congress and in the
country, a coalition of conservatives, centrists and liberals have
been working for it. It is one of those rare pieces of legislation
that touches on how Americans see themselves, and American
idealism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, most of the press thought that was not a story,
except occasionally, in articles brushing off the anti-persecution
bill as conservative politics, or killing it off in embarrassing
premature obituaries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Oregonian of Portland is the only paper I know of that
accepted the implicit challenge in my many columns on persecution
of Christians: Get up and investigate yourself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Mary Robinson, the U.N. human rights chief, visited
and left China without meeting a single dissident. But Mark
O'Keefe, with David Aikman, a former Time reporter in China, met a
dozen in secret. They gave the journalists a breathtakingly
dangerous petition asking the government to let them worship as
dictated by conscience, not the Communist religion police.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of those who led the fight for the bill against
religious persecution. In Congress: Rep. Frank Wolf and Sen. Arlen
Specter, who introduced the original bill; Reps. Nancy Pelosi,
Chris Smith, Benjamin Gilman; retiring Sen. Dan Coats, former Sen.
Bill Armstrong, Sens. Don Nickles and Joseph Lieberman, and the
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, who gave the critical promise
to call a vote before Congress adjourns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outside Congress: many evangelical groups; the National Council
of Catholic Bishops; the Anti-Defamation League; the Episcopal
Church; the International Campaign for Tibet; the National Jewish
Coalition, and the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are deep differences among many of them. But they have in
common the knowledge that hatred and persecution are contagious,
and that so is the struggle against them. That is the particular
value of the bill now to be judged by Congress and by the people in
the cells.

 &HT;    COLUMN: So little left of Creola, storm can't do much
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A gentleman with the euphonious name of Pat Patrick called with
a timely question. ``Guess where the eye of the Hurricane Georges
is now!'' he directed.
</P>
<P>
   I was giving him a choice of Gulf Coast hurricane spots when he
cut me off. ``It's over Creola!'' he said triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   Aw, I thought, Creola, Ala., is too little and peaceful, even
insignificant, to attract the attention of a major hurricane. But
we used to count on them in years that had a six in them _ 1906,
1916, 1926 and 1936. As for an eye, we always met and recognized
that period of dead, ominous quiet that comes in the middle of a
storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   He has his sources down there, where I spent the happy years of
my childhood. Also at Buck's Crossing and Mount Vernon. Calvert and
maybe even Chunchula and Celeste. He stays informed because he,
too, grew up in South Alabama and still has kinfolks scattered
along the river.
</P>
<P>
   My own family wasn't able to show any concern about Creola, as
much as I extolled its charms all their lives. They clearly thought
that a spot so distant from Mobile would not warrant the attention
of a storm. By the old road, it was 18 miles north of Mobile; by
the new paved road, 15 miles. And since they have an expressway and
all kinds of signs, the distance may be even shorter now.
</P>
<P>
   You can spend a lot of midnight hours waxing anxious over the
approach of a hurricane to an old home place. I worried about
Mobile's old homes and century-plus oak trees, but I couldn't focus
on anything Georges would endanger in Creola. All that I loved is
already gone, wiped out by what some call progress.
</P>
<P>
   J. Paul Getty bought and destroyed the mills and the turpentine
still, the commissary and office, the house where we lived and all
the houses where our friends lived. His excuse was to make room to
explore for oil wells. I guess he found the fuel, because we saw on
our last visit months ago _ before I started crying and we left _ a
towerlike structure with flames leaping out of it.
</P>
<P>
   In Creola proper, three miles from the mill, the two-room
grammar school where I went is long gone, and so is Mays' store and
post office, by the gravel road where we would see salesmen passing
through and sell tickets to school plays and church box suppers.
</P>
<P>
   Out at the mill where my father's family operated a naval stores
business as far back as before the Civil War, the only thing that
remains is the millpond, which some fishers and hunters from Mobile
have acquired as a ``sportsman's club.'' This clear amber body of
water would placidly await the eye of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   So I didn't worry over Mr. Patrick's call. I guess I felt a
little homesick for all the hurricanes we lived through and the
calm with which we greeted them. My mother believed in having food
ready. (A fire in the wood range would have been hazardous.) She
almost always had a baked ham ready for sandwiches and a big
chocolate cake. Now people evacuate _ a word in hurricane
vocabulary. We stayed home, mainly, I suppose, because there was
not a plenitude of shelters and motels in our area.
</P>
<P>
   A friend sent me a little historical sketch of Creola by my
schoolmate Mildred Ellison Smith, and I was warmed and cheered to
learn that Creola is still served by freight and passenger trains
from the Southern Railway. Is the flag station still there, or did
some oil tycoon or maybe some hurricane get it?

 &HT;    Plant what you know, gardening expert advises
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ If it weren't for the cackles, you could
almost hear the gasps Thursday as Felder Rushing urged
horticulturists and gardener wannabes alike to toss the rules about
planting into Charleston Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ain't England, it's not Maine, and it's not Texas. We
waste a whole lot of time and money trying to grow things here that
aren't meant to be,'' the Mississippi extension agent and
best-selling author said.
</P>
<P>
   And, at least for locals attending the Charleston Garden
Festival seminar, set in a city steeped in rules and traditions,
that was a tough pill to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing said Southerners should concentrate on growing native
plants or at least tough ones that have adapted over the years to
extreme climate and soil conditions. That doesn't mean, however,
that gardeners shouldn't travel to see great gardens, borrow ideas
and experiment with new plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't appreciate what you are or where you live until you
get out and scratch and sniff,'' Rushing said.
</P>
<P>
   A seventh-generation gardener, Rushing lives in Jackson and
co-wrote 1993's best-selling gardening book, ``Passalong Plants''
(University of North Carolina Press, $16.95). He described four
types of gardeners: the ``wound-tight'' control freak who plays by
the rules, the cottage gardener who does what he likes, the
``mowers and blowers'' and the copiers/adapters.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing, who counts himself among the last, showed slides of his
own garden, complete with yard art _ old tires made into planters,
trees adorned with bottles and kitchen sinks converted into water
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a long time ago that no matter what you do, your
neighbors are going to talk about you anyhow, so what you do is
your own business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he appreciates good design, he learned a simple approach
to arranging plants. ``My rule of thumb is you always include
something roundy, something spiky and something frilly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But plants are his thing. He's a member of the American
Hemerocallis Society, but the only daylily he grows is the common
orange `Stella de Oro', found in ditch banks across the South. He
knows he will have no problem with it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, garden designer and writer Scott Ogden left
the audience with the same message. A nationally known expert on
garden bulbs, he urged the gardeners to refocus their efforts on
heirloom bulbs, such as crinum, that have flourished along Southern
roadsides for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Today's speakers include University of Georgia horticulture
professor Allan Armitage and Mike Shoup of Dahlonega, an expert on
heirloom roses.
</P>
<P>
   -- The festival, the Southeast's largest fall gardening event,
includes garden tours, a market and workshops through Sunday.
Information: 843-722-0661.

 &HT;    `Fakin'' needs a little more bakin'
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rodney King's famous 1992 muttering, ``Can we all (just) get
along,'' has somehow become a movie called ``Fakin' Da Funk.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavy-handed morality tale that would probably play better
shorter, and on television, works hard to be diversity training for
teenagers. But the depictions of stereotype after stereotype work
just as earnestly at stripping away its good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Fakin''' starts in Atlanta, when Joe (Ernie Hudson) and
Annabelle Lee (Pam Grier) end up with a Chinese baby after an
accidental switch at the adoption agency. (Notice their last name).
</P>
<P>
   The father, a preacher no less, demands that the agency ``find
us a black-looking baby. Take this child and bring out the right
order.'' And when his wife says she wants to keep the baby, he
shoots back: ``Can you make moo goo gai pan?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course the couple keeps Julian (Dante Basco), who by
elementary school has picked up the cadences of his father, is
dismissing his white female classmates' glances (``Look, baby, this
ain't `Ebony &AMP; Ivory'. I don't like cream in my coffee'') and goes
on to be in the choir. Accepted as ``black'' all the while.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for some vague reason, when Joe dies, Annabelle decides to
pack up Julian and his younger black brother, Perry (Rashaan Nall),
and move them to South Central Los Angeles. Julian and Perry's
first scene as the new boys in the 'hood is on the predictable
proving ground for young black men: the basketball court. And once
Julian shows the neighborhood players that he's got game, they
quickly conclude that ``Korean Abdul Jabbar,'' is ``Fakin' Da
Funk'' _ or pretending to be something he's not.
</P>
<P>
   What follows isn't hard to figure out: The guys who called the
Lee brothers a ``21 Jump Street starter kit'' on the court end up
being their best buddies. And the added, funny, story of a Chinese
exchange student (Margaret Cho) mistakenly being placed with a host
family (John Witherspoon, Nell Carter) in South Central ends with
the whole block practicing tai chi.
</P>
<P>
   But what is a bit perplexing is why Grier chose this background
kind of role after her supposed ``big comeback'' in Quentin
Tarantino's ``Jackie Brown.'' Or why ``Fresh Prince of Bel-Air''
star Tatyana Ali (Julian's love interest) decided to make her
post-television movie bow in what should be on the tube.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, this is a good answer to a lot of ``Whatever
happened to's?'' Tichina Arnold (``Martin''), rapper Tone Loc
(``Wild Thing'') and first ``Vibe'' television host Chris Spencer
all help make ``Fakin' Da Funk'' watchable, if not always
digestible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fakin' Da Funk''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pam Grier, Tatyana Ali, Ernie Hudson and Margaret Cho.
Directed by Tim Chey. Rated R for language. 1 hour, 29 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An after-school special in disguise.

 &HT;    `Impostors' barely rocks the boat
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flawed as it is, ``The Impostors'' is impossible to dislike.
It's too full of talented, entertaining people such as Lili Taylor,
Campbell Scott, Dana Ivey and Hope Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Stanley Tucci's follow-up to his immensely popular
``Big Night'' is something of a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to replicate '30s screwball comedy, the movie lacks
the crucial spark to make it sparkle. The result is a film that's
often amusing but rarely flat-out uproarious.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci and Oliver Platt play a pair of down-and-out actors in the
1930s. After a front-page run-in with an imperious Broadway ham
(Alfred Molina) who catches Platt spoofing his overripe Hamlet, the
two stow away on a luxurious ocean liner.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Molina is aboard, too, and our heroes spend most
of the movie trying to elude him and the ship's head steward
(Scott), a tyrannical Teuton with a dueling scar.
</P>
<P>
   The madcap tone is set less by the pair's travails than by the
passengers and crew. There's the social director (Taylor), who,
when she isn't fending off Scott's stilted advances, is a
sympathetic ally; a penniless widow (Ivey) on the hunt for a
wealthy new husband; her hilariously glum daughter (Davis); an
alcoholic, suicidal lounge singer (Steve Buscemi); and a half-dozen
others (Isabella Rossellini, Billy Connolly, Tony Shalhoub, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Individual comic sequences are sometimes successful, sometimes
not. The larger problem is that the script lacks the intricate
cohesiveness essential to farce. Plot complications don't build on
one another; they're simply tacked on (a conniving couple of
seducers, a terrorist with a cabin full of explosives).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the assorted characters are awfully funny, to the point
that they upstage the leads. Imagine the Marx Brothers, whose
``Monkey Business'' and ``A Night at the Opera'' this movie
recalls, being the butt of their comic chaos instead of the
instigators and you'll have an idea of the problem. Tucci and Platt
look funny together. They've been funny in other films. But somehow
they're not all that funny together.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the supporting players steal everything that's not
nailed down. Special mention must go to Scott. Everything he does
is amusing, from his stiff Germanic bearing to his clumsy but
insistent wooing of the uninterested Taylor. Catching up to her
after yet another attempt to corner the stowaways, he says
insinuatingly, ``The danger of the chase has made you perspire. It
has also made me ... moist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Impostors''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt. Directed by Tucci.
Rated R for language and sexual situations. At metro theaters.1
hour, 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Slight silly fun.

`A TALE OF AUTUMN': ELABORATE FANTASIES OF LOVE AND LONGING 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
(lb) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One way to look at the films of Eric Rohmer, in which
assorted combinations of attractive, cultivated Europeans rearrange
their lives amid much exquisitely verbalized soul-searching, is to
see them as sophisticated fairy tales.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespearean comedies for the modern professional class, they
presuppose a highly civilized code of behavior and advanced
educational level that in a Rohmer film could be taken as universal
givens. Despite whatever blows fate may deliver the characters, a
divine plan usually emerges that overrides earlier setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Rational decision-making pays off, as does trusting one's
deepest intuitions. True love _ or the closest thing to it that one
can find in this life _ is the ultimate reward, but it can't be
tasted until every moral quandary has been aired and resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Tale of Autumn,'' the final chapter in the director's
``Tales of the Four Seasons,'' is as sublimely warming an
experience as the autumn sun that shines benevolently on the
vineyard owned by the film's central character, Magali (Beatrice
Romond).
</P>
<P>
   A wiry, vital woman in her mid-40s with snapping eyes and an
unruly bush of hair, Magali, a widowed mother of two grown
children, is content with her life except for one thing. When
prodded by her married best friend, Isabelle (Marie Riviere),
Magali admits that she longs for a relationship with the right man
but believes it is too late for her to find love.
</P>
<P>
   Magali brings all the usual arguments to rationalize her
resignation. Potentially eligible partners would all want younger
women, she insists. And living in the country (in the gorgeous
Rhone Valley region of southern France), she is also isolated. When
Isabelle suggests placing a personal ad, Magali is revolted by the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Tale of Autumn'' follows the confusions that ensue when two
of Magali's friends decide to play matchmaker. Isabelle places a
personal ad in Magali's behalf, and when a courtly, eminently
suitable salesman named Gerald (Alain Libolt) responds, she
interviews him extensively before revealing that she is a merely
acting as an unbidden liaison to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Magali's son's girlfriend, Rosine (Alexia Portal),
whom Magali has taken under her wing, proposes to fix the older
woman up with her ex-lover and former professor, Etienne (Didier
Sandre).
</P>
<P>
   Both prospective partners are coaxed into attending the wedding
of Isabelle's daughter. The complications that follow at the
outdoor reception might be described as Rohmer's elegantly
psychologized and sublimated version of a classic French farce.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the story but the telling that makes ``A Tale of
Autumn'' such a rich, emotionally satisfying experience. As the
five main characters reveal their fantasies and fears, each emerges
as an astoundingly complex and fully rounded human being. By the
end of the film, Ms. Romond's Magali, an earthy, high-strung woman
with an arrogance that masks an underlying shyness, has come so
alive that you almost see her as a old friend.
</P>
<P>
   The film's plot, like that of other Rohmer films, is
mathematically schematic. Even before the equation has been
balanced, except for a twist here and there, you know where the
story will go. But the characters' depth, humanity and likability
make the expected payoff feel earned.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``A Tale of Autumn'' has its labored moments. Especially when
the talk turns to grapes and late vintages, it is pressing an
obvious metaphor a bit too aggressively. But the movie evokes such
a sensuous atmosphere _ bird song, wind, and light and shadow that
delineate the season and time of day with an astonishing precision
_ that you are all but transported into Magali's fields, where this
year's grapes promise to yield an especially fine vintage.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Tale of Autumn'' will be shown Friday night and Sunday at
Alice Tully Hall as part of the 36th New York Film Festival.

 &HT;    Fellini, Masina shine in `Nights of Cabiria'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one else in movies has a face like Giuletta Masina. Part
kewpie doll, part waif, with those huge Keane-kid eyes and just a
touch of Bette Davis as Baby Jane.
</P>
<P>
   Her looks were as unique as her talent. ``Chaplin-esque'' is the
word critics typically use, but it's not quite accurate. Her
naivete seems almost a self-protective bubble, her scrappiness more
instinctive.
</P>
<P>
   I can't think of a better introduction _ or re-introduction _ to
Masina than ``Nights of Cabiria.'' Filmed by her husband, Federico
Fellini, in 1957, the movie is a series of vignettes _ some
poignant, some funny, some wistful, some satiric _ that show us a
few days (and nights, naturally) in the life of a Roman prostitute
named Cabiria (Masina). A winner at Cannes and the Academy Awards,
the picture later provided the basis for ``Sweet Charity,''
starring Gwen Verdon on Broadway and Shirley MacLaine on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Cabiria is the eternal hooker with a heart of you-know-what.
Wandering the streets in her ankle socks and ratty fur, she's
hardly streetwise _ though she fancies herself so. But she is a
survivor. Her encounters with a bum of a boyfriend, a bum of a
movie star, a bum of another boyfriend _ you get the idea _
invariably end badly. Yet her resilience is both comic and
admirable. And one scene, in which a stage hypnotist gets her to
reveal her innermost longings, is as ineffably touching as anything
ever put on film.
</P>
<P>
   This new print hasn't just been spruced up for a new generation
_ seven minutes have been restored. A sequence called ''the man in
the sack,'' about a good Samaritan who feeds the city's poor, was
supposedly cut because the Vatican thought it made the church look
bad. True or not, the added section is welcome simply because it
gives us more Masina, more Fellini. More of both, please.
</P>
<P>
   One note to Fellini fans: This is not the over-the-top
``Fellini-esque'' maestro of ``8 1/2'' or ``Satyricon.'' This is
early Fellini. Simple. Toned down. Lovely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nights of Cabiria''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Starring Giuletta Masina. Directed by Federico Fellini.
Subtitles. Not rated, but the subject matter is sexual and adult. 1
hour, 57 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Another magical restoration.

 &HT;    CDC: Moms can get teens to use condoms
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Don't abandon the idea of parental guidance just yet.
Teens whose moms give them a heart-to-heart talk about condoms
before they become sexually active are much likelier to practice
safe sex, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Most sexually active teens, about 71 percent, say their moms
discuss condoms with them.
</P>
<P>
   But the key is for mothers to bring up the subject at an early
age, the CDC emphasizes. Teens who get the condom talk before they
have sex for the first time are three times more likely to use
condoms than teens who never discuss condoms with their mothers or
only after losing their virginity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised that parents made such a difference,'' said
CDC research sociologist Kim Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and other researchers interviewed 372 sexually active
teens, ages 14 to 17, and their mothers in Alabama, New York and
Puerto Rico. The study appears in Thursday's issue of the American
Journal of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not address the influence fathers may have on
teens' sexual behavior, because of the study's limited budget as
well as the absence of fathers in about half the families involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we know fathers are very important,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that teens who use a condom the first time
they have sex are 20 times more likely to subsequently use condoms.
The average age of first sexual experience in the study was about
14 years. The average age at which teens in the study discussed
condoms with their moms was 13.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC estimates that half of all new HIV infections in the
United States occur among young people under 25. Teens account for
3 million cases of other sexually transmitted diseases annually,
and 1 million teenage girls become pregnant each year.

 &HT;    CNN is brushing up image with a new set
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CNN will unveil a new anchor set and newsroom Monday, the
biggest change in the cable news network's on-air look in more than
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers won't be able to miss the new look, which includes the
Atlanta skyline behind the anchors and a new curved, wooden desk
with a cherry finish that gives off a reddish glow. The $7.5
million project, which also includes extensive renovation of the
newsroom, has been under construction since March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't changed the look of CNN in years,'' said Richard
Kaplan, president of CNN/U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``A set will never raise your ratings or cover up substantive
problems,'' he added. ``But what a good set will do is make it
easier for a viewer to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The new look will be nowhere near as big a break with tradition
as CNN competitor MSNBC's set, an exposed brick loftlike room that
Jay Leno once joked looked like a cross between a Lenscrafters and
a Bennigan's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just needed to freshen it up, bring it into the '90s,'' Sid
Bedingfeld, newly promoted executive vice president of CNN/U.S.,
said of the CNN set.
</P>
<P>
   The new CNN look, scheduled to appear on the air at 7 a.m.
Monday, will have the new wooden anchor desk at the front of the
viewer's TV screen. Behind the anchors, about 200 CNN staffers will
be working in the main CNN newsroom, with several clocks showing
different time zones also visible. On a back wall and above the
newsroom is a ``sign band'' of 15 CNN logos, which are gray with
red tubing. And below the sign band will be a series of photos of
the Atlanta skyline called a Duratrans, which will turn to night
photos during the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The anchors will sit on a newly built slab that actually juts
out over the CNN Center atrium, five stories overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tight in here,'' said Chuck Burleson, project manager
for Turner Properties. ``In the CNN Center, we basically have 15
pounds in a 10-pound bag.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN tour groups are already getting a sneak peek at the new
newsroom and anchor desk from a glassed-in corridor that's elevated
out of camera range.
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   CNN on the road
</P>
<P>
   CNN correspondent Larry Woods is on the road, re-creating John
Steinbeck's journeys in his 1962 book ``Travels With Charley.''
Woods, winner of an Edward R. Murrow Brotherhood Award for human
interest reporting, will retrace Steinbeck's route around the
perimeter of the United States from Connecticut to California. His
first report, an interview with Steinbeck's widow, Elaine, airs on
``CNN Sunday Morning'' (8-10 a.m.), and subsequent reports will
also air Sunday mornings. Woods also will write a weekly column for
CNN's Web site, http://www.cnn.com.
</P>
<P>
   A new anchor
</P>
<P>
   Also new at CNN: Anchor Carol Lin starts Monday on ``Early
Edition,'' the 7-9 a.m. ET show with Leon Harris. Lin, who's been a
national correspondent for ``Good Morning America'' and ``World
News Tonight,'' replaces Donna Kelley, who's moving to New York to
get married. Kelley will do free-lancing for CNN.

   NEW YORK _ In her poignantly witty, 12-part ``story quilt''
saga, ``The French Collection,'' Faith Ringgold makes her alter ego
Willia Marie Simone, a 16-year-old black girl who ``escaped the
cotton fields of Georgia and the side streets of Harlem'' in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Living it up in Paris as an artist and model, Willia has a slew
of improbable adventures, including dinner at Gertrude Stein's with
Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Langston Hughes and Nora Zeale
Hurston; a friendship with Josephine Baker, whose portrait she
paints as an odalisque, a la Matisse, and the proprietorship of an
artists' cafe bequeathed her by her white French husband, Pierre,
an older man whom she had all but abandoned at the altar.
</P>
<P>
   These and other Willia exploits, depicted by the distinctive
Ringgold mode of painting on ``quilts'' of stitched canvas bordered
with patchwork and written narrative, can be seen at the New Museum
of Contemporary Art in ``Dancing at the Louvre: Faith Ringgold's
French Collection and Other Story Quilts,'' organized by Dan
Cameron, senior curator at the museum. A blend of made-up tales,
ancestral sewing techniques, faux-naive folk art and the
sophisticated language of French modernism, the story quilts are
nothing short of wonderful. Ten on display here are from ``The
French Collection''; six others are from her most recent series,
``The American Collection,'' dealing with the life of blacks in the
United States. There are nine earlier works.
</P>
<P>
   In the French series, the yearning, questing, but au fond cool
Willia Simone is an amalgam of Ms. Ringgold's late mother, Willi
Posey, a fashion designer and dressmaker in Harlem, and Ms.
Ringgold herself, an ardent feminist and political activist known
for her efforts in behalf of black artists. Ms. Ringgold is also a
prize-winning author of children's books, the mother of two
scholars (both women) and a well-known figure on the college
culture circuit who has received no fewer than nine honorary
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Although the stories Ms. Ringgold tells in her quilts are made
up, they are based on her own and her family's lives. In dealing
with personal issues like love, marriage, motherhood, religion,
aspiration and death, they also touch on larger themes: women's
struggles _ particularly those of black women _ the relationship of
European to American civilization and the effects of history and
culture on individual lives.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Moroccan Holiday'' (1997), the last work of ``The French
Collection'' series, Willia converses with her daughter, Marlena,
against a background of four portraits she has painted of black
male icons: Frederick Douglass, Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X and the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; men who, she says, made it
possible for her to avoid living her life as ``a victim.'' But the
picture's narrative accompaniment reveals that the conversation
between the two women is about the vocation of motherhood versus
that of an artist, and the vastly superior chances for men _
exemplified by the four black heroes _ as opposed to women, to
affect the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motherhood is too often a trap, an excuse women have for
giving up their lives to others,'' Willia tells Marlena. ``I could
have sacrificed my art for motherhood and had anger instead of
guilt. But who wants to be an angry old woman?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most touching episodes in ``The French Collection''
is ``Matisse's Chapel'' (1991), a rendering of Matisse's famous
sanctuary for a Dominican nuns' order in Vence, France. Ms.
Ringgold packs the chapel with a congregation of dead relatives _
her mother, father, two brothers, a sister, grandparents, a
great-great-grandmother, aunts and uncles and others _ all dressed
in their finest (her sister, Barbara, is in her wedding gown).
</P>
<P>
   But the narrative tells us that the relatives, who sit with
churchly dignity in this shrine to God and European high culture,
are listening to a sickening story of slave ships told by Grandma
Betsy, a story of the loss of a people played off against the
individual losses memorialized in the painting.
</P>
<P>
   It took Ms. Ringgold, now 68, a while to arrive at her story
quilts, in which she has found a vigorous and audaciously offbeat
voice. She started out as a conventional painter of landscapes
while teaching art in New York City public schools. In 1963,
influenced by James Baldwin and Le Roi Jones, she began putting
political punch into her paintings.
</P>
<P>
   An early mural shown here, ``The Flag Is Bleeding'' (1967), a
big, flat wall work whose imagery echoed the work of Jasper Johns,
is a statement about troubled race relations. Not the most
persuasive of messages from that explosive era, it nevertheless
symbolizes Ms. Ringgold's conversion to activism.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s her work began to express itself in terms of
gender, focusing on black women, their trials, achievements and
efforts at empowerment, subjects that have become her life's work.
She started collaborating with her mother, who did the cutting and
sewing for such Ringgold creations as soft sculptures, masks, dolls
and paintings on cloth, whose subjects ranged from people she knew
to the unsolved 1981 serial killings of black children in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Their last joint effort, completed shortly before the mother's
death in 1981, is a quilt titled ``Echoes of Harlem.'' One of the
first Ringgold works in this genre, a rather static depiction of 30
painted faces on a canvas pieced out with multicolored quilting
strips, it comes across as a warm-up for her later productions.

NEW YORK: later productions. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her first story quilt was done in 1983. Titled ``Who's Afraid of
Aunt Jemima?'', it's a grid of comical, childlike portraits,
accompanied by the rambling success story _ in black dialogue _ of
``Aunt Jemima Blakey'' and her children, who made a fortune in the
restaurant business.
</P>
<P>
   It transforms the derogatory image of Aunt Jemima into that of a
beautiful, successful businesswoman in a chic hat, probably based
on Willi Posey. Having found her real metier, Ms. Ringgold began to
work exclusively in the narrative quilt form, a singular vehicle
for her complex musings about ancestry, the black-white world and
her relation to it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best of her early quilts are several that deal with
family life in Harlem, like the popular ``Tar Beach'' (1988), whose
title is the same as that of Ms. Ringgold's acclaimed children's
book, published in 1985. Set in the 1930s, the scene is a homey,
nighttime family picnic on a rooftop (the Tar Beach of summer
stay-at-homes), against the glamorously lighted backdrop of the
George Washington Bridge. As her siblings sleep on a blanket,
Cassie Lightfoot, the 8-year-old narrator, flies over the bridge,
claiming it as her own. The quilt is the first of a sprightly
series dealing with women and famous bridges, whose spans symbolize
fantastical pathways to woman's freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The American Collection,'' the narrator is now Marlena, the
daughter of Willia, and the powerfully stated issues ``are less
about art and more about America,'' Ms. Ringgold said. And in
truth, the American quilts _ without the customary narrative
borders _ are starker, harder hitting and more strikingly composed
than the French group. The first of them, ``We Came to America''
(1997), depicts New York Harbor aswarm with drowning blacks forced
overboard from a burning slave ship in the background. In front, a
black Statue of Liberty with dreadlocks holds in one arm a torch
and in the other a symbol of hope, an infant rescued from the
agonized horde behind her.
</P>
<P>
   But the set piece of the ``American'' group here is ``Born in a
Cotton Field'' (1997), a dramatically composed Nativity scene in
which a haloed black infant sits between doting parents in a field
of cotton. Behind them looms the Prince of Night, a huge black
figure with arms protectively outstretched. Shocked villagers,
their faces partly hidden by cotton bolls, witness the holy birth.
Based on a fairy tale composed by Marlena, the scene pays tribute
to a slave child in Africa who, if successfully hidden, will
eventually lead the other slaves to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   All praise to the vivid sense of history, the audacious
imagination and above all the irrepressible joie de vivre that have
produced this appealing show. It will be supplemented by a
selection of additional quilts from ``The American Collection,''
along with other works, on view at the ACA Galleries, 41 E. 57th
St., from Oct. 10 through Nov. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing at the Louvre: Faith Ringgold's French Collection and
Other Story Quilts'' remains at the New Museum of Contemporary Art,
583 Broadway, near Prince Street, through Jan. 3.

CORPORATE SPONSORS GET ON THE `CART' TO REACH THE MASSES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG HASSELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Some impressive autos have roared into Houston for the
Texaco Grand Prix, and they're burning plenty of high-octane
marketing fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors are shelling out $400 million to finance
racing teams in the Cart FedEx Championship Series _ which includes
Sunday's race _ and adorn them with names like Marlboro Team
Penske, the Miller Lite Ford and the Nicoderm CQ-Nicorette Champ
Car.
</P>
<P>
   Logos are slapped high and low, covering the cars, the drivers
and a good number of the non-moving surfaces surrounding the
downtown course.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dominant symbols flashing around Houston will be
the Texaco star. In addition to the millions it pays to sponsor
drivers Michael Andretti and Christian Fittipaldi, Texaco is
spending more than $1 million to be the primary sponsor of the
Houston race. That gives the oil company the right to put its logo
at 60 ``key locations'' around the course. And that's not including
the starting point and the finish line, which will be branded with
the name of the race _ Texaco Grand Prix of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   As if that sort of exposure weren't enough, Texaco has paid for
a slew of television commercials and billboards touting its
connection to the big race.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco has jumped on the racing bandwagon with both feet
because, ``Racing is one of the two growth sports right now, the
other being golf,'' said Kevin Ilges, manager of sponsorships and
events at Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   The cars racing at a grand prix have some of the best engines,
the best components, the best fuels and the best drivers in the
world. That's the sort of company an auto-related sponsor loves to
keep.
</P>
<P>
   ``That speaks volumes about the performance capabilities of the
products that are involved,'' said Sixtus J. Oechsle III, executive
director of corporate identity at Shell Oil Co., which is
sponsoring a car in Houston's grand prix. ``It's key to having
consumers feel comfortable with putting these products in their own
cars.''
</P>
<P>
   While racing is a natural for companies selling auto parts,
motor oil and gasoline, it also attracts sponsorships from
retailers, beer makers and a long-distance telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a truly international sport that does great at the
gate and has a very high demographic profile, which is very
important to sponsors,'' said Bret Werner, spokesman for
Championship Auto Racing Teams, the sanctioning organization for
the FedEx Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   According to CART studies, spectators at grand prix races are
twice as likely as the average American to have graduated from
college. They have an above-average household income of $52,700.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing is hot, and its gaining in mainstream popularity,''
said Bob Dorfman, a vice president and sports analyst for the San
Francisco-based advertising agency Foote Cone &AMP; Belding.
</P>
<P>
   During the past seven years, total race attendance has jumped
from 112,000 per weekend to 147,000 per weekend. At the same time,
the number of races has grown as CART adds events in cities like
Houston. Total attendance at CART races has soared nearly 50
percent, from 1.7 million in 1990 to 2.5 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   All reserved seats in Houton already are sold out. More than
200,000 people from around the world will attend the event,
including some of the pre-race practice runs. In addition, the race
will be televised live on ABC and rebroadcast by ESPN to 188
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Response to the inaugural Texaco Grand Prix of Houston has far
exceeded our expectations,'' said race general manager Jim Melvin.
``We were sure we would have a lot of interest from ticket buyers
all over the country, but the demand for tickets, paddock passes
and corporate hospitality has genuinely surprised all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   While it might surprise locals, the success of racing does not
come as a shock to some advertisers, who could see years ago that
it was emerging as a popular sport in America.
</P>
<P>
   Back around 1971, when Congress eliminated tobacco advertising
from television, the big cigarette makers started looking about for
other promotional venues.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious solution was billboards, which they latched onto in
a big way. A less obvious strategy was sponsoring sporting events.
Since 1971, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. has sponsored several
catagories of racing, including the Winston Cup Auto Racing
Circuit, Winston Drag Racing, and the now defunct Camel GT Series
and the Camel Mud and Monster Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing is made for television. That's the key,'' said Dr. Alan
Blum, a Baylor College of Medicine physician who has tracked
tobacco companies' advertising practices for more than 30 years.
``There would be no tobacco advertising of racing were it not on
TV. This allows them to get around laws that prohibit them from TV
advertising. If I were a cigarette marketer, I would have done
exactly the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlboro alone spent $20 million on racing promotions in 1992.
Fifteen percent of Marlboro's ads sport racing themes, according to
company documents released during recent legal battles with the
federal government and sundry state agencies. &QL;

   ``The tobacco industry has a narrowed field of communication
channels to consumers now. That makes every channel that's left to
us _ like racing _ more valuable,'' said Bert Kramer, sponsorship
manager for Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., which sponsors Team
Kool Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing is a sport that is high tech, that's contemporary,
that's exciting,'' Kramer said. ``Those are attributes our
consumers tells us are important to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing fans also are more likely to be smokers than the general
public. According to studies cited by Brown &AMP; Williamson, 36
percent of CART spectators are smokers, compared to 22 percent of
the total U.S. public.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes racing a good vehicle for us,'' he said. ``This
gets our brand out to the adult population and the smoking
public.''
</P>
<P>
   According to those company documents released during the various
court cases, tobacco companies found that racing projects a
masculine, powerful and dangerous image. Fans see race car drivers,
like cowboys, as loners, adventurers and survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies have found racing to be fertile ground, and
that has attracted the attention of SmithKline Beecham, which makes
products for those who want to kick the habit: Nicorette gum and
the NicoDerm CQ patch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost 75 percent of smokers polled say they would like to
quit, so we are making our name visible at venues that cater to
smokers,'' said Steve Kapur, associate director of promotion at
SmithKline Beecham, which sponsors the Nicoderm CQ-Nicorette Champ
Car. ``Racing is a good venue to reach smokers.''
</P>
<P>
   To piggyback onto its race sponsorship, the company has
dispatched to Houston its NicoVan _ a 34-foot long motorhome that
provides free counseling and tips for stopping smoking. The van
made stops at several Houston area stores this week, plus it will
be parked at the track area this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart is another sponsor looking to get more bang for its
sponsoring buck by mingling with the general public. On Thursday,
drivers Michael Andretti and Christian Fittipaldi appeared at
separate Kmart stores in Houston. Kmart also has the rights to sell
Houston Grand Prix merchandise in its stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will drive our sales up, definitely,'' said Nicole Brown,
who directs Kmart's motorsports vendor relations.
</P>
<P>
   Not every big corporation is eager to write a multi-million
dollar check and become the next big sponsor of an auto racing
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very expensive thing,'' said Jim Carter, vice president
of marketing at Exxon Co., which is not a big racing sponsor.
``It's hard for us to justify. Exxon already is a well-known
company, and name recognition is the prime benefit of a
sponsorship. We try to deliver a message instead of just saying,
`We're Exxon.'''
</P>
<P>
   No sponsor will tell you that participating in racing is cheap,
but they will argue that it's cost-effective. One favorite bit of
evidence is a report by Financial World magazine and Julius &AMP;
Associates in 1992, which examined 1,100 sporting events and
concluded automobile races represented eight of the 10 best
corporate sports sponsorship values.
</P>
<P>
   According to a CART study, 46 percent of grand prix spectators
say they are more likely to try a brand for the first time if the
product sponsors a favorite team or driver. The norm for this
measure when applied to all types of sponsorships is closer to 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a loyal and knowledgable group,'' Shell`s Oechsle
said. ``They really care about engines and performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Locating this race in Houston allows CART sponsors to bring
their show into a whole new part of the country. There are no other
grand prix races in the Sunbelt or southern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is a state we've never raced in,'' said Ron Richards,
vice president of communications at CART. ``This allows our
sponsors to reach into a whole new market for racing.''
</P>
<P>
   When the race is over and the drivers have headed off for their
next contest, the marketing effort will just be beginning for one
Houston company. Koch Materials Co., one of the largest asphalt
companies in the country and a division of Houston-based Koch
Industries, supplied the binding material that holds the course's
asphalt together.
</P>
<P>
   The streets constituting the grand prix course _ including
Austin, Crawford, Capitol and Clay streets _ were paved with
demanding quality specifications so they can withstand the pressure
of cars flying along at 200 miles per hour, heating their massive
tires up to 300 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come up with a new product, something that hasn't been
used anywhere,'' said Jerry Brown, a sales representative for Koch
Materials. ``It is supposed to last anywhere from 15 to 20 years
under normal circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Standard asphalt lasts about 10 years before it needs
resurfacing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the course streets were repaved earlier this summer, city
engineers from Arizona, Florida and Kansas came to watch the
process and check out the quality of the new paving material. Those
engineers, potential clients for a company like Koch, can be
expected to come back for another look after the Texaco Grand Prix
of Houston has blazed past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for the race to demonstrate the superiority of
our product,'' Brown said. ``This will be the smoothest, most
durable two miles in Houston.'' &QL;

FAA APPROVES $2.6 BILLION EXPANSION OF ST. LOUIS AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday
approved an expansion plan at Lambert-St. Louis International
Airport expected to give Trans World Airlines a financial boost and
reduce flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have promised lawsuits to delay the expansion, saying
the plan would increase noise and needlessly displace thousands of
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion plan would add a third runway at Lambert, one of
TWA's hubs. The $2.6 billion plan, which would also add terminal
space and improve roads, would be one of the largest airport
expansions ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to look back on this one day and realize it was a
pivotal moment for St. Louis' future,'' said Jeff Rainford, a
spokesman for Citizens for a Modern Airport, a coalition of civic
and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The improvements would be completed in 2003 at the earliest. The
expansion would be St. Louis' largest public-works project ever.
Most civic and business leaders, including TWA, back the plan.
</P>
<P>
   TWA says delays cost it millions of dollars a year because poor
weather can leave Lambert with just one working runway. The airline
had been shaky financial ground in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the airport estimates that delays could cost
airlines $400 million annually by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would add a 9,000-foot-runway but would require the
removal of more than 2,000 homes in the adjacent city of Bridgeton.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, known as W-1W, would double parking and terminal space
and increase passenger gates by about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents question how much the plan would help. They say
W-1W would not reduce delays as much as promised. They have asked
the FAA to conduct a computer simulation of air traffic under the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has divided residents in the western suburbs since the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents in Bridgeton, St. Charles and other neighboring
towns mobilized against Lambert's expansion from the start. This
week, dozens protested at the mayor's office. A vanload of
opponents even drove to Kansas City last spring to picket a speech
by the airport's director.
</P>
<P>
   Other Bridgeton residents formed a group called ``Let's Get on
With Our Lives'' and want the airport to buy their homes as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeton officials said they planned to sue St. Louis in state
court, saying the city has no right to unilaterally expand the
airport outside its boundaries. Other cities plan to sue in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to come,'' said Rowan Raftery of
Bridgeton Air Defense, an opposition group. ``What this does is it
gives us an opportunity to challenge the decision. Once this gets
into the courts, that will cast a lot of doubt, and they could tell
them to go back and start over.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Air Traffic Controllers Association and the Air
Line Pilots Association see the need to expand but oppose W-1W.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert is the second-fastest-growing airport in the world.
Airport officials project traffic to double in 20 years. The
airport has consistently ranked in the top five in delays among
major U.S. airports.

 &HT;    PEROT LAUNCHES PETITION DRIVE AMID CATCALLS FROM CLINTON CAMP
 &HT;    340&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and its allies Thursday ridiculed
Ross Perot's call for a national petition drive to ask President
Clinton to resign because of his ``erratic'' behavior in the Monica
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ross the hoss is back _ bucking again,'' quipped sharp-tongued
loyalist James Carville.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas businessman and founder of the Reform Party, speaking
on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' Wednesday night, issued a call to
veterans, ministers, small business owners and others to circulate
petitions locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will show them that we care about morals and ethics,'' he
said. ``We'll show
</P>
<P>
   them that we care about duty, honor and country. And, more than
anything else, we'll show them that the man who sends our children
into combat, and a man who can press the nuclear button, has got to
be a stable person who tells the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential press secretary Michael McCurry brushed aside the
Perot challenge, saying, ``His comments in the past several days
confirm the good judgment of the American people who did not elect
him president.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond to Perot's promise on CNN that he would not run
for president again if Clinton resigns, McCurry joked, ``That's
admittedly the first compelling argument we've heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party chairman Russell Verney said of the reaction from
the Clinton forces: ``We would expect nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the petition drive, conceived only 24 hours before
it was unveiled, would be led by Reform Party state leaders. Part
of their job, he said, would be to send volunteers to collect
signatures at polling places on Election Day, Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Verney said that an Internet site, whose address (www.perot.org)
Perot held up for viewers, has received more than 500,000 visits
since Wednesday's announcement. The Internet site includes petition
forms that ask Clinton to ``resign now for the good of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot envisions a convoy of trucks bringing the signed petitions
to Washington in early December.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Response from the political establishment has been low-key.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, might be a natural ally,
since he has called for Clinton to step down, but his response was
cautious. According to spokesman Michael Scanlon, Delay said,
``Perot's his own person. He has a following and we'll see how it
turns out.''
</P>
<P>
   Carville conceded that Perot might spur a big turnout in a
petition rally in the capital. ``What's he worth, about $8 billion?
With $8 billion he ought to be able to put any number of people on
the Mall,'' he said. But, Carville said, ``You got about 90 percent
of the people who think he's a nut.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot is not alone in trying to stir up public input in the
presidential scandal. Consumer activist Ralph Nader on Thursday
called for a national referendum on the president to be added to
the Nov. 3 ballots.
</P>
<P>
   And People for the American Way, a liberal group, is raising
funds to run advertising spots urging an end to the impeachment
effort against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way has gathered a coalition of
environmentalists, feminists, labor union members and others behind
their campaign. Its message is ``it's time to move on to the real
issues,'' identified as education, health care and the
international economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president made a big mistake'' in having a sexual liaison
with a former White House intern, said Michael Lux, political
director for the organization. ``But he has apologized for it, and
we think the punishment does not fit the crime in terms of him
being taken out.''

 &HT;    MCCURRY BOWS OUT WITH REGRETS ON LEWINSKY
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michael McCurry, the mild-mannered, wisecracking
White House press secretary who has borne the brunt of reporters'
questions over President Clinton's sex and deception scandal, bowed
out on Thursday, saying, ''frankly, the president misled me too.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, who was planning to leave his high-profile post even
before the scandal broke last January, defended his strategy of
intentionally knowing as little as possible about Clinton's
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, saying
it was better not to know than to lie.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one thing I was determined, when that story broke back in
January, was to never come here and ... lie to you and mislead
you,'' McCurry told reporters who packed into the White House
briefing room for his 539th, and final, White House briefing.
''Sometimes not knowing the answer _ even though that puts you in a
tough position, too _ is better than consciously misleading
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even by his own standard, though, ''at times I came up short,''
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know at times that I didn't, you know, have the right
information. And frankly, the president misled me too, so I came
here and misled you on occasion. And that was grievously wrong of
him, but he's acknowledged that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said, though, that he was leaving with a clear
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did I ever knowingly come here and send you folks in the wrong
direction? I did not,'' McCurry said. ''I'm confident of that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, a 43-year-old father of three young children, became
White House spokesman in January 1995 after two years as State
Department spokesman. He said he plans to spend time with his
children, play golf and ''make a little money.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be replaced by Joe Lockhart, 39, who has served as
deputy White House spokesman for the past two years.

DON'T WAIT TO DEAL WITH HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: An organization that provides sexual-harassment
awareness training after it's sued for having a hostile work
environment is like the person who vows to floss at the moment the
dental drill bites into tooth enamel.
</P>
<P>
   Good intentions. Too late to prevent the problem at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. Supreme Court decisions issued this summer put
employers on notice about their proactive duty to stop sexual
harassment. The penalties for not acting on that duty can be
costly.
</P>
<P>
   The high court said employers might be liable for on-the-job
sexual misconduct even if they didn't know it was happening and
even if there was no tangible, job-related action taken against the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Those decisions should strike fear in employers' pocketbooks.
But the decisions also give clear guidelines to avoid trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That explains the flurry of sexual harassment seminars popping
up in workplaces around Kansas City and the nation. Employers that
were ``too busy'' or ``too small'' to worry about such staff
training have changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what employers are doing to protect themselves:
</P>
<P>
   Providing mandatory seminars to employees _ especially managers
_ to define, recognize and avoid sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Putting zero-tolerance policies in place and making sure the
work force knows the consequences of violating them.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing complaint channels and assuring workers that they
can file complaints without job retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up in-house investigation systems that move quickly and
fairly to investigate claims.
</P>
<P>
   Making it clear that no one _ not even the chief executive _ is
exempt from the zero-tolerance policy.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decisions also put a specific burden on the
harassment victim: If there is a policy and complaint system in
place, the victim must use it to protect his or her rights.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions broadened the definition of harassment beyond
having a hostile work environment or quid pro quo harassment _
which, for example, would include promising a raise in return for
sexual favors.
</P>
<P>
   The new definition asks whether the harassment was severe or
pervasive enough to alter the working conditions of the victim's
job.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions also make a distinction between harassment
initiated by a supervisor or a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   If the harasser is a peer, courts will ask whether the employer
knew or should have known about the harassment and whether the
employer took immediate action to stop it once it was discovered.
If not, employer liability looms large.
</P>
<P>
   If the harasser is a supervisor, courts will ask whether
tangible employment actions (demotions, failure to promote, etc.)
were taken against the victim. If so, there is employer liability.
</P>
<P>
   Even without tangible employment actions against the victim,
employers will be held liable for supervisor-inflicted harassment
if the organizations can't prove they had effective anti-harassment
and complaint policies in place.
</P>
<P>
   If employers can prove they had well-publicized policies and
procedures but the victim failed to take advantage of them,
employers may escape liability or at least be forced to pay reduced
damages.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late for lagging workplaces to take proactive care.

`VELVET GOLDMINE': GLITTERING ODE TO THE DAYS OF ZIGGY STARDUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(JT) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Todd Haynes' dazzlingly surreal ``Velvet Goldmine''
offers a celestial ``Here's looking at you, kid'' to the heyday of
British glitter rock in general and to the David Bowie of the early
1970s in particular. Without addressing Bowie directly, it
appropriates his shimmering, protean aura in virtuoso ways that put
ordinary period filmmaking or time-capsule musicology to shame.
</P>
<P>
   The astounding Haynes, whose last film (``Safe'') took place on
an entirely different planet from this one, brilliantly reimagines
the glam-rock '70s as a brave new world of electrifying
theatricality and sexual possibility, to the point where
identifying precise figures in this neo-psychedelic landscape is
almost beside the point. ``Velvet Goldmine'' tells a story the way
operas do: blazing with exquisite yet abstract passions, and with
quite a lot to look at on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Structured as a rock ``Citizen Kane'' with an extraterrestrial
Rosebud, ``Velvet Goldmine'' traces its tendrils back to Oscar
Wilde, whom it imagines as a schoolboy. (``I want to be a pop
idol,'' this child sweetly announces.) A century later, the Wildean
spirit of flamboyance is spectacularly reborn, ready to erupt into
the glittery, pansexual pop utopia over which Bowie so dramatically
presided.
</P>
<P>
   The film, with a vibrant soundtrack of glam-era homages and
originals (performers like Roxy Music, T. Rex, Brian Eno and Iggy
Pop are interwoven ingeniously), doesn't force its musical
references on audiences, but it evokes them with vast fondness and
fascination. ``People have certain memories that they hold very
dear, so you want to remain true to them,'' Christine Vachon, the
film's audacious producer, has explained.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the wild Ken Russellish phantasmagoria of ``Velvet
Goldmine'' several essential characters emerge, central among them
the Bowiesque Brian Slade. Played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers as a
stunningly pretty, insolent, snake-hipped presence, he embodies the
provocative and mysterious heart of the film. Haynes, cerebral as
ever despite this film's explosion of visual sensuality, surrounds
Slade with implicit questions about art and inspiration, truth and
honesty, passion and repression. ``You live in terror of NOT being
misunderstood,'' Slade is eventually told by Mandy (Toni Collette),
another witchily familiar figure here. Mandy is an American whose
transformation into London party girl is, we're told, a great
source of amusement to one and all.
</P>
<P>
   Playing what he has rightly called ``a birthday present of a
part,'' Ewan McGregor makes a fabulously charismatic rock star
named Curt Wild, who is both reproach and object of fascination for
Brian Slade. Whatever else he may be, McGregor's often hilariously
decadent Curt Wild is the real thing. With typically wicked wit,
the film mentions that Curt underwent early shock treatments ``to
fry the fairy clean out of him'' and that the net effect of this
was ``to make him bonkers every time he heard an electric guitar.''
The resultant mad-dog stage presence, with as much Jim Morrison as
Iggy Pop, is exultantly displayed.
</P>
<P>
   In a film that has at least one more major character than it
needs, and that like ``Safe'' overworks its elusiveness in ways
sure to confound some audiences, Christian Bale plays the
journalist a la ``Kane'' who investigates Brian Slade from the
chilly distance of 1984. That period is rendered no less fancifully
than the film's rainbow days, as Bale's doleful Arthur Stuart
reaches out from his dreary present to a past that both entices and
humiliates him. Arthur, the fan who is forever linked to Curt Wild
in one of the film's most exquisitely imaginative visions, conveys
all the wistful distance of what it means to see the events here
from the outside, looking in.
</P>
<P>
   On the same bill, and naturally paling in comparison to Haynes'
thrilling pyrotechnics, is ``Tangerine Dream,'' an Australian short
by Keri Light that toys emptily with post-conversational small
talk. ``At least it was fast,'' someone at the screening remarked
afterward, since it does hurtle along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Velvet Goldmine'' was shown as part of the New York Film
Festival.

   CHELATNA LAKE, Alaska _ Everything now speaks of endings.
</P>
<P>
   Last night there came another snow. The mountains at daybreak
wore a fresh crown of white, and this time it may stay.
</P>
<P>
   The sockeye salmon, or reds, have finished their run. There
still are some late ones lingering in the creeks, and now and then
_ quite by accident _ one will be foul-hooked or will strike a lure
being cast for trout or coho.
</P>
<P>
   But it is meaningless. Since leaving the ocean and returning to
the freshwater streams of their origin to spawn and die, they have
eaten nothing. Their remaining life is measurable in days, or for
some only hours.
</P>
<P>
   They are fast deteriorating, their flesh no longer suitable for
the table.
</P>
<P>
   But if one happens to become attached to a fisherman's line,
then runs with the current or turns its crimson flank broadside in
the flow, the power of the doomed creature can be astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   In the lake itself, the shallows near the shore are full of
them, floating dead or holding feebly in the still water and
waiting for the end, the future of their kind guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The brown dog, Jesse, stands shoulder-deep at the edge, growling
and barking at the untidiness of so much death all around.
</P>
<P>
   Then someone comes with cart and pitchfork to cleanse the shore
and haul the whitening corpses away for disposal in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, with guide Wade Elg, we decided to try Otter Creek
again, a stream we'd fished before with only moderate success. Cold
nights have lessened the runoff from the higher elevations. The
creek has fallen, and today the silver salmon were there in good
numbers, along with the occasional spawned-out red.
</P>
<P>
   Wade had brought along a folding table and chairs so we might
take our last shore lunch in comfort and with a bit of style.
</P>
<P>
   When the lodge closes next week for the winter, he said, he and
his fellow guide, Adam, plan to turn their attention to bigger
game. They'll set up a camp and lead visiting hunters to moose.
</P>
<P>
   On a wall in one of the lodge buildings we'd seen two
photographs of Wade. In each of them he was peering over the
bristling back of a grizzly he had slain. Wade is a bit of a bear
himself, but those creatures were enormous. In the pictures, they
looked as large as city buses.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with bears, in his view, moose are more work than
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to pack the meat out. If you keep the antlers and
cape, a moose is seven loads over 100 pounds,'' he said. ``So
/{where/} you shoot him's important. You want it where you can get
to him with a boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Light clouds drifted across the deep blue of the coming-autumn
sky. The air, pungent with spruce, had a hint of an edge to it.
Sometimes, talking or just drinking in the freshness of the day, we
forgot to fish.
</P>
<P>
   In that easy manner the afternoon got away. We motored to the
rendezvous on the river, and Seth came with the yellow pontoon
plane, circled once and then landed to gather us up.
</P>
<P>
   By the supper hour a threatening bank of clouds had settled over
the lake. It just might happen that a storm would prevent our
flying back to Anchorage tomorrow, said our host, Duke Bertke. It
was unlikely, but at least possible.
</P>
<P>
   I walked a last time down to the shore, trying to hold that
hope, even if I knew it was nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   In the dark water I could see the shadows of great salmon, their
destiny fulfilled, adrift now in the long continuum of their
generations. And I was reminded that, like them, every creature has
its time.
</P>
<P>
   And this was ours.

TOWN ISN'T WAITING TO DEAL WITH YEAR 2000 COMPUTER GLITCH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NORFOLK, Neb. _ Combines are earnestly combing the cornfields
here to harvest a bin-busting crop that is bringing farmers a
trifling $1.70 per bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle producers and 1,200 former employees of BeefAmerica Inc.,
once the town's largest employer, are still smarting from the
plant's closing in July, which dried up a $20 million annual
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Country Kitchen restaurant, those who have time to
take a break complain about the 40-degree drop in temperature over
just two days.
</P>
<P>
   So who has time to worry about a glitch that could cause
computers to fail on Jan. 1, 2000?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, about 200 small-business leaders, homemakers,
police officers, plumbers, bank presidents and politicians who
gathered Wednesday for a Year 2000 town hall meeting at Northeast
Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in human history in our time that can equal
this,'' said City Administrator Mike Nolan, who organized the
meeting and has become the town crier on the challenges of the Year
2000 problem. . ``For some reason, this is not resonating with a
majority of our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the audience, though, the wheels were turning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I knew all there was to know about Y2K,'' Gene
Walker with Hy-Vee Foods said of the nickname for the programming
problem, which could prevent computers from operating properly if
they can't recognize the difference between 1900 and 2000. ``But
after 10 minutes here, I felt my heart rate begin to go up, and I
can feel it in this room.''
</P>
<P>
   In 200 stores in seven Midwestern states, Hy-Vee will spend $6
million for a new software system and replace 800 personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Others in this city of 22,000 are already in motion.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Norfolk will spend $300,000 to fix the glitches in
its system. Patrick Roach of Faith Regional Health Systems is even
planning ways to get nurses to work in a Y2K emergency.
</P>
<P>
   That may be a good idea, said Fire Chief Shane Weidner, who
expects problems on Jan. 1, 2000. ``You're going to call 911 and
we're not going to be there immediately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weidner's warning seemed to take the audience aback. And this
wasn't a crowd that would be easily spooked.
</P>
<P>
   Located in the Nebraska plains, the city still has a gritty
self-reliance that seems far removed from even Omaha. At midday,
tractors rumble down the main street without drawing a second
glance.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's gathering was different from other Year 2000 town
hall meetings being held across the country in places like Lowell,
Mass.; Medford, Ore.; and Boulder, Colo. In those cities, the push
for preparation comes from residents' demanding answers from
reluctant city leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In Norfolk, the hometown of Johnny Carson and Thurl Ravenscroft
(the voice of Tony the Tiger), the city leaders are warning
residents about the impact the Y2K bug could have if power plants
go dark, phones die and fuel pumps stop.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses like the Battle Creek Coop, Volkman Plumbing &AMP;
Heating and the Norfolk Rescue Mission all got on board to sponsor
the meeting. Of the 5,000 invitations sent, 200 people showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not good enough,'' said Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   But one national expert Nolan brought in for the meeting was
impressed by the turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk could become a prototype for other communities that need
to prepare, said Douglass Carmichael, a Washington-based
psychoanalyst and information consultant who has worked for the
U.S. government, Philip Morris and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the country, politicians don't want to panic
constituents, Carmichael said. Employees don't want to panic their
bosses. Business leaders don't want to panic investors.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to hush the potential for problems are actually
making matters worse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making certain a higher degree of ultimate panic
weeks before the year 2000, when people feel helpless to do
anything,'' Carmichael said.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan wants Norfolk to be prepared. After all, northeast
Nebraska isn't exactly a warm part of the country in January if the
power does go out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two groups of people who are really dangerous,'' he
said. ``Those who are the alarmists and those who are in denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk's information systems manager, Jim McKenzie, worries
about banks, which play a key role in a rural economy dominated by
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency Management Coordinator Faythe Peterson holds
twice-a-month meetings with police, fire and utility officials. The
Norfolk City Outlook newsletter carries a Year 2000 article in each
edition and public service announcements are being prepared.
</P>
<P>
   A Y2K civil defense drill is being organized to simulate the day
the computers might crash. Local ministers have agreed to help get
the word out. And the police department will send a Y2K speaker to
any neighborhood association that will listen.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Nolan doesn't want to panic Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's non-productive to assume this thing is going to be
apocalyptic,'' Nolan said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Nolan is planning to stock a two month's supply of
tuna and soup in his home.

SENIORITY: WHEN ENOUGH REALLY IS ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (For release Sunday, Oct. 4) 
(bl) 
 By FRED BROCK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elton Pasea is a mutual fund salesman's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Pasea, 76, a native of Trinidad, lives quite nicely in
Nederland, Texas, on $1,200 a month: $700 from Social Security and
$500 from a union pension. He has never owned stocks, bonds or
mutual funds. His life savings of $33,000 is invested in
certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   He is, he says, having the time of his life. He even manages to
save some money, but it goes into the bank. ``I don't know anything
about stocks,'' said Pasea, a widower. ``I've never even considered
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And he apparently has never considered that, according to
projections by mutual fund companies, he should be eating cat food.
Or at least wallowing in financial misery, sorry that he didn't
take the companies' advice and save more.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have a million-dollar nest egg, and his income isn't
at least 70 percent of his pre-retirement figure. That's what the
projections say he needs. How can the poor wretch possibly be
having a good time?
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the Elton Paseas of this world are living
proof that many such estimations of retirement needs are
self-serving claptrap from an industry that has a vested interest
in convincing people to save as much as possible _ in its mutual
funds, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Waddell, a money-management specialist and associate
professor at Auburn University, calls many of the projections
outrageous because, he says, much of the data on which they are
based are unrealistically inflated. He accuses the fund industry of
``fear selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many baby boomers have bought into the slick sell
as they approach the final decade or so of their working lives.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, of course, the boomers have been famous for
spending, not saving. So, in a panic, these born-again savers are
playing catch-up, pouring billions of dollars into mutual funds and
stocks and helping to fuel the long-running bull market. They watch
every twitch of the Dow. Their angst is palpable. When the market
slumps, they joke about having to work until they are 80.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these folks should lighten up a bit. The truth is that
if your home is paid for and you are willing to move to a
relatively inexpensive area of the country, you won't need nearly
as much money as you might have been led to believe.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in a high-cost, high-tax metropolitan area in the
Northeast, for example, calculate how much of the money you spend
goes to maintain yourself in that environment _ and how much you
spend on work-related items like parking, commuting, clothes and
lunches. Stop working and move to a lower-cost area and watch the
expenses disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention taxes. Nine states have no income tax: New
Hampshire, Florida, Tennessee, Texas, South Dakota, Alaska, Nevada,
Washington and Wyoming. In addition, Delaware, New Hampshire,
Alaska, Montana and Oregon have no sales tax. Be careful, though,
of property taxes. You might be willing to settle for a state with
a modest sales or income tax if property taxes are low.
</P>
<P>
   The October issue of Kiplinger's magazine compares these kinds
of data from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   And if you have frugal inclinations, you could be in a for a
pleasant surprise. Just consider Pasea.
</P>
<P>
   He retired to Nederland on the Gulf Coast in 1984 after 41 years
of roaming the world as a merchant seaman. He wanted a small town
and a warm climate in which to indulge a lifelong passion:
bicycling. He rides every day (4,000 miles last year alone). He
takes a couple of big bicycle trips a year _ one of them is usually
in Europe _ all within his annual income of $14,400.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have many health-related expenses. Wiry and fit from
all that riding, he also watches his diet, which consists mostly of
fish and vegetables, and has never smoked.
</P>
<P>
   Pasea's house is paid for. If it needs repairs, he usually does
them himself. Texas has no state income tax, and his property taxes
run a little less than $400 a year. His utility bills average $100
a month. He drives a 1984 Nissan with ``only'' 216,000 miles on the
odometer, so at some point he may have to dip into his savings to
replace it.
</P>
<P>
   His total expenditures in July were less than $500. This left
him enough money to buy a plane ticket to Vancouver, British
Columbia, where he spent three weeks in August with a friend. ``It
takes very little for me to live,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not stint when it comes to bicycles. He has spent
about $3,000 on his two high-performance road bikes and related
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Music is another passion. An amateur musician who used to play
the clarinet, Pasea sometimes splurges on CDs _ modern classical
(his ``first love'') and jazz.
</P>
<P>
   And the rewards of such a Spartan life style? ``I'm the happiest
guy in Texas,'' Pasea said.
</P>

approach to and arrival at retirement will appear the first Sunday

`EL ALMA DEL PUEBLO': SOUL OF THE PEOPLE, FROM OLD WORLD TO NEW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 1996 exhibition ``Converging Cultures: Art and
Identity in Spanish America'' at the Brooklyn Museum of Art broke
important ground in the study of the colonial presence in the New
World. It demonstrated, unforgettably, an alchemical fusion of
European and Indian art and pointed to many paths of future
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   One of those leads has been been taken up in the ambitious
traveling exhibition ``El Alma del Pueblo: Spanish Folk Art and Its
Transformation in the Americas,'' organized by the San Antonio
Museum of Art and now installed in the adjoining headquarters of
the Americas Society and the Spanish Institute on Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Alma del Pueblo'' (``Soul of the People'') is not as
closely focused as its predecessor. And at least as installed at
one of the two New York sites, it is visually far less spectacular.
But as a survey of Spanish vernacular forms that served as colonial
models, it fills out the historical picture. And interestingly, it
makes that picture seem more vivid in the New World than in Spain
itself.
</P>
<P>
   But Spain is where the story begins, and the gathering of
objects from that country at the Spanish Institute really amounts
to self-sufficient show. Or more accurately, a sampler with a
little bit of everything, large and small, from grain chests to
chocolate cutters, weather vanes to reliquaries.
</P>
<P>
   Such diversity causes problems, giving the installation as a
whole a feeling of thematic drift. But many of the individual
pieces are fascinating, and together they help to define folk art
in this context as a merging of function and ornament, elite and
popular styles, religious and secular impulses.
</P>
<P>
   The show opens, for example, with pocket-size sets of forks and
spoons carved by Castilian shepherds from animal horn. They are
items of portable flatware, nothing more. But each is lovingly
embellished with incised decorations: a garland of wild roses in
one case, in another the figures of Adam and Eve standing like
tongue-tied teen-agers under a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Iron kitchen utensils, from sieves to tongs, have a similar
plain-spoken elegance, and so do the handles, somewhat like those
on corkscrews, of wooden stamps used to mark bread in communal
village ovens. Each handle is chiseled and notched with patterns
that are inessential to actual use but clearly have an important,
if less tangible, value.
</P>
<P>
   Entire social histories can be read in furniture, as designs
created for an urban elite find their way to the provinces, gaining
weight and character en route.
</P>
<P>
   And evidence of cross-cultural exchange is everywhere. A Spanish
lusterware bowl has roots in Islamic North Africa; a 14th-century
wooden Virgin trails her French pedigree like perfume; an
18th-century cherub, with outstretched cheerleader's arms, seems
proud to be a homeboy version of suave Italian prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, sacred and profane identities blend. A bit of
bright fabric with a scalloped lace trim looks like a fancy sachet;
it's actually an infant's christening cap. A splashy bridal corsage
made of ribbons carried a saint's relic. Two lifelike wooden puppet
heads from Cataluna, replete with human hair, look like Punch and
Judy types, but were used to dramatize Bible stories.
</P>
<P>
   The material amassed at the Spanish Institute, in galleries on
two floors, is full of information _ but almost too much, or at
least too varied in kind, for any coherent picture of a culture to
emerge. In the end, the ideas and pleasures remain episodic, with
much of the work left to sink or swim, little helped by the bland
installation.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is different at the Americas Society, where
colonial art predominates; there the show springs to life. In part,
this is because of an atmospheric display, and a honing down of
materials: A single vitrine of shrewdly chosen ceramics catches the
dynamic of colonial encounters in a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, the story told here of two worlds meeting
has an intrinsic compare-and-contrast logic that the curator,
Marion Oettinger Jr., brilliantly exploits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One sees it as one goes through the gallery door, in two
19th-century wooden images of the Virgin _ one from Spain, the
other from Bolivia. The bodies are rudimentary; they were meant to
be swathed in robes. But the heads are carefully modeled. The face
of the Spanish image has the milky skin and rapt expression of a
Murillo Madonna; that on the Bolivian figure, appearing above a
massive neck, has slightly darker skin and emphatic Frida Kahlo
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Such differences may only reflect the preferences of individual
artists. And there is plenty of evidence on hand of art apparently
little changed in being transplanted. This seems to be the case in
the selection of votive paintings, images commissioned in gratitude
for crises averted.
</P>
<P>
   One depicts a woman recuperating from childbirth in her Spanish
bedroom; another a sailor pulled from the Gulf of Mexico by the
Virgin of Guadalupe. In both, the format and you-are-there
illustrational approach are much the same.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere, a New World context is unmistakably announced.
Figures in a Peruvian painting of the Adoration of the Magi wear
Andean ponchos and hats. A rose-bedecked Madonna in an 18th-century
Mexican icon stands in a fishing canoe. St. Isidore the Farmer,
patron of Madrid, Spain, is awarded his own hacienda in a Bolivian
painting. The genuflecting bull in a carved 20th-century shrine of
the Virgin of Montserrat from Puerto Rico refers to a miracle that
only Caribbean locals would know.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, certain works stand out as virtual lexicons of the
truly global culture that developed in colonial America within a
matter of decades after European contact. An earthenware platter
from Mexico uses a Spanish-Islamic glaze technique; the abstract
designs on its rim have Aztec and Mixtec origins; the ``willow
pattern'' landscape painted at its center is borrowed from English
versions of Chinese exportware.
</P>
<P>
   This multicultural marvel, like the Puerto Rican Virgin and many
other objects in the show, is of fairly recent date, made around
1900 by the Mexican potter Miguel Martinez. Even work by
contemporary Latino artists in New York _ Cecilia Vicuna, Antonio
Martorell, Manuel Vega _ whose work is, in some essential way,
craft-based, would make perfect sense in this context. Traditions
born in Spain and carried westward five centuries ago are still in
the process of transformation in this city, and wherever the soul
of the people lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Alma del Pueblo: Spanish Folk Art and its Transformation in
the Americas'' remains at The Americas Society, 680 Park Ave., New
York, and at The Spanish Institute, 684 Park Ave., through Dec. 31.
The exhibition travels to the Chicago Cultural Center, to the
Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento, Calif., and to the San Diego
Museum of Art. It is supported by Ford Motor Co.

 &HT;    Whale of a fossil makes big scientific mark
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A very old creature discovered in Georgia 15 years ago
finally has a name and an important niche in science.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern University scientists have named the creature,
a whale that lived 40 million years ago, Georgiacetus vogtleensis.
Its remarkably well-preserved remains _ North America's oldest
fossil whale skeleton _ were discovered in 1983 about 30 feet in
the ground by workers building Georgia Power Co.'s Plant Vogtle
nuclear power plant near Baxley.
</P>
<P>
   The new moniker ``honors both the state in which it was found as
well as the name Vogtle,'' says Georgia Southern acting President
Harry Carter.
</P>
<P>
   When the fossil was removed from the construction site, most of
it was still encrusted in rock. It was kept in some back rooms of
the Georgia Southern Museum in Statesboro, where over the years
scientists tediously chipped away the rock and learned how to fit
the skeletal pieces together. Then they analyzed the skeleton and
debated over it for several more years to determine its role in the
evolution of whales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consulted with whale experts all over the world, and many
of them came here to study it,'' says Georgia Southern
paleontologist Richard Hulbert Jr. ``It is perhaps the best
preserved specimen of an early whale in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In their report in the September issue of the Journal of
Paleontology, the Georgia Southern researchers conclude that the
fossil represents not only a new species, but a new genus _ an
entire classification of animals.
</P>
<P>
   Hulbert says the fossil is especially important to science
because it might shed light on the time when whales were moving
from land to the sea about 40 million years ago. At that time,
South Georgia was covered mostly by a tropical sea. The shoreline
stretched along what is known today as the ``fall line,'' which
runs through Columbus, Macon and Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   When they began living in the sea, whales switched to
tail-propelled swimming; their hind legs were reduced and
eventually lost. Also, the connection between the backbone and the
pelvis was no longer needed for support on land and was lost to
increase flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   The pelvis of the Georgia Southern fossil has lost the
connection with the backbone, but the hind legs were still used for
swimming even though the tail provided most of the power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fossil initiates a new chapter in the history of
mammals,'' says Del Presley, director of the Georgia Southern
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power donated the fossil to the museum after university
scientists helped extract the specimen from the construction site.
In observance of the naming of the whale, the skeleton will be on
public display Oct. 4-25 at the museum. After that, it will be
dismantled and its individual pieces stored for more scientific
study.

COMMENTARY: BIG BIG BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RUSSELL BAKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The abnormal baseball season has produced a lot of media
flapdoodle about the national psyche. The theme most commonly
expounded is that the spirit of America has been saved from despair
and lifted into exuberance by baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The idea underlying this nonsense is that the media frenzy
generated by a White House sex story had sent the nation reeling to
the brink of terminal melancholy. Then _ hark!
</P>
<P>
   Is that a bugle that sounds afar? No, it is not the cavalry. It
is baseball. Baseball has restored the smile to the national pan,
put happiness back in the American heart and helped the great
Republic to rise out of the emotional trough.
</P>
<P>
   To take this view of things seriously, you have to accept the
demonstrably silly idea that the famous Washington scandal had left
the country deep in despair.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that since last winter said scandal has been the
nation's main, if not sole, source of entertainment. The national
amusement dispensers _ press and television _ have dished it out
with great lashings of titillation, and Americans have lapped it up
hungrily.
</P>
<P>
   It has provided millions with the smug joys of feeling morally
superior to the great and famous. It has allowed schoolchildren,
teachers, mothers, fathers, psychologists and parsons to enjoy
gales of once forbidden sex chatter under the pretext of improving
the cultural hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   It has provided Republicans with the delicious prospect of
crushing a Democratic president. Yes, Democrats are depressed all
right, but Democrats have been so depressed by years of constant
defeat that despair is their natural state.
</P>
<P>
   That baseball has improved the national morale is as dubious as
the notion that the national morale needed any improving.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa making a joke of Babe
Ruth's and Roger Maris' home-run records was an entertaining story,
and the Yankees' triumphal season was a pleasure to watch,
especially for New Yorkers under the delusion that they have a
``home team.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither spectacle, however, can dispel suspicion that there is
something deeply wrong with baseball. And not only baseball, but
also most sports, professional and amateur.
</P>
<P>
   College football, as all morally righteous humanity knows, is a
professional minor-league network churning out players for the
National Football League and big money for its college sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The money in baseball is now simply stupendous, and not just for
the players. During the Yankees' game with the Rangers Tuesday
night, a roving TV camera paused for a moment on a trio that
represents money on the cosmic scale.
</P>
<P>
   Clumped together were the Yankees grandee George Steinbrenner,
His Honor Mayor Giuliani and Rupert Murdoch, who buys professional
sports teams because cable television now makes them hugely
profitable. Just the other day he bought a British soccer team for
_ so it's said _ $1 billion. Shortly before that he bought the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the three together _ Murdoch, Giuliani, Steinbrenner _
you could see that baseball has traveled a far distance since the
time New Yorkers booed Joe DiMaggio because he'd asked the Yankees
to raise his pay to $45,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has been chatting up Mayor Giuliani about a new
billion-dollar ball park he'd like in Manhattan. How much of the
cost do you suppose local taxpayers would have to pay? Why was
Murdoch making it a trio Tuesday night? Could it have been love of
baseball that brought them together?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, but ... With baseball nowadays what springs first to
a skeptical mind is money.
</P>
<P>
   The players are famous for being royally paid, at least compared
with the $45,000 the Yankees once refused DiMaggio. Still, their
talents have a short shelf life, and only a churl would begrudge a
kid a few $1-million-a-year paydays.
</P>
<P>
   These big paydays have a downside for fans. Take the antique
concept of the ``home team,'' for which people were supposed to
root, root, root. The ``home team'' is now dead, dead, dead. With
players moving from town to town at the call of the highest bidder,
each year brings a new team to town. In the new culture the old cry
``Wait till next year'' would be senseless. Next year most of the
``home team'' will have skipped town.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's a market economy. Just bidness. It's not about
rescuing the land from despair. Just bidness, Charlie.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Each year, the auto manufacturers proclaim their new
cars can do more than any they have produced in the past. But can
they boast of offering a car that flies? This year, the centerpiece
of the Louis Vuitton Classic at Rockefeller Center is the 1949
Airphibian, a car that 49 years ago was as at home on the highway
as it was cruising 2,400 feet high in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The third annual Louis Vuitton Classic, which begins Friday and
continues through Sunday, transforms Rockefeller Center into a
showplace for extraordinary automobiles. While the Airphibian may
be the only car that actually takes to the air, a goal of the
Vuitton Classic, according to chief judge Murray Livingstone Smith,
is to ``present an array of cars that are visually stimulating, and
that will cause the imagination of the viewers to take flight as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Airphibian is one of five cars that will be displayed in
Rockefeller Center's Channel Gardens as part of ``Flights of
Imagination'' _ the theme of this year's event. Unlike the other 51
classic cars on display that compete for Best of Class and the Best
of Show awards, the theme cars are not judged in concours
d'elegance, or a competition of elegance, as these shows are known.
Each theme car was selected because it represented the passion of
individual creators.
</P>
<P>
   While most such competitions are presented on immaculately
groomed golf courses, and have admission fees as high as $50 a
person, the Louis Vuitton Classic ``is the only major one in the
world that takes place right in the heart of a city, has no
admission fee and closes down the streets,'' Smith said. The event
is underwritten by Louis Vuitton North America, a unit of LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, according to police estimates, more than 2.3 million
people passed through the exhibition, Smith said. And while New
York City is not often regarded as a hotbed of sports and classic
car enthusiasts, Smith said, ``we have been overwhelmed by positive
comments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because New Yorkers don't get to see cars like this very
often doesn't mean that they aren't attracted to them,'' Smith
said. ``It's like we are bringing a museum full of cars and putting
them onto the streets, their natural environment, where everyone
can enjoy them.''
</P>
<P>
   The man behind the featured car, the Airphibian, Robert Edison
Fulton Jr. of Danbury, Conn., in 1940 created the world's first
flight simulator. The Gunairstructor, as it was called, helped
teach pilots how to shoot down enemy planes. He sold $6 million
worth to the U.S. military. While traveling across the country by
private plane to teach instructors to use his device, he was often
stranded at local airports without a car, in those days before
rental cars.
</P>
<P>
   His solution was the Airphibian, reportedly the world's first
aircraft capable of flying as well as driving down the highway.
According to a July 1952 test in Popular Science magazine, the
Airphibian was capable of cruising at 110 miles an hour in the air
and traveling 50 mph on the ground, and getting 20 miles to the
gallon. After extensive testing, in 1950 the Civil Aeronautics
Administration granted the Airphibian its aircraft certificate, and
orders for 10 planes at $7,500 each were received.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating that greedy investors and a desire for quick
return on capital are not a phenomenon of the '90s alone, Fulton's
financial backers began to quarrel, then tried to sell the
Airphibian to General Motors. Finally, after Fulton's withdrawal
from the project, the investors let the entire endeavor dissolve in
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Airphibian Co. donated a single example to the Smithsonian
Institution in 1959, where it has since been stored. It is this
Airphibian that has been restored and will make its public debut at
the Vuitton event before going back to the Smithsonian.
</P>
<P>
   The four other theme cars include the 1938 Phantom Corsair,
built by Russ Heinz, then 23, of the Heinz 57 Varieties family.
Designed to be a ``car of the future,'' its wildly aerodynamic
styling resembles a cross between a horseshoe crab and a manta ray.
</P>
<P>
   Another theme car, the 1952 So-Cal Special, had its genesis in
1940s race cars that were built out of teardrop-shaped 315-gallon
auxiliary fuel tanks from World War II P-38 combat airplanes. Known
as ``Lakesters'' and ``Streamliners,'' they were raced at the
Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, among other places. In 1952, drawing
on new aircraft technology, the So-Cal Special was built in the
style of the ``Streamliners'' and immediately set five speed
records at the Salt Flats.
</P>
<P>
   Although Buckminster Fuller is best known as the man behind the
geodesic dome, in 1933 he invented the Dymaxion, a futuristic,
teardrop-shaped, three-wheeled, aluminum-bodied vehicle that is
also a theme car this year. Less than 20 feet long, it seats a
driver plus 10 passengers. The inventor said the Dymaxion was
capable of 120 mph with a 90-horsepower engine and got 50 miles to
the gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The final theme car is from the modern era, a retro hot rod
designed by Boyd Coddington, one of America's premier hot rod
builders. Despite its visual homage to the past, the 1994 Aluma
Coupe is a high-technology car with a polished aluminum skin that
looks like yellow glass.
</P>
<P>
   Television host David Letterman has entered his 1951 Ferrari 212
EL Inter Coupe, the twin of a 212 once owned by King Farouk of
Egypt in the Rare Road Cars class. ``When I purchased the 212 it
was several boxes of parts,'' Letterman said through his publicity
representative. The assembly of the car was entrusted to a Ferrari
expert, Francois Sicard. ``Francois Sicard did a lovely job
reconstructing it,'' Letterman said. ``I believe it is the
homeliest Ferrari ever made. I drove it once and melted the clutch.
Francois won't let me near it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewar touring and grand touring cars make up the True Greats
class. Included is a 1931 Bugatti Type 41 Royale Coupe de Ville,
which cost $42,000 when new, making it the most expensive
production vehicle of its time, with a current market value of more
than $10 million, according to Don Williams, a vintage car expert.
One of six built, the Royale has a 788-cubic-inch engine, is nearly
20 feet in length, almost 2 feet longer than today's Chevrolet
Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of a 1931 Rolls-Royce with an airplane engine from
a World War II Spitfire resulted in a one-of-a-kind automobile,
which is in the same class of the Royale. The size of the engine,
also built by Rolls-Royce, at 27 liters, is five times the size of
a standard American V8.
</P>
<P>
   As this is the 50th anniversary of the founding of the car
builder Porsche, a single class is devoted entirely to the sports
and racing cars from Stuttgart, Germany. The 1958 Speedster in the
group, owned by Chad McQueen, was originally delivered to his
father, the actor Steve McQueen.
</P>
<P>
   The judges are a cross section of automotive experts, including
David E. Davis, founder of Automobile magazine. Among the other
judges are Tom Gale, executive vice president of design for
Chrysler; Steve Earle, founder of the Monterey Historic Races; Ken
Gross, director of the Petersen Museum in Los Angeles; David
Gooding, head of Christie's automobile department, and Brian
Redman, three-time sports car world champion.
</P>
<P>
   The Vuitton Classic is open Friday and Saturday from 9 a.m.
until 10 p.m. and on Sunday, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. with a parade of
all the cars at noon.

Barry Singer, who writes frequently about musical theater, is
completing a novel on the subject. 
 By BARRY SINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The face of the Walt Disney Company on Broadway these
days has many masks. Some are daring and innovative, like those of
``The Lion King.'' Others are theme-park safe yet intimidating _
both Beauty and Beast.
</P>
<P>
   Strip them away and what is left? A matched pair of Disney
executives who reflect the company's theatrical countenance: Peter
Schneider, president, and Thomas Schumacher, executive vice
president, of Walt Disney Theatrical Productions. (They also run
the Disney feature animation empire in Hollywood.) Largely unknown,
and mostly unseen, save for a televised dash to the stage of Radio
City Music Hall to claim the best-musical Tony Award last June for
``The Lion King,'' the two men may be, potentially, Broadway's most
powerful concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi. We're the Disney guys.''
</P>
<P>
   It is 9:30 in New York on a weekday morning in August and
Schneider is standing alongside Schumacher, facing about 60 Disney
employees _ administrators, cast and crew _ many nervously
contemplating their first day on a new job. ``Elaborate Lives: The
Legend of Aida,'' Disney's widely anticipated follow-up musical to
``The Lion King,'' begins rehearsals Sunday in this studio near
Union Square for an Oct. 7 premiere out of town. It will be a
co-production with the Alliance Theater Company in Atlanta, a
midsize nonprofit institution with a preponderantly white
subscription audience and a celebrated black artistic director
named Kenny Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Beaming mischievously, Schneider and Schumacher try to disarm
the crowd, just a couple of wisenheimers who happen to be paying
the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher: ``We're very informal.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider: ``Yeah, we just don't like to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher: ``We don't?''
</P>
<P>
   From the sidelines, Leon looks on, bemused. ``I love watching
these guys work,'' he says. But what exactly is the Alliance
Theater Company's role? Will Leon have any influence on the
production? The smile turns beatific. ``Absolutely none,'' Leon
says. ``But we're feeding at the top of the food chain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elaborate Lives'' uses no masks. A rock-and-roll retelling of
the operatic Aida story, it has a multiracial cast of 28 relative
unknowns, a la ``Rent,'' including Sherie Scott as the Pharaoh's
daughter, Amneris; Hank Stratton as her betrothed, the warrior
Radames, and Heather Headley _ the original Nala in ``The Lion
King'' _ as the enslaved Nubian princess Aida, whom Radames loves
and martyrs himself alongside.
</P>
<P>
   The show also has a pioneering laser-powered set at a cost that
some involved, who would not speak for attribution, put at $10
million. This is theme-park technology devised by Disney's
legendary Imagineering unit. The central element: a vast pyramid
that redeploys dizzyingly before finally entombing Radames and Aida
forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elaborate Lives'' unites a variety of people who have helped
Disney lay siege to Broadway over the last five years: Elton John
and Tim Rice, primary composer and lyricist for ``The Lion King'';
and Linda Woolverton and Robert Jess Roth, primary book writer and
director for ``Beauty and the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its predecessors, though, ``Elaborate Lives'' (the title
derives from one of Rice's lyrics) has no animated ancestor. The
show will be Disney's first wholly original theatrical musical.
</P>
<P>
   While some critics have praised the company's visual
achievements in transferring ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``The
Lion King'' to the stage, others have found the dramatic
underpinnings of the productions less praiseworthy. The question
remains: Can Disney create a brand-new musical with the substance
of the best Broadway shows?
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive
officer, the man Schneider and Schumacher often refer to
shamelessly as ``Dad,'' acknowledges that this time around things
are both different and yet much the same. ``We had a six-year
tryout, as it were, with `Beauty and the Beast' and `The Lion King'
as movies,'' he says. ``We then took `Beauty and the Beast' to a
regional theater in Houston to develop it as a musical. We took
`The Lion King' to a theater in Minnesota. And now we're going to a
smaller, less expensive venue in Atlanta with `Elaborate Lives'
because this is, by design, a smaller, less expensive show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that `Elaborate Lives' wasn't a movie first has its
advantages. Dealing with a treasure like `The Lion King,' we had
more to lose by screwing up than with something like `Elaborate
Lives,' which, if we screw up, nobody will remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But all eyes, especially on Broadway, have been focused
on Disney since the company agreed to restore and occupy the New
Amsterdam Theater, a major anchor in the redevelopment of 42nd
Street and the rejuvenation of Times Square. In a little less than
five years, this multibillion-dollar corporation has become a major
player on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's ``Beauty and the Beast,''
Disney's first cartoon-theater transfer, is still running and has
thus far spun off companies in 11 cities worldwide. ``King David,''
a cantata-scale, partly dramatized concert version of the Bible
story, by Menken and Rice, reopened the New Amsterdam last year for
a limited run. It was followed by ``The Lion King,'' directed by
Julie Taymor and based on the Disney animated hit. The show remains
today a commercial and critical blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Beauty and the Beast' and `King David' were not done by
Peter and Tom,'' Eisner says. ``We just sort of did them out of
corporate. When theater became a more strategic direction for the
company, we had to make a more formal arrangement. I grew up in New
York, I personally loved the theater and I personally knew enough
about it to know that we should stay away from it.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Lion King,' however, enhanced our brand,'' he continues.
``We've been OK around the world, but in the intellectual community
in New York, we surprised them with `Lion King.' All of which was
not pre-planned. We got lucky. But Peter and Tom made that happen.
In fact, I would not have gone into Times Square without them.''

 NOTE: Full-length article (5,500 words) available on request  
 &HT;    Are you prepared for the greatest computer glitch in history _
the Year 2000 Bug?
 &HT;    Throughout history, prophets and visionaries have spent their
lives preparing for the end of the world.
 &HT;    But this time it is software programmers who are blazing the
millennial trail. They've have read the future, not in the Book of
Revelation, but in a few million lines of computer code.
 &HT;    By now, the source of their anxiety is well known.
 &HT;    In the 1950s and 1960s, when the computer world was young and
memory was expensive, programmers developed a convention for
marking the passage of time. It's the same system most people use
to date their checks: two digits for the day, two for the month and
two for the year. Dropping the ``19'' from the year was convenient,
and it saved two bytes of precious RAM every time it was used.
 &HT;    Those were days of innocence and optimism. Everyone knew what
would happen if this little shortcut was still in use in AD 2000 _
the two-digit year would roll over like the odometer on an old
Chevy, and the computers would think they'd jumped 100 years into
the past. Programmers knew it, and they warned their managers.
 &HT;    Not to worry, was the usual reply. When the millennium finally
rolls around, all this code will be ancient history.
 &HT;    But the code stuck around. The old software worked fine in the
post-mainframe world, so nobody felt compelled to replace it.
Instead, like Roman architects, they just built on top of it. The
two-digit year became a standard, wired right into the heart of
Cobol _ the Common Business Oriented Language that still serves as
the digital workhorse of commerce and industry. It also crept into
the embedded microchips found in everything from VCRs to nuclear
power plants.
 &HT;    For years the Y2K bug sat quietly, remembered largely as an
amusing textbook example of poor software design.
 &HT;    But as 2000 drew near, the screwup became less amusing. In
November 1996, the ``comp.software.year-2000'' newsgroup was
launched, creating an on-line forum that would soon become ground
zero for the Y2K survivalist movement. But at first, the charter
was clear: Discussions would be limited to Y2K bug fixes,
remediation strategies and reports.
 &HT;    Over the course of the next year, information poured into the
newsgroup, and most of it was bad: The FAA was hopelessly behind
schedule in patching air-traffic-control systems; Edward Yardeni,
chief economist for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Bank, laid odds that
Y2K upheaval would trigger a recession; Ed Yourdon, a respected
software guru and author of 25 computer books, predicted the
collapse of the U.S. government _ not long after he packed up and
moved to New Mexico.
 &HT;    Optimism became a scarce commodity. Philosophical questions were
raised: Do programmers have a moral duty to remain at their
keyboards until the last moments of 1999, like captains on a
sinking ship?
 &HT;    Debates raged over social Darwinism and the ownership of wheat
in grain elevators. Plans were made to begin converting equities
into gold and buying land in remote parts of California, Arizona
and Oklahoma.
 &HT;    In January 1998, 250 ``hits'' were posted to the Website
``misc.survivalism'' _ up from an average of 30 a month in late
1997. Gradually, a new acronym entered the Internet lexicon:
TEOTWAWKI, pronounced ``tee-OH-tawa-kee.'' The End of the World as
We Know It. The Internet's very own survival movement was born.
 &HT;    Scott Olmsted, a 20-year programming veteran, who lives in San
Diego, has known about the Y2K bug since the 1980s, but he never
gave it much thought until early 1997, when he received a
snail-mail flyer from Gary North, a historian and early leader in
the Y2K preparedness movement. After reading it, Olmsted remembers
feeling a vague sense of dread.
 &HT;    But as a rational guy and student of decision analysis _ the
science of logical decision making in the face of chronic
uncertainty _ he didn't jump to any conclusions. Instead, he went
online to do some research.
 &HT;    As he pored over Web sites and news clippings, Olmsted felt
himself moving through the same psychological stages endured by
people confronted with fatal illness: denial, fading into anger,
leading to a deep depression that culminates in a sense of
acceptance.
 &HT;    ``I'm still not 100 percent sure that the world's coming to an
end,'' he admits. ``But the idea that I may want to get out of town
for a while is not such a long shot. It's enough to make me want to
prepare.''
 &HT;    Olmsted has decided that the only real fix for the Y2K problem
may be to pack up and move to a patch of land 75 miles from his San
Diego home.
 &HT;    ``In the next year or so,'' he predicts, ``the most common
cocktail party chatter will be, 'What are you doing to prepare for
Y2K?' But by then, it will be too late.''
 &HT;    His Y2K retreat is in an area of sagebrush country where high
security means a few strands of barbed wire clinging to a rusty
pole. Olmsted's chain-link fence is shiny and new. The
alarm-company sign that hangs from the fence would be more at home
in Brentwood, and on the roof there's a DirecTV satellite dish
pointed toward the sky. The shed outside his back door will hold
nonperishable food.
 &HT;    Olmsted intends to celebrate New Year's Eve at his home in the
suburbs; the place in the desert will be there just in case things
get rough.
 &HT;    The hardcores believe it will happen like this: On Jan. 1 (or
shortly thereafter), the electricity grid will go dead. Groceries
in America's refrigerators will go bad. Food distribution systems
will crash and store shelves will go bare within days. Businesses
will fail, either because they aren't Y2K compliant or because they
are dependent on noncompliant customers and suppliers.
 &HT;    As losses mount and companies go under, the stock market will
plummet. Banks will calculate interest for negative 100 years. The
government will stop issuing entitlement checks to gray-haired
senior citizens when their age suddenly clicks back to -35. Panic
will set in. Police dispatch systems will be crippled, and the only
law will be the law of the jungle.
 &HT;    Desperate citizens will abandon the cities to hunt for resources
in rural areas. They'll come looking for the mad prophets _ the Y2K
survivalists _ ready to plunder their food, their heat and their
communications links.
 &HT;    Millions of Americans have already gotten a small taste of
critical system failure. When the onboard control system of the
Galaxy IV communications satellite failed on Tues., May 19, 1998,
the outage temporarily crippled U.S. pager networks, several
broadcast news operations and even credit-card verifications
systems.
 &HT;    Most of the disruptions were brief _ technicians were able to
switch to backup communications paths _ but doctors who use pagers
as a lifeline with patients and colleagues were forced to set up
camp in hospitals and offices. The failure of one satellite threw a
wrench into the mechanisms of modern life, perhaps providing a peek
at what life may be like at the dawn of the new millennium.
 &HT;    Or sooner. While the full brunt of the Y2K bug is reserved for
AD 2000, some early problems are already developing. In 1996, Visa
and MasterCard temporarily stopped issuing credit cards with an
expiration date of 2000 after credit-card verification terminals
began choking on the ``00.'' The gaffe led to customer complaints
and a lawsuit filed by a suburban Detroit grocery store against its
computer supplier, TEC America Inc.
 &HT;    Since then, most verification systems have been upgraded, but
Y2K is making its presence known in other areas. The Information
Technology Association of America released a survey last March
showing 44 percent of the U.S. companies they polled have already
experienced Y2K failures. Ninety-four percent of the respondents
termed Y2K a ``crisis.''
 &HT;    The GartnerGroup estimates that 180 billion lines of code need
to be examined and that 20 to 30 percent of all firms worldwide
have not yet started preparing for Y2K. Many of these are expected
to suffer significant failures.
 &HT;    In a series of studies issued over the last year, Gartner
surveyed 15,000 companies in 87 countries to assess their Y2K
readiness. The results weren't encouraging. Small companies rated
lowest _ for most, winning over new customers has taken priority
over the Y2K problem. But midsize and large companies are lagging
too. Gartner then rated the overall Y2K efforts of industrialized
nations on a scale of zero to five, where five is total compliance
on all systems.
 &HT;    The highest scorers on the scale, including the United States,
Canada and Australia, rated somewhere between two and three _ a
score that suggests they have completed an inventory of Y2K
vulnerabilities, but not yet developed a comprehensive remediation
plan.
 &HT;    The United States may be at the front of the pack in the Y2K
race, but that's small comfort to some legislators. Last March, the
House Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and
Technology warned that 37 percent of the critical systems used by
federal agencies will not be ready in time. Then in June,
California Republican Stephen Horn, who heads the subcommittee,
issued a scathing report card on the Clinton administration's Y2K
progress. He gave the government an F.
 &HT;    John Koskinen, head of the president's Year 2000 Conversion
Council, complains that Horn is just a tough grader. ``As a
government, we're in a C+ to B range,'' he argues.
 &HT;    Koskinen keeps a digital desktop clock that runs backward _ on
the day we spoke, the clock showed 609 days, 8 hours, 39 minutes,
16 seconds, and counting _ but he generally refrains from calling
the situation a crisis. Instead, he describes it as a ``critical
management challenge.''
 &HT;    He fully expects the federal government's critical systems to be
ready on time, or even early. ``Many companies, financial
institutions and federal agencies are still working on the
problem,'' he says. ``But most major organizations plan to have
their solutions in place by the first quarter of next year.''
 &HT;    If the council is successful, Koskinen believes, Americans will
confront little more than a few minor inconveniences when the year
2000 finally rolls around. ``There's not enough information right
now to indicate that stocking up on Coleman stoves and Sterno is an
appropriate response,'' he says.
 &HT;    And in the end, he predicts, ``a lot of people won't notice.''

 &HT;    Are you prepared for the greatest computer glitch in history _
the Year 2000 Bug?
 &HT;    Throughout history, prophets and visionaries have spent their
lives preparing for the end of the world.
 &HT;    But this time it is software programmers who are blazing the
millennial trail. They've have read the future, not in the Book of
Revelation, but in a few million lines of computer code.
 &HT;    By now, the source of their anxiety is well known.
 &HT;    In the 1950s and 1960s, when the computer world was young and
memory was expensive, programmers developed a convention for
marking the passage of time. It's the same system most people use
to date their checks: two digits for the day, two for the month and
two for the year. Dropping the ``19'' from the year was convenient,
and it saved two bytes of precious RAM every time it was used.
 &HT;    Those were days of innocence and optimism. Everyone knew what
would happen if this little shortcut was still in use in AD 2000 _
the two-digit year would roll over like the odometer on an old
Chevy, and the computers would think they'd jumped 100 years into
the past. Programmers knew it, and they warned their managers.
 &HT;    Not to worry, was the usual reply. When the millennium finally
rolls around, all this code will be ancient history.
 &HT;    But the code stuck around. The old software worked fine in the
post-mainframe world, so nobody felt compelled to replace it.
Instead, like Roman architects, they just built on top of it. The
two-digit year became a standard, wired right into the heart of
Cobol _ the Common Business Oriented Language that still serves as
the digital workhorse of commerce and industry. It also crept into
the embedded microchips found in everything from VCRs to nuclear
power plants.
 &HT;    For years the Y2K bug sat quietly, remembered largely as an
amusing textbook example of poor software design.
 &HT;    But as 2000 drew near, the screwup became less amusing. In
November 1996, the ``comp.software.year-2000'' newsgroup was
launched, creating an on-line forum that would soon become ground
zero for the Y2K survivalist movement. But at first, the charter
was clear: Discussions would be limited to Y2K bug fixes,
remediation strategies and reports.
 &HT;    Over the course of the next year, information poured into the
newsgroup, and most of it was bad: The FAA was hopelessly behind
schedule in patching air-traffic-control systems; Edward Yardeni,
chief economist for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Bank, laid odds that
Y2K upheaval would trigger a recession; Ed Yourdon, a respected
software guru and author of 25 computer books, predicted the
collapse of the U.S. government _ not long after he packed up and
moved to New Mexico.
 &HT;    Optimism became a scarce commodity. Philosophical questions were
raised: Do programmers have a moral duty to remain at their
keyboards until the last moments of 1999, like captains on a
sinking ship?
 &HT;    Debates raged over social Darwinism and the ownership of wheat
in grain elevators. Plans were made to begin converting equities
into gold and buying land in remote parts of California, Arizona
and Oklahoma.
 &HT;    In January 1998, 250 ``hits'' were posted to the Website
``misc.survivalism'' _ up from an average of 30 a month in late
1997. Gradually, a new acronym entered the Internet lexicon:
TEOTWAWKI, pronounced ``tee-OH-tawa-kee.'' The End of the World as

 NEW YORK: without them.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Schneider and Schumacher are known for anything on Broadway
right now it is for their audacious hiring choice of the
iconoclastic Ms. Taymor to oversee the stage transformation of
``The Lion King.'' Yet, in ``Elaborate Lives,'' the two men are
returning to the company fold, employing a team largely drawn from
the Disney world of animation and theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   This is precisely why many people in the Broadway community,
prior to ``The Lion King,'' refused to take Disney's efforts at
creating musical theater seriously. So wouldn't Schneider and
Schumacher characterize this as a step backward?
</P>
<P>
   ``Elaborate Lives'' actually came first, says Schneider. ``At
the same time four years ago that we started considering `Lion
King' for Broadway, Elton and Tim wanted to do something that was
not animated and we had this children's book we'd bought for
animation, `Leontyne Price's Aida Story,' that we came to think
might work better as a stage musical.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider talks fast, even faster than Schumacher. Both men are
also of medium height and appear almost delicate _ Schneider pale
and wiry, Schumacher more placidly pallid. In sneakers and jeans,
Schneider projects eternal friskiness, though at 47, he is the
elder. Schumacher, 40, is contrastingly fashion conscious and
studious, with a trim mustache, designer eyeglasses and couture
linen suit.
</P>
<P>
   Like the patter in the animated movies they produce, the two
wisecrack endlessly. As in those films, the labor beneath the
carefree facade is clearly prodigious.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great give and take,'' observes Michael Ovitz, the
former Hollywood super agent who had a brief run at Disney as
Eisner's second in command before their famous divorce. ``People
say, `They practically finish each other's sentences,' but in fact
they don't finish each other's sentences, they respect each other's
sentences. I imagine they've probably had a ton of disagreements
but you'd never know it. They're simply one of the best marriages
I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider generally strikes the major business chords, while
deferring to Schumacher on esthetic matters, though the division
remains fluid. At a production meeting after the first full run
through of ``Elaborate Lives,'' it is Schumacher who sets the
agenda, with Schneider chiming in from across the table, seconded
by a handful of Disney animation staff members flown in from
Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a score of ballads,'' Schumacher begins somewhat
ruefully. ``I don't see any way out other than heaving stuff over
the side.'' He glances knowingly at Schneider. ``We've had this
problem before.''
</P>
<P>
   They look at each other. `` `Pocahontas,' '' both mutter
simultaneously. `` `If I Never Knew You,' '' explains Schumacher.
The animation contingent nods. ``An exquisite Alan Menken ballad.
But audiences didn't want to hear it.'' He pauses. ``We took it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider seems crestfallen. ``I'm still not sure we did the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher eyes his cohort, who is about to catch a plane back
to Los Angeles. ``Peter,'' he asks, ``did you eat?''
</P>
<P>
   One week later, the two are home in Burbank together for a
moment, at the Disney Animation building that Schneider basically
built _ a corporate hive of more than 2,000 animators, writers,
computer technicians and number-crunchers _ all laboring beneath
the giant, pointy sorcerer's hat that literally crowns the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had my job before me,'' Schneider announces, sprawled
on a sofa in his office, sneakers up, head back. ``Animation was
not a business 15 years ago. The company went through this
cataclysmic change when Michael Eisner, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Roy
Disney took it over in 1984. Their vision was to restore live
action and thereby revive the company. And Roy, when asked by
Michael and Jeffrey what he wanted, said, `Give me animation.' ''
</P>
<P>
   From its humble beginnings in 1923 under Roy Disney's uncle Walt
and father, Roy Sr., the Disney company enjoyed, of course, a run
of unadulterated success as the industry pioneer in feature
animation, riding ``Snow White,'' ``Pinocchio'' and ``Bambi,'' to
say nothing of Mickey Mouse, to the summit of American popular
culture. In the wake of Walt Disney's death in 1966 though, the
animation division lapsed into a decline.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider was 34 when he arrived in 1985. ``There were 190
people here making a movie every 3 or 4 years,'' he says. As
Schneider tells it, Robert Fitzpatrick, then head of the California
Institute of the Arts, who had just organized the Olympic Arts
Festival, which Schneider ran, recommended Schneider for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Why was he hired, Schneider asks rhetorically: ``Because it
fundamentally meant no difference who they hired. They didn't care.
Roy cared. But in retrospect, Jeffrey and Michael couldn't have
cared less. Animation? Who cares? It wasn't making any money. As a
matter of fact, it was losing money. I got lucky because they were
not that picky and I was at the right place at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider grew up in Wisconsin and graduated from Purdue
University in 1971 with a theater degree and aspirations to be a
director. Schumacher, the grandson of a silent-film studio head and
a graduate of UCLA, was a worshipful lover of the theater when he
found himself, in 1983, at the age of 26, sharing a tiny office at
the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles with Schneider, who was
coordinating the theater component of the Olympic Arts Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only person who would have lunch with him; everyone
else was bothered that an outsider had been brought in,'' recalls
Schumacher, sitting in his sumptuous office, furnished by Matthew
White, a decorator and Schumacher's companion of 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   By then, both Schneider and Schumacher had worked extensively in
the theater, Schumacher in and around San Francisco and Los
Angeles, Schneider in New York, Chicago and London. When Schneider
and Hope Tschopik, his future wife, were promoted to run not just
the theater program but the Olympic festival itself, they invited
Schumacher to work for them as a line producer. Three years later,
he found himself being pestered by Schneider to ``come to Disney.''

<P>
   ``I had all the preconceived notions about Disney,'' Schumacher
remembers, ``and I didn't feel like a Disney person, even though
I'd worked extensively in children's theater. Why did I finally
come? Peter. It seemed like a great adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   In a span of five years, from 1986 through 1990, six new
animated features were released under Schneider's supervision,
including, ``Roger Rabbit,'' a joint project with Steven Spielberg
and Robert Zemeckis, and ``The Little Mermaid,'' a full-fledged
Ashman-Menken musical. All the movies did appreciably well; the
latter two, though, grossed astonishing sums.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider smiles. ``Suddenly, everyone realized, `Oh, my God.
There's money to be made in this business.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after the effusive critical reception of ``Beauty and
the Beast'' as a musical that bettered anything Broadway could
offer, Eisner began thinking something that Walt Disney probably
never had: perhaps Disney should be on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty and the Beast,'' the stage musical, opened in 1994,
generating considerable ticket revenue as well as industry
condescension from a Broadway community that widely viewed it as
inferior work. Schneider and Schumacher will not assess the
production on the record beyond stating that it was ``unfairly
dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   That same year, though, as Katzenberg exited Disney
acrimoniously, leaving Schneider at the top of Disney Animation,
the division released ``The Lion King,'' destined to become one of
the most critically acclaimed and financially profitable films ever
made _ animated or not. When it inevitably came under consideration
as a Disney Broadway venture, Eisner asked Schneider to help out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I said to Michael,'' Schneider recalls, ``either keep the
whole theater business _ which is fine _ or give it to me and Tom.
And Michael said, `OK, it's yours.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Both men say they were adamant about elevating Disney's
theatrical standards. ``Peter and I knew that `Lion King' would
have to be different,'' Schumacher says. ``Push-the-envelope
unique. And we got lucky. We caught Julie Taymor at the exact right
moment in her career.''
</P>
<P>
   To many (including Ms. Taymor herself), she was a surprising
choice: a self-described ``nonprofit baby,'' known for adventurous,
cross-cultural stage works.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was trepidation on both sides, when Peter and Tom first
approached me,'' Ms. Taymor says. ``They worried that I was too far
out and I worried that they were Disney. But once we started to get
into it, once I came up with ideas and a direction that they could
back and present to Michael Eisner, there was incredible support
and tremendous understanding. Because they know theater, more so
than most any New York producer.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly more than most New York producers, Schneider and
Schumacher work with few financial restrictions. ``Beauty and the
Beast'' was the most expensive musical ever mounted on Broadway up
to that time, with an official cost of $12 million, though some
estimates were considerably higher. Estimates about ``The Lion
King'' have ranged from $11 million to $15 million, though Disney
has never released a production cost figure.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, as the producer Rocco Landesman has observed, ``No one
on Broadway will ultimately imitate or even attempt to compete with
Disney because in the end no one else can afford to.''
</P>
<P>
   Side by side, in a shadowy back row of the Alliance Theater,
Schumacher and Schneider hunker down behind their laptops. It is
Sept. 17, and the first public preview of ``Elaborate Lives'' is in
a scant few hours, the opening three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   While Schneider slips ever lower in his seat _ the signature
Schneider slouch, a progressive descent into posturepedic oblivion,
Schumacher pulls out a fresh bottle of water. ``This is the
essential difference between making movies and making theater,'' he
announces wryly. ``With movies, they bring you water. With theater,
you bring your own.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, far from Broadway, Schneider and Schumacher will be
confronting the doubters who viewed ``The Lion King'' as a Disney
anomaly. Is making a cartoon movie musical really the same as
creating one for the stage? Can the same formula apply?
(italics)Should(end italics) it apply?
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep saying that animation is like doing musical
theater,'' Ms. Taymor has said. ``It's not been my experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider will have none of this. ``The process of development
is fundamentally the same,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do worry,'' Eisner had conceded a few days before. ``Their
main responsibility is animation. That's 90 percent of their job. I
reluctantly assigned them to do the theatrical work because I had
no choice, they're so good. But I prefer them creating product for
2,000 theaters, not 1.''

 &HT;    AG DEPARTMENT'S CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION IN DISARRAY, INSPECTOR
FINDS
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Agriculture Department's civil rights division
is in disarray, has ``no decisive leadership'' and is making no
progress in clearing up a backlog of discrimination complaints, the
department's inspector general reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report provides fresh ammunition for black farmers, who have
long accused the department of ignoring their complaints that they
have been the victims of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really confirms everything I've said for the past year,''
said John Boyd, president of the National Black Farmers
Association. ``The system is so corrupt. ...The investigative
process isn't working.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent inspector general's report blasts the civil
rights division for a variety of offenses, including providing
false information to inspectors, a data base full of errors, and
allowing student interns to determine whether discrimination
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staff members with little training and less experience were
put to judging matters that carry serious legal and moral
implications,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said he was ``deeply
disappointed'' by the problems identified by the report. ``I am
ready to act on it today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said President Clinton has
seen the report, but was ``confident that Secretary Glickman is
addressing the issue vigorously and effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says division employees did not provide accurate
information about the number of active and closed discrimination
cases, and that these inaccuracies were repeated at congressional
hearings and other public forums.
</P>
<P>
   It recommends establishing a complaint resolution task force
that is independent of the civil rights division to immediately
assume control of the backlog. It also recommends that the
department appoint an assistant secretary of civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said he would make a recommendation to Congress for the
new assistant secretary's post next year, but rejected the
recommendation for a completely independent task force.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, employees from within the civil rights office along
with other department employees will make up a task force, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said a task force from within the Agriculture Department is
not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the fox watching the henhouse,'' he said, adding
that he would prefer an advisory committee approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, black farmers and members of the
Congressional Black Caucus were angered by a Justice Department
decision to uphold a two-year statute of limitations on
discrimination complaints. The limit effectively bars hundreds of
complaining farmers from getting any cash compensation even if they
suffered discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the complaints are a result of a Reagan administration
decision in 1983 to dismantle the civil rights complaint office,
which resulted in thousands of complaints being ignored for years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the complaints, the Clinton administration faces
a $3 billion federal lawsuit filed by 600 of the farmers over the
long delays in settling cases. A trial date of Feb. 1 has been set
for the case but lawyers representing the farmers have said they
hope to settle before then.

NAGY HOPES FOR REPEAT PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The expectations _ at least in the taxicab that brought
him to the ballpark _ were low and the pressure on Charles Nagy was
about the same the last time the Indians righthander pitched in the
postseason at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy would like nothing better than to match the results of that
game when he takes on the Red Sox in Game 3 of their best-of-five
American League Division Series this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was Oct. 6, 1995, and the Indians had won the first two games
of the first-round series in Cleveland. Nagy, in his playoff debut,
faced Tim Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the park, the cabbie was talking baseball and
offered an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was a lock,'' Nagy recalled her saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, she felt, were going to give the Red Sox one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like, `Great,''' Nagy said.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy pitched seven innings that night, giving up four hits and
one run, and when he left, it was 8-1, the Indians went on to
prevail, and it's still his only playoff victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sweep. The Red Sox went three and out, and that was the game
that ran to 13 the postseason winless streak that lasted until
Tuesday afternoon in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   It was no pressure, no sweat, Nagy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up, 2-0, and I was in a no-lose situation,'' he said.
``Even if we lost, they had to win three straight. Orel Hershiser
and Dennis Martinez won the first two games and took a lot of
pressure off me. I was able to go out relaxed and just throw the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He did that well. And that's what he generally does against the
Red Sox. Throws well. In short, he'd likely take a repeat of most
of his starts against the Red Sox as he tries to break a 1-1 series
tie.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the playoff win, Nagy is 6-1 with a 2.54 earned run
average in his career against Boston. In the regular season, he is
3-0 with a 1.29 ERA at Fenway. He threw eight shutout innings the
last time he pitched here in April in a duel with Pedro Martinez,
gave up a couple of runs in the ninth, and the Sox won it in the
10th.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy grew up a Yankees fan in Fairfield, Conn., and played at
the University of Connecticut _ which makes him a longtime rival of
Norwalk and Seton Hall's Mo Vaughn in Babe Ruth, Legion, college,
and now the majors _ and says he can't explain why he has such
success against the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   He claims he loved the Yankees, but that doesn't mean he hated
the Sox. There are no magic spells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, you really can't explain anything like that,'' Nagy
said. ``Why is it that one year you pitch well against a team and
the next year you can't even get out of the first inning? It's just
baseball and that's the way it goes. It's not that I feel more
comfortable pitching against them or pitching in Fenway.''
</P>
<P>
   Just looks that way.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a roller-coaster season for Nagy. He began 7-2,
then didn't win in eight starts (0-4, four no-decisions) through
June and well into July before breaking the streak with a 4-3 win
over the Sox in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   He was 5-1 in his last seven starts. But in his last one, as the
Indians battled for the home-field advantage _ and to avoid the
Yankees in the first round _ he was roughed up for seven hits and
four runs in just three innings against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he led the Indians in wins and innings pitched (210
1/3) for the fourth straight season but had a 5.22 ERA to go with a
15-10 record.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy said he had fallen into some bad pitching habits _ neither
he nor manager Mike Hargrove wanted to elaborate _ and was able to
straighten them out with the help of pitching coach Mark Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very good athlete and he has good stuff,'' Hargrove
said. ``He worked continuously to get out of those bad habits. It
took most of half a year to get it done. It takes a while to
identify the habits. Some are or were so subtle that we were down
to putting tapes side by side on a screen and comparing them frame
to frame to see the differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove is well aware of Nagy's success against the Sox, but he
doesn't have a reason for it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I hope this holds true,'' he said. ``At least one more
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox _ and the area's cab drivers _ hope otherwise.

SABERHAGEN AT HOME IN THE PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rich Zawacki watched as Bret Saberhagen, twinkle in his
eye and smile on his face, enjoyed the moment before his Moment _
pitching once again in the playoffs Friday, his wife singing the
national anthem at Fenway Park, his arm once again strong. All
seemed as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never gets booed,'' Saberhagen quipped of his wife, Lynn.
``I always get booed. I'll probably be more nervous for her than
for myself. She started us well on Opening Day'' _ a Red Sox
comeback win over Seattle after Lynn Saberhagen sang that national
anthem. Just the right touch.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Saberhagen thanked those who had helped bring him back
from a useless right shoulder, from that agonizing playoff game
three years ago when he had taken the mound though ``my arm was
killing me'' and had given up six runs, five earned, in four
innings as Atlanta hammered him and the Colorado Rockies, the
Braves clinching the series with that game.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen thanked his wife, thanked Mets reliever John Franco,
thanked his doctors, and then thanked Zawacki, thanked them all for
not letting him give up.
</P>
<P>
   Zawacki, the Red Sox' physical therapist, took all this in and
thought back to one April evening in Anaheim. Not April of this
year when all seemed promising for Saberhagen and his comeback, but
back to April 1997 when nothing seemed sure about Saberhagen's
baseball future.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'd first met Bret, after the extensive surgery he'd had,
I knew it was going to be a long time before he came back,'' said
Zawacki. But that was not Saberhagen's impression, even 18 months
ago at the start of the 1997 season when no one expected him to
pitch that year.
</P>
<P>
   Except Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``His impression _ we're talking 1997 now _ was that he was
going to be one of the starting pitchers when we left spring
training,'' Zawacki recalled. ``That's 1997 ... and that obviously
was not going to happen. So what I had to do was keep Bret focused
that it was going to be a long, long road ahead for him.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that the Red Sox opened the 1997 season in Anaheim.
Saberhagen did some throwing before one of those first games,
Zawacki watching every toss most carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, I remember it was tough,'' Zawacki recalled of his
efforts to temper Saberhagen's expectations with reality. ``I knew
that he thought he should be pitching for us. But (pitching coach)
Joe Kerrigan and I had scheduled a side day for him on the mound in
the bullpen, and Bret wanted to show us that he was ready to pitch.
In his mind, he was thinking, `I've had the surgery. I'm feeling
pretty good. I can pitch.'''
</P>
<P>
   And?
</P>
<P>
   ``So he threw 20 pitches as hard as he could,'' said Zawacki.
``Then he walked off the mound, basically cussing me out because he
wasn't ready. Actually, that set him back about two weeks ...
because he couldn't pick up a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Zawacki's physical therapy was most important. But, as
Saberhagen said Thursday, there was also mental energizing needed.
Most of that came from himself, of course, but reminders also came
from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after those tosses and cusses in Anaheim, ``we sat
down again,'' Zawacki said. ``He had calmed down and we talked
about it. I told him, `You're not ready and you're not going to be
ready for a while. And if you expect to pitch now, you're never
going to be ready, so you might as well go home. You're just not
ready to pitch and it's going to take some time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, Zawacki recalled with a smile, ``eventually came
around'' to that line of thinking. ``He then did what he was
supposed to do _ we never had to remind him to do it _ and he just
hung in there. After that incident in Anaheim, he sort of calmed
down as to his expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   For the entire 1997 season, Saberhagen was around the Red Sox,
doing his work, building up his arm _ all for the big test that
would come in 1998. But there came a time in July 1997 ``when I
didn't think he was going to pitch at all,'' said Zawacki. ``Things
were not going well at all. He just wasn't ready to get up on the
mound and throw like he wanted to throw. I was having my doubts as
to whether it was going to work or not.''
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, though, ``he started complaining less about his
shoulder,'' said Zawacki. ``I'm not exactly sure what happened. We
changed a few things that he was doing, and then he was better.''
So much so that ``one day Joe Kerrigan came up to me _ I think it
was in Detroit _ and said he thought we could throw Bret in a
simulated game,'' said Zawacki. ``He wasn't ready to pitch last
year, but it was important for him to get on the mound at this
level and get people out.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen went on a rehabilitation assignment, starting games
in Lowell, Trenton, Pawtucket, and eventually Boston _ 11 starts in
all. By then, Saberhagen had come to the realization, said Zawacki,
that ``he had to be patient, that he was in it for the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Since no pitcher had undergone the type of surgery Saberhagen
had, the whole process ``was trial and error,'' said Zawacki.
``There were things I wanted him to do that he just couldn't do. We
eventually ended up with `what works' exercises that would work for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen started fast this season, but there was a lull after
the first month. The pitcher several times said his shoulder did
not feel totally right. ``Alarms didn't go off for me,'' said
Zawacki, ``but I think they went off for him. A couple of times, he
came in to me and said, `Man, I feel like my shoulder is going to
dislocate.' He had put so much effort into throwing those days that
it just didn't feel right for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Here Zawacki was soothing. ``I'd say, `Why don't you come in
tomorrow and see how you feel then?' And `Come in the next day and
see what it's like then.' In a situation like that, you have to get
him thinking positive, because if they start thinking negatively,
they start getting down on themselves. A guy can't pitch if he has
concern about his arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Through this entire two-year ordeal, Zawacki has kept as close
an eye on Saberhagen as anyone in the Boston locker room. Zawacki
eschews terms like ``medical miracle,'' saying that what he has
seen Saberhagen accomplish _ a 15-8 record and 3.96 ERA _ ``is an
extraordinary achievement. Every day he had to do something, and I
don't think many players would do what he did for himself. Most
players would have hung it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, said Zawacki, ``is as mentally a tough person as
I've seen. You can compare him to (Roger) Clemens for mental
toughness. Bret just made up his mind that he was going to come
back if it was at all possible.''
</P>
<P>
   There was admiration in Zawacki's voice as he said those words,
just as there was a twinkle in Saberhagen's eye as he talked of
once again pitching in the playoffs. Where he belongs.

HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL TOUTS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ACHIEVMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were the first wave of black students in Harvard Medical
School's then-new affirmative action program, arriving at the
intimidating school and in racially torn Boston with doubts and
worries, but determined to make it through.
</P>
<P>
   And make it they did, the 15 blacks in the class that entered in
1970, despite academic struggles and discrimination including being
mistaken for janitors and orderlies when they first came on the
wards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some patients said they didn't want a student examining them
because he or she was black,'' recalls Dr. Alvin Poussaint, the
black psychiatrist who joined the medical school that year as an
associate dean to help smooth what many feared would be a rocky
introduction to diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The program was a success and went on to broaden its reach to
other underrepresented ethnic groups, notes Poussaint, one of the
speakers at a ceremony Friday celebrating 30 years of affirmative
action at the Harvard medical and dental schools. Together, the
schools have graduated more than 700 minority students who have
gone on to academic research and clinical practice.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Harvard Medical School had enrolled one or two
blacks a year previously, but the assassination of the Rev. Martin
Luther King in 1968 prompted a new commitment to expanding black
representation, said Dr. Leon Eisenberg, professor of social
medicine and one of nine faculty members who urged Harvard to start
the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation was abysmal,'' said Eisenberg Thursday. ``Only
about 2 percent of medical students were black, and about 150 of
them went to Howard and Meharry (universities), the all-black
medical schools, and the other 50 were divided among the other 90
medical schools'' in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Following a faculty vote to expand the Harvard class to 140 and
to recruit 15 blacks (in addition to three for the dental school),
Harvard professors wrote to friends and acquaintances in search of
promising black undergraduates. By the next year, they had filled
the slots and launched an effort that has achieved a minority
representation of about 20 percent in recent classes, said
Eisenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's observance, titled ``A Recommitment to Diversity,''
sends a message of support for affirmative action even as it is
being rolled back or attacked in several states, said medical
school dean Dr. Joseph B. Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I'm here, we will make every effort'' to recruit
and graduate minority students, Martin said in an interview, ``and
to see that they get sent off from here with the best likelihood of
being able to contribute and to serve some of their own people.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin added that he is concerned about ``the persistence of
inequality in the way we treat people of color'' in medical
institutions in Boston and elsewhere, despite medical school
courses designed to sensitize students to racial issues.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration is clouded by the threat of declining minority
applications to medical schools following the dismantling of
affirmative action programs in California and Texas: a measure
aimed at a similar reversal is on the ballot in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said that nationally minority medical school applications
dropped 11 percent from 1996 to 1997 after the two states ended
affirmative action and the actual number of minority students
entering medical school declined by 8.4 percent. ``And we're all
anxiously awaiting the numbers for 1998,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Poussaint, who is a clinical professor of psychiatry and faculty
associate dean for student affairs, said, ``the minority group
students get discouraged: they interpret (abolishing affirmative
action policies) as a message that they're not wanted any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, he said, has an advantage in recruiting minorities
because it attracts the top students, but officials worry that even
so, recruitment could become more difficult if the pool of minority
applicants shrinks significantly.

<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Former Sprint Car champion Dave Blaney captured
his first career NASCAR Busch Grand National Series pole position
at Charlotte Motor Speedway yesterday, completing a sweep of the
No. 1 qualifying spots for the Pontiac Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Derrike Cope earned the first pole of his
NASCAR Winston Cup career with a hot lap at 181.690 mph during
qualifying for Sunday's UAW-GM Quality 500. Blaney posted his
breakthrough pole yesterday afternoon, touring the 1.5-mile trioval
at 177.247 mph during qualifying for tomorrow's All Pro Bumper to
Bumper 300.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts served as morale boosters for both drivers, and the
manufacturer that traditionally has taken a back seat to Ford and
Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're always surprised (by a front-row start),
because you have to put a perfect lap together,'' said Cope, driver
of the No. 30 Gumout Pontiac. ``When we were here testing, we
brought two new cars and tested very well, and there were a lot of
good cars here. (Points leader) Jeff Gordon was here (in a
Chevrolet), and I knew the laps we turned were very productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we could come back and match that and be close.''
</P>
<P>
   Cope's time of 29.721 seconds was 0.077 seconds quicker than
that of No. 2 qualifier Mark Martin, who toured the track at
181.220 mph in the No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus. The pole came in
Cope's 331st career start. His previous best start was second in
back-to-back races at Pocono International Raceway and Michigan
Speedway in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Cope, who suffered injuries to his ribs, sternum and shoulder
blade in a grinding crash at Atlanta Motor Speedway in early March,
is mired in 37th in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely been a year of uncharted territory for (team
owner) Chuck Rider and myself,'' said Cope, who gave Pontiac its
ninth Cup pole of the season, a modern-era record for the
manufacturer. ``Being hurt to the degree I was really limited us.''
</P>
<P>
   BGN rookie Blaney, meanwhile, continues to make the transition
from the open-wheeled, dirt-track World of Outlaws Sprinters to the
world of full-bodied, pavement NASCAR stock cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a brand new team we started up _ not just me, but the
whole team,'' said Blaney, who won the World of Outlaws
championship in 1995. ``It's taken a little while to get everybody
going, especially me and my confidence up. It's a huge weight off
me. We missed the race at Michigan and I was wondering if I was cut
out to do this. I've been a successful Sprint Car owner and driver
and know how difficult it is to keep morale up.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaney, driver of the No. 93 Amoco Pontiac owned by Bill Davis,
is the 22nd different pole winner this season _ a Busch series
record. The previous record of 21 was set in 1995. The pole came in
Blaney's 16th career BGN race.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Kenseth, who trails BGN championship leader Dale Earnhardt
Jr. by 97 points, qualified No. 2 at 176.887 mph. Earnhardt, winner
of a series-high six races, will start fifth after a lap at 175.393
mph.

OLDER AMERICANS HAVE BETTER LIFE, CENSUS DATA SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life is getting better for older Americans, judging from a drop
in the percentage of those who report difficulty in mundane but
all-important tasks such as reading a newspaper, climbing stairs,
and hefting a bag of groceries.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest gains, according to an analysis of Census Bureau
data published Friday, have occurred among the oldest individuals _
those over age 80. That bodes well for those approaching such
advanced years and for society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully this means that more elderly should be able to work
and live independently,'' said Vicki A. Freedman of the Rand
Corporation, who did the study with her Rand colleague Linda G.
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The study is based on Census Bureau interviews in which about
13,000 individuals 50 and over were questioned about their
difficulty in doing four everyday tasks: reading a newspaper,
lifting and carrying a 10-pound weight, walking up a flight of
stairs without resting, and walking a quarter-mile, about three
city blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing results from 1984 and 1993 surveys, the researchers
found ``large improvements across all age groups _ from folks in
their 50s to the oldest old,'' Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion who said they had difficulty seeing newsprint
dropped during that period from 15.3 percent to 11.6 percent. Those
who reported difficulty lifting and carrying a 10-pound weight
declined from 23.5 percent to 18.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Difficulty climbing stairs without resting declined from 24.5
percent to 22 percent, while difficulty walking a quarter-mile
dropped from 25.8 percent to 22.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While these differences may appear modest, the researchers noted
that they occurred over a relatively short period of time.
Multiplied by the number of older Americans _ and projected forward
in time _ such differences are substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The largest absolute declines in disability occurred among the
oldest old. For instance, 52 percent of those over 80 reported
difficulty lifting a 10-pound weight in 1984, but that declined to
41 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic minorities, less well-educated Americans, and those
without liquid financial assets had substantially higher disability
rates. But even these less-advantaged groups experienced declines
in disability during the nine-year period.
</P>
<P>
   A decline in disability does not mean that the absolute number
of disabled older Americans will shrink. In fact, because the 78
million baby boomers are just entering their 50s, the number of
disabled elders is sure to rise. But the recent studies suggest it
won't rise as steeply as feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you assumed that disability remains constant the number of
older disabled people would triple by 2020,'' Freedman said. ``If
disability continues to decline at about 1 percent per year...the
number of disabled people will `only' double. Compared to tripling,
that's good news, but we still will have a lot more disabled people
than we have today.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysis, which appears in this month's American Journal of
Public Health, is not the first to suggest that disability rates
are declining among older Americans. However, the new study may
help dispel skepticism about earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study provides important new evidence of the strength of
the trend and moves us toward understanding what is behind it,''
said Richard M. Suzman, associate director for behavioral and
social research at the National Institute on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Stallard of Duke University, who coauthored a widely
discussed 1987 report on declining disability among elders, said
the Rand study ``supports our analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These reports tell us that the future is improving,'' Stallard
said. ``They tell us we're not going to get a significant increase
in the period of disability'' as the US population ages _ something
many social planners had assumed.
</P>
<P>
   The implications touch on a wide range of issues, from the
fiscal soundness of Medicare and the cost of long-term care
insurance to cultural attitudes and expectations about the last
third of the lifespan.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ When Josue da Silva stepped up to the
consumer society four years ago, the ground underfoot felt solid
and endless.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years inflation in Brazil was under
control, and he and his wife had steady jobs. They moved out of a
cramped room behind a store into an apartment and signed to buy
furniture, appliances, a stereo system and even a car.
</P>
<P>
   But these days the foundation beneath da Silva is about the size
of his wife's shoes. Out of work since June, he relies on the $40 a
day that Mrs. da Silva earns cleaning houses, and he walks the
streets of Sao Paulo desperate for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed commitments that I don't have any way of getting out
of,'' da Silva, a former salesman in a building-supply store, said.
``How could I know that in 1998 I'd be stopped dead? Our lives have
turned around more than 800 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   As Brazilians prepare to vote on Sunday, polls predict that
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, highly acclaimed for putting
inflation under control, will handily win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the voters' preferences is a kaleidoscope of doubts
and difficulties that Brazilians face as their economy grinds to a
virtual halt, and they prepare for the humiliation of ceding some
degree of sovereignty for an expected $30 billion in aid from the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The president's closest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, 52, a
union leader from the leftist Workers' Party, opposes the bailout
and says the administration lacks an effective industrial and
employment policy. Polls project that he will take 24 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   While presidents and prime ministers, central bankers and
economists debate whether low inflation should be a higher priority
than economic growth, Brazilians ask the same question on a deeply
personal level. After years of failed economic projects and
hyperinflation of more than 200 percent a month just four years
ago, Brazilians see the global future as inevitable, although they
are not sure where they will land in this modern borderless world
of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The middle of a storm is not the time to change the ship's
captain,'' said Emir Sader, a sociology professor at the University
of Sao Paulo and at the State University of Rio de Janeiro,
explaining the support for Cardoso. ``It doesn't mean the boat is
not sinking, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month Cardoso pledged to push Social Security and tax
overhauls through Congress and to thin the Civil Service rolls. His
plans mirror those that he made four years ago, which were partly
sacrificed because of his crusade for a constitutional amendment
that let him seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in trimming government spending heightened Brazil's
vulnerability to the credit problem that is affecting emerging
markets. The overnight doubling of effective interest rates to more
than 40 percent a year last month has stopped the economy in its
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden drain of confidence, vividly illustrated by the
steady exit of $30 billion in foreign reserves since Russia's
collapse last month, raised doubts about the direction of the
economy that Brazilians once thought was doing well.
</P>
<P>
   Nilton Bonder, a rabbi and the writer of ``The Kabbalah of
Money,'' said he felt as if Brazil had been seduced by
globalization as a first-world nation and had lowered trade
barriers without any strategy to modernize industry.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bonder noted, some companies in once formidable
industries like textiles and toys have slowed production and begun
importing from China, ``doing what's best for the company rather
than what's best for Brazil.'' He said he could not imagine what
Brazil's long-term global role would be.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, also questioned conventional economic wisdom, wondering
how setting up a country like Brazil for recession, with a steep
increase in interest rates and cutbacks in government services,
could be considered correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Structural reform is supposed to help the supply side of the
economy, not be a precondition for increasing demand,'' Krugman
wrote recently. He likened the solutions for saving Japan, South
Korea and other economies in crisis to ``trying to bail out a
sinking ship with teaspoons.''
</P>
<P>
   As the election approaches, Brazilians have hunkered down as if
for a tidal wave, expecting that the loss of employment, benefits
and government services, combined with the industrial slowdown,
will hit them all at once after Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Though nobody has laid out the details of Social Security
changes, pensioners like Nilton Tambara, 54, a retired metalworker,
fear becoming its targets.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso had proposed that age rather than the number of years
worked should determine eligibility for retirement. In a famous
gaffe this year he used the word ``bums'' to describe workers who
wanted to retire. Though Cardoso apologized for the remark, workers
like Tambara felt under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Tambara said he began working at 11 and paid into the Social
Security system for 33 of the 41 years that he had worked before
starting to collect his pension. He said Brazilian men, on average,
lived to 65.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil is the ninth-largest economy in the world,
one-quarter of the adults live on one minimum salary of $110 a
month. Seven of 10 Brazilians who will vote next week have had less
than a primary-level education.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution of income, among the most skewed in the world,
continues in retirement, when 15 percent of those who collect
Social Security receive 50 percent of the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any way to stay calm in this country?'' Tambara
asked. ``The categories that the government talks about _ the rich,
the middle class and the poor _ don't exist. It's just the rich and
the miserable.''

BOYS RANCH-NURSE (Undated) - It's unusual for a nurse to be

MCM (Phoenix) - One of the country's largest credit management
companies is planning to hire as many as 2,000 Phoenix area
workers. Midland Credit Management quietly set up shop in east
Phoenix earlier this year and has already brought on 250 people to
its back office call center. But the company is hoping to quickly
build that office up to 1,000 people, and when that is filled, open
a second location of equal size in the east or west Valley. By LISA

BAND BREAKUP-ART (Tempe, Ariz.) - One of Tempe's most popular bands
nationally came to an unfortunate end Wednesday, as the
Refreshments called it quits due to a storm of personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Gin Blossoms, the Refreshments helped define the
Tempe music scene on a national scale. Perhaps best-known as the
guys behind the theme song to TV's ``King of the Hill,'' the group
announced its breakup through a carefully worded news release that
pointed out some of the turmoil that the Mill Avenue Band has
weathered. With PHOTO. By RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E''

DREAM-MOVIE (Undated) - Here is what 's wrong with big screens. You
can imply that this is what heaven's like: spending eternity
looking at giant close ups of Robin Williams' face as he weeps and
moans and emotes. The last time Williams ventured from his safe
ground of comedy into metaphysical histrionics, he made the worst
film of his career, ``Being Human.`` This time, with ``What Dreams
May Come,'' he only makes the second worst. 2 stars. By BOB
FENSTER. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ROXBURY-MOVIE (Undated) - Take your typical ``Saturday Night Live''
skit and turn it into a movie, and you get five minutes worth of
laughs embedded in 90 minutes of fluff and suet. But every now and
then the ``SNL'' crew hits the comic nail right in the funny bone.
Between the two extremes falls ``A Night at the Roxbury,'' which is
just funny enough to keep you from thinking: What ever made them
think they could turn a sight gag about two guys with neck spasms
into a movie? 3 stars. By BOB FENSTER. Story moved in the ``E''

 &QL; 
ANTZ-MOVIE (Undated) - Woody Allen has always been a funny little
guy _ but not this little. Woody turns up picnic-crumb size in the
first of the season's two animated bug movies, ``Antz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz'' is a throwback to Allen's earlier comedies, which means
it's likely to be funnier for adults than young kids. 3 stars. By
BOB FENSTER. Story moved in the ``E`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TATTOO-ART (Undated) - Tattoos, once the province of sailors,
soldiers and elements of society that could charitably be described
as ``fringe,'' are fully mainstream now. Which means, sooner or
later they'll become passe. However, unlike other fads that have
come and gone, a tattoo can't be dropped off at the church clothing
drive or chopped off at the hair salon. Extraordinary measures must
be taken. With PHOTO. By DOUG CARROLL. Story moved in the ``L''

 &QL; 
SHREDDER-ART (Scottsdale, Ariz.) - Diane Rose doesn't care to
share. So instead she shreds. Canceled checks, credit card
statements, out-dated documents and any other piece of paper
containing her name and account numbers that might prove profitable
in unscrupulous hands. With an electrical gadget Rose keeps on her
kitchen counter, the Scottsdale housewife merrily makes mincemeat
out of her private papers before throwing them away in her
dumpster. ``I just love doing this,'' she said. The object of
Rose's affection is her new home-style paper shredder, a

 RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL: the miserable.''

   Tambara stood in an aisle at Wal-Mart outside Sao Paulo, unable
to afford a $16 4-foot aluminum ladder. ``I need the ladder, but
I'll have to find a solution, maybe make one out of wood, or
improvise in some other way,'' he said as he and his wife, Maria
Luisa Takada, left empty-handed. ``If I buy this, I won't have
money for something else that I need.''
</P>
<P>
   The start of the Real Plan four years ago, named for the new
currency, pushed millions of Brazilians into the consumer economy.
In its first two years the sales of appliances, electronics and
cars exploded. It was not just that salaries held their value from
one month to the next, but also that a low inflation rate, about 3
percent this year, meant ready access to credit for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   After he had lived with 3,000-percent-a-year inflation, 120
percent did not seem usurious at first, said Cesar Fraga, 36, an
advertising executive who was having his shoes shined on the
Avenida Getulia Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then people realized their salaries were staying the same,''
Fraga said. There would be no more adjustments for inflation. Now,
Fraga said, he buys only with cash.
</P>
<P>
   An out-of-work receptionist in Sao Paulo, Augusta Pettinari,
said she felt as if she had lost her identity when her credit went
bad. Just before her wedding in April she wrote a check to a
pharmacy for lipstick, face powder and shampoo, and charged
groceries to her credit card. Then she lost her job and could not
pay. Her husband lost his job. Her name was blacklisted, and
alienation set in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an economic life,'' Ms. Pettinari, 28, said. ``I
don't have a name. I feel like I'm not Brazilian anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   On some days, she said, when every door she knocks on for work
knocks back with another rejection, she goes home feeling
everything about her is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been honest,'' Ms. Pettinari said. She looked off
in the distance, tears forming in the corners of her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because I can't pay a few checks that I stop being
honest,'' she said. ``It's what my mother always taught us: `Be
poor, but honest.'''
</P>
<P>
   Da Silva, luckless in his search for work, labors to maintain a
name that is creditworthy, with each month bringing an unrelenting
march of due dates on bills. He and his wife juggle payments and
excuses, developing an intricate knowledge of where each creditor's
truly final limit lies.
</P>
<P>
   The couple smartly avoided interest from the start by joining a
Brazilian-style buying club, a peculiarly Brazilian invention. The
clubs operate on diligence and luck, with members contributing to a
fund for a fixed period and drawing lots to determine who buys
when.
</P>
<P>
   The da Silvas are paying a car consortium $220 a month for five
years, with their chance to buy coming by 2002 at the latest. That
is also how long they would have to wait to receive back the cash
that they have already paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to do with the money in 2002?'' he asked. ``I
need it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, with unemployment in Sao Paulo, the industrial
heartland, running at 19 percent before the recent interest
increases, the qualifications for even menial work are growing more
demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Though discrimination because of age is against the law, all the
jobs advertised on the street where da Silva and Ms. Pettinari
looked for work gave age ranges. For work as a messenger or a
cleaner of houses and offices, employers now require some high
school education, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say people who are 40 years old are discriminated against
in the market,'' da Silva, 33, said. ``But in my case it doesn't
look like I'll have to wait until 40 to be washed up.''

US STOCK FUNDS LOST 15% IN THIRD QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mutual funds got clobbered in the third quarter, the
worst for investors in eight years and a sign that the party, at
least for now, is over.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders of funds invested in US stocks lost 15 percent in
the three months just ended, erasing this year's gains for many
investors, according to early data Thursday from Lipper Analytical
Services, the fund tracking firm. Not only was it just about
impossible to make any money in a stock fund in the last quarter _
many of the losses were in hefty double digits. Among broad,
diversified stock funds, the low-cost, unmanaged variety that
tracks the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index offered the least pain,
declining only 10 percent. By contrast, small-capitalization funds,
which buy stocks in up-and-coming companies, and mid-cap funds lost
twice that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Growth funds, which generally hold big, blue-chip names with
prospects of growing earnings, declined 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There have been bumps in the Great Bull Market of this decade;
many stock funds stood still in the second quarter of 1998. But not
since the third quarter of 1990, when the US stock market was in a
recession, have stock funds _ and Wall Street, on whose fortunes
most mutual funds depend _ performed so badly.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are unpleasant for fund shareholders, who had seen
double-digit gains in recent years. Now market watchers are in
fierce debate over how soon Wall Street might recover _ and whether
stock fund investors will shift their attention to bonds.

<P>
   ``We're perfectly willing to call this the bear market of
1998,'' said Al Kugel, senior investment trategist at Stein Roe &AMP;
Farnham's mutual fund division in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The brutal quarter wipes out gains so far this year for most
investors, except for those holding S&AMP;P 500 index funds, which are
up 5.6 percent for the year through September. By contrast, growth
funds, whose composition may not mirror that of the S&AMP;P 500, have
lost 0.25 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the more a portfolio manager scoured the globe for
promising bets last quarter, the more he stood to get burned. Funds
invested in Latin American stocks lost 29.4 percent, those in
individual European markets declined 17.3 percent, and emerging
markets funds fell 23.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Funds that buy Asian stocks provided a cushion, but still lost
anywhere from 6.7 to 9.4 percent. Global funds, which buy stocks in
many countries, rather than one in particular, were down 14.8
percent. Among international stock funds, only those devoted
exclusively to European shares are up for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Funds invested in gold-mining stocks, considered a defense in
times of turmoil, rose 4.3 percent in the third quarter, which
covers July through September. But they are still down 5.1 percent
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors holding US long-term Treasury paper also eked out some
gains last quarter. But that 1.3 percent rise becomes negative once
fund management expenses are factored in. Still, long-term bond
funds are up 5 percent so far this year, and have outperformed the
vast majority of stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   Sector equity funds, which focus on individual industries, also
had their share of third-quarter woes. The worst hit were financial
services funds (down 19 percent) and natural resource funds (down
16.1 percent). Funds invested in utilities stocks offered one of
the best buffers around, l

NET TOOB MAKER SAYS MICROSOFT MEDIA PLAYER A THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tiny company in Salem, Mass. says that a piece of free
software from giant Microsoft Corp. poses a major threat to its &UR;  &LR; 
business.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Executives of Digital Bitcasting Corp. say their company is
put at an unfair disadvantage because its Net Toob software is
automatically deactivated by Microsoft's popular Windows Media
Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes in and says `OK, I'm now in charge of
everything,''' Digital Bitcasting president Peter Dougherty said of
the Microsoft program.
</P>
<P>
   Net Toob is a $20 program that allows users to look at movie and
TV clips over the Internet. Dougherty said that about 8 million
people use Net Toob to view videos created using a format called
MPEG.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft's Windows Media Player runs MPEG and many
other types of Internet audio and video. Its versatility and that
it's free have combined to make the Microsoft product quite
popular.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's habit of giving away software is controversial.
The firm challenged rival Internet browser maker Netscape
Communications Corp. by offering a free browser to compete with
Netscape's product, which cost $29 to $79. Netscape was forced to
start giving away its browser as well, but the company still has
continued to lose ground to Microsoft. A pending federal antitrust
case against Microsoft cites the company's browser giveaway as
unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty doesn't mind Microsoft's media player giveaway. He's
annoyed because Media Player, when it is installed, automatically
disconnects Net Toob.
</P>
<P>
   Net Toob can be set to run automatically as a user is browsing
on the Internet. The user clicks on a link to an MPEG video, and
Net Toob begins to show the images.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Media Player does the same thing, but with a difference.
When a user installs the Microsoft program, it disconnects Net Toob
from the browser, without telling the user. Now when this user
clicks an MPEG video, the Microsoft program starts up instead of
Net Toob. To go back to using Net Toob, the user must reinstall the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty says this is unfair. He thinks Microsoft should offer
an option that would install the free media player without
disconnecting Net Toob.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Schare, Microsoft's lead product manager for Windows
media technologies, described the dispute as ``a transparent
attempt by some of our our opponents...to create a controversy
where none exists.'' Schare said that Microsoft has e-mail messages
from Digital Bitcasting stating that the firm has no complaint
against Microsoft &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; a claim that Dougherty disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Schare also said that Microsoft might add more flexible
installation options to future versions of the media player, to
prevent the deactivation of competing programs. But he said the
current design was intended to make installing the program easier
for consumers, not to harm rival firms.

EPA OK'S NEW BEDFORD DREDGING AIMED AT PCB POLLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen years after naming PCB-contaminated New Bedford Harbor a
Superfund site, the US Environmental Protection Agency finally
decided Thursday how to clean it up: a huge dredging project that
will lock up PCB-tainted muck in shorefront mounds.
</P>
<P>
   The work, not expected to be completed until 2006 at the
soonest, will involve dredging the equivalent of over 25,000
truckloads of dirt from 170 acres of the harbor floor, then burying
it in four carefully monitored ``confined disposal facilities'' on
the shorefront.
</P>
<P>
   The project could still be snarled by expected battles over the
design of the four disposal mounds, which EPA hopes to turn into
parks, shipping facilities and warehouse lots. The EPA has on hand
barely half the $120 million the project requires.
</P>
<P>
   Coming coincidentally a week after EPA agreed to a $150
million-plus deal with General Electric to clean up its PCB mess in
Berkshire County's Housatonic River, Thursday's settlement marks
the first glimmer of hope in years for cleaning up what is widely
deemed the state's dirtiest harbor. Since 1977, PCB contamination
has led to a ban on eating fish from the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Bedford Harbor is on the verge of a renaissance as both a
working waterfront and tourism destination,'' Mayor Frederick M.
Kalisz Jr. said, adding that the decision will ``allow this process
to move along and the revitalization to accelerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Simmons of Hands Across the River, a local environmental
group, called the decision ``the beginning of the end of our
PCB-contaminated river and harbor'' and promised his group would
bring ``an open mind'' to negotiating design of the mounds.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA promised to coordinate the dredging of 450,000 cubic
yards of PCB-contaminated muck with efforts to deepen navigational
channels in New Bedford Harbor to bring more shipping business to
the economically struggling city.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning about eight years ago, five New Bedford manufacturers
who spewed polychlorinated biphenyl wastes into the Acushnet River
and New Bedford Harbor for decades paid $70 million to settle
Superfund lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   PCBs, used in insulating oils for electrical transformers and
other products for several decades before Congress banned them in
1977, cause cancer in animals and are deemed by EPA a probable
human carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA will use the $70 million to start dredging in the spring
of 2001. After that New Bedford will have to compete with hundreds
of other Superfund sites for EPA cleanup funding for the other $50
million or more required to finish the cleanup _ which could delay
completion past the 2006 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the EPA dredged up 15,000 cubic yards of
so-called hotspots from five acres within the harbor. Some had the
highest concentrations of PCBs ever found in the world. It has
stored them in a 300,000-gallon fenced-in pool at the end of Sawyer
Street near many homes and a playground, and plans to pump out and
treat the water and ship the rest to an out-of-state landfill.
</P>
<P>
   The plans call for four containment mounds totaling 44 acres
that would each rise about eight feet above the high-water mark.
Each would be covered with clean fill and monitored to ensure
pollution does not trickle out.
</P>
<P>
   Once the worst 170 acres of contamination are removed by Army
Corps of Engineers contractors, said David Dickerson, the EPA
project manager, questions will remain about what if anything to do
with thousands of acres of low-level contamination in the outer
harbor south of the hurricane barrier. Dickerson said the $120
million project will solve ``the lion's share'' of harbor pollution
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to remedy the harbor mess have been stalled for years
because of initial concerns dredging could just make the problem
worse, and then by a firestorm of local opposition on
``environmental racism'' grounds to plans to incinerate the hotspot
muck in a low-income Portuguese-American neighborhood.

<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash. _ Armed with a steel harpoon, a .50-caliber
assault rifle and official permission to conduct the first legal
hunt for a gray whale in American waters in more than 50 years,
members of a small Indian tribe gathered Thursday on a beach on
Washington's rugged Olympic Peninsula to start an adventure
intended to resurrect the glory and traditions of their
whale-hunting forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   But before the eight-man crew could even launch its 32-foot
cedar canoe into the steely waters of the Pacific, the Makah
Indians had to contend with a modern-day flotilla of animal-rights
protesters, themselves equipped with a Norwegian-built submarine
painted to resemble a whale and an underground speaker system that
the protesters said was capable of scaring off a whale and saving
its life.
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S. Coast Guard, intent on preventing the groups from
clashing with each other, kept close watch on a scene that has
posed an exquisite dilemma for many environmental groups. Finding
themselves caught between the save-the-whales ethos represented by
the protesters and the respect for centuries-old Native American
traditions that the Makah say their whale hunt is all about, many
leading environmental groups have taken no position at all on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Though no living Makah has ever hunted a whale, the Indian
nation here at the very northwestern tip of the continental United
States was once renowned for its prowess, and it is the only Indian
tribe specifically guaranteed the right to hunt whales under an
1855 treaty with the American government.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by the Clinton administration and a $310,000 grant
from the Commerce Department, the group won an exemption from the
worldwide whaling ban last year and, as of Thursday, has the right
to take up to five gray whales per year in the next five years.
Though critics fear the Makah hunt will open the door to commercial
whaling here and elsewhere, the Indians insist they plan to use the
whale meat, oil and blubber only for their own food and for
ceremonial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hunt is the missing link, the thing that brings us full
circle to our traditions,'' said Marcy Parker, the Makah tribal
council's vice chairwoman. ``We're ocean families, whaling
families. So much of what we are all about comes from the ocean,
and we feel a deep spiritual need to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Makahs live in a spectacular forested setting hard by
the roaring sea and at the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, it
is a community racked by joblessness and tainted by the plagues of
modern life, such as drugs. Many here say that the whale hunt has
succeeded in instilling a new sense of purpose in the lives of the
young men selected for the hunt, and in the Makah nation at large.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribal elders who can remember the taste of whale meat are
not so sure the hunt is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire the young people for taking on the challenge, but I
just hope to God that no one is hurt,'' said 82-year-old Hildred
Ides, whose grandfather was a whale hunter. ``Going for a whale is
a very serious thing, a very dangerous thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 88-year-old cousin, Irene Ward Ides, nodded her head in
agreement as they sat watching dancers in the community hall here
one recent evening. ``I wonder if they really know what they are
doing,'' she said. ``The whale can get awfully mad. The whales know
they're being chased. They know they're being hunted.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the gray whale, which can weigh as much as 40 tons and
grow much longer than the hunters' canoe, was called the ``devil
fish'' by 19th century whalers for its propensity to thrash and
fight when attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, when not under attack, the whales can be
inordinately friendly and are known to swim and play alongside
boats, making them a popular tourist sight all along their annual
migration route from Baja California to the Bering Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, all of the crew on board the conservation ship Edward
Abbey were privileged to meet a young, friendly whale we named
Buddy,'' says an alert posted on the World Wide Web by the Sea
Shepherd Conservation Society, a Southern California-based group
that has taken the lead in opposing the Makah hunt and prides
itself in having scuttled whaling missions around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This October,'' adds the alert, ``Buddy may be blasted to
death against those cliffs, near the reservation at Neah Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   The young men of the Makah nation, who have been training for
months and have traveled as far as Russia to learn whaling
techniques, describe the hunt in sacred terms and say it is a
powerful way to connect with prior generations of Makah hunters and
with the group's traditions, which include hundreds of songs and
dances oriented around the hunt. They defend their planned use of a
powerful rifle to finish off the whale once it is harpooned as a
modern protective measure that would be sanctioned by their
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are praying to be right with God,'' said Eric Johnson, a
muscular 31-year-old who is a teacher in the Makah's Head Start
program and the captain of the hunt team.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is the one to judge whether or not we get the whale, and
whether or not we will survive,'' said Johnson at dusk the other
night, just before he and other crew members slipped away into the
coastal fog for a practice session, chanting songs that are
intended to coax a whale toward their canoe.

</P>
<P>
   With the gray whales driven almost to extinction by global
whaling, the Makahs stopped whaling altogether sometime in the
1920s, and the United States banned the hunting of gray whales in
1937 in a bid to protect the species. It has been a conservation
success story: there are now an estimated 23,000 whales out in the
Pacific, the highest number in at least a century, says the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   The whale was officially removed from the endangered species
list in 1994, an action that sparked the Makah tribe's campaign for
whaling rights.
</P>
<P>
   Even as members of the Makah group huddled Thursday on the beach
and met with Coast Guard officials in a bid to find ways to keep
the protesters at bay, the hunt's opponents were vowing to protect
the gray whales by just about any means necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about five whales, we're talking about
thousands of whales,'' said Paul Watson, the leader of the Sea
Sheperd, from his cell phone aboard one of the group's boats,
anchored off Neah Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he believed that if the Makahs succeeded in taking
even a single whale, it would open the floodgates to demands for
whale hunts by other Indian tribes in the United States and Canada
and, even more alarmingly in his view, to non-Indian whalers in
countries like Norway, Iceland and Japan. Those countries have
conducted limited whaling in defiance of an international ban, but
many groups who defend whales say they believe the Makah hunt is
part of a campaign to broaden commercial whaling. (Whale meat is
considered a delicacy in many Asian countries and, by some
estimates, a single gray whale can be worth up to half a million
dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is not really Neah Bay,'' said Watson through the
crackle of his phone. ``We're concerned about the message this will
send to Oslo, to Reykjavik, to Tokyo.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, who also gathered for a vigil Wednesday night in
nearby Port Angeles, wearing gray and red ribbons (to symbolize the
whale and the blood it would shed) have drawn the wrath of many of
the Makah.
</P>
<P>
   So have the hundreds of people from around the country who have
made threatening telephone calls or written scornful letters to the
Makah, such as this one from Vermont: ``So much for the `We love
the earth, peace, harmony, etc.' What garbage. You people ought to
stick to welfare. Your culture _ what a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Janine Bowechop, the executive director of the Makah Cultural
and Research Center here, which has an extensive display about the
tribe's whaling history in its museum, said she was deeply
frustrated by the way that animal-rights groups, in her depiction,
had ``slaughtered and distorted'' the tribe's interest in a whale
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are completely misrepresenting what is a very meaningful
tradition, something that is centuries old,'' said Ms. Bowechop.
``The question should be, what's the fuss all about? America is
supposed to be about the acceptance of different values.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Keith A. Johnson, tribal treasurer and head of the Makah
whaling commission: ``They come all the way out here to harass the
Makah, a little tribe that wants to take a few whales out of the
ocean. They have no idea about the richness of our culture, what
this is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get the story out _ if we didn't, we'd be these
horrible, dirty savages, the killers of the whales,'' he said.
``It's just not that way.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke in the tribal headquarters, which are in the
barracks of what was once an Air Force radar station here, Johnson
sprayed processed cheese spread on a cracker and popped it in his
mouth. Even as he joked about his snack (''we hear you can make
this stuff from whale blubber too,'' he said), it was a small
reminder of the ways in which modern forces pervade the 27,000-acre
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Neah Bay, amid rusted cars and broken-looking
homes, a few businesses with names like Cedar Shack Espresso and
the Big Salmon bait shop struggle to attract tourists, but the
place has a melancholy feel. And at the Makah Maiden, a
glum-looking waitress pointed to the hamburger portion of the menu
the other night, explaining that the restaurant had no seafood that
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Once whale meat comprised almost 80 percent of the Makah diet,
and among other things, a successful hunt may revive the whale's
importance in the community for both spiritual and sustenance
purposes. But others think that time is past, and should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't like the idea of killing whales, that's all,''
said Valerie Brown, a 38-year-old Makah woman who works as a cook
at Beebe's, another local restaurant. ``Nobody around here knows
what whale meat tastes like, anyway. Nobody ever asks if we have it
on the menu.''

RUSSIAN PREMIER'S CALMING WORDS: I HAVE NO ECONOMIC PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's new prime minister picked an unusual way to
reassure the nation Thursday. After two weeks of deliberations he
announced that he still had no plan to rescue the country from its
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to repeat once more _ there is no program,'' Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said. ``It has yet to be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   In most nations such a statement might provoke alarm. But
Primakov was seeking to calm an anxious public that was worried
that the Kremlin's cure could be worse than the disease.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if Russians do not have something to be concerned
about. Thursday Primakov convened a meeting of top aides to try to
hammer out a strategy for overcoming the economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   A main item on the agenda was the plan drafted by Yuri
Maslyukov, a Communist and the government's senior policy maker on
economic issues. It did not take long for Maslyukov's plan to hit
the street. A newspaper, Kommersant Daily, published it in full
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly Maslyukov's plan calls for a greater state role
in the economy, including controls on hard currency. A new State
Bank for Reconstruction and Development would be established using
the ``nationalized assets'' of failed commercial banks. Wages and
pensions would be paid in two months, and the minimum wage would be
indexed to inflation. There would be huge tax cuts, a combination
that suggested that the government was committed to printing
additional money.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange rate of the ruble would be set by the central bank,
based on changes in inflation and the balance of payments.
Maslyukov's plan also implies that Russians would be able to buy
dollars at exchanges through the country.
</P>
<P>
   It stipulates that hard currency could enter the country only
with special authorization. Exporters would be required to sell
most of their hard currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
   That is an allusion to currency controls that sent shock waves
through the Russian public. Russians have come to treat the dollar
as a second currency, and many people have squirreled away dollars
as a hedge against inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an obvious stupidity,'' Otto Latsis, a commentator with
the newspaper Noviye Izvestiya, said. ``People won't give their
dollars away. They will go to the black market if they need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister who favors free markets,
said the plan was a ``war against the dollar'' and predicted that
it would lead to a shortage of imports.
</P>
<P>
   As the criticism grew, Primakov rushed to distance himself from
the talk of currency controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rumors of the state's becoming a monopolist on the inflow
of hard currency into the country is nonsense,'' he said, asserting
that the document published by Kommersant Daily was just one of six
possible plans.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov may be opposed to wildly unpopular currency controls.
He may be worried that the plan would would set off the panic
buying of dollars, further depressing the ruble. Or he may simply
be trying to keep his distance from Maslyukov's plan while Russia
tries to wrangle its next disbursement, $4.3 billion, from the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The particulars could be modified, but many people following the
maneuvering say they believe that it represents the basic thrust of
the government's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has called for greater state regulation and an
expansion of the money supply, two themes of Maslyukov's plan. The
plan also has many similarities with the plan presented to the
government by Gorbachev-era advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is close to being a final document,'' said the
United Financial Group, a Russian investment business.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how long Primakov can carry on without spelling
out a detailed strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The ousted tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, has argued that the IMF
should not provide further aid until Primakov has taken tough
measures to build a free market.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has, however, sought to turn that logic on its head,
arguing that his government's economic strategy will depend on the
fund's willingness to provide aid.
</P>
<P>
   His aim appears to be to pressure the fund by implying that it
will be the fund's fault if Russia is forced to default on its
loans or take draconian measures at home.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Primakov put it Thursday, without the fund's money, Russia
will have to impose ``unpopular measures.''

NEXT-OF-KIN REQUEST GIVES SOME PASSENGERS A SHIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Manuel Feldman, 75, adjusted his lucky hat and handed
his airplane ticket to Alice Brew at &UR;  &LR; the British Airways counter
at Logan International Airport. Brew examined Feldman's blue
American passport, then handed him a ``contact information'' card.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman eyed the carefully-worded card, which asked for the full
name of a ``contact person not on the flight,'' and cracked a
knowing grin. ``Que sera sera,'' he said, shrugging before he wrote
the name of his attorney in the blank. ``He handles my estate.
He'll know who to call.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman had just experienced US Transportation Department
regulation number 14 CFR 243.13, which went into effect Thursday
and requires American passengers on international flights to do the
disconcerting: provide the name of someone who can be contacted in
case their plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation was established because of difficulties finding
relatives of victims in recent airplane disasters, including
SwissAir Flight 111 that crashed off the Nova Scotia coast Sept.
2., killing 229. The rule is limited to international flights,
where the federal government has a legal duty to notify friends or
family of crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   When a plane crashes in the United States, the airline or
coroner is responsible for bringing the bad news to loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   While some passengers at Logan took comfort in the new
regulation _ like Cindy Friesen, 29, who was heading to Canada to
spend that nation's Thanksgiving with family _ many others were
downright disturbed by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they wait until you're at the counter to do this?''
asked Mary Baxter, an Irish national who was not required to fill
out such a form but who felt sorry for those on her flight who did.
``Why don't they do it when you call to make your reservation?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me the willies,'' said Nancy Sears, a senior citizen
from New Hampshire heading to Austria with a group of friends.
``You don't like to think about the fact that your plane might ...
ditch, or whatever,'' she said, placing a hand over her heart.
``It's unnerving enough just to get on the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Salzman, 58 and heading to France, made light of the
situation. ``I already told my next of kin where the jewelry is,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Salzman, who wears a necklace made of colorful metal
airplanes every time she flies, said she was superstitious, and the
regulation forced her think about something she'd rather not
consider.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hodges, 35, said he hoped the new regulation was
voluntary. ``There aren't enough freedoms in America anymore,'' he
said, opening his eyes wide with rage. ``The government interferes
in everything. Now they're making me sign this because of my
mother's interests, not my own. When will it end?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many passengers said they were unfazed by the new
request, and others thought it was a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great idea,'' said Belle Liberman, one of Sears's pals
headed to Austria. ``They should have done it a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Sears listened to her friend, thought for moment, then nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you're right,'' she said. ``Still, it may be a good
idea, but psychologically, I don't care for it.''

MARKET TAKES SECOND 200-POINT-PLUS BEATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, the United States stock market
tumbled more than 200 points amid growing concern that the global
economic turmoil will spread to the US by next year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this week's Federal Reserve cut in short-term interest
rates, investors have not &UR;  &LR; shaken off fears that economic problems
in Asia, Russia and Latin America will drag down the US economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are simply very unsettled,'' said Larry Horwitz,
managing director of Primark Decision Economics in Boston. ``We're
in totally uncharted waters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average Thursday fell 210 points, or
2.7 percent, to 7632.53. It came within 100 points of its low for
the year, set Aug. 31, when it tumbled 512 points in a day. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index Thursday fell 30.62, or 3 percent, to
986.39. The technology-laden Nasdaq tumbled 81.51, or 4.8 percent,
to 1612.33.
</P>
<P>
   Since the market hit its peak on July 17, the Dow is off 18.3
percent, the S&AMP;P 500 is off 16.9 percent, and the Nasdaq is off
19.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While stocks were falling around the world Thursday, bond prices
were surging as investors raced to find safer havens for their
money. The yield on 30-year US Treasury bonds, which on Wednesday
was pushed below 5 percent for the first time in three decades,
sank 10 more basis points Thursday to 4.88 percent. Bond yields
move inversely to bond prices. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This week's drop in stock prices was triggered by a series of
negative reports from around the world, which economists said add
up to a pervasive sense of gloom.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a key economic survey in Japan showed that business
leaders are more pessimistic than they have been in four years. US
manufacturing activity declined for the fourth month in a row, due
largely to slowing exports. And sales of new and existing homes
were down for the second month in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors are also worried about the potential
exposure of banks, investment firms and securities companies that
loaned money to high-risk hedge funds, following last week's
near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, a giant hedge fund
that needed a $3.6 billion bailout by Wall Street's major banks to
stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you're putting a mosaic together, with all these
pieces,'' said Robert MacIntosh, vice president and portfolio
manager for Eaton Vance Management in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And the picture that's emerging, he said, is not pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the market is expecting a higher chance of recession
next year than might have been the case a month ago,'' said
MacIntosh. Although he still believes the chances of a US recession
are ``much less than 50-50,'' investor behavior during the past
week suggests the fear is real, MacIntosh said.
</P>
<P>
   David Wyss, chief economist with Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in
Lexington, agreed that the wave of bad economic news is having a
snowball effect on US markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way recessions happen. Confidence is everything. At
some point, if confidence gets shaken, then people stop spending
money, investors stop investing and businesses stop spending on
capital improvements. Pretty soon,'' he said, ``your shiny boom
turns into a recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer and Internet companies, along with financial services
firms, were among the worst-hit stocks Thursday. Retail stocks also
fell, however, as fears of a US recession mount.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., the giant software company, fell 6 to 104 1/16
and IBM Corp. lost 3 1/4 to 125 1/4. Cisco Systems Inc., the leader
in computer networking equipment, fell 4 9/16 to 57 1/4. Even Dell
Computer Corp., a darling of Wall Street, fell 4 3/16 to 61 9/16.
More than 42 million Dell shares were traded, making it the most
active US stock.
</P>
<P>
   Among bank stocks, American Express Co. fell 4 1/8 to 73 1/2,
Citicorp fell 4 3/4 to 88 1/4 and J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. lost 3 5/8 to
81. Among local issues, Bank Boston fell 1 3/8 to 31 5/8 and Fleet
dropped 2 5/8, to 70 13/16.

BAY STATE SOFTWARE FIRMS CONTINUE TO GROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' software industry continues to grow,
according to a new survey, with 215 more companies and nearly 9,000
more employees than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The data, due to be released today by the Massachusetts Software
Council, shows there are 2,751 software and interactive companies
in the state, an increase of 8.5 percent from 1997 and three times
as many as in 1989, when the software council first began keeping
the tally.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 402 are Internet-related companies, 43 percent more
than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, most of the companies that make up the state's
software industry are young and relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 percent of the software companies were established
since 1990, while more than half of the Internet companies were
formed in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   About 73 percent of the software companies have 25 or fewer
employees, and 80 percent of the interactive companies have fewer
than 25 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the state's software industry had 131,508 employees,
up 7 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of companies in both categories had revenues
of under $5 million, but together, the state's software and
interactive industry generated $9.2 billion in revenues, an
increase of 15 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are considered conservative, a council spokeswoman
noted, because about 1,100 of the 2,751 companies surveyed did not
provide revenue information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these companies are below the radar screens of the
people who track the industry,'' said council president Joyce
Plotkin, ``but Massachusetts' strength has always been with small
companies. That's where the growth has always been.''
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin said, ``We continue to be a center for software,
business innovationm, and company creation. The growth has just
been phenomenal. There's no shortage of ideas and products and
companies.''

ART REVIEW: IN CIVIL-RIGHTS FERMENT, A CONFLICTED NOSTALGIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ill., Calif., N.Y.)  (Eds.: Exhibition notes at end of review.) 
 (bl)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kerry James Marshall, an artist based in Chicago, has
described his work as history painting, and he has taken black life
in America as his primary subject.
</P>
<P>
   In the large-scale pieces he contributed to last year's Whitney
Biennial, black children played in housing projects that resembled
those he had lived in during the 1960s in Los Angeles. The settings
were carefully detailed, but surreal. Urban buildings had the look
of American-dream suburbs. Hallmark card sunrises and bluebirds
filled the skies. But parts of the pictures were obliterated with
smeared paint.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional tone was complicated, at once sentimental and
tough, mixing affection and reproach. It was as if each picture had
started out as a fond, idealized depiction of a life remembered,
then gradually turned into a disillusioned statement of a life
denied.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Kerry James Marshall: Mementos'' at the Brooklyn Museum of
Art, these complexities deepen, formally and conceptually. For his
first museum solo, the artist has moved into multimedia
installation and has tackled the huge, and hugely conflicted topic
of the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   As always with his work, history is both social narrative and
personal experience. Marshall was born in Birmingham, Ala., in
1955, the year the bus boycott began. He was a child there when the
16th Street Baptist Church was bombed, killing four girls, and when
George Wallace prevented black students from entering the
University of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in Los Angeles during the Watts riots and the shootout
between the Black Panthers and the police. And all of these events
were played out against the deaths of President John F. Kennedy,
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy,
national catastrophes that charged an era with a mood of anger and
grief.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn installation, organized by the Renaissance Society
at the University of Chicago, opens on a funerary note with a
bannerlike commemorative painting. On a solid black field framed by
a decorative border of gold glitter appear the portraits of the
three dead leaders, accompanied by the words ``We Mourn Our Loss''
in Gothic script.
</P>
<P>
   Similar pieces recur throughout the show, though no two are
exactly alike. A portrait of Malcolm X is inserted in one. Another
turns into a tribute to the artist's father. In a third, iconic
faces are blotted out by a swipe of paint. Each panel also
incorporates handwritten words in pencil and ballpoint pen _ Bible
quotations, personal names, the initials of political groups _ like
entries in a funeral parlor guest book or graffiti on a wall,
history inscribed by whoever is passing through.
</P>
<P>
   Words play an important role in Marshall's work. They appear in
all of his paintings and they are the only images in a recent
series of prints of civil rights era political slogans. They range
from the pacifist anthem ``We Shall Overcome'' to the militant
``Burn, baby, burn'' and together chart the shifting political mood
of a decade. Marshall created the prints with five-foot-high
handstamps, and these appear in the show, like abstract sculptures,
along with outsize ink pads in red, green and black, the colors of
black nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Also included is a series of four paintings, each titled
``Souvenir,'' in the artist's signature format _ mural size, on
unstretched canvas _ and they are extraordinary. In each, an
orderly living room, carefully observed in every detail, is
occupied by a middle-aged black woman. The scenes look
straightforward enough except that the woman has angel's wings and
is accompanied by apparitional presences.
</P>
<P>
   In one painting, the faces of black musicians from the past
float above her head; in another, the names of artists and writers
who died in the 1960s: Zora Neale Hurston, Augusta Savage, Lorraine
Hansberry and Bob Thompson among them. In a third, the ghostly
portraits of Black Panthers and the four girls who died in the
Birmingham church hover on high.
</P>
<P>
   The title of the exhibition's centerpiece video work, ``Laid to
Rest,'' seems to promise a resolution to the paintings' mix of
regret and celebration. The film, which can be viewed only through
eyeholes cut in the side of a wood enclosure painted as a
mock-mausoleum, shows a wake in progress with an open coffin banked
by flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But the atmosphere is agitated. Animated images flash by in a
quick-cut sequence over the bier, accompanied by an aggressive
soundtrack of couples battling and drug deals being made. And over
the coffin, above where the head would be, a pair of Lincoln
pennies, intended to close the eyes of the corpse, spin in midair.
</P>
<P>
   The image can have several meanings. Many of the problems
addressed by the civil rights movement have not died; nor have the
movement's heroic ghosts found repose, despite being enshrined in
history books. The work they initiated needs to be advanced, just
as the outsize handstamps, with their exhortations to action, need
to be put to use.
</P>
<P>
   They are being used, of course; the prints Marshall has included
in the installation attest to that. And political changes stemming
from the civil rights era are in progress, though often in subtle
and oblique forms. Such changes are suggested in a group of small
paintings that are not part of the installation, but hang in a
gallery nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Each is a three-quarter-length portrait of a single black sitter
dressed in a traditional American scouting uniform. A Boy Scout in
regulation beige looks out at the viewer, his head surrounded by a
fiery halo. A Cub Scout den mother with close-cropped hair wears
small gold rings in her nose and ears. A scoutmaster has an
American flag stitched on his sleeve and his hand clenched in a
fist.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Marshall's complex historical perspective is distilled. In
these portraits, time-honored American values _ community,
leadership, duty _ that were also the bedrock of the early civil
rights movement, are reconfirmed and radically recast. The scout
figures wear familiar uniforms, but with a difference: as militant
citizens claiming a place in the mainstream but sustaining a
revolution within. It's a difficult position to negotiate, but a
powerful one, and it seems to form the foundation for much of this
challenging artist's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry James Marshall: Mementos'' remains at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, through Nov.
29.

GORDON TINKERS WITH RACE-DAY SETUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Winston Cup points leader Jeff Gordon will start
26th, the spot he earned during first-round qualifying Wednesday
night, in Sunday's UAW-GM Quality 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Because the top 25 positions were locked in during that session,
26th was as good as it was going to get for Gordon this weekend, so
he elected not to requalify yesterday afternoon. But Gordon's hot
lap at 178.974 mph in the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevy
ended a streak of 20 consecutive top-10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed it a little bit in qualifying,'' said Gordon, who
has a 199-point lead over Mark Martin with six events remaining.
``We're trying a different combination here, hoping it's going to
be a little bit better in the race than what we've been in the
past. It's just a different car, different body, different
front-end suspension on it than what we normally run here.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we normally run here is good enough to sit on the pole or
something near the pole, but it's not good enough to win during the
day. We're definitely trying a different combination.'' &QL; 
IRL DATE SWITCH EXPECTED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Motor Speedway officials are expected to officially
announce movement of the track's Pep Boys Indy Racing League event
from late July to Saturday night, May 1, during a news conference
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL has run under the lights at CMS the past two summers.
But the switch to May will allow IRL teams to test their
superspeedway setups before the 83rd Indianapolis 500 on May 30.
The May 1 date makes sense because Mother's Day _ traditionally an
off-day from racing _ falls on May 9 next year. And CMS will play
host to NASCAR's The Winston all-star race on May 22 and the
Coca-Cola 600 on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the IRL awarded Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, a
sister facility to CMS, the 1999 season ender on Oct. 17.

 &HT;    Court rules against census sampling
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal court has sided with an Atlanta-based
public interest law firm in a challenge to the Clinton
administration's plan to use statistical sampling methods in the
2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   A special three-judge panel in the U.S. District Court in
Alexandria, Va., ruled unanimously Thursday that such sampling is
illegal. It is the second federal court to issue such a ruling in
as many months.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is proposing to use sampling to get a more
accurate count of minorities and other groups that have been
historically undercounted in the decennial census.
</P>
<P>
   The matter is headed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which will hear
arguments Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the conservative
Southeastern Legal Foundation. Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), the
foundation's former director, is one of the plaintiffs in the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The first ruling came in a suit filed by Speaker Newt Gingrich
and the House of Representatives, as part of a compromise last year
with President Clinton to seek a speedy court resolution of the
controversy. A three-judge panel in Washington, D.C., then ruled
unanimously against sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans generally oppose sampling, fearing that it would add
people in traditionally Democratic areas. Sampling's effect would
probably be the greatest in the reapportionment of congressional,
state legislative and municipal electoral districts that will occur
in state legislatures around the country in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dangerous and short-sighted political attack on our
republic, which has now been outlawed twice by the federal courts,
means that President Clinton...must stop spending public money on
illegal sampling, period,'' said Matthew Glavin, the foundation's
president.

 &HT;    China orifies Communist Party on National Day
 &HT;    By Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In one of China's most stridently nationalistic
interludes in a decade, the nation's rulers are pulling out the
stops to glorify the once pallid President Jiang Zemin and proclaim
the dominance of Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   With a single-mindedness that would have heartened the late
leader Mao Tse-tung, Communist Party propagandists recast
Thursday's National Day to praise Jiang for his brilliance in
directing a ``people's war'' to vanquish this summer's heavy
floods.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's most visible symbol is a 20-foot-long photo
montage featuring Jiang with a megaphone inspiring legions of
flood-fighting troops as they stand shoulder-to-shoulder protecting
sand-bagged river dikes.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Chinese holiday-makers viewed the giant Jiang
poster as they trooped into the Museum of the Revolution, just off
Beijing's Tiananmen Square, to see an urgently arranged exhibition
of flood-fighting photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which seems to be playing very well with the
people, is also symbolized by the lavishness of the party's daily
self-congratulatory rhetoric on radio and television. The tone
harkens back to the heady years not long after Mao declared the
founding of a ``new'' nation _ the People's Republic of China _
Oct. 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has eloquently proved that the Communist Party of
China is a great, glorious and correct party,'' Premier Zhu Rongji
told 1,000 party leaders and foreign dignitaries Wednesday at a
banquet on the eve of National Day.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, who has enjoyed an overseas reputation as a non-ideological
pragmatist, has emerged in recent weeks as one of the Communist
Party's chief drum-beaters in the propaganda campaign to celebrate
what is repeatedly referred to as China's ``flood-fighting
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The socialist system has incomparable superiority and
vitality,'' Zhu said in his first National Day speech since
becoming premier in March. ``Our people will be able to advance the
great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in
all areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The state media have been laden with almost identical slogans
from other party luminaries, led by Jiang himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-flood campaign proves that the Chinese Communist
Party is a great, glorious and correct party,'' the president said
last month in a visit to the flood-damaged town of Jiujiang in
eastern China. ``The socialist system has great superiority. The
army is trustworthy. The Chinese people are industrious and
courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago, Jiang heightened the rhetoric when he likened
China's victory over the floods to its conquest of pro-democracy
protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late 1980s and early 1990s, we stood up to the
international and domestic political disturbances to defend the
great undertaking of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and successfully withstood a severe test of
political risk,'' Jiang said. ``This time, we conquered the
assaults of the extraordinarily serious flooding ... and withstood
a severe test of natural disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains a mystery just why the Communist Party hierarchs
chose this year's floods as a pretext for such an extended barrage
of patriotic and pro-party propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that following President Bill Clinton's mid-summer
trip to China, the ruling party leaders were worried about a
stirring of support for ending the Communist Party's political
monopoly through the creation of a legal opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   The ``flood-fighting spirit'' campaign also arose at a time when
the image of the People's Liberation Army leadership was tattered
by reports of corruption. Meanwhile, the party was grappling with
how to explain the slowing of China's economy, following
two-decades of near double-digit annual economic growth credited to
Jiang's predecessor, the late Deng Xiaoping.

A TOUGH CALL FOR NFL'S WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The one-game suspension of Detroit Lion safety Mark Carrier for
his frightening helmet-to-helmet hit Monday night against Tampa
Bay's Brice Hunter was not an easy decision for the NFL's top cop,
Gene Washington.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Washington, the one-time Stanford quarterback who went
on to become a Pro Bowl receiver with the San Francisco 49ers, is a
1965 Poly High graduate who long has known Carrier, a 1987 Poly
High graduate who played at USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've run into Mark several times over the years at games and
different functions,'' said Washington Thursday from his NFL office
in New York. ``He's a good guy, and I like him a lot. That made it
doubly tough for me to do what I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What Gene Washington has to do in his duties as the NFL's
director of football operations is to mete out punishment to
players he thinks have delivered illegal hits.
</P>
<P>
   And after watching film of Carrier's violent collision with
Hunter, Washington felt Carrier deserved to be sent to the
sidelines for one game. It's the first time a player has been
suspended in the NFL since 1992 when Green Bay's LeRoy Butler was
forced to sit for throwing a forearm to the head of Detroit
quarterback Andre Ware.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my position, you have to put all personal considerations
aside and just consider the hard evidence,'' said Washington.
``Mark was coming in like a torpedo with his helmet against Hunter,
and it was a clear violation. You just have to put blinders on when
making these decisions, or it'll come back to bite you.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mark's case, we felt the frequency in which he was leading
with his helmet had got out of hand. There was a game last year
against Green Bay in which three of his hits came under review. He
just received a fine in that game, but four hits within a 12-month
period that are considered dangerous is simply too many. I felt the
punishment was appropriate under the circumstances. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The word from a Very Reliable Source With Strong Golfing Ties is
the world's richest man, Bill Gates, recently was turned down in
his bid to become a member of the Augusta National Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the notoriously stuffy members of this notoriously
stuffy organization that stages the Masters weren't impressed when
Gates listed his handicap at a mere 24.
</P>
<P>
   As I've always said, money can't buy everything, including
birdies on a golf course or membership into the world's most
arrogant country club. ..
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire spent two hours the other day at The Abbey in Seal
Beach, a restaurant he made nationally famous when he kept wearing
its baseball hat at his post-game press conferences. He graciously
kibitzed with customers and signed autographs.
</P>
<P>
   He flew to Southern California Sunday evening after striking his
epic 70th home run earlier in the day in St. Louis, and was picked
up at the airport by his pal, Rob Burdick, the famed bartender who
so fortuitously gave him The Abbey hat that has resulted in a
financial windfall for the new establishment.
</P>
<P>
   I hear sales of The Abbey hats have exceeded $400,000. ...
</P>
<P>
   If any regular-season NBA games are canceled because of the
labor dispute, I hear there are 13 hard-line owners who would want
to close down the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt that will happen, but I also never thought I'd see the
World Series canceled, either, as it was in the sport's dark days
of 1994. ...
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated indeed got it right in the headline on the
cover of its current issue. This indeed has been the greatest
season in the history of baseball, and none of us will see even the
faintest likes of it again in our lifetimes. If someone told me
before this magical season that McGwire would hit 70 HRs, Sammy
Sosa would hit 66, the New York Yankees would win 114 games, and
Kerry Wood would strike out 20 batters, I would have told the
person he'd have a better chance of seeing Cal Ripken voluntarily
sit out a game, which Ripken finally chose to do in this memorable
season. ...
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that every single guy I know who has a cell phone and
beeper attached to his trousers is in debt and never gets a date?
</P>
<P>
   I hear the Dodger coaches including veterans ones like Manny
Mota and Joey Amalfitano were told of their dismissals over the
phone from Kevin Malone instead of face-to-face. A real class move
by the new Dodger general manager. ...
</P>
<P>
   I have the overwhelming feeling that it'll be years before the
Dodgers become a serious National League pennant contender again. I
don't know Kevin Malone from Karl Malone, but I do know the
Fox-owned Dodgers sanctioned the trading of Mike Piazza, the best
hitter in the team's Los Angeles history. How many more similarly
stumblebum decisions will be dispensed by the new Dodger caretakers
in the future?. ...
</P>
<P>
   If I were the GM of the San Diego Padres, I'd have fired the
Padres' manager, Bruce Bochy, on the spot the other day for
removing Kevin Brown after he had struck out 16 Houston Astros and
yielded only two hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most dominant playoff performance I've ever
witnessed, yet Bochy brought in his extraordinary reliever, Trevor
Hoffman, in the ninth to finish up for Brown, who wasn't tired and
had been toying with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman almost blew the game the Padres escaped with a 2-1 win
and Brown was seen blowing his top in the San Diego dugout, which
was quite understandable.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres might go on to the World Series, but I have to stick
Bruce Bochy on my Gene Mauch-Bobby Cox-Tony LaRussa list of lousy
managers that makes moves that defy sound reasoning. ...
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Malone sounds too ominously to me like a typically
unctuous, slick-schmoozing, self-absorbed, egotistical
administrative tyrant when he says he feels compelled to make
changes for changes' sake.
</P>
<P>
   How ghastly!
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if I understand it right in his rationale for
detaching Glenn Hoffman, Malone didn't feel comfortable with
Hoffman as the Dodger manager because he didn't hire him. If Kevin
Malone is such a genius, then why weren't his former employers, the
Baltimore Orioles, in the World Series the past few years?
</P>
<P>
   I've always found corporate types who come into a new positions
and decide to clean house at the expense of qualified people to be
insecure buffoons who inevitably fail and wind up getting fired
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   What did Glenn Hoffman do to deserve getting demoted? The guy
had a 47-41 record during his tenure with a mediocre Dodger team
and earned at least a shot to come back for another season.
</P>
<P>
   His only failing, evidently, is that he wasn't hired by Hoffman,
a grievous offense if there ever was one.
</P>
<P>
   Oh please! Just because Fox finds itself in a desperate
situation with a team devastated by its own inane decision to get
rid of Mike Piazza and decides to hand total control over to
Malone, that doesn't mean Malone has to disrupt everyone's life in
the Dodger organization with his micro-managing style. Remember,
Malone, that hoariest of axioms what goes around comes around. ...
</P>
<P>
   I find Randy Hill's wickedly light-hearted NFL comments in our
Monday Snap page far more entertaining than the games themselves.
...
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything more irritating than calling AT&AMP;T long
distance information, and then having to wait and listen to a taped
spiel about whether you want the number you're seeking dialed
automatically for an extra 50 cents?. ...
</P>
<P>
   If the Long Beach State women volleyballers beat UC Santa
Barbara tonight at the Event Center in Santa Barbara, Brian
Gimmillaro thinks the second-ranked 49ers should assume the top
spot in the coaches poll instead of Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're fortunate enough to beat Santa Barbara, that would
give us seven wins over teams that have been nationally ranked,''
says the 49ers' coach. ``Penn State has played one nationally
ranked team.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Brian Gimmillaro's logic is faultless. ...
</P>
<P>
   I echo Bud Selig's sentiments. I wish this baseball season would
go last into infinity. ...

 &HT;    Cable networks reshape journalistic landscape
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Congress releases more files from the Clinton-Lewinsky grand
jury probe today as expected, TV will be there to cover it.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours, the once-secret documents will be everywhere at
once: picked over by reporters and massaged by pundits, subjected
to flash polls, dissected on nightly newscasts and still later,
debated by newsmakers and noisemakers on Sunday morning talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   John Moody, vice president of news for Fox News Channel says the
unblinking coverage of the Clinton crisis is just what viewers want
_ and need.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there were only three networks, the attitude was `eat
your spinach,''' Moody says. ``Now we're letting people have their
cake and eat it. They can eat as much as they want, when they want
to.''
</P>
<P>
   But how much is too much?
</P>
<P>
   Some media observers wonder if TV _ especially all news,
all-the-time, cable networks _ are committing journalistic overkill
on the White House scandal and other splashy stories that have
gotten similar ``wall-to-wall'' treatment in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real sense of chaos here,'' says Robert Thompson,
who runs the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse
University in upstate New York. ``The need to fill all this air
time has resulted in drive-by opinion delivery. Having 24-hour news
channels has taken the whole idea of social thought and turned it
into a spectator sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined viewership of news-heavy cable networks _ including
CNN, MSNBC, CNBC and Fox News Channel _ remains just a fraction of
their broadcast cousins, but they are reshaping the journalistic
landscape once dominated by ABC, CBS, and NBC, which once doled out
information in neatly packaged newscasts twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and CNBC are not only changing how
Americans get their news, but what kind of news they get and how
much.
</P>
<P>
   From Hurricane Georges to the White House sex scandal and from
the O.J. Simpson murder trial to the death of Princess Di, the
cable networks are giving viewers more choices. Even critics
concede that's a plus, but they're concerned the abundance of
coverage tends to exaggerate the importance of certain stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cable networks help push stories that would have been less
of a story if we still only had three networks,'' says Rich Noyes,
political studies director for the Center for Media and Public
Affair in Washington. ``The problem with cable is no matter what
the story is, they make it a huge deal even if it's just a big
deal. The story is hyped to get viewers, but sometimes the story
isn't that exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they must fill a gaping 24-hour news hole every day,
Noyes says, cable networks are often recycling and repackaging the
same story to make it seem fresh to viewers just tuning in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll keep rewording the headlines and every single movement
in the story is exaggerated as a huge trend even if the story
hasn't moved that much,'' Noyes says. ``Through repetition, they
create a false sense of momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sesno, CNN vice president and Washington bureau chief,
defends the network's Clinton coverage as intelligent, fair and
accurate. Still, he admits feeling pangs of ``scandal fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is an echo effect that makes it seem to the
viewer that it's just too much,'' Sesno says. ``I don't think it's
particular to any one network, but now there are lots of networks,
and lots of talk shows and lots of Internet coverage, and at some
point people just say, `Go away and get a life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in
Journalism in Washington, says the economic demands of running a
24-hour network creates a dizzying blur of facts, ideas and images.
For viewers, it creates a warped reality where distinguishing
straightforward reporting from opinions is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cable networks have really gotten into the business of
commenting on the news, which is cheaper to do,'' Rosenstiel says.
``All you need is a booker, a host and some guests and you have a
half-hour of programming. It's not only cheaper (than a half-hour
newscast), it's easier to do intellectually.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody at Fox News disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a rule at Fox that correspondents can't be on the air
at the same time as our spinmeisters,'' he says. ``The only thing
driving us is that Monica Lewinsky is the biggest story to hit
Washington since Watergate. I don't think we are letting anything
push this story beyond what we think is responsible journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson says TV's current information overload may have a
numbing effect on viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What might happen is that the variety and loudness and
constancy of the voices might create so much babble that they just
cancel each other out,'' he says. ``It may get so noisy people just
throw up their arms. It's like when you walk into a bar and you're
overwhelmed by the smoke. But five minutes later, you can't smell
anything anymore.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLUBOVAC, Yugoslavia _ A 42-year-old man who says he is the
lone survivor of a massacre in which 13 ethnic Albanians were
summarily shot and killed in this village in Kosovo recalled
Thursday how he was herded into a garden with other men and told to
lie flat on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Heads to the fence, feet toward the house! Serbian policemen
barked, he recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the severely wounded man said as he recounted the tale
from his mattress on the floor of his home Thursday, police kicked
the prone men with their boots and beat them with the wooden
handles of shovels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept yelling, `Who among you is Kosovo Liberation Army?
If you tell us, we will release everyone else,''' the man recalled
of the events of last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, the shooting started. First, the man to his right
was shot, then two men farther down the row. And then the whole row
from left to right, then down the row again, from right to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the two shots for each man, they kicked one, and he was
alive.'' he said. ``They shot him again. When they kicked me, I
didn't move.''
</P>
<P>
   The survivor, the father of eight children, was advised by
Western diplomats who interviewed him on Tuesday and by a
researcher for Human Rights Watch who saw him Thursday not to give
his name to a reporter for fear of jeopardizing his safety.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats and the researcher for the New York-based rights
organization said the man could suffer reprisals from Serbian
policemen who are at checkpoints on the roads and in the hills
around the village if he revealed his identity.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that because of the clarity and first-hand nature
of the man's evidence, they consider him a key potential witness
for a proceeding at the international war crimes tribunal in The
Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of the men and the massacre of 18 members of an
Albanian family on the same day in villages about four miles apart
in the Drenica region of Kosovo, a province where guerrillas are
fighting for independence from Serbia, prompted calls from Western
leaders for war-crimes investigations by The Hague tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Washington called on the government of the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, to allow impartial forensic experts to visit
the sites to determine what happened. The Milosevic government has
denounced the war crimes tribunal and consistently denied access to
forensic experts, asserting that there was no need for them because
no war crimes had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Two investigators from the war crimes tribunal who have been in
Kosovo for a week were expected to see the survivor Thursday. But
the investigators who got into Kosovo, after long negotiations with
the Yugoslavia government for their visas, left for Belgrade, the
capital, Thursday without interviewing the survivor or inspecting
the site where the Deliaj family was massacred.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at The Hague, Jim Landale, said he had no
information on why the investigators left before pursuing the two
cases. ``We are confirming that we are investigating these
incidents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher for Human Rights Watch, Peter Bouckaert, who has
experience in interviewing survivors of atrocities in Africa, said
after listening to the man's account that the coherence of his
story and his lack of exaggeration made him an important witness
for the tribunal. Significantly, he said, details of the story
tallied with evidence in the garden of spent bullets from an
automatic weapon and pools of blood along the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, said
in New York Thursday that it was troubling that the tribunal had
not seized the opportunity to listen to the survivor or inspect the
two killing sites. ``This is not a historical inquiry,'' Roth said
of the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The survivor, who has a shock of black hair and full black
mustache, has essentially been a captive in his house since he
hobbled the half-mile back home Saturday afternoon. He is too
frightened to go to the hospital even though his leg wound reaches
to the bone and gangrene is starting to develop. His left arm is
also wounded from the second bullet.
</P>
<P>
   The International Committee for the Red Cross visited him on
Tuesday with some bandages and medicines but has not been back
since, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The man described the events leading up to the shootings as the
climax of a Serbian attack on the village that began last Friday
morning with shelling from across the hills. Men, women and
children fled to the forest and spent the night under the trees.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, he said, everyone was ordered by Serbian
forces to come out of the forest and gather in a field. The women
and children were separated from the men, and then the men were
whittled down into a smaller group.
</P>
<P>
   There were about ``30 to 40 police'' doing the sorting of the
men, he said. They wore the blue camouflage uniforms of the Serbian
security police, and some had yellow insignia on their shoulders
signifying rank, he said. Some wore black bandannas around their
foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was one person in charge, he said: ``I don't
know. They were all speaking.'' Toward the end of the selection,
one policeman was making the choices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The final group of men were ordered to walk about half a mile
from the field to a dirt road at a spot just outside the garden of
the house where the killings occurred. They were told to kneel with
their heads down to the ground, he said. They were kept there about
two hours, he said.
</P>
<P>
   They were then forced to walk through the wide wooden gate of
the garden and lie on their stomachs with their hands held behind
their necks.
</P>
<P>
   When the beating with the shovels started, the victims began to
scream, he said. Those who turned their faces to the policemen were
beaten much more, he said. ``I was screaming and shouting, but I
didn't turn my face, only once.''
</P>
<P>
   The man said that after a while, ``somebody new came to the
garden.''
</P>
<P>
   He presumed, he said, that it was the ``new'' policeman who did
the firing. A diplomat who interviewed him on Tuesday said he
understood from the man's account that one or more policemen did
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were executed one by one,'' he said. ``Some were begging to
be released. Nobody tried to get up.'' The clatter was that of an
automatic weapon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly silence fell, he said. He could hear the policemen
leave the garden and then depart the village with a burst of
machine-gun fire.
</P>
<P>
   A builder by trade, the man said his brother was one of the 13
who was shot to death. His brother's body was brought home along
the same route he had used to escape.
</P>
<P>
   The survivor's face crumpled slightly when he was asked if he
would testify at The Hague. He was most afraid, he said, for the
safety of his wife and children, who would most likely become
targets of Serbian revenge.

IMF ROLE IN WORLD ECONOMIC WOES IS HOTLY DEBATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the world's finance ministers and central
bankers gathered last year in Hong Kong, they nervously
congratulated each other for containing _ at least for the moment _
a nasty financial brush fire in Asia. In a year's time, many
predicted in hallway chatter, the troubles in Thailand and
Indonesia would look like a replay of Mexico in 1995 _ a rough bump
in the road for a world enjoying remarkable prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about bad market calls. Twelve months later, as the same
financial mandarins clog Washington with their limousines and glide
through endless receptions at the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, just about
everything that could have gone wrong in the world economy has: the
worst downturn in Japan since World War II, economic meltdown in
Russia, a depression in Indonesia that is plunging 100 million
people below the poverty line, and deep fears over what happens
next in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this year's IMF meeting most remarkable, though, is
that the harshest criticisms are directed at the monetary fund
itself, and, by extension, at the U.S. Treasury, which is viewed as
the power behind the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in place of confident predictions, there are mutual
recriminations. Arguments are breaking out over whether the true
culprits were crony capitalists and weakened leaders like Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, or huge investors who poured money into
the world's emerging markets with reckless abandon in the mid-1990s
and panicked in the past twelve months.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds of billions
of dollars have fled from economies on four continents _ seeking
the safest havens possible, often in the United States _ and the
money is not returning anytime soon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And the subtext of every seminar on capital flows and every
conclave of nervous ministers will be some painfully blunt
questions: Can this be stopped? Or is the world headed for a global
recession?
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three years ago the IMF was created after the Bretton
Woods conference which sought to stabilize the world economy and
secure the peace after World War II. Now it is under attack from
all sides, charged not only with worsening a bad situation by
misjudging the economics, but with being politically tone-deaf in
some of the most volatile capitals in the world, from Jakarta,
Indonesia, to Moscow. For the first time, there are disturbing
questions about whether the institution itself is still capable,
financially or politically, of containing the kind of economic
contagion that caught the world unaware.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the IMF's critics were largely found in Africa and South
Asia, were the fund was often viewed as arrogant; today they
include Wall Street's biggest players and top officials in the most
powerful economies of Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few _ including former Secretary of State George Schultz
and members of Congress who are increasingly suspicious of all
international institutions _ are talking about scrapping the IMF
altogether. But almost everyone is talking about creating a ``new
financial architecture'' that can do what the old one clearly
cannot: smother financial wildfires before they leap around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other
leaders, after months of silence, have edged into the debate, in
some cases wresting the issue for the first time from their finance
ministers and central banks. Their fear, their advisers say, is
that 15 months of financial turmoil are now threatening political
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns have turned this year's meeting into a tumbled
mass of worries and a groping for short and long-term solutions.
The Japanese, the French, the Southeast Asians are all arriving in
Washington with different diagnoses of what went wrong, and
different solutions about how to set it right. The United States
has its own set of plans, a mix of suggestions to force more
disclosure of financial data in countries around the world and to
impose more American-style financial standards and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an ideological argument is breaking out over whether
the world should slow down a long march toward more free and open
markets _ a strategy pressed by the Clinton administration for the
past six years. Others argue that it is unwise to start rebuilding
the hospital while the patients are still on the operating tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year the standard answer that all of us were given came
down to this: `We have the IMF and the World Bank, and they know
best,''' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said over breakfast
in Washington the other day, reflecting on how the crisis turned 30
years of astounding growth in his country into an overnight
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they said everything that went wrong was our fault,'' he
said. ``But now, now I think people know that much of the problem
came from the outside, and we need something better.''
</P>
<P>
   And the IMF itself is beginning to fight back, an awkward role
for an institution dominated by Ph.D. economists who are
unaccustomed to being openly challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every place you turn you read the same story, that we came in,
that we made things worse,'' said Stanley Fischer, the deputy
managing director of the fund, who was born in Northern Rhodesia _
now Zambia _ and became chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's economics department before taking a job that has now
put him in the center of the financial storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We frequently get the blame, some of it well-deserved,'' he
said. ``But it is politically convenient for governments around the
world to cry, `The IMF made us do it,' and pin their mistakes on
us. That's fine. We'd rather be loved, but more than that we'd like
to be effective.''

   MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS

   On a steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, the IMF's top
official, slipped into Jakarta to the private residence of
President Suharto and sat down for a four-hour meeting to tick off,
line by line, the huge reforms Indonesia would have to implement in
return for tens of billions of dollars in emergency aid. Two
previous deals had collapsed when Suharto ignored the fund's
conditions, so Camdessus insisted that he strike a deal directly
with Suharto, then Asia's longest-serving leader.
</P>
<P>
   It was a meeting of men who knew different worlds of power
politics: Suharto rose as a general in central Java, and Camdessus
had detonated mines in Algeria for the French army before entering
the French Treasury on his way to becoming head of France's central
bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all there,'' a senior IMF official recalled. ``He was
told he had to dismantle the national airplane project, the clove
monopoly, all the distribution monopolies.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Camdessus looked at the impassive Suharto and
said, ``You see what this means for your family,'' a reference to
their vast investments in the country's key industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I called in my children, and they all understand.'''
</P>
<P>
   But within months, that exchange in Jakarta came to symbolize
the IMF's twin troubles: Its inability to understand and reckon
with the national politics of countries in need of radical reform,
and its focus on economic stabilization rather than the social
costs of its actions.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto had no intention of fulfilling the agreement. It was,
one of his former Cabinet members said, ``a delaying move that was
obvious to everyone except Camdessus.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one reason why the IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf is
that its senior staff is almost entirely composed of Ph.D.
economists. There are few officials with deep experience in
international politics, much less the complexities of Javanese
culture that were at work in Indonesia. Historically, experts in
politics and security have gravitated to the United Nations,
development experts to the World Bank, and economists to the IMF _
creating dangerous gaps in a crisis like this one.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the fund had only a rudimentary understanding of
what would happen if its demands were met and all Indonesia's state
monopolies were quickly dissolved. While that system lined the
pockets of the Suhartos and their friends, it also distributed
food, gasoline and other staples to a country that stretches for
3,000 miles over thousands of islands. To help balance the budget,
the fund demanded a quick end to expensive subsidies that keep the
price of food and gasoline artificially low.
</P>
<P>
   But that, combined with the huge currency devaluation that
sparked the crisis, resulted in high prices and shortages that
fueled riots that continue to this day, as millions of Indonesians
lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF _ unintentionally, its officials insist _ also sped
Suharto's resignation, insisting on the elimination of ``crony
capitalism,'' code words for removing the Suharto family from the
center of the economy. Ultimately, that may prove to be Indonesia's
salvation, if the new government can contain the rioting against
the ethnic Chinese minority _ whose money is desperately needed to
save the country's fast-shrinking economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worth noting,'' Fischer said this week, ``that our
programs in Asia _ in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand _ only took
hold after there was a change in government.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Indonesia experience has revived the argument
that the IMF is so focused on stabilizing banks and currencies, on
preventing capital flight and freeing up markets, that it is blind
to the social costs of its actions. Among the toughest critics has
been its sister institution, the World Bank, whose main charge is
alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen the tension almost every day,'' one senior World
Bank official said recently. The bank has gone to extraordinary
lengths in recent months to differentiate its role from that of the
fund, and to announce a tripling of aid to the poorest in the
countries hit by the economic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Even U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has joined the argument,
warning in a speech at Harvard recently that ``if globalization is
to succeed, it must succeed for poor and rich alike. It must
deliver rights no less than riches. It must be harnessed to the
cause not of capital alone, but of development and prosperity for
the poorest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   IMF officials say they are changing strategies when they see
they are exacting too great a social cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult formula to get exactly right,'' Fischer
said in August, as Russia was teetering and the IMF was sending in
$4.8 billion in aid that was rapidly wasted. ``You need enough
discipline to send the right message to the markets and keep
investors from fleeing. But you need enough leeway to keep people
from suffering more than they otherwise would.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, he noted, the IMF has allowed more spending to
sustain subsidies for basic goods for longer periods in Indonesia,
Korea and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new flexibility at the IMF'' a senior Indonesian
official concluded recently. ``It is a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY?
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration admits that the IMF has many
failings, many of them on display this year. But it insists that
the world has gone through global financial crises without an IMF
once before in this century _ and the result was the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt the situation over the past year would have
been much worse _ with greater devaluations, more defaults, more
contagion, and greater trade dislocations _ without the program
agreed with the IMF and the finance it has provided,'' Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Congress last week.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans and some Democrats are unconvinced. Even though
the Senate has overwhelmingly approved an $18 billion contribution
to the fund to help it fight new crises, the House defeated that
measure two weeks ago. The fund's last hope of getting the money,
which will free up nearly $100 billion in contributions from other
nations waiting for the United States to act, will come when the
House and Senate try to resolve their budget differences in a
conference committee in the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   A rejection, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send
a message around the world that the United States is turning its
back on the one institution charged with restoring economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere else in the world, though, politicians and
businessmen insist that one of the biggest problems with the IMF is
that, contrary to the view of Congress, it acts as the U.S.
Treasury's lap dog. Ask in Jakarta or Moscow, and the response is
the same: The IMF never ventures far without looking back for the
approving nod of its master.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That view may not be far wrong. In ordinary times, the United
States largely leaves its hands off, as the IMF's executive board _
made up of 24 representatives of the 182 member nations _ delve
into the intricacies of budget policy in Greece or banking
regulation in Argentina. ``Surveillance'' of the world's economies
is the fund's main activity.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States weighs in, however, is when the IMF is
called on to rescue a country in deep trouble. Only then does the
IMF _ and the U.S. Treasury _ have the leverage to extract
commitments in return for billions in aid. In theory, the U.S.
influence is limited: It has an 18.5 percent vote in the fund.
Germany, Japan, France and Britain have about 5 percent each. But
in practice the United States usually gets its way, exercising its
influence behind the scenes, often in interactions between Fischer
and Summers.
</P>
<P>
   The two met when Fischer was on the MIT faculty and Summers was
a graduate student taking one of his classes, later becoming a
colleague at MIT. Each served as chief economist of the World Bank.
It was Summers who was instrumental in placing Fischer in the
fund's no. 2 job, and these days they talk constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually a warm relationship,'' Fischer said this summer.
``Remember, this is a job where you cannot turn to outsiders for
advice _ you can't call the chief economist at a Wall Street firm,
or even many of your academic friends, because so many of the
issues are confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury's relations with Camdessus are often more strained
as he plays the role of world diplomat, traveling the globe and
trying to coax along political leaders. The tensions were obvious
from the start of the Asia crisis. The fund made little secret of
its displeasure that the United States was not offering direct aid
to Thailand, a major U.S. ally, as a sign of support and
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the backlash in Congress when Mexico was bailed out
with U.S. money, that was the last thing the Treasury planned to
do. Summers, in turn, thought the fund was not forcing the Thais to
implement its reform commitments rigorously enough or disclose
their true financial picture. Within the U.S. government there was
other dissension: The State and Defense Departments felt the United
States should do more for Thailand, but backed off when the
Treasury asked if they would like to pony up some aid out of their
own budgets.
</P>
<P>
   There were other conflicts. When Japan used the last IMF meeting
to propose setting up a $100 billion ``Asia Fund'' _ one that would
exclude the United States and would probably offer aid under much
more relaxed conditions than the IMF does. Rubin called up
Camdessus at breakfast one morning and told him that the Japanese
proposal would undercut the IMF's authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just had a dispute with Michel,'' Rubin reported to his
aides as he returned to his orange juice and croissant. One of them
shot back: ``And it's only 8 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus backed down at Rubin's insistence and walked away from
money that Asia could have used. Japan says it will be back with a
similar proposal this weekend, this time for a $30 billion fund.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus has also rankled U.S. officials with statements that
amounted to cheerleading to reassure the markets _ sometimes in the
face of the facts. In June, with Russia on its way to collapse,
Camdessus declared that ``contrary to what markets and commentators
are imagining'' about the slow collapse of Russia's economy, ``this
is not a crisis. This is not a major development.''
</P>
<P>
   The bailouts of Russia and South Korea were prime examples of
how Washington muscles into the IMF's turf as soon as major U.S.
strategic interests are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas, as South Korea slipped within days of running
out of hard currency to pay its debts in December, it sent a secret
envoy, Kim Kihwan, to work out a rescue package. ``I didn't bother
going to the IMF,'' Kim recalled recently. ``I called Summers'
office at the Treasury from my home in Seoul, flew to Washington
and went directly there. I knew that was how this would get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days the Treasury dispatched David Lipton, its most
experienced veteran of emergency bailouts, who is leaving his post
as undersecretary for international affairs this month, to shadow
the IMF staff's negotiations with the government in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer was displeased. ``To make a negotiation effective, it
has to be clear who has the authority to do the negotiating,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   WHO LOST RUSSIA?
</P>
<P>
   The pattern was repeated this summer, when the United States
raced to put together a $17 billion package for Russia. The IMF's
staff in Moscow declared that Russia needed no money at all _ it
just needed to enact policies that would restore confidence in
investors. The Americans and Germans came to a different
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, U.S. officials gathered in the White House situation
room to consider what might happen to Russia if the ruble was
devalued and market reforms collapsed and to push the IMF to come
up with emergency money. So the fund began assembling a last-ditch
program to prop up a country that had resisted its reform plans for
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus, though, was still hesitant, questioning whether the
IMF should risk its scarce resources in Russia. ``We had to pull
Michel along,'' a senior Treasury official recalled.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Camdessus' instincts were right while the
approach championed by Rubin and Summers proved disastrously wrong.
The first installment of that payment _ $4.8 billion _ was wasted,
propping up the currency long enough, in the words of one IMF
official, ``to let the oligarchs get their money out of the
country.'' Then Yeltsin reversed his commitments, let the ruble
devalue anyway, began printing money with abandon and fired
virtually every reformer in his government _ resulting in a
collapse of the IMF agreements and the indefinite suspension of its
aid program.
</P>
<P>
   Now, inside the IMF and on Capitol Hill, there are
recriminations over ``who lost Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Fischer argues that ``there are no apologies owed for
what we attempted in Russia.'' But some IMF officials complain
privately that they let Rubin and Summers run roughshod over them,
striking a deal that fell apart within weeks as the Russian
parliament rebelled and Yeltsin backed away from his commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Summers responds that the United States ``took a calculated
risk'' because ``it was vastly better that Russia succeed than not
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian collapse touched off new rounds of economic
contagion, with investors fleeing Latin America, and triggering
huge losses in hedge funds like Long Term Capital, the Greenwich,
Conn., investment firm that needed to be rescued by Wall Street
powerhouses whose money it had invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia was a turning point,'' said Robert Hormats, the vice
chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``It made the world realize that
some countries can fail, even if the IMF and the Treasury
intercede. And that changed the perception of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the countries meet to face a future that the IMF has
warned could be very bleak, they need to reverse those perceptions,
or watch countries slowly starve for lack of capital. The emerging
markets are calling for controls on short term investments. The
French want a stronger IMF. The Americans say the answer is more
disclosure, so that investors are better warned, and tougher
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are usually nice, quiet meetings; everyone very
polite,'' a top U.S. official said earlier this week. ``Not this
year.''

COLLECTION FIRM GROWS IN PHOENIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A major credit management company expects to hire
2,000 workers in the next few years as it expands its operation in
the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Midland Credit Management quietly set up shop in east Phoenix
earlier this year and already has 250 employees at its call center
near Broadway Road and 44th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutchinson, Kans.-based company hopes to double that by
December, and have 1,000 employees by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Once the present 51,000 square-foot office is filled, the
company will look for a second center in the far east or west
Phoenix area that would employ another 1,000 people, said Les
Gilbert, a local career opportunity manager with MCM.
</P>
<P>
   If the two offices are filled, the company would also
considering opening a satellite operation of about 200 workers in
Flagstaff, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning to grow dramatically,'' said Frank Chandler,
Midland's president. ``Arizona is where we want to focus that
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand employees would make Midland one of the largest
back office operations in the Valley, said John Lewis, a projects
manager in the office of business and work force development for
the Maricopa Community College District, who has studied the local
back office market.
</P>
<P>
   The company is planning its expansion as many other local
back-office operators are reporting struggles in finding and
keeping workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley has become known as a popular destination for call
centers, with its large, educated labor pool with neutral accents
and its lack of weather problems. But as the number of back office
operations has doubled to 120 in the past few years, competition
for workers has driven wages from $6 an hour to more than $8. Many
call center operators have been frustrated as workers continually
jumped ship for a few more cents an hour elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis said many of the companies who complain about the
labor pool drying up are not understanding the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you employ the three 'bs' _ bucks, benefits and
benevolence _ if you treat your workers right, you could open up a
huge call center in the busiest area in the Valley and fill your
staff,'' Lewis said. ``The ones that are having trouble finding and
keeping workers usually fall into two categories: low-ballers and
sweatshops.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert acknowledges that hiring has not gone as quickly as
Midland had hoped, but he said the company is confident it will be
able to fill its openings. He said MCM's offering of high wages,
attractive benefits packages and a friendly, family-like atmosphere
have helped.
</P>
<P>
   The company is launching a major advertising blitz to jump-start
its hiring. Midland offers base pay of $10.39 to $14.42 per hour,
plus commissions, bonuses, medical benefits and paid vacations. A
job hotline at 707-5506 offers more details.
</P>
<P>
   Midland Credit Management is one of the larger debt management
companies in the country. Chandler took it over in 1991, and
changed it from a floundering third-party collector to a purchaser
of unsecured, charged-off accounts _ mainly credit card balances
and student and consumer loans. Companies like Midland purchase the
debt for pennies on the dollar and make their profit from what they
can recover.
</P>
<P>
   MCM has grown from 28 employees in Kansas in 1991 to 78 there
now, plus its expanding Valley operations. The amount of debt it
purchased has increased from $650 million last year to close to $1
billion this year. It is positioning itself to go public down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're seen as one of the up and coming companies in the
industry,'' said Steven Frie, an analyst with Standard &AMP; Poor's who
prepared a report on Midland. ``Once a company gets up into the
billions in the debt it services, it becomes a pretty major
player.'' &QL;

RODHAM CLINTON PRESSES HOUSE DEMOCRATS ON IMPEACHMENT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is vigorously
pressing House Democrats to oppose an impeachment inquiry of
President Clinton, arguing that the presidency and the country
could be irreparably harmed by a full-scale investigation of her
husband's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her personal pain over the president's illicit affair
with Monica S. Lewinsky, Mrs. Clinton has aggressively reached out
to numerous lawmakers in recent weeks in the hope of sparing the
president from a formal impeachment inquiry, several lawmakers and
congressional aides said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the cabin of an Air Force jet on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton made
the case to a half-dozen House Democrats, including Representative
Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, during a flight from Washington
to Puerto Rico to survey the damage from Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   The president's defense strategy is focused in part on keeping
the 206 Democrats in the House as united as possible in opposing a
formal impeachment inquiry to make it appear as if Clinton is the
target of a partisan investigation motivated by election-year
interests.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Mrs. Clinton has fully embraced the White House
initiative, as the House Judiciary Committee prepares to vote early
next week on recommending the formal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hard for anyone to see that she's certainly upset
with this whole process, especially the unfairness of it all,''
Kennedy said Thursday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy declined to discuss specifics of Mrs. Clinton's private
conversation over the Atlantic Ocean with the House Democrats.
Among them were Representatives Charles B. Rangel of New York, Jim
McDermott of Washington, George Miller of California, and Donald M.
Payne of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy attributed Mrs. Clinton's anger in part ``to the
prosecutorial misconduct of Ken Starr, his entrapping witnesses,
his conflicts of interests, his political bias.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said Mrs. Clinton spoke pointedly to the House Democrats
about trying to focus the midterm election debate on the
differences in spending priorities between the two parties. But she
placed special emphasis on working to block the impachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is obviously concerned about the country and the fact that
this thing has been given such a green light by so many people
without somebody saying, `Stop, what in the world are you
thinking?''' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired in part by his conversation with Mrs. Clinton, Kennedy
delivered a speech on the House floor Thursday in which he accused
Starr, the independent counsel, of engaging in ``sexual
McCarthyism.'' He also asserted that House Republican leaders are
rushing to launch a formal impeachment inquiry of Clinton now
``because the majority could never vote to initiate an inquiry once
they really knew what they were talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is a reckless, embarrassing personal act by the
president,'' Kennedy said in his House speech. ``It was wrong. He
was human. He tried to hide it. That too was wrong. None of this,
however, shows that the president was on a course that was
dangerous to the republic or justifies throwing this democracy into
a constitutional tailspin.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton and her spokeswoman were traveling in Latin
American Thursday and were not available to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the White House picked up key support Thursday from
the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who
has pledged to mobilize rank-and-file Democrats against a full
impeachment inquiry unless the investigation is limited to the
Lewinsky matter, according to House Democratic sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is expected to pass a resolution early
next week that calls for a full impeachment inquiry with
Watergate-style rules that allow for a wideranging inquiry, give
both Democrats and Republicans access to subpoena power and allow
the president's lawyers to participate fully. Under a draft of the
resolution released Wednesday by the panel's chairman,
Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, no deadline would be set
for the probe, and the committee would be permitted to expand the
investigation beyond the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, even some who had pressed Hyde to adopt the
Watergate-style rules, said the resolution was designed by
Republicans to prolong the investigation as far into the 2000
election season as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Thursday to Hyde, Representative John Conyers Jr. of
Michigan, the Judiciary Committee's ranking Democrat, said the
resolution could ``only mire the country into a protracted and
partisan inquiry which could last for years and drag down the
country in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gephardt huddled privately Thursday night with Democrats on
the Judiciary Committee, trying to draft an alternative to Hyde's
resolution, Republicans accused many Democrats of duplicity,
particularly for seeking a Watergate-style resolution, then
criticizing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of doublespeak going on,'' said
Representative Stephen E. Buyer, an Indiana Republican who serves
on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer described the opposition as ``a diversionary tactic to
confuse'' the public and blamed it on ``extreme, left-wing
Democrats'' on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Added Representative Charles T. Canady, a Florida Republican and
committee member: ``I have a growing suspicion that no matter what
we do, they will criticize us.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats privately acknowledged they face a dilemma. If all 16
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee oppose Hyde's resolution for a
formal inquiry, they run the risk of looking badly out of step with
the large number of Democrats who favor an impeachment review and
may support the Republican proposal on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   That would provide Republicans powerful ammunition to attack
committee Democrats as more partisan than their peers, and perhaps
substantially weaken their ability to mold committee proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   With about 50 rank-and-file Democrats already poised to support
the GOP resolution, according to Democratic sources, Gephardt and
the White House faced a dicey task in designing a resolution that
would prevent a wholesale desertion of Clinton by the Democratic
caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who is close to Gephardt, tried to rally his colleagues
against the Hyde resolution, saying on the House floor that
supporting the measure would set the House on ``a reckless course
that wil imperil and permanently damage the Constitution and the
definition of what is an impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the House was headed down ``a maddening road'' toward
the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton, Gephardt and Kennedy were given little chance
of blocking the GOP move, particularly because Clinton's popularity
among congressional Democrats is considered to be at an all-time
low despite broad public support for his job performance.
</P>
<P>
   When the House voted last month on the resolution that
effectively started the impeachment process, the measure passed,
363-63, with support from more than 130 Democrats.

   QUEBEC-ENGLISH (Montreal) -- Quebec's English-speaking minority
is campaigning to convince the venerable Eaton store to post signs
in English as well as French. But Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard

BIRD, BOSTON IRREVOCABLY TIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ This is a true story. It is not a re-creation. Names
have not been changed to protect the privacy of the characters. It
is dramatic; it is not a dramatization. This is the story of a man
who took his last NBA fadeaway jumper on May 17, 1992. We know: so
far, none of this is unusual. Many men have retired from pro
basketball, sidelined by unpredictable backs and sore feet that
shifted and turned and cut into sneakers far too many times over 13
seasons. Careers end. It happens. But how many players can say they
made a city and region stop for six years?
</P>
<P>
   Our main character has done that. It is as if Boston and New
England life is a compact disc, a disc that the man can rewind,
replay, and freeze any time he wants. The last time he gingerly put
on his No. 33 jersey in 1992, Chris Ford was his coach, his final
opponent's arena was literally in the middle of Ohio woods, his
president's name was George Bush, his governor's name was William
Weld, and, like everyone else, he did not think there was anything
peculiar about a young woman named Monica wearing a blue dress from
the Gap. So everything has changed. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   When you think of our main character, all 6 feet 9 inches of
him, do you think of the pensive man at the end of the Indiana
Pacers bench? Or do you think of No. 33 throwing a no-look pass to
a teammate cutting to the basket? He will be inducted into the
Basketball Hall of Fame tonight in Springfield. Once again, we
know: This is not unusual. We could have prepared the appropriate
busts and plaques in the early 1980s. But cliches tell us that life
goes on. Apparently it doesn't for him. Life is the same. The man
isn't just as popular as he was when he played for the Celtics. He
is more popular. This doesn't happen often. Magic Johnson, a son of
Los Angeles, coached and left the Lakers and had a late-night TV
show _ made in LA _ canceled. If there were a program called ``The
Larry Bird Hour'' filmed in New England, do you think it would be
dropped, no matter how poor the ratings and/or content? If you
answered yes, you must read on about this very fictional yet very
real man. You must read about this Larry Bird, a man who has made a
city and region stop for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Larry is always watching. This is not some Orwellian statement
(although Bird won the first of his three MVP awards in 1984 while
George Orwell's book about Big Brother always lurking is titled
``1984''), it's a fact.
</P>
<P>
   If you are hungry, you can go to the Coolidge Corner Clubhouse
in Brookline. You can check the menu and find a Larry Bird
sandwich, a ham and turkey creation on white rye with Russian
dressing, Swiss cheese, and cole slaw. Following your meal, you can
travel further into Brookline to see Bird's old home, where people
still tell you that, yes, Larry once lived here. You can go to
Quincy Market, where our character once got into a scuffle at a
place named Chelsea's. The bar is long gone, 13 years after Bird
allegedly threw a punch at a 200-plus-pound, former college
offensive lineman named Mike Harlow. But the stories are still
there. Larry is still here. Of course.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some things you cannot do. You cannot call the
Registry of Motor Vehicles and request a license plate that says
something like ``33'' or ``Larry 33'' or ``Bird 33.'' They're all
taken. Ed Lavoie knows about that. He says he probably shouldn't
admit it, but the other day he saw a Connecticut plate with ``L.
Bird'' inscribed on it and, well, he was very intrigued by it. He
wanted it. Desperately. Not desperate enough to go up to the car
and take what did not belong to him. But still desperate. You get
that way sometimes when, every day, you stare at a poster in your
office of Bird diving out of bounds after a loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   Lavoie is box-office manager at the Worcester Centrum. He has to
be there tonight when Janet Jackson comes to town. He would rather
be in Springfield, honoring the player he began following at
Indiana State in the late 1970s. Since then, he has met Bird and
built his own Bird Hall of Fame in his basement. There are
lithographs, Wheaties boxes, Sports Illustrated covers (signed by
Bird), books, a ``33'' license plate (from Aruba), an authentic
game jersey that someone gave him as a gift, and several game
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is more popular now for the simple reason that the
NBA has gone down in quality,'' Lavoie said of Bird. ``You don't
have players now who played like Larry, Magic, and Michael. You'll
probably think I'm crazy for saying this, but the only guy who
plays as hard _ diving after loose balls and concentrating on
rebounds _ is (Dennis) Rodman.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you don't have players who lived like Bird, either. He
despised the NBA's humming PR machine. He was notorious for
hovering over his cash, as if it were a rare harvest he never would
see again. He spoke simply and dressed simply. His Indiana twang
never merged with the silent ``r'' of Boston and his ``a'' never
sounded like an ``ah.'' He was just Larry Bird. Could there be a
more fitting tribute to him than the bronzed sneakers near Faneuil
Hall? Lavoie hasn't seen the immortalized shoes yet but, ``I'll go
there on one of my off days.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll go and hear the stories of how Bird, Quinn Buckner, and a
friend scuffled all the way out to State Street one May night in
1985. If he listens closely, he may hear the whispers of the
ever-present Bird, who told a Worcester paper shortly after the
incident:
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care about my image as far as grown-ups are
concerned. Most grown-ups are a pain anyway. But in my heart, I
feel bad about the kids. I regret all of this because kids should
be able to look up to athletes, and my mom took it pretty tough.
She said, `You know better than that. You shouldn't have been in a
place like that.' That bothered me a lot. I'm real sorry about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one good thing about all this is that maybe people finally
will understand that I'm human. I make mistakes; I've made a lot of
mistakes. I like to drink beer and go out and have a good time _
I'm human.''
</P>
<P>
   He is flawed. He makes mistakes. He is human. Yet, how can he be
in two and three places at once?
</P>
<P>
   Places like the one on a Cape Cod beachfront, amid trendy
restaurants and hotel chains. You make a few turns off Routes 6 and
28 and you see Larry there. He is watching over the home of Peter
Shankman, a 48-year-old Bird lover who refers to basketball as a
funk ballet. Shankman has a 40- by 30-foot basketball court set up
at his house. There have been times when people drove by his
Dennisport home and swore that they saw someone standing outside.
They did see someone. A huge mural of Bird.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the places in the middle of the city. Places
where beachfronts are miles away, where drivers clamor for parking
spaces and youngsters run to a Dorchester facility called The
Colonel Daniel Marr Boys and Girls Club. You walk inside, go to the
second floor and see the usual basketball sights. But in a far
corner, there is Bird again. An artist named Mike Lalone has drawn
an early Bird, moustachioed, dropping back to shoot among the
cosmos. There are wings and space. It is as if Bird were meeting
someone like Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Bird stepping back to
shoot over stellar constellations and the moons of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Back on Earth, 24-year-old Byron Goss and 18-year-old John
Martins, from Roxbury and Dorchester, tell of how they have played
under Lalone's drawing of Bird for years. ``Back in the day, I
think he influenced a lot of playground players because everybody
wanted to shoot 3-pointers,'' Goss said.
</P>
<P>
   And, really, who could shoot 3s and simultaneously talk trash
like Bird?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be more like (Michael) Jordan when I was a kid,''
Martins said. ``But I'll always remember Bird for making the clutch
shot. He always made the clutch shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least it seemed that way. There were many nights when Bird
shot 4 of 15 or 6 of 20. But he was everywhere on the court. For a
rebound, steal, or block. Something. And when he stopped doing it
on the court, he was there off it. Like he is now. In Dennisport
and Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I used to drive 80 miles to see him because I felt like
I might see something that's never been done before,'' Shankman
said. ``Think how lucky I am. I am old enough to remember seeing
(Bill) Russell, (John) Havlicek, (Satch) Sanders and all the great
Celtic teams. And I got to experience Larry Bird. It was such an
orgasm for me to watch him play. Just think: The alternative is
that I could have grown up in Sacramento or Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Shankman is not in California or Missouri. He is in New England,
where there are stories and footprints and likenesses of Bird
everywhere. It has been that way for years. There will be
additional words and a higher focus on Bird today. But this has
been his area since he first arrived. It still is. We will start
believing that life indeed goes on when Bird is no longer a
regional king.

SOME DOUBT SHORTAGE OF HIGH-TECH WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By REBECCA ROLWING  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - With almost two decades of experience as a computer
programmer, Robert Sanchez still can't find a permanent job.
</P>
<P>
   He's sent out dozens of resumes and most go unnoticed. To make
ends meet he does contract work, bouncing from one job to the next.
Sanchez scoffs at any suggestion of a shortage of technology
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Guidi, corporate director for information technology
support for an East Coast Fortune 1,000 company, began job hunting
in Phoenix and other markets in May. His result in Phoenix: not one
interview.
</P>
<P>
   One executive recruiting firm told Guidi it wasn't certain if it
received his resume, but knew it had no openings for him.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies from software firms to semiconductor giants
have complained for years about a shortage of qualified workers to
fill specialized jobs. When candidates can't be found locally, some
companies look overseas for workers to fill the gap. Frequently the
workers are foreigners studying at colleges in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States issues 65,000 foreign temporary visas a year.
This year, that cap was reached in May as companies snapped up
foreign computer programmers, engineers and other specialists
eagerly sought by high-tech employers.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-month debate, the House of Representatives recently
approved legislation that would set aside 142,500 visas over the
next three years for the foreign workers. The Senate was expected
to take it up Thursday. (NOTE: Oct. 3)
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp., Motorola Inc., and other industry giants with major
Phoenix operations say the change is imperative to find the workers
needed to keep projects in the United States. Other companies, such
as JDA Software and AG Communication Systems would also benefit
from a change that increases the hiring pool.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some remain skeptical of those claims, including Norman
Matloff, of the department of computer science at the University of
California-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that there is no high-tech employment shortage and
America is shortchanging itself by embracing more foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only `shortage' is one of cheap labor, especially in the
form of foreign nationals, who make on average 15 to 30 percent
less than comparable natives,'' said Matloff, who testified before
a House committee.
</P>
<P>
   Matloff's view hit home for Sanchez, 43, while at a Phoenix area
job fair. A form asking for minority-status information included a
category for those ``over 30.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an old foggie,'' Sanchez recalled. ``If there's really a
big shortage of engineers why won't they hire anyone over 30?''
</P>
<P>
   Older people may need to go back to school to upgrade to the
latest skills, said Ed Denison, executive director of the Arizona
Software Association.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage is no mirage, it's the leading problem among
software firms, Denison said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting more foreign workers won't be a panacea but will
alleviate some of the struggle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we can get some (additional workers) we're a lot better
off than if we can't,'' he added
</P>
<P>
   Businesses agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times where we just need to go outside the U.S. to
find the technical skills and resources to meet our technically
advanced products,'' said Maureen Tuskai, spokeswoman for
Phoenix-based JDA Software, which employs 1,000 people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   JDA has more than 50 people on work visas, roughly 5 percent of
its workforce. The company makes every effort to recruit locally,
Tuskai said.
</P>
<P>
   Shankar Kalyanam, a technical services manager at JDA on a visa
from India, challenges the stereotypes surrounding foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   Kalyanam, a computer programmer specializing in Oracle
databases, says he earns within the industry average of $50,000 to
$80,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   And what about those long hours?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I see my (American) boss in before me and leaving
after me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kalyanam, 27, who came to Phoenix in 1993 to work for an
India-based company, expects he will remain until next year and
then plans to work for one of JDA's 22 overseas offices.
</P>
<P>
   The big semiconductor giants pushing for the visa measure
strongly contend the work shortage is real.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13,000 people Intel hired last year, about 350 needed
HB-1 visas, which are available only to those with at least a
bachelor's degree and are getting a job that requires that degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are qualified people out there, at any age, we would
be glad to hire them because it's more expensive to hire foreign
nationals,'' said Coeta Chambers, a human relations attorney for
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   It costs up to $12,000 to sponsor a person for a visa and to
help them get the necessary credentials, she said.
</P>
<P>
   AG Communication has sharply curtailed its overseas recruiting.
Instead, the company farms out some of its work to a 100-person
team in India, a trend that's gaining popularity among many
high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   India has vast pool of skilled workers, most of whom speak
English.
</P>
<P>
   It provides a nice alternative to filling out the mountains of
paperwork required to bring in a foreign worker.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the telecommunications company with 1,200 Valley workers,
has certain government projects that can't be worked on by certain
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really been a need and we've not been able to fill it
so we've looked at other ways,'' said Charlie Schultz, vice
president and chief technical officer for AG Communication. &QL;

 &HT;    NationsBank name change coming in '99
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia customers can expect to see the NationsBank
name well into next year, even though that old name is living on
borrowed time.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, NationsBank, the holding company, became
BankAmerica as the $43.1 billion merger announced in April was
completed. The new operating name is Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Thursday, company Chairman Hugh L. McColl
Jr. said the transition to the new corporate name will continue
into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short run, the important message to our customers is
that nothing will change _ their accounts, checks, their credit
cards,'' said James Lientz, president of BankAmerica's Mid-South
unit in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will still have customers using predecessor checks all over
the country,'' Lientz added. ``If you have a big supply of
NationsBank's checks, you can continue to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   The changeover will begin in the East. North and South Carolina
will be first, and the Eastern transition will conclude with
Florida, McColl said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia will ``come between the Carolinas and Florida, sometime
in 1999,'' Lientz said. ``As soon as we have a time line, we'll be
more specific. There'll be a lot of happy sign companies.''
</P>
<P>
   As a first fruit of the marriage, NationsBank and BankAmerica
customers can now use 14,000 combined ATM machines around the
country_ without fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if this merger allowed the bank to lower fees
for all its customers. But based on history, that's not going to
happen,'' said Robert Pregulman of the U. S. Public Interest
Research Group's Atlanta office.
</P>
<P>
   McColl was exuberant at the news conference. But when a San
Franciso-based reporter expressed doubt about McColl's promised
commitment to that city, McColl responded, ``As Southerners we take
that question as an insult. When we give our word , we keep it.''
He refused to discuss the issue further.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the new Bank of America foundation will announce
community programs, and thousands of bank employees will turn out
into communities Saturday in a volunteer campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lientz said the $350 billion designated for community
development has not been allocated yet by city, but that he
assumed, ``owing to its importance, that Atlanta would receive a
disproportionate amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America has 8,700 employees in Atlanta and 10,100 in
Georgia, up from 6,200 and 7,000, respectively, when it became
NationsBank in 1992. That's a 45 percent increase in Atlanta.
Lientz expects that trend to continue ``because it's a great market
for us and a great place to do things.''
</P>
<P>
   He expanded on his remarks earlier this week about Atlanta's
importance, pointing out three Atlantans will be on the new board
of directors, and major lines of business will remain headquartered
here.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his duties as head of BankAmerica's
small-business effort, Lientz cited the technology and operations
side, headed by James D. Dixon, and the real estate lending area
run by Michael Buchanan. William Middlemass is responsible for
credit policy and asset policy in consumer and commercial banking.
</P>
<P>
   McColl reiterated that Bank of America will take a ``special
charge of $1.3 billion, it could be higher, in the third or fourth
quarter.'' That includes severance pay and reserves for signage.
</P>
<P>
   He said NationsBank had no hedge fund exposure but that the old
BankAmerica has a $1.1 billion line of credit to hedge funds, of
which $300 million was loaned out. The bank also has an investment
in the D. E. Shaw hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   That did not strike analysts as significant. The new
Charlotte-headquartered banking giant, the country's largest, has
assets of $572 billion, and in its 22 states reaches one-third of
U.S. households, representing 8 percent of U.S. bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
   On its first day of trading, the new BankAmerica stock closed at
$53.68 3/4 per share, up 18 3/4 cents.

 &HT;    Cox signs off on Vegas cable deal
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Communications has closed a $1.33 billion deal to
buy a controlling stake in the cable TV system that serves all of
metro Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the country's 10 largest single systems with
319,000 residential customers. It's also one of the fastest
growing.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Las Vegas makes Cox Communications the fifth
largest cable TV concern, with 3.8 million subscribers. The
Atlanta-based company, controlled by Cox Enterprises Inc., had been
sixth. Cox Enterprises also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is complex, involving cash, stock and the assumption of
debt. Cox Communications is buying an 80 percent stake in Prime
South Diversified, a cable and telecommunications concern that had
been owned by Prime Cable of Austin, Texas, and the Greenspun
family in Las Vegas. The family also owns the Las Vegas Sun, a
daily afternoon newspaper. The newspaper is not part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Prime South will become Cox Las Vegas and be folded into the
parent company. The Greenspun family will retain a 20 percent stake
consisting of $134 million in preferred stock. They also will
receive $59 million in cash. And the Greenspuns are also expected
to remain active in Cox Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of the Las Vegas system makes Cox Communications
the largest single cable operator in the Southwest. It serves 1.8
million subscribers across the region, including such markets as
San Diego, Orange County, Calif., and Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz.

 &HT;    October gloom settles in; Wall Street drops 210
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took only one day of trading for October to live up to its
reputation as a frightful month on Wall Street, as major indexes
plunged. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 4.81 percent, the Dow Jones
industrial average 2.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors continued to show disappointment with
the size of the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate cut _
only a quarter percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   But the market was also worried U.S. banks are vulnerable to
global loan losses stemming from currency and other economic
troubles in Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are concerned about a credit squeeze, especially
among banks exposed to foreign markets,'' said Herb Williamson,
vice president of the Enterprise Group, an Atlanta-based mutual
fund organization.
</P>
<P>
   He said the recent Fed-induced bailout of the Long-Term Capital
Management hedge fund added to investor worries about potential
Asian defaults on U.S. bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our banking system is one of the soundest in the world, but we
will have to work our way through the credit squeeze,'' added
Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan didn't help the market much with his
testimony before the House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He said failure of Long-Term Capital Management ``could have
potentially impaired the economies of many nations, including our
own.'' He also said the bailout should be a rare event.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, bank stocks led the market to one of the worst
one-day losses ever on Thursday, with the Dow recording its second
stright loss of more than 200 points.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bonds, meanwhile, continued to reap the benefit of Wall
Street panic as investors abandon stocks to put their money in
safer but lower-yielding fixed-income securities.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury yield dropped below 5 percent for the first
time on Wednesday and fell again Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the market's direction this quarter will be
determined in large part by third-quarter corporate profit reports,
which companies will release during the next three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts anticipate the profits of Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
companies will show a year-over-year decline _ the first since
1991, when the economy was emerging from a recession.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's cut in the federal funds interest rate on Tuesday was
designed to prevent a recession in 1999, according to analysts who
think additional rate cuts will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside risk is not over unless the Fed steps in and
moves rates lower again,'' Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst Paul Cherney
said in an S&AMP;P Web report.
</P>
<P>
   As for October, it is the month notorious for stock market
crashes, including the Great Crash in 1929 and the market's biggest
crash, in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Others also note the month has recorded some big gains over the
years.

 &HT;    Lucent Technologies to let go 425 at Georgia plant
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lucent Technologies said it will cut up to 425 jobs at
its sprawling plant along Interstate 85 in Norcross, even as it
continues to expand production of fiber optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which currently employs about 3,000 people in
Norcross, will eliminate as many as 175 management jobs and 250
manufacturing jobs held by Communication Workers of America Local
3263 members. Many of the workers will leave by the end of the
year, but the cuts aren't expected to be completed until late
March, Lucent spokesman Roger Frizzell said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Workers will be offered a package of incentives to voluntarily
leave the company or take early retirement. They can also apply for
other Lucent positions in metro Atlanta and elsewhere in the
nation, Frizzell said. ``Our hopes are that we have very few
people, if any, leave our business involuntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent said it wants to make its operations more efficient and
base many of its sales and management people in offices throughout
the world that are closer to customers. The production jobs, which
involve the assembly of cable connecting equpment rather than the
manufacturing of cable, will be shifted to a Lucent plant in Omaha,
Neb., and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The company said some of the work may also end up at a Fi-Tel
plant in Carrollton, according to Leon Gusek, president of CWA
Local 3262. While the plant is part of a Lucent joint venture,
workers there are neither Lucent employees nor union members. Gusek
predicted that Norcross workers won't be offered jobs at the
Carrollton plant because of their union background. ``That work
should stay here,'' said Gusek.
</P>
<P>
   Gusek said Lucent officials told the union that labor costs were
too high to make those products profitably at the Norcross plant.
Manufacturing workers at the Norcross Lucent plant make about
$16.29 an hour, according to Gusek.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Tucker, the president of the Gwinnett Chamber of
Commerce, said there are still many jobs available for skilled
workers in Gwinnett. ``There are between 500 and 700 high-tech and
high-tech related companies in the county,'' Tucker said. ``I
expect there won't be much problem for qualified workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Norcross plant's main business focus _ making fiber optic
cable _ is unaffected by the job cuts. Lucent continues to run
three shifts a day to make the cable, and it is continuing with a
$350 million expansion of the plant's production capacity. That
work now is expected to add at least 50 manufacturing jobs at the
plant, Lucent's Frizzell said. Officials expect to complete the
expansion within two years, though further expansions are possible,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   To convince Lucent to make the expansion in Georgia the state
agreed to kick in $5 million for a special lab that will help
improve the technology. The state has said Lucent is also eligible
for tax credits for new jobs it creates.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's stock closed at $66.12 1/2, down $3.12 1/2 Thursday.
Edward Jones analyst David Powers tied the drop to investors'
negative view of the overall telecommunications industry. He said
he hadn't heard of the job cuts in metro Atlanta.

ISRAEL ACKNOWLEDGES PLANE CARRIED CHEMICAL USED IN MANUFACTURE OF
NERVE GAS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ An El Al cargo plane that crashed in Amsterdam six
years ago was carrying a chemical that can be used in the
manufacture of the deadly nerve gas Sarin, a spokesman for the
Israeli national airline acknowledged on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that
the chemical was not toxic and had been ordered by Israel to test
gas masks and other filters designed to protect against chemical
agents. The Israeli Defense Ministry said that the plane carried no
``dangerous goods'' for the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The El Al spokesman, Nachman Klieman, confirmed a report in a
Dutch newspaper that the plane had carried the chemical, but he
declined to say anything about its possible use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comment on what its ultimate purpose was,'' Klieman
said. ``We fly sugar, which can be used for cake, but that doesn't
mean we're flying a cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has never acknowledged production of chemical or
biological weapons, just as Israeli officials have been
deliberately ambiguous about the country's reported nuclear
capability.
</P>
<P>
   An El Al Boeing 747-200F crashed into an apartment complex in
Amsterdam on Oct. 4, 1992, killing 43 people. Since then, scores of
people living in the area have complained of unidentified health
problems, including respiratory and skin ailments. An investigation
determined the mechanical cause of the crash, but a full list of
the plane's cargo was not made public by the Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
   After several investigations and persistent speculation in the
Netherlands about the nature of the freight, the Dutch Parliament
announced last week that it would begin an inquiry into the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad reported on Wednesday that
the plane was carrying about 50 gallons of dimethyl
methylphosphonate, which the paper said was enough to produce 594
pounds of sarin. The chemical is also used as a flame retardant in
building materials.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper printed a copy of what it said was a freight
document showing that the material came from Solkatronic Chemicals
Inc. in Morrisville, Pa., and was sent to the Institute for
Biological Research in the Israeli town of Ness Ziona, south of Tel
Aviv. The institute's work is a closely guarded secret in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch paper said that three of the four main components
needed for the production of sarin were on the El Al plane, and
that it was unclear whether the burning of the chemicals had
contributed to health problems experienced by people living in the
area of the crash. Neither the spokesman for El Al or for Netanyahu
mentioned the presence of other chemicals on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for Netanyahu, Aviv Bushinsky, said that the
Institute for Biological Research had ordered about 50 gallons of
dimethyl methylphosphonate ``for testing of filters, including
protective filters'' with the approval of the U.S. Department of
Commerce. After the shipment was lost in the crash, another was
delivered, Bushinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be emphasized that the material is not poisonous and
is used in various industrial applications,'' Bushinsky added.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Weinreich, spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry, said
in a written statement that all documents listing cargo sent to the
ministry had been submitted to the Dutch authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freight consigned to the Ministry of Defense on board
flight LY1862 did not contain dangerous goods, therefore no grounds
for concern exist,'' Weinreich said. ``It should be noted that this
statement pertains only to cargo consigned to the Ministry of
Defense.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement by El Al said that the chemical mentioned in the
Dutch report had been approved for air transport by the
International Air Transport Association, the International Civil
Aviation Association and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Al has never hidden any facts or details regarding cargo
flown on the flight in question, and has always provided full
cooperation with the appropriate Dutch authorities,'' El Al said.
</P>
<P>
   Klieman said that El Al routinely carried a variety of
substances whose transport is permitted by international aviation
agencies. At the time of the crash, he said, it was disclosed that
the El Al plane carried military spare parts and perfume, but
reporters' queries about other items were referred to the Dutch
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch Foreign Ministry said it knew of chemicals on the
plane, Agence France-Presse reported, saying the document cited by
the newspaper was included in a report to the Dutch Parliament in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Israel signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in January 1993,
but it has not been ratified by the Israeli Cabinet. Ratification
would give the signature practical effect, requiring Israel to
declare chemical weapons it may have held in the past, to destroy
any weapons it might currently hold, and to allow inspection of
suspected weapons production sites.
</P>
<P>
   The convention was recently ratified by Iran, but it has not
been signed by Syria, Egypt, Iraq and Libya, on the ground that
Israel should first sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

HMOS TO DROP THOUSANDS OF MEDICARE PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Colo., Fla., Texas, Ill., N.Y., N.J., Conn.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Health-maintenance organizations, once thought to
be the hope for the future of Medicare, said Thursday that they
would drop tens of thousands of beneficiaries next year, in part
because the Clinton administration had refused to let them raise
premiums or cut prescription-drug coverage for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the industry said that health plans were
withdrawing from 300 counties in 15 states because medical costs
were higher than expected, while Medicare payments were lower than
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the Department of Health and Human Services
rejected a last-minute lobbying blitz by HMOs, which had asked for
permission to increase premiums, raise copayments or limit certain
costly benefits like prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Friday is the deadline for HMOs to say whether they will
participate in Medicare. Karen Ignagni, president of the American
Association of Health Plans, a trade association for the industry,
said that ``175,000 to 200,000 beneficiaries are being dropped'' as
a result of decisions already made. ``And in the next two days,''
she said, ``we expect a number of announcements that will push the
total over 250,000 and potentially to 300,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Such cutbacks would affect one in 20 Medicare beneficiaries now
enrolled in HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers dropped from HMOs have two basic options. They can go
into the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program, with or
without supplementary insurance to cover extra items. Or they can
enroll in another HMO if one is available where they live.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the elderly said the turmoil and uncertainty in
this market could deter people from joining HMOs in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Matheis, a lobbyist for the American Association of
Retired Persons, said: ``HMOs have left the Medicare market in the
past, but far fewer people were affected. The knowledge that HMOs
can and do leave the program may make people a little wary about
going into these plans in the future. Beneficiaries do not want to
be changing health plans every year. They like stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ms. Matheis said: ``Many of these beneficiaries will
have higher out-of-pocket medical costs if they have to buy
supplementary insurance, and they may not have coverage of
prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The association, using government data, said Medicare
beneficiaries paid an average of $104 a month last year for the
supplementary insurance, known as Medigap policies. Medigap plans
covering drugs often cost much more.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Rights Center,
a consumer group in New York City, said, ``Beneficiaries leaving
HMOs may be unable to get insurance to fill gaps in the traditional
Medicare program because of their health, their age, the cost or
other factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare finances health care for 39 million people who are
elderly or disabled. About 5.9 million of them are in HMOs, and the
number has been rising rapidly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Ms. Ignagni said that Aetna, Prudential, Allina, Anthem,
Pacificare, Humana, Intermountain Health Care and other HMOs were
scaling back their Medicare operations.
</P>
<P>
   Allina, for example, said that it was ending HMO coverage for
10,000 of the 35,000 people in its Medicare health plans in
Minnesota. ``Reimbursement rates don't cover our costs,'' said
Sarah Stoesz, a spokeswoman for Allina.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, United Healthcare Corp., based in Minnetonka,
Minn., said Thursday that it was withdrawing from 86 of the 206
counties where it has Medicare health plans, in Colorado, Florida,
Texas, Illinois, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, among other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``That affects 13 percent of our total Medicare membership _
59,000 of the company's 440,000 Medicare beneficiaries,'' said Sue
Busch, a spokeswoman for United, which has participated in Medicare
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs submitted their bids for Medicare business on May 1. The
government issued new regulations for the program on June 26. In
the last two weeks, HMOs said they should be allowed to revise
their proposals to account for renewed medical inflation and for
the cost of complying with the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Thursday, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of
the Medicare agency, told Ms. Ignagni, ``We do not believe that
your proposal to allow plans to increase their premiums and
cost-sharing and reduce benefits would be in the best interests of
our Medicare beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's actions come after a yearlong battle in which HMOs
have resisted President Clinton's proposals for new laws to define
patients' rights and administration officials have repeatedly
denounced HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs withdrawing from Medicare must notify beneficiaries in
writing by Nov. 2. Some patients will need to find other doctors.

 &HT;    Cope on pole; Gordon slips

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Did Halloween come early to Charlotte Motor
Speedway Wednesday night?
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain that Derrike Cope won his first career pole,
for Sunday's UAW-GM Quality 500, after failing to qualify in four
other events? That Jeff Gordon didn't make the top 25? That Mark
Martin was bumped from the pole by Cope?
</P>
<P>
   Cope, the 41st driver on the 1.5-mile track, surprised all with
his pole-winning speed of 181.690 mph, just a tick faster than his
inside front row partner Martin's 181.220 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of adversity, a year of uncharted territory
that has limited us,'' said Cope, referring to the beating he took
in accidents at both Atlanta and Texas. ``To win the pole is
self-gratifying for me toward my crew. I knew we had a shot at it,
and I wanted it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cope broke his ribs, sternum and shoulder in Atlanta, then
aggravated the condition in Texas, where he hit a slick spot on the
track and crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's poor lap was one he expected, but not to the extent of
not qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew when we tested here we weren't going to be good in
qualilfying,'' Gordon said. ``I'm not real concerned because I know
we've got a good race car. We misjudged a little bit, and I got a
little bit looser than I was expecting to get for qualifying. I'm
disappointed we didn't go faster, but I'm thankful to get this out
of the way so we can get ready to race.''
</P>
<P>
   For Martin, Gordon's slip was no more than a blip on the screen,
even though the crowd stood and roared when his speed was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real good lap for us,'' Martin said of his second-place
lap. ``This is a moody old girl here, this track, especially when
it comes to sun and cloud cover and nighttime and everything else.
I expect Jeff got into a little bit of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Buckshot Racing team announced Wednesday that
two-time Busch Series champion Larry Pearson will drive the No. 00
Pontiac and with a new sponsor, Cheez-It Snack Cracker, for the
1999 Busch season. Kenneth Campbell, formerly with the Timber Wolf
team, will oversee the program from their headquarters in
Spartanburg. Buckshot Jones will move to the Winston Cup circuit in
'99, with headquarters in a new shop in Spartanburg. Ricky Pearson
will be crew chief of the Winston Cup team. ...Todd Bodine returns
to the Busch circuit in '99 with Team 34, reuniting with the Frank
Ciccio/Scott Welliver team where he enjoyed much success in the
early 1990s.

AS HE BIDS PRESS CORPS FAREWELL, McCURRY DEFENDS CLINTON  
 (bl) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mike McCurry drew warm applause and on-the-record
compliments from the White House press corps Thursday even as he
departed as President Clinton's spokesman with a final defense of
the long mendacious months of presidential denials in the Lewinsky
sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I was determined, when that story broke back in
January, was to never come here and do what some of my
predecessors, unfortunately, did, which was to lie to you and
mislead you,'' McCurry said in a parting defense of his signature
strategem of deliberately not asking the president about the
biggest story of the year, the one that has put Clinton at risk of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes not knowing the answer _ even though that puts you
in a tough position, too _ is better than consciously misleading
people,'' Curry said as he headed off to the lecture circuit after
three-and-half years of speaking for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   To the end, reporters questioned the wisdom of McCurry in his
never-ask policy on the Lewinsky affair even as many in his
skeptical audience offered some departing applause, as if for an
actor who has carried off some searing Ibsenesque role in a drama
of dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave with your honor intact,'' allowed one critic in an
aisle seat, Sam Donaldson of ABC News. But Bill Plante of CBS News
did not let McCurry go that easily, asking why he felt he could
ever ``afford to remain ignorant'' of something concerning the
president and, even more, ``Who does a press secretary work for?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   True to form, McCurry fielded the questions with a gentle ease,
contending that to have behaved otherwise and pressed the president
for details about the Lewinsky allegations would have made Clinton
a ``sitting duck'' for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr by
breaching Clinton's attorney-client privilege by way of the press
office. ``I segmented out'' Monica Lewinsky questions from
``millions of pieces of information that I stuffed in this pathetic
brain of mine every day,'' he said, adding he has no regrets for
this.
</P>
<P>
   The press secretary works for the taxpayers, the president and
the press, McCurry said, describing his role as operating
``equidistant between two combatants,'' the media and the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I know that at times I came up short,'' McCurry
said, apologizing for not always offering the right information.
``Frankly, the president misled me too, so I came here and misled
you on occasion. And that was grievously wrong of him, but he's
acknowledged that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, allowing himself a rhetorical question, he asked a
jam-packed press room, ``Did I ever knowingly come here and send
you folks in the wrong direction? I did not. I'm confident of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wry and smooth to the last word, the spokesman, who once
described his job as ``telling the truth slowly,'' was asked
whether he had learned a lot about how the White House works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, quite a bit, but I'm going to go out and make people pay
to hear it,'' he said, relishing the five-figure speaking fees he
has lined up as his bridge to the 21st century. Even as they
laughed, some reporters privately judged McCurry too clever by half
for presenting his dedicated ignorance of the affair as a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old press secretary, who has spent half his life
honing his skills in government and political press relations,
showed his strengths in his final performance. He minimized his
answers on the ``white noise'' of the impeachment struggle up on
Capitol Hill, while indulging at length questions about Kosovo and
the Serbs, brandishing a command of detail he mastered earlier as
the State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, to the final minutes the questions necessarily
continued about the president and the intern. One reporter noted
that, in February, McCurry admitted in an off-guard moment that
there would likely be no ``simple, innocent explanation'' for the
president's predicament. ``I don't think so,'' he conceded then,
``Because I think we would have offered that up already.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters took that as a slip of the Oz-like media curtain that
modern White Houses labor to work behind in their spin endeavors.
But the spokesman parried to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clairvoyance!'' said a grinning McCurry of those comments,
which preceded by six months Clinton's turnabout admission that he
had misled the nation about Ms. Lewinsky even as his staff, notably
McCurry, was daily proclaiming his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   As he paused in the TV lamplight, the spokesman mused that he
might write a book, but nothing nasty and tell-all, something
``about the changes we're going through as a culture, as we try to
communicate about public policy in the Information Age.''
</P>
<P>
   He drew mock groans and shouted advice (``Sex! You've got to
have sex in the book!'') from the assemblage of doubters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've done a good job, Mike, under the circumstances,'' said
Helen Thomas, the long-serving dean of the press corps, twice
stressing ``under the circumstances'' as she moreor less dismissed
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, Sweets,'' McCurry shot back. As laughter grew the
president's spokesman did not hesitate to add, as if in parody of
the White House's rough year: ``Helen and I always had a thing for
each other.''

METAL DETECTORS IN PLACE AT MAGIC MOUNTAIN, HURRICANE HARBOR THEME
PARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STACY BROWN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Metal detectors are being installed at the two
Six Flags theme parks, the first time the security devices will be
used at a Southern California amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   Every visitor to Magic Mountain and Hurricane Harbor in suburban
Valencia will be required to go through the airport-style
detectors, which spokesman Andy Gallardo said are simply another
tool to complement an already polished security force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to add to the safety of our guests,'' Gallardo
said. ``Six Flags probably has one of the more comprehensive
security programs in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallardo said the detectors could not have averted an incident
in April, when a 15-year-old youth from suburban Fontana was
fatally shot in the parking lot of the 260-acre amusement complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing we could do to prevent that shooting,'' he
said. ``It happened in the parking lot so, unfortunately, even with
the detectors that couldn't have been prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   Local sheriff's officials have been quick to praise security at
the Six Flags California site. Lt. Carl Deeley of the Santa Clarita
Valley sheriff's station said the park is one of the safest around.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do an excellent job,'' Deeley said after a May 30 melee
that park visitors said involved gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm in
neighboring Orange County and Universal Studios in suburban
Universal City said metal detectors are not in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have them, and I can't say whether or not they are
being considered,'' said Disneyland spokeswoman Marge Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Gallardo said installation should be completed by January and
that the devices should only add to an already impressive security
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will always look to make our program better,'' he said,
``although we feel our security is very thorough already. We are
very happy with our program.''

 &HT;    Speed humps aren't only way to calm traffic
 &HT;    By Joey Ledford
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, efforts to slow traffic in residential areas
have almost exclusively involved the controversial speed hump.
</P>
<P>
   But during a two-day conference in Atlanta this week on
preventing childhood pedestrian injuries, the speed hump was only
rarely mentioned as a traffic engineering solution.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers have found that, in addition to better pedestrian
training for children and better supervision for the very young,
changes in roadway design can slow drivers and help prevent
pedestrian deaths and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Cities like Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Cambridge, Mass., have
become more pedestrian friendly by introducing ``traffic calming''
features in neighborhoods. Speed humps are the most extreme and
obtrusive, yet least expensive, example of a traffic calming, or
speed limiting device.
</P>
<P>
   Others include curb extensions, which shorten pedestrians' walk
across a street, and traffic circles, or roundabouts, used at
intersections to make traffic circle slowly instead of being
controlled by traffic signals.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrians are also protected by refuge islands, which give
crossing walkers a safe haven halfway across a street, and
chicanes, a routing device that makes traffic in effect zigzag and
slow in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious pedestrian aid, which is only now debuting in
some suburban Atlanta neighborhoods, and is still nonexistent in
many others, is the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need policies that say the sidewalk goes in as soon as the
street gets built,'' said Dan Burden, a Florida-based pedestrian
advocate and traffic engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic calming devices don't have to be expensive, said Peter
Lagerway, an administrator for a pedestrian and bicycle program in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, by piggybacking on, it's very little money,''
he said. When a street is torn up by utility construction, repaving
or even repainting, traffic calming treatments can be inserted at
little additional cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it's a matter of just moving paint,'' he said,
noting that bike lanes can be added and wide streets narrowed on
existing pavement, resulting in slower speeds through
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, he said, neighborhoods that want such changes are
given them in stages just to make sure it's what they really want.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we put in a new treatment, first we will paint it in,''
Lagerway said. ``Then we put cones in. Then we say, if you don't
like it, in a year we will take it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Very few neighborhoods decide to return to the old speed-driven
ways, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason motorists tend to speed in residential areas,
said several speakers, is that many roads in neighborhoods appear
to be built for speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedestrian needs have been largely forgotten,'' said Charles
Zeeger, associate director for roadway study at the University of
North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Putting crosswalks or crossing signals on multilane roads is
like ``trying to put a small bandage on a badly broken leg,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta, recently named as having the nation's
seventh-meanest streets by a pedestrian advocacy group, most
commonly uses pedestrian signals as its lone concession to walkers.
But a 1983 Federal Highway Administration study of 1,700 signalized
intersections showed they had no safety benefits compared to sites
without them.
</P>
<P>
   Without a will to change our neighborhoods, or at least start
building better ones, our children will remain captives in front of
the television, eating instead of playing outside and getting the
exercise they need, said Richard Killingsworth, a Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention specialist.
</P>
<P>
   One of every five children is overweight, he said, as is one of
every two adults.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason? ``Our communities continue to be developed in a
way where walking is nonexistent,'' he said.

SECURITY COUNCIL CONDEMNS ATROCITIES IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-MASSACRE, KOSOVO-U.S.) 
(sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council, prodded by Britain and
the United States, on Thursday condemned the recent atrocities
against civilians in Kosovo and demanded that those guilty be
caught and punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Council members expressed considerable alarm at reports that
fighting was continuing despite the demand for a cease-fire, and in
particular that thousands more civilians have been forced to leave
their homes because of the actions of government security forces,''
said Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative and this
month's council president, after Thursday's emergency meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The condemnation called for an immediate investigation by the
Yugoslav government, though government forces are among those
accused of taking part in the atrocities. In order to get unanimous
backing of all 15 council members, it did not take the formal shape
of a resolution or presidential statement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some hedged language over the role of the War Crimes
Tribunal and no explicit mention of force, the message was welcomed
by the American representative on the council, Peter Burleigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The council is sending a clear signal of its outrage that the
council shares with the secretary general with regard to these
latest atrocities in Kosovo,'' he said after the meeting on
Thursday evening. ``It's a very serious situation, a very grave
situation. The council is deeply concerned about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very clear, direct message to the government in
Belgrade that they have to be accountable and responsible for their
activities, the activities of their security forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a renewed condemnation of the Serbs by the
Security Council, the British and Americans want Secretary General
Kofi Annan to speed up a report on Yugoslavia's compliance with a
resolution passed on Sept. 23 that called for an end to attacks on
civilians. Annan's report had been expected to be turned over by
the middle of next week. It will now go to the council no later
than Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Annan warned of a human disaster in the making. ''I
utterly condemn the unwarranted killings and excesses by the Serb
security forces,'' he said, adding that violence on both sides must
stop and that the relief organizations must get access to the
refugees in need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appeal to all concerned to cease the violence and give us
humanitarian space and access to do our work,'' Annan said. He also
asked the Serbs to ``allow the negotiators to do their work and get
people back to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading NATO nations appear to want the moral authority of the
secretary general behind the decision to take action against
President Slobodan Milosevic. An American official said that his
report can be interpreted by those who want to interpret it that
way as a trigger for action or a validation of the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   The nations that have been working together as a contact group
on Yugoslavia _ Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the
United States _ are planning to meet at the ministerial level on
Friday in London.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke with several
European leaders on Thursday in advance of the meeting. American
officials believe that the recent atrocities in Kosovo have
galvanized into action some countries that were hesitant to talk
about using force and that some nations once more insistent on
another specific U.N. resolution authorizing an attack may be less
so now.
</P>
<P>
   France, whose foreign minister told reporters last week that a
decision on the use of force was still in the future, now believes
that last week's Security Council resolution constitutes sufficient
legal grounds for NATO to take military action against Milosevic's
forces, French officials said on Thursday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that they no longer believe that another
resolution would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has argued that NATO had the authority to
attack even before the resolution last Wednesday, which was adopted
under a chapter of the U.N. Charter that makes the resolution
militarily enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China continue to hold out against any kind of
military intervention in Kosovo. Last week China could not be
persuaded even to join in condemnation of attacks against
civilians. Thursday in Moscow, Russian officials repeated their
opposition to force. Within NATO, the Greeks are also reported to
be opposed. At the Security Council, Russia's representative,
Sergey Lavrov, declined to comment on Thursday's condemnation
except to say that it had been arrived at by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, in transition between governments, remains something of
a question mark. The outgoing chancellor, Helmut Kohl, may be
reluctant to authorize an action whose results would be left to his
successor, Gerhard Schroeder, to deal with. A Western diplomat here
said, however, that Schroeder might welcome a situation in which a
decision to take part in military action would be laid on his
predecessor's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, a NATO official said that ambassadors to the
organization from member countries would study the legal grounds
for action in Kosovo before any attacks took place.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the organization still had to complete
planning on what kind of peacekeeping force might have to be sent
to Kosovo if bombing or the threat of bombing causes Milosevic to
back away from more attacks on civilians and the situation requires
a neutral presence on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, NATO officials say, the organization has to take formal
control of forces, aircraft and other equipment pledged for bombing
operations and to collect an attack force at designated bases.

LAWYER OFFERS A GUILTY PLEA IN UNION CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan lawyer who represented Ron Carey in his
1996 re-election campaign for the teamsters' presidency pleaded
guilty Thursday to one count of conspiracy to make false statements
to a court-appointed election officer.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Nathaniel Charny of the labor law firm of Cohen,
Weiss &AMP; Simon, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
to lying about the legitimacy of several contributions to the Carey
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The election monitor, Barbara Zack Quindel, overturned Carey's
1996 victory over James P. Hoffa after concluding that more than
$700,000 in union money had been improperly funneled into the Carey
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Charny, 33, admitted he had lied to Ms. Quindel when he
testified that he had questioned several wealthy donors about the
propriety of their contributions to the campaign. He also
acknowledged concealing that two employers had sent his law firm
checks for the Carey campaign; employers are barred from
contributing money to candidates in union elections.
</P>
<P>
   Charny was in charge of vetting contributions to a special fund
set up to receive donations from wealthy people who did not belong
to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Charny, a Manhattan resident, faces a maximum penalty of five
years in prison and a fine of $250,000. He acknowledged in court
Thursday that he was cooperating with prosecutors in the office of
Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once threatened with demolition, gnawed by decades of
urban grime, obscured by ungainly advertising signs, corroded by
roof leaks and just plain unloved by the 500,000 people who sprint
through its cavernous halls each day on the way to somewhere else,
Grand Central Terminal celebrated its rebirth Thursday as a
lustrous train station that ranks as a destination in its own
right.
</P>
<P>
   In its restored grandeur, with sunlight pouring through
steel-ribbed skylights and twin marble staircases curling to a
platform on the east side of the Main Concourse, the 85-year-old
structure is once again so imposing that it dwarfed those who came
to praise it during a spirited rededication ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `grand' has truly been put back into the Grand Central
Terminal,'' declared E. Virgil Conway, chairman of the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, his voice so distorted by the echoing
marble walls that it was indistinguishable from those
simultaneously announcing track numbers for the next trains to
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Lavish praise also came from many of the hundreds of people who
came to the station to see _ and this time, to stop and take a good
look at _ what hundreds of technicians, craftsmen and designers had
wrought over the last two years from the sadly decaying edifice
that had gone without a major overhaul since its construction
before World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' said Teresa Delgado, an office worker at a nearby
Chase bank, as she gazed around at the cream-colored marble walls
and stairways, gleaming chandeliers and twinkling ceiling lights.
``I pass by it in a rush, normally, but this time I decided to take
a good look, and it's absolutely gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ceremony signified not only the official rededication
of the terminal but also the public opening of the set of marble
stairways on the east side of the Main Concourse and a restored
entrance at 42d Street and Vanderbilt Avenue, and the removal of a
low deck covering the east ramp to the Oyster Bar that since 1927
had blocked the view up to the skylights and down to the concourse.
</P>
<P>
   While the building itself was clearly the star of the event, the
MTA also enlisted some kinetic razzle-dazzle. High above the
assembled dignitaries, who included Gov. George Pataki, a trapeze
artist from the Big Apple Circus was hauled up 120 feet to the
vaulted ceiling, where, resplendent in a taxicab-yellow bodysuit,
he dangled and flipped on a lone swing. Turquoise lights danced
across the painted ceiling to the sounds of ``Rhapsody in Blue'' in
a laser light show.
</P>
<P>
   In a performance by the Westchester Philharmonic of an original
march commissioned for the event, six uniformed Metro-North
Commuter Railroad conductors solemnly accompanied the musicians on
whistles, bells and a box with a ratchet that simulates the sound
of train wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the train noises get going in the opening, it's like the
hustle and bustle of the station,'' said Bruce Saylor, the composer
of the march, titled ``Grand Central!''
</P>
<P>
   For railroad buffs, there were vintage railroad cars on view,
outfitted with all the trappings of luxury travel _ wood-paneled
dining cars, fluffy beds with raspberry-colored linens, padded
leather bars _ that largely disappeared from Grand Central as it
evolved from the ``gateway to the continent'' into a commuter train
and subway terminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could work in one of these instead of my subway
car,'' said Steve Fink, a New York City Transit driver on the No. 6
line, who stopped by on his way to work and found himself gazing
wistfully into an old New York Central train car that once served
as a home on the rails for Cornelius Vanderbilt, the shipping
magnate who purchased the 76-acre midtown site in 1864 to house his
expanding railroad empire.
</P>
<P>
   The building was a steam locomotive depot for 30 years, and when
Grand Central Terminal first opened in 1913, more than 150,000
people came to see the underground rail yards and expansive
separate passenger waiting rooms during the first 24 hours. In
1947, at the height of its glory, more than 65 million people took
trains that departed from, arrived at or transferred through Grand
Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   But the station's days of grandeur faded as more and more
Americans began to forsake rail travel in the 1950s. Its once
pristine interior halls were rented out for billboards, and by
1968, developers were talking about surrounding the terminal with
high-rise buildings and demolishing the Main Concourse.
</P>
<P>
   It was saved, after a 10-year court battle, with the help of
preservationists who enlisted the high-profile help of Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis, who will be honored with a plaque to be installed
in the Main Concourse. John F. Kennedy Jr. unveiled the plaque
Thursday. The Grand Central Terminal cleanup and renovation, which
has cost $197 million and was financed by MTA funds and its sale of
$84 million in bonds, has been revealed to the public layer by
layer since the project began in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, commuters were first treated to the sight of the
newly scrubbed and modernized sky ceiling, a blue-green swath of
color punctuated with lighted stars and the outlines of
constellations. It is meant to represent the night sky, seen from
above, and has been improved by switching to a fiber-optic lighting
system from hundreds of workaday light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   State officials were so proud of the cleanup job that they had
workers leave one lone spot on the ceiling just as it was _ nearly
black with the accumulated smoke and dirt from years of cigarette
smoke, poor housekeeping and neglect _ for contrast. During the
ceremony, a spotlight was turned on the blemish.

METAL DETECTORS IN PLACE AT MAGIC MOUNTAIN, HURRICANE HARBOR THEME
PARKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Metal detectors are being installed at the two
Six Flags theme parks, the first time the security devices will be
used at a Southern California amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   Every visitor to Magic Mountain and Hurricane Harbor in suburban
Valencia will be required to go through the airport-style
detectors, which spokesman Andy Gallardo said are simply another
tool to complement an already polished security force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to add to the safety of our guests,'' Gallardo
said. ``Six Flags probably has one of the more comprehensive
security programs in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallardo said the detectors could not have averted an incident
in April, when a 15-year-old youth from suburban Fontana was
fatally shot in the parking lot of the 260-acre amusement complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing we could do to prevent that shooting,'' he
said. ``It happened in the parking lot so, unfortunately, even with
the detectors that couldn't have been prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   Local sheriff's officials have been quick to praise security at
the Six Flags California site. Lt. Carl Deeley of the Santa Clarita
Valley sheriff's station said the park is one of the safest around.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do an excellent job,'' Deeley said after a May 30 melee
that park visitors said involved gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm in
neighboring Orange County and Universal Studios in suburban
Universal City said metal detectors are not in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have them, and I can't say whether or not they are
being considered,'' said Disneyland spokeswoman Marge Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Gallardo said installation should be completed by January and
that the devices should only add to an already impressive security
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will always look to make our program better,'' he said,
``although we feel our security is very thorough already. We are
very happy with our program.''

FED CHIEF DEFENDS U.S. ROLE IN SAVING GIANT HEDGE FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Ala., Minn., La., N.Y.)  (bl) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Parrying a rare wave of criticism, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan on Thursday defended the central bank's
role in averting the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management LP,
saying that it had acted out of concern for the stability of the
financial markets rather than a desire to assist the investment
firm's wealthy owners.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the House Banking Committee alongside William
McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
Greenspan built a case that it was the central bank's
responsibility to play a role in addressing a crisis whose effects
could extend far beyond the fate of Long-Term Capital's owners,
investors and lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial market participants were already unsettled by recent
global events,'' Greenspan said, referring to the spread into
Russia and Latin America of the financial crisis that began last
year in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the failure of LTCM triggered the seizing up of markets,
substantial damage could have been inflicted on many market
participants, including some not directly involved in the firm, and
could have potentially impaired the economies of many nations,
including our own,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is usually heaped with praise for his stewardship of
the economy when he appears before Congress. But Thursday, two days
after cutting interest rates by one-quarter point to help insulate
the United States from the global crisis, he heard respectful but
nonetheless pointed questions and doubts from members of both
parties about the Federal Reserve's involvement in saving a risky
investment fund that catered to some of the wealthiest people.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers expressed considerable reservations about the
Federal Reserve's decision to use its influence to buy some time
for Long-Term Capital last week by helping to arrange a $3.6
billion rescue package from a group of big banks and investment
houses. And they asked whether the Fed and other regulators should
do more to regulate hedge funds and their sophisticated financial
dealings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., said the message from Washington to
welfare mothers and small businesses had been ``that it's not the
job of the federal government to rescue you.''
</P>
<P>
   The same message, he said, ``ought to also apply to rich
Greenwich, Connecticut, investors who are multimillionaires, that
we ought to use the same standards that we've used on the welfare
mothers on these large hedge funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., said there seemed to be a gap between
free market theory and decisions made by policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear a lot of speeches about free enterprise and the
marketplace, but a lot of folks don't like to practice it,'' he
said. ``The problem we have as representing our constituencies is
that there seem to be two rules, a double standard: one for Main
Street and another one for Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the committee's chairman, questioned
whether the Fed's efforts to put together a rescue package raised
antitrust concerns. He also questioned whether it had undermined a
separate offer from a group including multibillionaire investor
Warren Buffett and Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of that offer were reportedly less attractive to
Long-Term Capital's owners, including its founder, John Meriwether,
than the deal later struck by the group assembled by the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the only smart deal of the month that Long-Term
Capital did was they played the Fed off against another party,''
Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   Other members seemed to be searching in frustration for ways to
contain the risks posed by a small number of investment firms
operating outside the regulatory system, that use vast amounts of
borrowed money to make sophisticated financial market bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we are going to be comforted that the regulators
do now, in fact, have plans in place that would help avert such
unfortunate circumstances in our future,'' said Rep. Richard Baker,
R-La.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, however, stuck to his position that it would be
difficult or even counterproductive to impose more direct
regulation on the sophisticated investment firms known as hedge
funds. Regulating hedge funds, Greenspan said, would drive them to
operate from other nations with looser regulatory structures,
undermining the ability of the United States to monitor them even
indirectly through their lenders and investors.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to rein in gambling by those firms, Greenspan said,
was to encourage their lenders to assess more rigorously the risks
they are taking, and deny credit to those whose bets become unwise.
In that way, he said, banking supervisors and other regulators can
act as a second line of defense by pushing lenders to make sure
their risk assessments are adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from members of the committee, Greenspan
admitted that same approach had failed in the case of Long-Term
Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   But he said such failures were inevitable in markets, that he
had been surprised at how few there had been in the last five years
and that he expected more of them in the future. Moreover, he said,
if the financial system is unwilling to assume risks, the economy's
ability to grow would be impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not presume that the ideal outcome is more regulation,''
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from members of the committee to explain why
Long-Term Capital's troubles justified help from the Fed in
arranging a rescue plan, Greenspan and McDonough said no taxpayer
money was used and that the case should not be seen as a precedent
for future intervention in the marketplace by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they said, although the Fed brought all the players
together, the deal that emerged stripped Long-Term Capital's owners
of all but 10 percent of their stakes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Greenspan said, the plan ``may well work to
reduce the ultimate losses to the original owners of LTCM, but that
was a byproduct, perhaps unfortunate, of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that the case raised questions about
what economists call moral hazard _ the idea that rescuing
investors from a bet gone bad encourages further overly risky bets.
</P>
<P>
   But wiping out investors through a forced liquidation of the
sort that Long-Term Capital faced would have made investors perhaps
too frightened to take risks, Greenspan said, hurting the economy's
ability to grow. As a result, he suggested, it is appropriate to
intervene in the markets to stem potential panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Risk taking is a necessary condition for wealth creation,'' he
said. ``The optimum degree of risk aversion should be governed by
rational judgments about the marketplace, not the fear flowing from
fire sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maurice Hinchey, D-N.Y., pressed Greenspan on his
opposition to further regulation of exotic securities called
derivatives, which are essentially bets on the direction of stocks,
bonds, currencies and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan replied that the ``degree of supervision and
regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite
adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system.'' He
supported language in a spending bill now before Congress that
would prevent the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from
proceeding with an effort to develop tighter regulations on
derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   But Brooksley Born, the chairwoman of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, later stepped up her warnings of the perils of
not requiring more disclosure from banks and investment firms of
their derivatives positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lack of basic information about the positions held by OTC
derivatives users and the nature and extent of their exposures
potentially allows OTC derivatives market participants to take
positions that may threaten our regulated markets or, indeed, our
economy with any federal agency knowing about it,'' Ms. Born told
the committee.

OBSTACLES ARE THE NORM AT VANDERBILT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Discovered lurking on the Mississippi State coaching staff a few
years back, noted crusader Watson Brown offered a perfectly
plausible explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got tired of getting my tail whipped,'' he said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Almost universally regarded as one of the bright young faces on
the coaching scene, Brown had nevertheless just completed a stretch
at two schools where his teams compiled a sparkling 14-63 record.
</P>
<P>
   The schools in question were Rice and Vanderbilt _ two
small-enrollment private universities that, in the quaint parlance
of the '90s, are referred to as ``academic'' institutions.
</P>
<P>
   It is a line delivered without irony, as if describing a member
of the community suspected of tree worship.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt, which will face TCU tomorrow in Amon Carter Stadium,
is on its third coach since Brown left in 1990. Thus far, the
ledger for the decade _ including an 0-3 start this year _ reads
26-65.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent, Woody Widenhofer, arrived in '95 as defensive
coordinator and became the head coach last year. While Brown was a
genuine Vandy hero who once quarterbacked a famous upset of
Alabama, Widenhofer gained acclaim and four Super Bowl championship
rings coaching Pittsburgh's famed ``Steel Curtain'' defense in the
seventies.
</P>
<P>
   They do share one trait, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it starts,'' Widenhofer says, ``you become obsessed with
turning this thing around.''
</P>
<P>
   It requires, among other things, an energetic approach to
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he says, ``when I was coaching at Missouri (his alma
mater), we obviously got some kids in school that we couldn't get
in here, because of our entrance requirements. But also, you could
take Prop 48s back then (in the Big Eight).
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't recruit junior-college players, because most of them
are in junior college because of their high school academic
standing. On each year's Top 100 recruiting list, there are a lot
of players we have to automatically cross off.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are a lot of good students out there who are also
good football players _ you just have to find them. The payback is
that the type of kids we get, it's really a joy to coach them and
get to know them. They are very intelligent, committed to getting a
quality education, and they are not the kind of guys that you get
calls from the police about at 2 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of Houston Memorial High School, Clay Condrey figured
he had two choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably could have gone to school somewhere in Texas, with
a bunch of my friends, and really had a lot of fun,'' he says.
``Both my parents went to the University of Texas, so it would have
been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or, I figured I could go somewhere and get an education that
would be important and useful to me for the rest of my life. I've
always wanted to be an engineer, and that's why I'm here. That's
why everybody is here _ for a chance to be something besides just a
football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a senior, Condrey (6-6, 270) has been a starting tackle for
two years. He took a recruiting visit to TCU, but recalls that
``they told me their engineering program was still a year away from
being accredited, so I came here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough school. I've cut my class load down to 12 hours
per semester so I can make my grades and continue to play football.
I'll be here an extra semester _ perhaps a year _ but in the end,
there will be an engineering degree. And that's what I came here
for.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Commodores' adventures on the field (3-8 last year),
Condrey says, ``We don't sit around worrying about who Tennessee is
recruiting _ we just love playing teams like that. But although
we've played them close (12-7, 14-7, 17-10) the three years I've
been here, we've lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win. In that respect, we're no different from the
players at any other school.''
</P>
<P>
   This is also a big point with Widenhofer. Although there are 37
players on the current squad with grade-point averages of 3.0 or
better, he is inclined to downplay the academic separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of excellent football players at all of the
big state schools,'' he says, ``who are also very good students.
They are the kind of students who could have gotten into
Vanderbilt, but they chose those other schools ... primarily
because of the football tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted a school where they could win a championship, go
to a bowl, play on TV. That's what we are fighting, really. We need
to get more of those kids to come here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do that, we win.''

U.S. DELIVERS WARNING; GIVES MILOSEVIC TWO WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States will have both the political
authorization from its NATO allies and the military forces in place
to use against Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic in two
weeks if he does not agree to remove his special police from the
province of Kosovo, to allow relief to more than 300,000 refugees
and to begin serious negotiations toward a political solution,
senior U.S. officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they have not delivered a formal ultimatum to
Milosevic, but have warned him that they are serious this time
about military action and will take it if he does not comply.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that they are under new congressional and public
pressure because of widely publicized atrocities blamed on Serb
forces, the officials said that they expect Milosevic to heed their
warnings and comply with these international demands before force
is used. But the only way he will do so, the officials said, is if
he thinks NATO's warnings, this time, are credible.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. officials like National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
insisted Thursday that these new warnings are credible. ``If
Milosevic does not comply, NATO must be prepared to act militarily,
and it will,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   America would not act alone, he said, but within NATO. ``And the
events and atrocities of the last week or so have quickened the
pace of our European allies.''
</P>
<P>
   But some U.S. officials acknowledged that these threats come
very late, after Milosevic has already accomplished most of his
aims _ beating back the insurgent Kosovo Liberation Army and
destroying the livelihoods of many of its civilian supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call this policy by embarrassment, or policy by
shame,'' said another senior administration official who requested
anonymity. ``But we are at last serious, and our European allies
are at last serious. This is not an empty exercise, and we do not
have our fingers crossed behind our backs. Our goal is a diplomatic
solution. But if there is no legitimate change on the ground, I am
confident that we and NATO will follow through on these threats.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the atmosphere of threat, the State Department
issued a travel advisory warning Americans not to travel to
Yugoslavia and asking those Americans already there to consider
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   And the administration's top national security officials,
Berger, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary
William Cohen and Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, went to Capitol Hill to provide senators
a confidential briefing about Kosovo and NATO military
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They laid out the stakes in Kosovo and the importance of being
prepared to use force and had a serious consultation with senators
about what decisions may follow in next few days,'' an official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Albright told reporters: ``The combined threat of the
use of force and diplomacy is the best way of proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The briefing was well-attended, senators said, and the officials
laid out a strategy that focuses on help for the refugees and
diplomatic action, but backed up by the use of military force if
Milosevic does not heed international demands.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said that the recent media coverage
of the latest killings of ethnic Albanians ``have pushed many of us
over the atrocity line.'' He said he told the officials: ``With all
due respect, it's time to shoot or shut up.'' He said he was
disappointed that the U.S. position still seemed insufficiently
aggressive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said he favored the use of air power
in Kosovo and would support a congressional resolution to that
effect.
</P>
<P>
   And Senate Democratic Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota said
that military action ``may be required'' to enforce diplomatic
efforts. ``I do believe that some of these people only seem to
understand diplomacy and its merit once they've seen the
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morton Abramowitz, a former senior State Department official
and an expert on the Kosovo problem, said he did not expect
military action. ``I'm not holding my breath,'' he said. ``I think
every opportunity is being given to Mr. Milosevic to pull back. We
are trying to get the ethnic Albanians and the Serbs to some sort
of agreement, but what that agreement is remains very unclear, and
I'm skeptical that all this is the way to any durable settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the decision to press ahead and ``cock the
trigger'' resulted from a Cabinet-level meeting of
national-security officials two weeks ago and a series of
conversations with key allied officials, in particular the British,
French and Germans. The result was a U.N. Security Council
Resolution that fell just short of specifically authorizing force.
The Germans and Italians remain more concerned about taking NATO
action without going back to the Security Council, officials say,
while the Russians oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   But given the new revulsion at Serb tactics stemming from the
recent massacre of some 19 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo _ producing
wrenching television film and photographs _ European countries are
now more willing to use force without going back to the United
Nations, U.S. officials insisted on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Recent atrocities have also prompted former Republican
presidential candidate Robert Dole to urge military action in
Kosovo, a call recently echoed by other key Republican senators
like John McCain of Arizona, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Smith
of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, NATO asked member nations to provide specific
military forces for an operation against Serbian or Yugoslav
targets. The next step, possibly as early as a week from now, would
be an activation order giving political authorization by NATO
members to the NATO commander to take military action at any time.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior U.S. official said that even this activation order
would have a waiting period built in to it, ``to allow Milosevic to
see the handwriting on the wall.'' Yugoslav claims that attacks on
ethnic Albanians had ended are ``blatantly untrue'' said State
Department spokesman James Rubin, while his Pentagon counterpart,
Kenneth Bacon, said that while Belgrade ``says they are withdrawing
back to the barracks, they are continuing to fight at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible military plan would involve an initial wave of air
strikes followed by a pause and a warning of crippling strikes to
follow, an U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What NATO has planned is a graduated series of possible air
strikes which could, at the high end, involve a very considerable
number of airplanes,'' Bacon said. ``The goal of the options is to
reduce or degrade the Serbian military's ability to continue
striking the Kosovar Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger and other officials emphasized the urgency of Milosevic's
compliance before winter sets in and starts freezing refugees to
death in the mountains. So far, the U.S. government has provided
over $47 million in financial and material support for refugee
support, including $26 million to non-government aid organizations,
who are no longer required to work through Serb authorities,
officials say.

HBO GETS TO THE HEART OF THE BOSNIAN TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for times.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The HBO movie ``Shot Through the Heart'' is the story of Vlado
and Slavko, and part of the prospective audience is adrift already.
</P>
<P>
   Vlado and Slavko were in Sarajevo. Journalist John Falk, whose
1995 article in Details magazine led to the movie, knows about the
average American's interest in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Americans,'' he said in a recent interview,
``is before you tell them who you're going to cheer for, they've
got to be able to find the place on the map. You know, if they
can't find Rhode Island, they're not going to be able to find
Bosnia, so adios to that.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO made ``Shot Through the Heart'' anyway. Pats on the back and
shiny medals to HBO. Not only did it make the movie, which
premieres Sunday, but it also approved a low-profile cast, because
these actors were right for the parts.
</P>
<P>
   However thick the politics and ethnic entanglements, the story
is stark and powerful. Also, true.
</P>
<P>
   Vlado Sarzinsky (Linus Roache, ``Wings of the Dove'') and Slavko
Simic (Vincent Perez, ``The Crow 2: City of Angels''), best friends
and colleagues on the Yugoslav national rifle shooting team, end up
on opposite sides when the Serbs lay siege to Sarajevo in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Simic joins the Serbian army and begins training snipers who'll
gun down men, women and children on the streets of Sarajevo.
Sarzinsky becomes an anti-sniper. Ultimately, in an incredibly
dramatic metaphor for the whole bloody mess, one will be in the
other's crosshairs.
</P>
<P>
   The story of best friends split by war is so pungent that at
times it threatens to overwhelm the bigger picture. But the
particular tragedy of Sarajevo does emerge. This was a proudly
cosmopolitan place, an Olympic city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Sarajevo, not Somalia,'' says a bewildered Vlado when
the roadblocks spring up around the Bosnian capital. ``We're
Europeans, for God's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Grim but determinedly humanistic, ``Shot Through the Heart'' is
directed by David Attwood (PBS' ``Moll Flanders'') and was filmed
mostly at former Russian army barracks in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   But the cemetery at the end, with the tombstones signifying
various ethnicities and foreshortened lives? Sadly, unmistakably
Sarajevo.

<P>
   _ ``Legalese'' (Sunday on the TNT cable channel) is a little
poison dart of a movie aimed at lawyers and tabloid journalists. It
turns out to be more of a local anesthetic than a poisonous comedy,
but it's a moderately entertaining watch.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Glenn Jordan, the film is about an actress (Gina
Gershon) accused of murder, whose famous defense attorney (James
Garner) disguises his involvement by using a novice attorney (Ed
Kerr) as his front man. Kathleen Turner contributes as a shrewd
tabloid TV reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is heavy company for TNT. But Mary-Louise Parker, as
the sexy, cynical Garner assistant who falls for Kerr, waltzes off
with the film. Miles to go before the next Emmys; someone make a
note.
</P>
<P>
   _ And _ this is important _ don't forget to call your cable
operator and demand The Learning Channel, because educational TV
turns you on.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, TLC (motto: ``Adventures for your mind'') asked us to
put our thinking caps on for ``Next to Nothing: A History of
Lingerie.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the curriculum features ``Secret World of
Supermodels,'' which promises to help you ``discover the naked
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't miss it. It's on immediately after ``Secret World of
Beauty Pageants.''
</P>
<P>
   A little knowledge really is a dangerous thing.

FORTUNES OF REDSKINS, TURNER REST IN THE HANDS OF INEXPERIENCED
QUARTERBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RICHARD TIJERINA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norv Turner is counting on a backup quarterback to lead his team
through the NFC East schedule. What else is new?
</P>
<P>
   Turner certainly has been here before. Only the names on the
backs of the jerseys have changed, from Babe Laufenberg to Steve
Beuerlein to now, where Trent Green has been handed the reins of
the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Cowboys-Redskins game will be decided by a pair of
backups _ Green and Jason Garrett _ who have just six NFL starts
and three victories between them.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Green _ who took over for the injured Gus Frerotte against
the Giants in the season opener and has been the starter ever since
_ is 0-3. Yes, he has thrown five interceptions in three games.
</P>
<P>
   No time to worry, though, Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that when you start with a backup, you can't
allow him to ``lose'' the game for you,'' Turner said. ``From
there, you go on. If he makes a number of plays to help you win,
that's a bonus. In the Giants game, Jason made the plays and was
able to win the game with no errors. That's what you look for.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be no surprise to see a Green making headlines in
Washington. But now, it's ``Trent'' _ not ``Darrell'' _ who is
making the waves.
</P>
<P>
   His inaugural tour as an NFL starting quarterback hasn't been
all bad for Green, who in his first four seasons had logged just
one play _ an incomplete pass last year against the Eagles _ before
Frerotte went down in Week 1 against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the second half, Green almost rallied the Redskins to an
upset victory against the defending NFC East champions. Through
four games, Green is 77-of-135 for 1,044 yards. He has six
touchdowns to go along with his five interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Only Tony Banks in St. Louis has thrown more interceptions in
the NFC than Green.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Green was 19-of-31 for 252 yards against Denver last
week and impressed Turner with his mobility in the pocket, evading
several sacks under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   It is a trait that might help him on Sunday against the Cowboys,
who might try to rattle the backup early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trent has given us an added dimension in that he's got
athletic ability,'' Turner said. ``He's completed a number of balls
to receivers coming free because of his ability to run around. He
has helped us in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Redskins winless, the only less popular man feeling
more heat than Turner these days in Washington is President
Clinton. With cries of ``Impeach Norv'' chasing him, Turner must
place his and the Redskins' fortunes in the hands of Green, who
took just one of the team's 1,028 offensive snaps last season.
</P>
<P>
   It will be backup vs. backup, substitute vs. substitute on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, in his first season as the Cowboys' No. 2 quarterback,
is 1-1 as a starter since Troy Aikman broke a collarbone against
the Broncos. He led the Cowboys to a big victory against the
Giants, but looked shaky at times last week against the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Garrett has won a game, which is more than can be said
for Green.
</P>
<P>
   Now Turner is hoping Green _ signed as a free agent by the
Redskins on Valentine's Day of 1995 _ becomes a quarterback the
Redskins can love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, Gus struggled in the preseason,'' Turner said.
``Coming off last year, we were looking for more consistency from
him. Trent played so well in the second half of the Giants game
that he deserved a second chance. He's done some good things in the
last few weeks.''

SAVVY INSIDER IS THE DEMOCRATS' COUNSEL ON THE PANEL

 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For three weeks, Abbe Lowell hunched down on the
thin carpeting in the hallway of the Ford Building, just outside
the vault securing the independent counsel's documents, a cell
phone in one hand and a portable file folder in the other. He was a
long way from the comfortable surroundings of his downtown law
office.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when his office computers finally arrived this week, there
arose another indignity. The computers seemed to have an odd
glitch; Democrats couldn't click their way past an oversize glossy
photograph of the Judiciary Committee's Republican chairman, Henry
Hyde of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that until this weekend, I and the
consultants that came on with the Starr report had no offices, no
computers, no phones,'' Lowell said in an interview last week,
still a touch sore from the head butting that makes most
congressional Democrats seethe as members of the minority party.
Only a directive by Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia put an end to
the triage operation.
</P>
<P>
   For Lowell, perhaps the most difficult challenge of all in the
coming months, as the Judiciary Committee grapples with
impeachment, is cozying up to the idea that this is one case he
cannot easily beat into submission. At the core, it may seem
ordinary _ a tale of sex and lies _ but the trappings are
considerably more complex and far-reaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that, without being excessively humble or modest,
I am a very small part of a very big place called the House of
Representatives that's dealing with this,'' Lowell said, surrounded
by an assortment of boxes in his new offices at the Ford Building.
``For someone who likes to be in control of his case, this is a
great education to know how little control I can assert, how events
go faster than my ability to even blink.''
</P>
<P>
   In their choice of a lawyer to oversee the expected impeachment
inquiry for the minority, Democrats took a blatantly opposite path
than their Republican counterparts. While Republicans chose an
outsider, a street-smart lawyer from Chicago who shies away from
the limelight, Democrats opted for a savvy Washington insider who
relishes his role working for the panel and soaks in the klieg
lights.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, 46, has made his name as an aggressive trial lawyer
defending smeared or fallen politicians, most of them Democrats, as
well as players on the periphery of elected office. The former
House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, hired him as his lawyer
when he faced ethics charges in Congress. He has also represented,
among others, Dan Rostenkowski, the one-time chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee who went to prison for mail fraud, and
Mario Biaggi, a former New York representative who was convicted
for bribery, extortion and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   To Democrats, Lowell, a Columbia University man through law
school, seemed like a natural for the sex-and-lies charges Clinton
faces on Capitol Hill. Calm, quick-witted and precise with his
words, Lowell held three valuable assets: He knows the law, is
sure-footed on Capitol Hill and has a knack for communicating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's assume, for example, you were arrested in x location and
that you are hauled up on charges in that jurisdiction,'' said Bob
Bauer, a longtime legal adviser for the House Democratic leader,
Dick Gephardt of Missouri, who helped recruit Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times would you hear someone suggest to you, you
should have a local lawyer around, someone who knows the court
house and the issue,'' he added. ``You have to understand this
community, how it works, how Congress operates, how members think
through issues and react to them. Somebody who is completely
unfamiliar with that forum would have difficulty with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Bauer said, ``He doesn't shy away from intellectual
combat.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Born in the Bronx and raised in Long Island, Lowell said New
York still courses through his veins, although Washington was where
he wanted to practice law, and law was the only career he wanted to
pursue.
</P>
<P>
   This was partly because the people who impressed him most as he
was growing up were all activist lawyers, and partly because of his
rich uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always came to visit in a really nice Buick and gave me
chocolate cigars,'' said Lowell, who is married with two children
and teaches criminal procedure law at Georgetown. ``I think I
associated law with being able to drive a fancy Buick and having
chocolate cigars, which also appealed to me.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, a World War II veteran who was shot down over enemy
territory, worked as an insurance agent and was also a musician and
professional photographer. His mother spent her days as a doctor's
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   He described himself as a ``normal kid.'' A batch of elementary
school report cards unearthed by parents recently were disturbingly
prescient, he said. He talked too much, his teachers noted,
bothered his classmates while they were still working on their
assignments, and never took no for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Lowell fell in with the civil rights movement,
and then the anti-war movement, as a rally organizer and a
register-to-vote evangelist. It was not something his parents
understood, at least initially. ``My fights weren't whether I could
have the car on the weekend,'' he said, ``They were, can I go march
on the Pentagon?''
</P>
<P>
   But his involvement with the civil rights and anti-war movements
marked him indelibly, he said. ``I guess social change turned into
government process for me,'' he said. ``Having an impact on the
government was part of my upbringing through those two movements.''
</P>
<P>
   Law in Washington, he said, allows him ``to work on issues or on
cases that can impact on government, to make it more responsive to
people and to check its power, and those were the themes of my
growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   The country, he said, has never washed away the bitter
aftertaste of Watergate, the defining moment of that era. But
Lowell is quick to mention that the Clinton-Lewinsky imbroglio is
no Watergate, despite its overtones of perjury and obstruction of
justice. In his view, Watergate was something altogether different,
and the public recognizes that distinction. The polls, he said,
reflect that. His job is to see if the House reflects that as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report, while it's dressed up to be something which
invokes the impeachment word, really, at its heart, is about a
private affair with a president and a woman,'' Lowell said. ``It
has all the trappings of being important, but a lot of people think
that underneath, it is not as important.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the world's finance ministers and central
bankers gathered last year in Hong Kong, they nervously
congratulated each other for containing _ at least for the moment _
a nasty financial brush fire in Asia. In a year's time, many
predicted in hallway chatter, the troubles in Thailand and
Indonesia would look like a replay of Mexico in 1995 _ a rough bump
in the road for a world enjoying remarkable prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about bad market calls. Twelve months later, as the same
financial mandarins clog Washington with their limousines and glide
through endless receptions at the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, just about
everything that could have gone wrong in the world economy has: the
worst downturn in Japan since World War II, economic meltdown in
Russia, a depression in Indonesia that is plunging 100 million
people below the poverty line, and deep fears over what happens
next in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this year's IMF meeting most remarkable, though, is
that the harshest criticisms are directed at the monetary fund
itself, and, by extension, at the U.S. Treasury, which is viewed as
the power behind the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in place of confident predictions, there are mutual
recriminations. Arguments are breaking out over whether the true
culprits were crony capitalists and weakened leaders like Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, or huge investors who poured money into
the world's emerging markets with reckless abandon in the mid-1990s
and panicked in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds of billions
of dollars have fled from economies on four continents _ seeking
the safest havens possible, often in the United States _ and the
money is not returning anytime soon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And the subtext of every seminar on capital flows and every
conclave of nervous ministers will be some painfully blunt
questions: Can this be stopped? Or is the world headed for a global
recession?
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three years ago the IMF was created after the Bretton
Woods conference which sought to stabilize the world economy and
secure the peace after World War II. Now it is under attack from
all sides, charged not only with worsening a bad situation by
misjudging the economics, but with being politically tone-deaf in
some of the most volatile capitals in the world, from Jakarta,
Indonesia, to Moscow. For the first time, there are disturbing
questions about whether the institution itself is still capable,
financially or politically, of containing the kind of economic
contagion that caught the world unaware.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the IMF's critics were largely found in Africa and South
Asia, were the fund was often viewed as arrogant; today they
include Wall Street's biggest players and top officials in the most
powerful economies of Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few _ including former Secretary of State George Schultz
and members of Congress who are increasingly suspicious of all
international institutions _ are talking about scrapping the IMF
altogether. But almost everyone is talking about creating a ``new
financial architecture'' that can do what the old one clearly
cannot: smother financial wildfires before they leap around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other
leaders, after months of silence, have edged into the debate, in
some cases wresting the issue for the first time from their finance
ministers and central banks. Their fear, their advisers say, is
that 15 months of financial turmoil are now threatening political
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns have turned this year's meeting into a tumbled
mass of worries and a groping for short and long-term solutions.
The Japanese, the French, the Southeast Asians are all arriving in
Washington with different diagnoses of what went wrong, and
different solutions about how to set it right. The United States
has its own set of plans, a mix of suggestions to force more
disclosure of financial data in countries around the world and to
impose more American-style financial standards and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an ideological argument is breaking out over whether
the world should slow down a long march toward more free and open
markets _ a strategy pressed by the Clinton administration for the
past six years. Others argue that it is unwise to start rebuilding
the hospital while the patients are still on the operating tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year the standard answer that all of us were given came
down to this: `We have the IMF and the World Bank, and they know
best,''' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said over breakfast
in Washington the other day, reflecting on how the crisis turned 30
years of astounding growth in his country into an overnight
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they said everything that went wrong was our fault,'' he
said. ``But now, now I think people know that much of the problem
came from the outside, and we need something better.''
</P>
<P>
   And the IMF itself is beginning to fight back, an awkward role
for an institution dominated by Ph.D. economists who are
unaccustomed to being openly challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every place you turn you read the same story, that we came in,
that we made things worse,'' said Stanley Fischer, the deputy
managing director of the fund, who was born in Northern Rhodesia _
now Zambia _ and became chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's economics department before taking a job that has now
put him in the center of the financial storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We frequently get the blame, some of it well-deserved,'' he
said. ``But it is politically convenient for governments around the
world to cry, `The IMF made us do it,' and pin their mistakes on
us. That's fine. We'd rather be loved, but more than that we'd like
to be effective.''

   MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS
</P>
<P>
   On a steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, the IMF's top
official, slipped into Jakarta to the private residence of
President Suharto and sat down for a four-hour meeting to tick off,
line by line, the huge reforms Indonesia would have to implement in
return for tens of billions of dollars in emergency aid. Two
previous deals had collapsed when Suharto ignored the fund's
conditions, so Camdessus insisted that he strike a deal directly
with Suharto, then Asia's longest-serving leader.
</P>
<P>
   It was a meeting of men who knew different worlds of power
politics: Suharto rose as a general in central Java, and Camdessus
had detonated mines in Algeria for the French army before entering
the French Treasury on his way to becoming head of France's central
bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all there,'' a senior IMF official recalled. ``He was
told he had to dismantle the national airplane project, the clove
monopoly, all the distribution monopolies.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Camdessus looked at the impassive Suharto and
said, ``You see what this means for your family,'' a reference to
their vast investments in the country's key industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I called in my children, and they all understand.'''
</P>
<P>
   But within months, that exchange in Jakarta came to symbolize
the IMF's twin troubles: Its inability to understand and reckon
with the national politics of countries in need of radical reform,
and its focus on economic stabilization rather than the social
costs of its actions.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto had no intention of fulfilling the agreement. It was,
one of his former Cabinet members said, ``a delaying move that was
obvious to everyone except Camdessus.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one reason why the IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf is
that its senior staff is almost entirely composed of Ph.D.
economists. There are few officials with deep experience in
international politics, much less the complexities of Javanese
culture that were at work in Indonesia. Historically, experts in
politics and security have gravitated to the United Nations,
development experts to the World Bank, and economists to the IMF _
creating dangerous gaps in a crisis like this one.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the fund had only a rudimentary understanding of
what would happen if its demands were met and all Indonesia's state
monopolies were quickly dissolved. While that system lined the
pockets of the Suhartos and their friends, it also distributed
food, gasoline and other staples to a country that stretches for
3,000 miles over thousands of islands. To help balance the budget,
the fund demanded a quick end to expensive subsidies that keep the
price of food and gasoline artificially low.
</P>
<P>
   But that, combined with the huge currency devaluation that
sparked the crisis, resulted in high prices and shortages that
fueled riots that continue to this day, as millions of Indonesians
lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF _ unintentionally, its officials insist _ also sped
Suharto's resignation, insisting on the elimination of ``crony
capitalism,'' code words for removing the Suharto family from the
center of the economy. Ultimately, that may prove to be Indonesia's
salvation, if the new government can contain the rioting against
the ethnic Chinese minority _ whose money is desperately needed to
save the country's fast-shrinking economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worth noting,'' Fischer said this week, ``that our
programs in Asia _ in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand _ only took
hold after there was a change in government.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Indonesia experience has revived the argument
that the IMF is so focused on stabilizing banks and currencies, on
preventing capital flight and freeing up markets, that it is blind
to the social costs of its actions. Among the toughest critics has
been its sister institution, the World Bank, whose main charge is
alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen the tension almost every day,'' one senior World
Bank official said recently. The bank has gone to extraordinary
lengths in recent months to differentiate its role from that of the
fund, and to announce a tripling of aid to the poorest in the
countries hit by the economic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Even U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has joined the argument,
warning in a speech at Harvard recently that ``if globalization is
to succeed, it must succeed for poor and rich alike. It must
deliver rights no less than riches. It must be harnessed to the
cause not of capital alone, but of development and prosperity for
the poorest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   IMF officials say they are changing strategies when they see
they are exacting too great a social cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult formula to get exactly right,'' Fischer
said in August, as Russia was teetering and the IMF was sending in
$4.8 billion in aid that was rapidly wasted. ``You need enough
discipline to send the right message to the markets and keep
investors from fleeing. But you need enough leeway to keep people
from suffering more than they otherwise would.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, he noted, the IMF has allowed more spending to
sustain subsidies for basic goods for longer periods in Indonesia,
Korea and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new flexibility at the IMF'' a senior Indonesian
official concluded recently. ``It is a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY?
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration admits that the IMF has many
failings, many of them on display this year. But it insists that
the world has gone through global financial crises without an IMF
once before in this century _ and the result was the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt the situation over the past year would have
been much worse _ with greater devaluations, more defaults, more
contagion, and greater trade dislocations _ without the program
agreed with the IMF and the finance it has provided,'' Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Congress last week.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans and some Democrats are unconvinced. Even though
the Senate has overwhelmingly approved an $18 billion contribution
to the fund to help it fight new crises, the House defeated that
measure two weeks ago. The fund's last hope of getting the money,
which will free up nearly $100 billion in contributions from other
nations waiting for the United States to act, will come when the
House and Senate try to resolve their budget differences in a
conference committee in the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   A rejection, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send
a message around the world that the United States is turning its
back on the one institution charged with restoring economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere else in the world, though, politicians and
businessmen insist that one of the biggest problems with the IMF is
that, contrary to the view of Congress, it acts as the U.S.
Treasury's lap dog. Ask in Jakarta or Moscow, and the response is
the same: The IMF never ventures far without looking back for the
approving nod of its master.

WASHINGTON: its master. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That view may not be far wrong. In ordinary times, the United
States largely leaves its hands off, as the IMF's executive board _
made up of 24 representatives of the 182 member nations _ delve
into the intricacies of budget policy in Greece or banking
regulation in Argentina. ``Surveillance'' of the world's economies
is the fund's main activity.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States weighs in, however, is when the IMF is
called on to rescue a country in deep trouble. Only then does the
IMF _ and the U.S. Treasury _ have the leverage to extract
commitments in return for billions in aid. In theory, the U.S.
influence is limited: It has an 18.5 percent vote in the fund.
Germany, Japan, France and Britain have about 5 percent each. But
in practice the United States usually gets its way, exercising its
influence behind the scenes, often in interactions between Fischer
and Summers.
</P>
<P>
   The two met when Fischer was on the MIT faculty and Summers was
a graduate student taking one of his classes, later becoming a
colleague at MIT. Each served as chief economist of the World Bank.
It was Summers who was instrumental in placing Fischer in the
fund's no. 2 job, and these days they talk constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually a warm relationship,'' Fischer said this summer.
``Remember, this is a job where you cannot turn to outsiders for
advice _ you can't call the chief economist at a Wall Street firm,
or even many of your academic friends, because so many of the
issues are confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury's relations with Camdessus are often more strained
as he plays the role of world diplomat, traveling the globe and
trying to coax along political leaders. The tensions were obvious
from the start of the Asia crisis. The fund made little secret of
its displeasure that the United States was not offering direct aid
to Thailand, a major U.S. ally, as a sign of support and
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the backlash in Congress when Mexico was bailed out
with U.S. money, that was the last thing the Treasury planned to
do. Summers, in turn, thought the fund was not forcing the Thais to
implement its reform commitments rigorously enough or disclose
their true financial picture. Within the U.S. government there was
other dissension: The State and Defense Departments felt the United
States should do more for Thailand, but backed off when the
Treasury asked if they would like to pony up some aid out of their
own budgets.
</P>
<P>
   There were other conflicts. When Japan used the last IMF meeting
to propose setting up a $100 billion ``Asia Fund'' _ one that would
exclude the United States and would probably offer aid under much
more relaxed conditions than the IMF does. Rubin called up
Camdessus at breakfast one morning and told him that the Japanese
proposal would undercut the IMF's authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just had a dispute with Michel,'' Rubin reported to his
aides as he returned to his orange juice and croissant. One of them
shot back: ``And it's only 8 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus backed down at Rubin's insistence and walked away from
money that Asia could have used. Japan says it will be back with a
similar proposal this weekend, this time for a $30 billion fund.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus has also rankled U.S. officials with statements that
amounted to cheerleading to reassure the markets _ sometimes in the
face of the facts. In June, with Russia on its way to collapse,
Camdessus declared that ``contrary to what markets and commentators
are imagining'' about the slow collapse of Russia's economy, ``this
is not a crisis. This is not a major development.''
</P>
<P>
   The bailouts of Russia and South Korea were prime examples of
how Washington muscles into the IMF's turf as soon as major U.S.
strategic interests are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas, as South Korea slipped within days of running
out of hard currency to pay its debts in December, it sent a secret
envoy, Kim Kihwan, to work out a rescue package. ``I didn't bother
going to the IMF,'' Kim recalled recently. ``I called Summers'
office at the Treasury from my home in Seoul, flew to Washington
and went directly there. I knew that was how this would get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days the Treasury dispatched David Lipton, its most
experienced veteran of emergency bailouts, who is leaving his post
as undersecretary for international affairs this month, to shadow
the IMF staff's negotiations with the government in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer was displeased. ``To make a negotiation effective, it
has to be clear who has the authority to do the negotiating,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   WHO LOST RUSSIA?
</P>
<P>
   The pattern was repeated this summer, when the United States
raced to put together a $17 billion package for Russia. The IMF's
staff in Moscow declared that Russia needed no money at all _ it
just needed to enact policies that would restore confidence in
investors. The Americans and Germans came to a different
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, U.S. officials gathered in the White House situation
room to consider what might happen to Russia if the ruble was
devalued and market reforms collapsed and to push the IMF to come
up with emergency money. So the fund began assembling a last-ditch
program to prop up a country that had resisted its reform plans for
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus, though, was still hesitant, questioning whether the
IMF should risk its scarce resources in Russia. ``We had to pull
Michel along,'' a senior Treasury official recalled.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Camdessus' instincts were right while the
approach championed by Rubin and Summers proved disastrously wrong.
The first installment of that payment _ $4.8 billion _ was wasted,
propping up the currency long enough, in the words of one IMF
official, ``to let the oligarchs get their money out of the
country.'' Then Yeltsin reversed his commitments, let the ruble
devalue anyway, began printing money with abandon and fired
virtually every reformer in his government _ resulting in a
collapse of the IMF agreements and the indefinite suspension of its
aid program.
</P>
<P>
   Now, inside the IMF and on Capitol Hill, there are
recriminations over ``who lost Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Fischer argues that ``there are no apologies owed for
what we attempted in Russia.'' But some IMF officials complain
privately that they let Rubin and Summers run roughshod over them,
striking a deal that fell apart within weeks as the Russian
parliament rebelled and Yeltsin backed away from his commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Summers responds that the United States ``took a calculated
risk'' because ``it was vastly better that Russia succeed than not
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian collapse touched off new rounds of economic
contagion, with investors fleeing Latin America, and triggering
huge losses in hedge funds like Long Term Capital, the Greenwich,
Conn., investment firm that needed to be rescued by Wall Street
powerhouses whose money it had invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia was a turning point,'' said Robert Hormats, the vice
chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``It made the world realize that
some countries can fail, even if the IMF and the Treasury
intercede. And that changed the perception of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the countries meet to face a future that the IMF has
warned could be very bleak, they need to reverse those perceptions,
or watch countries slowly starve for lack of capital. The emerging
markets are calling for controls on short term investments. The
French want a stronger IMF. The Americans say the answer is more
disclosure, so that investors are better warned, and tougher
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are usually nice, quiet meetings; everyone very
polite,'' a top U.S. official said earlier this week. ``Not this
year.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Isaac Mizrahi, who was once considered the designer
most likely to inherit the mantle of Donna Karan and Calvin Klein,
representing the next generation of American fashion, announced on
Thursday that he would close his business this week.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected news startled the New York fashion community,
which had built Mizrahi into one of its most beloved and ballyhooed
figures.
</P>
<P>
   His exuberant designs and equally endearing personality _ one
part cherubic mama's boy, one part haute aesthete _ endeared
Mizrahi to the fashion press and retailers, who devoted endless
pages in magazines and square footage in stores to his clothing.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, his sales were less than stellar and his
celebrity did not pay the bills. Chanel Inc., the American arm of
the French fashion house, which had quietly bankrolled the designer
since 1992, pulled the plug after years of losses, said Michael
Rena, executive vice president of Chanel.
</P>
<P>
   Rena would not give details on the extent of the losses to the
business, whose gross sales industry estimates put at $20 million
to $30 million a year. But clearly, Chanel had grown weary of the
drain. Despite the creativity and irrepressible personality for
which Mizrahi was known to fashion insiders, he failed to create a
signature image, like Ms. Karan or Klein, with which average
shoppers could identify.
</P>
<P>
   He therefore forfeited the chance to develop lucrative licenses
for shoes, jeans and fragrances, or a cheaper secondary collection
that would lead to a high-volume business. Chanel saw a future that
perhaps looked very much like the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew and we knew where we were heading,'' Rena said. ``We
told him there was a point beyond which we were not going to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi will remain in his Manhattan offices through November to
tie up loose ends. ``For me, it's bittersweet,'' he said. ``I don't
know what it says about fashion. I don't know what it says about
me. A lot of it is luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi said he had canceled his runway show of designs for
spring 1999, which was scheduled for next month in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden shuttering of his business indicates one of the
perennial weaknesses of the fashion industry, which tends to make
celebrities of designers with little regard for their commercial
viability. There was perhaps no designer whose press and retail
loyalty was so out of synch with the performance of his collection
in stores.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, sales of Mizrahi's collection have been
inconsistent, with only 50 to 60 percent selling at full price,
compared with other top designer lines that typically sell 70 to 80
percent at full price.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the end came just as retailers reported that sales
were looking up. In the last year, stores like Barneys and
Bloomingdale's had reinstated Isaac Mizrahi shops in their stores.
``We were willing to invest in him because of his creativity,''
said Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice president and fashion director of
Bloomingdale's. ``The clothes this season had been selling better
than in many seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The demise of his business, even in the face of this recent
turnaround, illustrates how difficult it has become for his
generation of designers to thrive. Many of the best designers now
routinely hire themselves out to famous and established houses,
primarily in Europe, to support their own lines.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion has become increasingly challenging for companies
existing in a the nebulous middle ground in size and customer
appeal. Mizrahi's is the third prominent fashion business to close
this year. Earlier, Kenar and Andrea Jovine declared bankruptcy and
shut their doors.

RUBIN URGES MORE DISCLOSURE IN GLOBAL FINANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMF-CRISIS) 
(lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Thursday that the United
States would press for ``a new openness in international finance''
that would require private financial institutions to disclose far
more information about their loans around the world and force
investors to pay their share of the cost of bailing out troubled
nations.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in New York on the day before the opening of the
annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund in Washington, Rubin said, ``The global economy cannot live
with the kinds of vast and systemic disruptions that have occurred
over the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he offered specific proposals, he also seemed intent on
heading off proposals from countries that are going to the meetings
intent on tough new rules that would control the flow of billions
of dollars of funds in and out of small economies. Malaysia is
beginning to invoke an extreme version of such ``capital controls''
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's speech to an annual conference on the Americas held by
Dow Jones &AMP; Co. began to flesh out vaguer proposals by President
Clinton and others for a new ``global financial architecture'' that
would constitute the largest overhaul of international financial
regulation in a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   But he offered few proposals for the short term, at a moment
when countries around the world are calling for immediate steps to
contain the global economic contagion that began in Asia and has
now spread.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, a former trader at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said that
although part of the problem the world is facing today is a
function of markets that move much faster than in the past, another
part was simply the herd mentality that has again led investors
``to go to extremes.''
</P>
<P>
   The best cure, he argued, is ``making information more
available, and making sure it is well used.'' A working group
created this year of 22 nations involved in the instability, both
the largest economies and emerging markets, will call this weekend
on the monetary fund ``to examine and broadly publicize countries'
adherence to international standards'' on making public important
financial information.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the Asia crisis Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea hid
crucial information, and Russia has consistently played a
cat-and-mouse game about its finances. Japanese banks have done the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also called for some changes for the fund, saying the
international financial institutions ``must work harder on
providing adequate social support and on reinforcing good
governance and reinforcing political commitment to reform.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentence was full of code words. It suggests that the fund
still pays too little attention to the effects of its programs on
the poor and has to fight corruption and crony capitalism actively,
directions where the fund management insists that it is going
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was more directly critical in the case of Russia, telling
reporters after the speech: ``I don't think it's the activities of
the international community that have failed in Russia. I think
what failed in Russia was Russian.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, he added, illustrated that ``if we don't have the
political commitment to, or ability to deliver, reform,'' then
whatever the rest of the world does ``isn't going to be responsive
or effective in dealing with the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's call for private investors to pay a larger share of
bailouts is part of an effort, led by the United States and Europe,
to create additional risks for investors that may make them think
twice about pouring money into a troubled market _ with the
assurance that the country is ``too big to fail.'' But he did not
specify how the investors would have to contribute.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Private-sector burden-sharing is critical, not only because
there will not be sufficient official money for all circumstances,
but also because it is absolutely essential in inducing market
discipline,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin issued his strongest warning yet on the danger of imposing
controls on currency trading, saying, ``We must avoid actions that
may offer short-term relief but create permanent damage in
developed and emerging-market countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was most direct in his criticism of Malaysia, which has
led the drive to control currency trading, banning traders and
speculators from holding its currency outside Malaysian borders. He
said such controls were ``tempting'' but would ``almost surely not
be effective over time, will deter capital from flowing into a
country and will often tend to be used as a substitute for real
reform.''

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A worsening decline in stock prices expanded Thursday
to damage every market worldwide on growing concern about financial
turmoil and the possibility of a global recession.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 210.09 points, or 2.7
percent, its third consecutive decline, as investors again sought
the safety of U.S. Treasury securities, driving interest rates
substantially lower. The government's benchmark 30-year bond ended
at 4.88 percent, a level not seen since the 1960s, down nearly a
quarter of a percentage point in two days.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks have now fallen 18.3 percent from their
mid-July peak and stand just one percentage point above the low for
the year reached when the Dow plummeted 512.61 points Aug. 31. At
20 percent below its peak, the market would be widely considered to
have entered a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with price drops in the United States on Thursday,
damage overseas was worse. Stocks in Brazil, which will conduct
elections Sunday, plunged 9.6 percent, while shares fell 7.6
percent in Frankfurt, 5 percent in Paris and 3.1 percent in London.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo's main index fell 1.6 percent to the latest in a series of
12-year lows after the Bank of Japan reported a drastic decline in
business confidence and the International Monetary Fund predicted
Japan's recession would become the most severe since the end of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a referendum on the fact that the crisis keeps
smoldering and no one has confidence that anybody's going to
extinguish it,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at
Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of financial institutions in the United States, exposed
to turmoil in emerging markets, write-offs of hedge fund losses and
other domestic debt as well as the possibility of recession, took
some of the heaviest battering. High-technology stocks were also
hit hard, reflected in a 4.8 percent drop in the Nasdaq market.
Utility and gold mining shares were among the few to post gains.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decline in the Dow followed a modest loss Tuesday and
a 237.90-point drop Wednesday. The average was off nearly 260
points in the last hour of trading before recovering a bit.
</P>
<P>
   One contributor to the latest selloff was the IMF report
predicting that the Japanese recession would be more severe than
has been generally expected. It said that the world's second
biggest economy would contract by 2.5 percent this year; until
recently, the worst outcome had been thought to be a shrinkage in
the range of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF also said that ``the risks of a deeper, wider and more
prolonged downturn have escalated'' for Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank is to begin this
weekend in Washington but some analysts were skeptical that
effective action would, or even could, be taken to restore
confidence in arresting the downward economic and financial spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worldwide events have superseded what the IMF can handle,''
said Mickey Levy, chief economist at NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities. At the same time, however, he said that low interest
rates provide a cushion, spurring demand, in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy's not falling out of bed,'' he said, even though
growth in the United States would not be much faster than a 2
percent annual pace in the quarter that ended Wednesday and perhaps
as little as 1 percent in the year's final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The market's drop Thursday coincided with an extended public
appearance by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan but his
remarks did not produce a noticeable reaction. At a congressional
inquiry into hedge funds, one source of current instability,
Greenspan resisted suggestions for tight regulation, saying that
such moves might be counterproductive by driving those operations
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Investor alarm about the turbulence in stocks was reinforced
Wednesday by the latest trend data from the mutual fund industry,
the most popular way for Americans to invest in the market. The
Investment Company Institute, a trade group, said that investors
withdrew $11.2 billion from stock funds in August, the biggest
outflow on record. At the same time, they funneled a record $50.94
billion into relatively safe money market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch was one of the many prominent casualties among
financial stocks, sliding 3 3/16 a share, to 44, after trading as
low as 42 9/16 during the day _ down from a high of 109 1/8 on July
13.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp fell 4 3/4, to 88 1/4, and Bankers Trust fell 3 15/16,
to 55 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   American Express fell 4 1/8 a share, to 73 1/2; J. P. Morgan
slid 3 5/8, to 81, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter dropped 3 1/8 to
40. Providian Financial lost 8 7/16, to 76 3/8, and Capital One
Financial shed 12 1/16, to 91.
</P>
<P>
   High-technology casualties included Yahoo, down 16 9/16 a share,
to 112 15/16; Amazon.com, down 9, to 102 5/8; Microsoft, down 6, to
104 1/16; Ebay, down 5 1/16, to 40, and Dell Computer, down 4 3/16,
to 61 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Among stocks in the Dow industrials, Sears, Roebuck endured the
biggest percentage loss _ 6.5 percent _ when its shares fell 2 7/8,
to 41 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris and McDonald's were among the only Dow stocks to
eke out gains. Utilities mostly held their ground, as did major oil
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a flight to stability and stocks with good
dividends,'' said Daniel Eagan, a portfolio manager at Black Rock
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining stocks trounced
advancing ones by 2,424 to 809, with 310 setting new lows and 81
new highs. Volume was 899.7 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.01 percent, to
986.39.

MERRILL CITES $1.4 BILLION EXPOSURE TO LONG-TERM
</HEADLINE>
   (See also HEDGEFUND-REGULATE, HEDGEFUND-MERIWETHER) 
(sw) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. said on Thursday that it had $1.4
billion of financial exposure to Long-Term Capital Management, the
speculative hedge fund it helped rescue from bankruptcy last week.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch said it covered this exposure, which comes largely
from serving as a major banker for Long-Term Capital, by requiring
the hedge fund to provide cash and government bonds as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   But if Long-Term Capital had collapsed, the value of the hedge
fund's derivatives might have sunk rapidly, causing steep losses at
Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch was a leading member of the consortium of 14 big
financial companies that injected $3.6 billion into the hedge fund
to stave off bankruptcy. Merrill has said that it participated in
that bailout because it feared that Long-Term Capital's collapse
would damage the world financial system.
</P>
<P>
   A Merrill spokesman said on Thursday that the firm's large
exposure to the fund did not influence its decision to partake in
the rescue. ``We have said that even if there were a distress
liquidation, given the secure collateral any loss would be fully
manageable,'' said Tim Gilles, a Merrill spokesman. ``That was not
the motivation for us to join. Our concern was the potential for
disruption in global markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Though almost all the big Wall Street firms had dealings with
Long-Term Capital, which is based in Greenwich, Conn., Merrill's
ties were arguably among the closest. The firm was an early equity
investor in the fund, contributing $15 million at its 1994
inception. Before this week's recapitalization, that amount had
already dwindled to $2 million, the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Merrill has a deferred compensation plan for senior
executives that allows them to channel a portion of their income to
Long-Term Capital. A total of 123 top executives there, including
its chairman, David Komansky, have invested $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill officials deny that their personal stakes in Long-Term
Capital influenced their decision to rescue the fund. They argue
that all the top executives have much larger personal stakes in
Merrill itself, and that they would not steer the company to take
an action that was not in the interest of shareholders generally.
</P>
<P>
   Though Long-Term Capital is easily Merrill's most important
client in the hedge fund world, other hedge funds owe it $700
million, most of that fully collateralized, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Other banks and brokerage houses are also detailing the risks
they took serving as underwriters, counterparties and lenders to
hedge funds like Long-Term Capital, which lost huge sums of capital
with ill-fated bets on world stock and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Chase Manhattan Corp. has said it has $3.2 billion in total
hedge fund exposure. Bankers Trust has said hedge funds owe it a
total of about $875 million. Both banks have said they consider
their exposure well backed by collateral. Both are also part of the
Long-Term Capital rescue effort, but it was not clear how much of
their total exposure was attributable to debts of that one hedge
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Italy's Foreign Exchange Office, a unit of the Bank
of Italy, the country's central bank, said it had invested $100
million in the hedge fund and loaned it another $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said it expected to have the loan repaid now that
Long-Term Capital was rescued. It equity investment was reduced in
value by 90 percent, but the bank said it made stellar returns in
previous years on its investment in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Antonello Biagioli, the foreign exchange office's co-director,
told Bloomberg News that the bank invested in Long-Term Capital, in
part, to tap the expertise in derivatives of the firm's partners,
including the Nobel prize winner Myron Scholes and John Meriwether,
Long-Term Capital's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's exposure to Long-Term Capital includes the risk it
takes by serving as a counterparty to derivatives owned by
Long-Term Capital _ taking the other side of the hedge fund's bets,
the company said. The investment bank also made loans to Long-Term
Capital in return for assets like government bonds, a transaction
known as repos.

SCHOUREK TO FOLLOW SABERHABEN IN SOX PLAYOFF ROTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The pitcher's wife will sing the national anthem. The
general manager's mother will sit with her son in his private box.
The first base coach will ride the Green Line to Kenmore Square,
and Boston's most famous Dominican will arrive proudly with his big
brother.
</P>
<P>
   The red, white, and blue bunting will be draped over box seat
railings almost as old as the Eck, Ted Williams's home run seat
will be freshly wiped, and Pesky's Pole should sparkle like gold in
the late-afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   October baseball returns this afternoon to Fenway Park with Game
3 of the American League Division Series. Bret Saberhagen will toe
the rubber, Lynn Saberhagen will take the mike, Mary Duquette will
beam at her son Dan, Dave Jauss will pocket his subway token, Pedro
Martinez will tip his cap to his brother Ramon, and the Red Sox
faithful, their worry lines for a change dwarfed by the upturned
curves of their smiles, will rise as one to celebrate that the Olde
Towne Team has a place in the playoffs for the first time since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians, a/k/a defending American League
champions, will be here, too, which is why, shortly after
Saberhagen's first pitch to Kenny Lofton, the euphoria of the
moment undoubtedly will give way to the anxiety that runs as deep
here as the Quabbin Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams, now just outside the big city in Norwood, has
been here only two years, so he still can't fathom why, in a
best-of-five series tied at a game apiece, so many people are
already fretting about a worst-case scenario _ namely, that by the
time the twilight shadows fade to black, the Red Sox will be on the
brink of elimination and Williams will have no choice but to call
on Martinez to man the ramparts for Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose Friday against Connecticut's Charles Nagy, Williams
said, that will not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete Schourek's going to start the fourth game,'' said
Williams, who stood in line at the neighborhood McDonald's for a
double cheeseburger before appearing at an off-day press conference
at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to make sure no one misinterpreted his meaning, Williams
restated his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro's not going to pitch Saturday,'' Williams said. ``He's
not pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't pitched with three days' rest this season. If it was
your son out there and he'd thrown 3,000-plus pitches and averaged
115-plus pitches a game and his career is on the line and you
panicked and pitched him too soon and hurt him, I don't think you
would be too happy. I know I wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense to the scouts who have reported that Martinez has
pitched tired in the second half of the season. Makes sense to
Indians manager Mike Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know their reasons,'' Hargrove said, ``but I do know
Jimy Williams is a good baseball man and knows his club very well.
For Jimy to say that, he's got a very, very good reason for it. He
knows his club better than any of the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense to Duquette, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy's looking forward to a great start from Saberhagen,''
Duquette said of the 34-year-old righthander who as a 21-year-old
in 1985 won the seventh game of the World Series the day after
celebrating the birth of his first son, Drew, and this season is
2-0 against the Indians, allowing just a run in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy's anticipating the team will be up, 2-1,'' Duquette said,
``and in a position to clinch the outcome on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, the lefthander who arrived almost as an afterthought
in August, when everybody else the Red Sox auditioned as a
bottom-of-the-rotation starter had flamed out, said he appreciated
Williams's show of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the confidence,'' said Schourek, who resembles
``Seinfeld's'' Kramer but for reasons he can't explain has been
called ``Yogi Bear'' by Martinez ever since he beat Tampa Bay 10
days ago for his first win with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what he is thinking,'' Schourek said of
Williams's insistence that Martinez will not go again unless there
is a Game 5. ``Obviously, I'm not a No. 1, but I give us a chance
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of elbow problems that have plagued him the last three
years, Schourek no longer is a No. 1. But he was the ace of the
Reds in 1995 when they went to the National League playoffs, and he
faced much greater uncertainty before his first postseason start
that year than he does now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in LA to play the Dodgers, and on the eve of that
series, they were expecting a verdict in the first O.J. (Simpson)
trial,'' he said. ``They were going to cancel the game if it didn't
go the way it did, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to get any big crowds of people, obviously.
So I had that anxiety, on top of getting mentally prepared for my
first postseason game ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek was equal to the task. He beat the Dodgers, 7-2, then
went on to face the Braves in the NL Championship Series, giving up
a total of two runs in two no-decisions against Atlanta, where
Williams was third base coach at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it goes back to the way I pitched against the Braves,''
Schourek said. ``Maybe he saw what I did under pressure, that I
didn't rattle.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Williams just wishes people would put first things
first. And that means Saberhagen. Martinez may be Boston's
wealthiest player, but he's not the club's only money pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel good about Saberhagen,'' Williams said. ``We will go
as long with him as it takes for us to win that baseball game.''

   NEAH BAY, Wash. _ Armed with a steel harpoon, a .50-caliber
assault rifle and official permission to conduct the first legal
hunt for a gray whale in American waters in more than 50 years,
members of a small Indian tribe gathered Thursday on a beach on
Washington's rugged Olympic Peninsula to start an adventure
intended to resurrect the glory and traditions of their
whale-hunting forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   But before the eight-man crew could even launch its 32-foot
cedar canoe into the steely waters of the Pacific, the Makah
Indians had to contend with a modern-day flotilla of animal-rights
protesters, themselves equipped with a Norwegian-built submarine
painted to resemble a whale and an underground speaker system that
the protesters said was capable of scaring off a whale and saving
its life.
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S. Coast Guard, intent on preventing the groups from
clashing with each other, kept close watch on a scene that has
posed an exquisite dilemma for many environmental groups. Finding
themselves caught between the save-the-whales ethos represented by
the protesters and the respect for centuries-old Native American
traditions that the Makah say their whale hunt is all about, many
leading environmental groups have taken no position at all on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Though no living Makah has ever hunted a whale, the Indian
nation here at the very northwestern tip of the continental United
States was once renowned for its prowess, and it is the only Indian
tribe specifically guaranteed the right to hunt whales under an
1855 treaty with the American government.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by the Clinton administration and a $310,000 grant
from the Commerce Department, the group won an exemption from the
worldwide whaling ban last year and, as of Thursday, has the right
to take up to five gray whales per year in the next five years.
Though critics fear the Makah hunt will open the door to commercial
whaling here and elsewhere, the Indians insist they plan to use the
whale meat, oil and blubber only for their own food and for
ceremonial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hunt is the missing link, the thing that brings us full
circle to our traditions,'' said Marcy Parker, the Makah tribal
council's vice chairwoman. ``We're ocean families, whaling
families. So much of what we are all about comes from the ocean,
and we feel a deep spiritual need to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Makahs live in a spectacular forested setting hard by
the roaring sea and at the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, it
is a community racked by joblessness and tainted by the plagues of
modern life, such as drugs. Many here say that the whale hunt has
succeeded in instilling a new sense of purpose in the lives of the
young men selected for the hunt, and in the Makah nation at large.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribal elders who can remember the taste of whale meat are
not so sure the hunt is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire the young people for taking on the challenge, but I
just hope to God that no one is hurt,'' said 82-year-old Hildred
Ides, whose grandfather was a whale hunter. ``Going for a whale is
a very serious thing, a very dangerous thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 88-year-old cousin, Irene Ward Ides, nodded her head in
agreement as they sat watching dancers in the community hall here
one recent evening. ``I wonder if they really know what they are
doing,'' she said. ``The whale can get awfully mad. The whales know
they're being chased. They know they're being hunted.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the gray whale, which can weigh as much as 40 tons and
grow much longer than the hunters' canoe, was called the ``devil
fish'' by 19th century whalers for its propensity to thrash and
fight when attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, when not under attack, the whales can be
inordinately friendly and are known to swim and play alongside
boats, making them a popular tourist sight all along their annual
migration route from Baja California to the Bering Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, all of the crew on board the conservation ship Edward
Abbey were privileged to meet a young, friendly whale we named
Buddy,'' says an alert posted on the World Wide Web by the Sea
Shepherd Conservation Society, a Southern California-based group
that has taken the lead in opposing the Makah hunt and prides
itself in having scuttled whaling missions around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This October,'' adds the alert, ``Buddy may be blasted to
death against those cliffs, near the reservation at Neah Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   The young men of the Makah nation, who have been training for
months and have traveled as far as Russia to learn whaling
techniques, describe the hunt in sacred terms and say it is a
powerful way to connect with prior generations of Makah hunters and
with the group's traditions, which include hundreds of songs and
dances oriented around the hunt. They defend their planned use of a
powerful rifle to finish off the whale once it is harpooned as a
modern protective measure that would be sanctioned by their
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are praying to be right with God,'' said Eric Johnson, a
muscular 31-year-old who is a teacher in the Makah's Head Start
program and the captain of the hunt team.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is the one to judge whether or not we get the whale, and
whether or not we will survive,'' said Johnson at dusk the other
night, just before he and other crew members slipped away into the
coastal fog for a practice session, chanting songs that are
intended to coax a whale toward their canoe.

</P>
<P>
   With the gray whales driven almost to extinction by global
whaling, the Makahs stopped whaling altogether sometime in the
1920s, and the United States banned the hunting of gray whales in
1937 in a bid to protect the species. It has been a conservation
success story: there are now an estimated 23,000 whales out in the
Pacific, the highest number in at least a century, says the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   The whale was officially removed from the endangered species
list in 1994, an action that sparked the Makah tribe's campaign for
whaling rights.
</P>
<P>
   Even as members of the Makah group huddled Thursday on the beach
and met with Coast Guard officials in a bid to find ways to keep
the protesters at bay, the hunt's opponents were vowing to protect
the gray whales by just about any means necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about five whales, we're talking about
thousands of whales,'' said Paul Watson, the leader of the Sea
Sheperd, from his cell phone aboard one of the group's boats,
anchored off Neah Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he believed that if the Makahs succeeded in taking
even a single whale, it would open the floodgates to demands for
whale hunts by other Indian tribes in the United States and Canada
and, even more alarmingly in his view, to non-Indian whalers in
countries like Norway, Iceland and Japan. Those countries have
conducted limited whaling in defiance of an international ban, but
many groups who defend whales say they believe the Makah hunt is
part of a campaign to broaden commercial whaling. (Whale meat is
considered a delicacy in many Asian countries and, by some
estimates, a single gray whale can be worth up to half a million
dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is not really Neah Bay,'' said Watson through the
crackle of his phone. ``We're concerned about the message this will
send to Oslo, to Reykjavik, to Tokyo.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, who also gathered for a vigil Wednesday night in
nearby Port Angeles, wearing gray and red ribbons (to symbolize the
whale and the blood it would shed) have drawn the wrath of many of
the Makah.
</P>
<P>
   So have the hundreds of people from around the country who have
made threatening telephone calls or written scornful letters to the
Makah, such as this one from Vermont: ``So much for the `We love
the earth, peace, harmony, etc.' What garbage. You people ought to
stick to welfare. Your culture _ what a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Janine Bowechop, the executive director of the Makah Cultural
and Research Center here, which has an extensive display about the
tribe's whaling history in its museum, said she was deeply
frustrated by the way that animal-rights groups, in her depiction,
had ``slaughtered and distorted'' the tribe's interest in a whale
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are completely misrepresenting what is a very meaningful
tradition, something that is centuries old,'' said Ms. Bowechop.
``The question should be, what's the fuss all about? America is
supposed to be about the acceptance of different values.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Keith A. Johnson, tribal treasurer and head of the Makah
whaling commission: ``They come all the way out here to harass the
Makah, a little tribe that wants to take a few whales out of the
ocean. They have no idea about the richness of our culture, what
this is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get the story out _ if we didn't, we'd be these
horrible, dirty savages, the killers of the whales,'' he said.
``It's just not that way.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke in the tribal headquarters, which are in the
barracks of what was once an Air Force radar station here, Johnson
sprayed processed cheese spread on a cracker and popped it in his
mouth. Even as he joked about his snack (''we hear you can make
this stuff from whale blubber too,'' he said), it was a small
reminder of the ways in which modern forces pervade the 27,000-acre
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Neah Bay, amid rusted cars and broken-looking
homes, a few businesses with names like Cedar Shack Espresso and
the Big Salmon bait shop struggle to attract tourists, but the
place has a melancholy feel. And at the Makah Maiden, a
glum-looking waitress pointed to the hamburger portion of the menu
the other night, explaining that the restaurant had no seafood that
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Once whale meat comprised almost 80 percent of the Makah diet,
and among other things, a successful hunt may revive the whale's
importance in the community for both spiritual and sustenance
purposes. But others think that time is past, and should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't like the idea of killing whales, that's all,''
said Valerie Brown, a 38-year-old Makah woman who works as a cook
at Beebe's, another local restaurant. ``Nobody around here knows
what whale meat tastes like, anyway. Nobody ever asks if we have it
on the menu.''

DEMOCRATS EMBRACE PLAN TO COUNTER REPUBLICAN WATERGATE-STYLE
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After weeks of disunity, Democrats on the House
Judiciary Committee late Thursday embraced a plan to counter the
Republican proposal for a broad, Watergate-style impeachment
inquiry of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with a 3-hour closed door meeting between
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and Democratic committee members said
the alternative would limit the Republican-controlled committee's
inquiry to allegations against Clinton contained in the Starr
report and whether they amount to impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsel Kenneth Starr last month delivered to
Congress a report alleging that Clinton committed perjury,
obstructed justice, tampered with witnesses and abused the power of
his office by trying to cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky
during the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit and, later, during
an eight-month grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal pushed by Gephardt, D-Mo., the Judiciary
Committee would have until Nov. 25 _ Thanksgiving eve _ to hold
hearings and determine whether the allegations rise to the level
the founding fathers intended when they gave Congress the power to
remove the president for ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   If the panel decides the allegations meet that standard, then a
full impeachment investigation could be launched, said the
officials who agreed to discuss the Democratic alternative only on
the condition they remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic proposal, to be unveiled today, was drafted by
Reps. Jerrold Nadler, of New York, and Rick Boucher and Bobby
Scott, both of Virginia. They were recruited by Gephardt to come up
with a plan to quell dissension among Democratic committee members,
who had been unable to reach consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something the rank-and-file Democrats can support without
being accused by their re-election opponents that they ignored
Starr's evidence against the president,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Democrats propose, it faces almost certain
rejection next week when the Judiciary Committee considers whether
to ask the House to launch the first impeachment inquiry of a
president in 24 years. The investigation of the Watergate scandal
in 1974 led to President Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is to vote Monday or Tuesday on a
resolution of inquiry that mirrors the one used to begin the
investigation of President Nixon. As proposed by committee Chairman
Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican, the resolution would allow a
broad, open-ended investigation while giving Democrats equal
authority to subpoena witnesses. If approved, the resolution faces
a vote by the full House on Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cannot be a never-ending fishing expedition,'' complained
Rep. John Conyers, the committee's top-ranking Democrat before the
meeting with Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers, D-Michigan, said that following the course proposed by
the Republicans ``would only mire the country into a protracted and
partisan inquiry which could last for years and drag down the
country in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want the committee to have the time and authority to
examine other scandals touching on Clinton and the White House,
including campaign finance abuses, the Whitewater land deal, FBI
file misuse and White House travel office controversies. Except for
campaign fund raising, these topics already have been investigated
by Starr, who did not include them in his Sept. 9 report to
Congress on the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be irresponsible for us to establish arbitrary limits
on the inquiry,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, a Florida Republican on
the committee. ``I have a growing suspicion that no matter what we
do ... (the Democrats) will criticize it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats hammered out their alternative to Republican plans
for a broad impeachment inquiry, the president was trying to shore
up support in Congress by promoting his plan to hire more teachers
and build more schools.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 Democrats, many of whom had been critical of Clinton's
personal behavior, showed up at the White House to throw their
support behind his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that Congress was spending too much time on possible
impeachment proceedings, Clinton urged lawmakers to focus on more
important subjects. ``No issue has suffered more from misplaced
priorities and partisan pursuits than America's public schools,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those attending the Rose Garden ceremony was Rep. Gene
Green, D-Texas. Green said that while he does not condone Clinton's
behavior in the Lewinsky affair, he would continue to back many of
the president's policies and goals, especially his call for more
funding to help improve schools and reduce class size.
</P>
<P>
   ``I vote with the White House about 75 or 80 percent of the
time. We have some differences, but I'll work with (the president)
on issues that are important to my area,'' Green said. ``But I'm
not going to defend the president's behavior. He can't defend it
himself, so why should I.''

TOP U.N. ARMS INSPECTOR TRIES TO QUIET EX-IRAQ TEAM MEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The head of the United Nations' Iraqi
disarmament commission said Thursday that he had ordered Scott
Ritter, an American inspector who quit in anger in August, to stop
revealing information he gathered on the job.
</P>
<P>
   But the order will not be easy to enforce, according to some
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, who in his letter of resignation accused the Clinton
administration and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan of effectively
gutting the inspection program by failing to stand up to Baghdad
over bars to inspections, has been at the center of congressional
testimony in Washington and has given numerous interviews to the
press in the United States, Europe and most recently Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats and officials here say that it was the last
interview, with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, that caused most
alarm. In it, Ritter spoke of sharing information with Israel, an
implacable foe of Iraq, which has long accused American inspectors
of spying for the Israelis and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Richard Butler, executive chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, known as UNSCOM, said Israel was not the issue because
it was one of 50 countries that shared intelligence with the
commission. He said the problem was larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've defended Scott's right to express his point of view, and
I always will,'' Butler, the chief weapons inspector, told
reporters Thursday. ``That's what makes it particularly sad for me
that he has said some things that I regret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I've had to write a letter to him asking him to stop doing
that,'' Butler said, ``because all officials of the U.N. and UNSCOM
sign an undertaking not to reveal matters that should not be
revealed publicly, which they've obtained in their official duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter accused Ritter of ``improper disclosure of
information.'' It threatens unspecified further action if Ritter
does not comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that that will be the end of that,'' said Butler, who
discussed the letter with the secretary-general on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the
secretary-general concurred with Butler's views. He said a decision
on whether to take legal action against Ritter was up to the
organization's legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter's lawyer, Matthew Lifflander, said in an interview
Thursday that Ritter would not comment on the letter and its
demands that he stop speaking until ``sometime next week,'' when he
sends a formal reply to Butler. But he has defended in the past
what he sees as his right to speak out on what he considers
important policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief news conference Thursday after a meeting of his
commission, Butler said that some of Ritter's public assertions
were not true. He mentioned reports quoting Ritter saying UNSCOM
knew Iraq had all the components for several nuclear warheads and
did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anyone in this room actually think that if we had
information that Iraq had three partially fabricated nuclear
weapons that we would not have called that to the attention of the
International Atomic Energy Agency?'' Butler said. ``Or put it on
the table of the Security Council?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we would have,'' he said. ``Have you seen us do
that? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats and officials here said they had been mystified
by some of Ritter's actions, which they say could lead to more, not
fewer, problems with Iraq and which have provoked annoyance within
the Clinton administration as it struggles to hold together a
consensus against Iraqi noncompliance with disarmament resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Butler is to send a six-month report to the Security
Council detailing the many problems that have arisen during the
period, the worst being Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to stop spot
inspections. The Security Council responded Sept. 9 with a freeze
on sanctions reviews, effectively keeping Iraq indefinitely under
an embargo imposed after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Butler said his report would have ``no
rabbits pulled out of hats'' but will restate the obvious, grim
facts. It will also lay out once again _ at least the third time
this year _ the road map Iraqi President Saddam Hussein needs to
follow to have sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report will, again, set forth priority issues, the
necessary conditions for getting to the end of the chemical and
missile files,'' Butler said, ``and we'll call for Iraq to do a
whole lot better on the biology file.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Thursday, Butler dismissed reports that
European scientists had not found traces of the colorless nerve gas
VX on Iraqi warheads discovered this year, while U.S. military
experts had found some.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his concern was that Iraq had first said it made no
VX, then 212 quarts. UNSCOM discovered it had actually produced
four tons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real story about VX is not these warhead remnants and the
lab examination, because that's only a portion of the story
relating to weaponization,'' Butler said. ``The real story is that
Iraq never told us convincingly how much of the VX it made. We need
to know, what is the true end figure.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ The pitcher's wife will sing the national anthem. The
general manager's mother will sit with her son in his private box.
The first base coach will ride the Green Line to Kenmore Square,
and Boston's most famous Dominican will arrive proudly with his big
brother.
</P>
<P>
   The red, white, and blue bunting will be draped over box seat
railings almost as old as the Eck, Ted Williams's home run seat
will be freshly wiped, and Pesky's Pole should sparkle like gold in
the late-afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   October baseball returns this afternoon to Fenway Park with Game
3 of the American League Division Series. Bret Saberhagen will toe
the rubber, Lynn Saberhagen will take the mike, Mary Duquette will
beam at her son Dan, Dave Jauss will pocket his subway token, Pedro
Martinez will tip his cap to his brother Ramon, and the Red Sox
faithful, their worry lines for a change dwarfed by the upturned
curves of their smiles, will rise as one to celebrate that the Olde
Towne Team has a place in the playoffs for the first time since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians, a/k/a defending American League
champions, will be here, too, which is why, shortly after
Saberhagen's first pitch to Kenny Lofton, the euphoria of the
moment undoubtedly will give way to the anxiety that runs as deep
here as the Quabbin Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams, now just outside the big city in Norwood, has
been here only two years, so he still can't fathom why, in a
best-of-five series tied at a game apiece, so many people are
already fretting about a worst-case scenario _ namely, that by the
time the twilight shadows fade to black, the Red Sox will be on the
brink of elimination and Williams will have no choice but to call
on Martinez to man the ramparts for Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose Friday against Connecticut's Charles Nagy, Williams
said, that will not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete Schourek's going to start the fourth game,'' said
Williams, who stood in line at the neighborhood McDonald's for a
double cheeseburger before appearing at an off-day press conference
at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to make sure no one misinterpreted his meaning, Williams
restated his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro's not going to pitch Saturday,'' Williams said. ``He's
not pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't pitched with three days' rest this season. If it was
your son out there and he'd thrown 3,000-plus pitches and averaged
115-plus pitches a game and his career is on the line and you
panicked and pitched him too soon and hurt him, I don't think you
would be too happy. I know I wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense to the scouts who have reported that Martinez has
pitched tired in the second half of the season. Makes sense to
Indians manager Mike Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know their reasons,'' Hargrove said, ``but I do know
Jimy Williams is a good baseball man and knows his club very well.
For Jimy to say that, he's got a very, very good reason for it. He
knows his club better than any of the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense to Duquette, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy's looking forward to a great start from Saberhagen,''
Duquette said of the 34-year-old righthander who as a 21-year-old
in 1985 won the seventh game of the World Series the day after
celebrating the birth of his first son, Drew, and this season is
2-0 against the Indians, allowing just a run in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy's anticipating the team will be up, 2-1,'' Duquette said,
``and in a position to clinch the outcome on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, the lefthander who arrived almost as an afterthought
in August, when everybody else the Red Sox auditioned as a
bottom-of-the-rotation starter had flamed out, said he appreciated
Williams's show of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the confidence,'' said Schourek, who resembles
``Seinfeld's'' Kramer but for reasons he can't explain has been
called ``Yogi Bear'' by Martinez ever since he beat Tampa Bay 10
days ago for his first win with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what he is thinking,'' Schourek said of
Williams's insistence that Martinez will not go again unless there
is a Game 5. ``Obviously, I'm not a No. 1, but I give us a chance
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of elbow problems that have plagued him the last three
years, Schourek no longer is a No. 1. But he was the ace of the
Reds in 1995 when they went to the National League playoffs, and he
faced much greater uncertainty before his first postseason start
that year than he does now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in LA to play the Dodgers, and on the eve of that
series, they were expecting a verdict in the first O.J. (Simpson)
trial,'' he said. ``They were going to cancel the game if it didn't
go the way it did, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to get any big crowds of people, obviously.
So I had that anxiety, on top of getting mentally prepared for my
first postseason game ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek was equal to the task. He beat the Dodgers, 7-2, then
went on to face the Braves in the NL Championship Series, giving up
a total of two runs in two no-decisions against Atlanta, where
Williams was third base coach at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it goes back to the way I pitched against the Braves,''
Schourek said. ``Maybe he saw what I did under pressure, that I
didn't rattle.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Williams just wishes people would put first things
first. And that means Saberhagen. Martinez may be Boston's
wealthiest player, but he's not the club's only money pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel good about Saberhagen,'' Williams said. ``We will go
as long with him as it takes for us to win that baseball game.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Health-maintenance organizations, once thought to
be the hope for the future of Medicare, said Thursday that they
would drop tens of thousands of beneficiaries next year, in part
because the Clinton administration had refused to let them raise
premiums or cut prescription-drug coverage for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the industry said that health plans were
withdrawing from 300 counties in 18 states because medical costs
were higher than expected, while Medicare payments were lower than
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the Department of Health and Human Services
rejected a last-minute lobbying blitz by HMOs, which had asked for
permission to increase premiums, raise copayments or limit certain
costly benefits like prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Friday is the deadline for HMOs to say whether they will
participate in Medicare. Karen Ignagni, president of the American
Association of Health Plans, a trade association for the industry,
said that ``175,000 to 200,000 beneficiaries are being dropped'' as
a result of decisions already made. ``And in the next two days,''
she said, ``we expect a number of announcements that will push the
total over 250,000 and potentially to 300,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Such cutbacks would affect one in 20 Medicare beneficiaries now
enrolled in HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers dropped from HMOs have two basic options. They can go
into the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program, with or
without supplementary insurance to cover extra items. Or they can
enroll in another HMO if one is available where they live.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the elderly said the turmoil and uncertainty in
this market could deter people from joining HMOs in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Matheis, a lobbyist for the American Association of
Retired Persons, said: ``HMOs have left the Medicare market in the
past, but far fewer people were affected. The knowledge that HMOs
can and do leave the program may make people a little wary about
going into these plans in the future. Beneficiaries do not want to
be changing health plans every year. They like stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ms. Matheis said: ``Many of these beneficiaries will
have higher out-of-pocket medical costs if they have to buy
supplementary insurance, and they may not have coverage of
prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The association, using government data, said Medicare
beneficiaries paid an average of $104 a month last year for the
supplementary insurance, known as Medigap policies. Medigap plans
covering drugs often cost much more.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Rights Center,
a consumer group in New York City, said, ``Beneficiaries leaving
HMOs may be unable to get insurance to fill gaps in the traditional
Medicare program because of their health, their age, the cost or
other factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare finances health care for 39 million people who are
elderly or disabled. About 5.9 million of them are in HMOs, and the
number has been rising rapidly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Ms. Ignagni said that Aetna, Prudential, Allina, Anthem,
Pacificare, Humana, Intermountain Health Care and other HMOs were
scaling back their Medicare operations.
</P>
<P>
   Allina, for example, said that it was ending HMO coverage for
10,000 of the 35,000 people in its Medicare health plans in
Minnesota. ``Reimbursement rates don't cover our costs,'' said
Sarah Stoesz, a spokeswoman for Allina.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, United Healthcare Corp., based in Minnetonka,
Minn., said Thursday that it was withdrawing from 86 of the 206
counties where it has Medicare health plans, in Colorado, Florida,
Texas, Illinois, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, among other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``That affects 13 percent of our total Medicare membership _
59,000 of the company's 440,000 Medicare beneficiaries,'' said Sue
Busch, a spokeswoman for United, which has participated in Medicare
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Other Medicare HMOs are pulling out of counties in Washington,
Oregon, Delaware, California, Virginia, Maryland, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs submitted their bids for Medicare business on May 1. The
government issued new regulations for the program on June 26. In
the last two weeks, HMOs said they should be allowed to revise
their proposals to account for renewed medical inflation and for
the cost of complying with the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Thursday, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of
the Medicare agency, told Ms. Ignagni, ``We do not believe that
your proposal to allow plans to increase their premiums and
cost-sharing and reduce benefits would be in the best interests of
our Medicare beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's actions come after a yearlong battle in which HMOs
have resisted President Clinton's proposals for new laws to define
patients' rights and administration officials have repeatedly
denounced HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs withdrawing from Medicare must notify beneficiaries in
writing by Nov. 2. Some patients will need to find other doctors.

DARRYL STRAWBERRY DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER OF THE COLON 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Darryl Strawberry, the 36-year-old Yankees
outfielder, was diagnosed with cancer of the colon Thursday.
Doctors say his prognosis for recovery is excellent, according to
Charisse Strawberry, the player's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry hopes to have surgery Saturday, or Monday at the
latest, for the removal of a walnut-sized tumor, and according to
his wife, doctors at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New
York are confident he will be able to resume his career next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's teammates, who will play Game 3 of their American
League Division Series against Texas here Friday night, were
informed of his condition by Manager Joe Torre before an afternoon
workout here Thursday. Torre's voice cracked as he spoke, and
several players began weeping.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the Yankees emerged from their clubhouse and
went through their workout in almost complete silence, the only
sound being that of bats striking balls during batting practice.
Their communication was inferred.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher David Cone, Strawberry's longtime teammate with the Mets
in the past and now with the Yankees, stood alone, emotion covering
his face. ``Darryl is going to have a lot of confusion and he is
going to be scared,'' said Cone. ``We are all scared. But the
prognosis is good. From what we hear, there has been early
detection and there is an excellent chance of full recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Yankees' owner George Steinbrenner said: ``I
have always said that this is a good man of great character and
this has certainly proved to be true. He is facing a serious crisis
and his concern is for his teammates. This is extremely upsetting
to me and it really shows that baseball is only a small part of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, expected to be replaced on the team's roster by the
outfielder Ricky Ledee, will remain in the hospital for six days
following his surgery. According to his wife, doctors believe the
tumor is of Grade A or Grade B variety, rather than the more
serious Grade D, and that a colostomy _ removal of part of the
colon _ won't be required. Charisse Strawberry, speaking in a
telephone interview from the Strawberry's New Jersey home, said
doctors believe the tumor has existed for about two years,
developing from a polyp; and that regular chemotherapy treatment
won't be necessary. They added that Strawberry would need only a
one-time radiation treatment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Eric Davis, a longtime friend of Strawberry's since both grew up
in Los Angeles and, recently, an outfielder with the Baltimore
Orioles, was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1997, and a third of
his colon was removed. He rebounded this year to rank among the
American League batting leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry has evolved in his adult life under the constant
scrutiny of New York baseball fans and media. Selected by the Mets
as the first pick in the 1980 draft, Strawberry ascended to the
majors three years later amid great expectations, which he seemed
destined to fulfill. He hit 26 home runs in his rookie season and
played center stage when the Mets won the World Series in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But his inability to cope with the success led to problems with
drugs and alcohol. Within two years after Strawberry left the Mets
in 1990, he had become a shell of the player he once was, riddled
with injuries and overwhelmed by his personal problems. Strawberry
was suspended from baseball in 1995 for substance abuse, and he
lost what remained of his fortune after being charged by the
Internal Revenue Service with owing substantial back taxes. At 33
years old, Strawberry was an untouchable in baseball, his career
seemingly over.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner agreed to give Strawberry another chance, however,
and in 1996, he hit 11 home runs in 202 at-bats, re-establishing
himself. He had become more devoted to his faith and was a member
of Alcoholics Anonymous. A knee injury sidelined him for virtually
the entire 1997 season, but this year, Strawberry slugged 24 home
runs in only 296 at-bats, and he had become a quiet leader, deeply
respected by teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the season, Strawberry's playing time decreased, and
Torre had a sense something other than a chronic knee problem was
bothering Strawberry. In fact, Strawberry suffered from abdominal
pains for about two months, pain that he didn't reveal to teammates
or the club's medical staff.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry wanted to remain on the roster for the playoffs,
wanted to remain a productive member of the lineup. But on Monday,
he decided to tell the Yankees of his pain.
</P>
<P>
   A CAT scan performed Wednesday afternoon revealed a mass in his
colon, and Strawberry told Torre he wouldn't be able to play in
Game 2 of the Division Series, but that he hoped that after a
colonoscopy Thursday, doctors would clear him to play in Game 3
Friday. Following the procedure Thursday morning, however, a
physician informed the Strawberrys that the walnut-sized tumor
found in his colon was cancerous.

 &HT;    UNION AND NAVISTAR OFFICIALS REACH TENTATIVE AGREEMENT
 &HT;    By Don Baker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD - After about 19 hours of non-stop negotiations that
stretched six
</P>
<P>
   hours past a strike deadline, union and Navistar officials
reached a tentative
</P>
<P>
   agreement Thursday morning for a new labor contract at the
company's
</P>
<P>
   Springfield truck processing center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the agreement,'' said Steve Shelton, United
Auto Workers
</P>
<P>
   International representative from the Dayton regional office.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Rosswurm, Navistar spokeswoman in Springfield, said the
company also
</P>
<P>
   was happy a tentative agreement was reached, but she declined to
discuss
</P>
<P>
   details of the five-year pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's the best agreement we could reach under the
circumstances,''
</P>
<P>
   said Charlie Bush, UAW Local 402 president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a ratification vote has been set for 9 a.m. Sunday to
allow the 140
</P>
<P>
   or so workers his local represents at the processing center to
decide on final
</P>
<P>
   acceptance of the agreement. Tim Marshall, UAW Local 658
president, said a
</P>
<P>
   ratification vote has not yet been set for the 10 workers his
local represents
</P>
<P>
   at the processing center.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the two UAW locals had given union leaders permission
to strike
</P>
<P>
   Navistar's truck sales processing center if contract talks
failed. A strike
</P>
<P>
   deadline was set for midnight Wednesday by the UAW Local 402 and
Local 658.
</P>
<P>
   Both contracts expired Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Local 658 represents the center's office workers and Local 402
represents the
</P>
<P>
   production and maintenance workers. The center's workers bargain
separately
</P>
<P>
   from the main workforce at the assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said formal negotiations begain in August and worked
through local
</P>
<P>
   grievance issues before moving the discussions to non-economic
issues on Sept.
</P>
<P>
   1. Those non-economic issues were agreed to before the two sides
began
</P>
<P>
   discussing the economic aspects of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we were hung up on for a while; we'd move a penny
one way and
</P>
<P>
   then a penny the other,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   After talks hung up on economic issues late Wednesday night, the
strike
</P>
<P>
   deadline came and passed. ``We extended talks until 6 a.m. and
we got an
</P>
<P>
   agreement at about five till six,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides remained at the bargaining table into the early
morning
</P>
<P>
   hours, third-shift workers at the processing center were on
alert to leave if
</P>
<P>
   talks broke down, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the company held firm on its positions
until beginning
</P>
<P>
   to show some flexibility late into the negotiations, helping an
agreement to
</P>
<P>
   be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the company was firm on their positions, they were also
helpful and
</P>
<P>
   moved to make the agreement possible,'' Shelton said. ``It's a
nice financial
</P>
<P>
   package with a lot of gains. In exchange, the company got some
work rule
</P>
<P>
   amendments.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the workers at the processing center are skilled
trade diesel
</P>
<P>
   mechanics, Shelton said. The deal struck early Thursday will
keep those
</P>
<P>
   workers the highest paid in their field in the area and with the
best
</P>
<P>
   benefits, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The truck sales processing center is located next to Navistar's
truck
</P>
<P>
   assembly plant on U.S. Route 68, but is a separate operation
from that plant.
</P>
<P>
   The center is used for the customizing of Navistar's trucks,
with workers
</P>
<P>
   adding special features requested by customers.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the processing center went on strike for nearly three
weeks in
</P>
<P>
   1985. During that time, the union claimed the company used
``union-busting''
</P>
<P>
   techniques by bringing in temporary employees to work at the
center.

TCU'S WILLIAMS PROVING HIS WORTH AT FULLBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By TERRANCE HARRIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU fullback Lance Williams remembered the
hurt about midway through the third quarter of Saturday night's
game against Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   He also recalled his vow.
</P>
<P>
   After watching helplessly on the sidelines two weeks earlier as
the Horned Frogs faltered during the waning moments of a 10-9 loss
against Oklahoma, he promised to make a difference in a close
situation the next time the opportunity arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when we got to that third quarter and had fallen behind, I
was like `here we go again,'' he said. ``Something in me just
sparked and made me kind of come on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs were able to rally from an 11-point deficit and snag a
35-34 stunning victory largely behind Williams' effort on offense.
Time and again the 6-foot-1, 228-pound senior leveled penetrating
Air Force tacklers to spring tailback LaDainian Tomlinson.
</P>
<P>
   He even displayed his worth as a rusher, stumbling then rumbling
13 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter, which helped pull
the Frogs within 31-28 with 6 minutes, 5 seconds left in the
quarter. Williams, who in one game eclipsed his 18 rushing yards in
1997, finished with 49 yards on the ground and 15 knockdown blocks
on the day.
</P>
<P>
   TCU coach Dennis Franchione deemed Williams the game's unsung
hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really came through in a big way,'' said Franchione, whose
2-1 Frogs take on Vanderbilt tomorrow at Amon Carter Stadium.
``Lance made some big plays for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But before Saturday night, Williams wasn't even a starter in the
Frogs' backfield after splitting time at fullback the past two
seasons. Williams and fellow senior Lou Porch were demoted during
two-a-days in favor of the smaller Tomlinson, who was moved from
tailback.
</P>
<P>
   In Franchione's offense, the fullback blocks according to the
reads defenses give them. Williams and Porch had become accustomed
to the isolation blocks on the linebackers, which were required in
the old offense. As a result, both natural fullbacks sat as
Tomlinson attempted to grow into the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt me real bad coming into my last year,'' said Williams,
a former All-State fullback in Georgia. ``But I talked with my
parents and my older brother about it, and they helped me to
continue to just fight for my job.''
</P>
<P>
   After playing special teams in the season opener at Iowa State,
Williams was put in at fullback on four snaps against Oklahoma. He
proved to the coaching staff during that brief appearance he was
ready to reclaim his starting role. On one particular play, he
unleashed a block, which sprung tailback Basil Mitchell for what
would have been a long touchdown were it not for an out-of-bounds
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think those four snaps contributed to the fact
they made me the starting fullback,'' said Williams, who has gained
59 yards and one touchdown on 13 carries this season. ``I just
wanted to prove to the coaching staff that they could count on
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione now says when he moved Tomlinson up and Williams and
Porch out, it was only done as a temporary fix. He said the plan
all along was to get Williams and Porch comfortable and put
Tomlinson back at his more natural tailback spot.
</P>
<P>
   The move appeared timely on Saturday, as the Frogs were able to
put a fresh tailback in the game once Mitchell wore down. The
result: A 99-yard, two-touchdown rushing day for Tomlinson and 256
team rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it did was keep two fresh tailbacks in the game,''
Franchione said. ``And that really strengthens our team and the
things we can do late in the game on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   For Williams it serves as a reprieve as he begins to distance
himself from his recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, you feel like they should have believed in you from
the beginning,'' Williams said. ``But I kind of wanted to prove
myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt all along I was the man for the job, but obviously I
hadn't shown that to the coaches. Now, I just have to make the best
of this opportunity.''

   GREENSPAN DEFENDS ROLE OF FED TO SAVE HEDGE FUND
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, defended the
central bank's role in averting the collapse of Long-Term Capital
Management, saying it had acted out of concern for the stability of
the financial markets rather than a desire to assist the hedge
firm's owners.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the House Banking Committee, Greenspan said it was
the central bank's responsibility to play a role in addressing a
crisis whose effects could extend far beyond the fate of Long-Term
Capital's owners, investors and lenders.
</P>
<P>
   IMF IS RECEIVING HARSH CRITICISM

<P>
   At the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the

the monetary fund and the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   RUBIN CALLS FOR FISCAL OPENNESS
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the United States would
press for ``a new openness in international finance'' that would
require private financial institutions to disclose far more
information about their loans around the world and force investors
to pay their share of the cost of bailing out troubled nations.
</P>
<P>
   VENTURE TO DEVELOP IMPOTENCE DRUG
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Icos rose $1.625, or 9.15 percent, to $19.375, after
the biotechnology company and Eli Lilly said they would form a
joint venture to develop and sell an impotence drug that some
evidence suggests could be superior to Pfizer's successful Viagra.
The two companies will share the marketing and sales of the drug in
North America and Europe and split the profits 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS DECLINE SHARPLY IN EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   European stock markets plunged, as investors across the
Continent seemed to conclude that they are no longer insulated from
the economic crises rocking other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   BOND YIELDS DECLINE TO 4.88 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices surged, and the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond fell to 4.88 percent from the previous 31-year low of 4.97
percent set on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   CHRYSLER SALES SOARED LAST MONTH

   EXPORTS SLUMPED IN SEPTEMBER
</P>

   Manufacturing weakened in the United States in September for a
fourth consecutive month, as exports slumped, while prices paid by
industrial companies fell to the lowest level in almost half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs DROPPING BENEFICIARIES
</P>
<P>
   Health maintenance organizations said they would drop tens of
thousands of beneficiaries next year, in part because the
government has not let them raise premiums or cut prescription drug
coverage for the elderly.

<P>
   The Japanese central bank's quarterly survey of corporate

   POLAND RECOVERS FROM ITS TROUBLES
</P>
<P>
   When Russia went into a tailspin earlier this year, Poland's
stock market crashed. Investors pulled $1 billion in short-term
capital out of the country and prepared for Poland to descend into
the maelstrom. But the panic has receded and Poland is moving
forward. Although the Poland stock market fell Thursday, it is up
4.8 percent over the last month.

CLINTON OFFERS JONES $700,000 IN LATEST BID FOR A SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton raised his offer to $700,000
Thursday to settle the sexual misconduct lawsuit against him by
Paula Jones, who was considering whether to accept it, lawyers
involved the case said.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was relayed to Mrs. Jones at her California home
Thursday morning. Her lawyers had previously asked the White House
for $1 million to have her withdraw the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations to settle the lawsuit that led to the president
being put at risk of impeachment have gone back and forth in the
last several days solely over the question of money.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest round of negotiations, which began on Sept. 8,
Mrs. Jones dropped her demand for an apology or some acknowledgment
that her complaint about Clinton was valid. She sued the president
in 1994, saying that three years earlier when he was governor of
Arkansas and she was a state clerical worker, he invited her to a
Little Rock hotel room where he dropped his trousers and made a
coarse sexual request.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton disputed her account, although he never denied that he
may have had her summoned to his hotel room for an introduction.
All previous attempts to negotiate a settlement had foundered on
her insistence on some statement of regret or contrition from the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers last week made a counter-offer of $500,000,
which the Jones camp immediately rejected as too little.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit in April, writing
that even if her accusations were true, they did not constitute a
case of sexual harassment or a deprivation of her constitutional
rights as she asserted. But an appeals court has scheduled Oct. 20
to hear Mrs. Jones' arguments that the lawsuit should be reinstated
because Clinton lied when he told her lawyers last January that he
had not engaged in sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has since admitted a sexual liaison with Ms. Lewinsky,
and White House lawyers fear that his reversal may be enough to
have the lawsuit reinstated. White House advisers have said they
would like to settle the Jones lawsuit to help them deal with the
impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   The House is considering whether to impeach Clinton after
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, charged that he
committed perjury when he told the Jones lawyers in a deposition
that he had not engaged in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
Starr also asserted that Clinton committed perjury again when he
repeated that position before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement of the lawsuit would not necessarily help Clinton
legally, his advisers have said. But they believe that if the
lawsuit were removed from the equation, it could bolster their
arguments to Congress that his deceptions were minor and only
constituted an understandable effort to conceal an improper sexual
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement would give Mrs. Jones some guaranteed money after
four years of grueling litigation. Any money received in a
settlement would, however, have to be divided among her and her
lawyers.

AIKMAN NOT DEFINITE FOR NEXT GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Although Troy Aikman continues to insist he will
return for the Oct. 11 game against the Carolina Panthers, coach
Chan Gailey is not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take a miracle for him to be ready by Carolina _ it'd
be amazing,'' Gailey said after practice yesterday. ``Maybe he can
be the third (quarterback) and hand off if we got in a bind late.
But as I see it right now, it'd be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has watched Aikman throw to wide receivers in practice
this week, but Gailey has not talked to him. Aikman, who fractured
his left collarbone in the first half of a Sept. 13 game against
the Denver Broncos, was expected to miss four to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Since his rehab began, Aikman has circled the Panthers game as
his return date. He began throwing for the first time last week.
And he is expected to get an X-ray on his collarbone Monday to see
how he is progressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to think he can come back early,'' Gailey said, ``I
want him to try to make it if he can. If so, that'd be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has said that he does not expect his bone to be healed
completely if he comes back earlier than team trainer Jim Maurer
expects. Gailey said Aikman would probably have to practice the
entire week to show he has no limitations before Gailey would
insert him into the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is optimistic,'' Maurer said. ``We just have to wait
and see. When you say four to eight weeks, it could mean four weeks
or it could mean eight.''
</P>
<P>
   If Aikman can't play against the Panthers, the Cowboys' next
game is at Chicago on Oct. 18. With a bye week coming up Oct. 25,
Gailey could hold Aikman out until the club's Nov. 2 game at
Philadelphia. That would give Aikman seven weeks from the time of
the injury to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is also a temptation to play'' Aikman, Gailey said.
``There are a lot of things to consider, and we will take it all
under consideration when the time comes.'' &QL; 
BRIEFLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders fell awkwardly and sprained his left ankle in
practice. The Cowboys listed him as probable on the NFL injury
report.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin is not on the injury report, but he has had some
soreness in his right ankle and did not participate in some
portions of practice yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith (groin), Leon Lett (knee) and Daryl Johnston
(swelling in knee) returned to practice yesterday after missing
Wednesday's workout.

HEDGE-FUND WIZARD OR WALL STREET GAMBLER? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (lb) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John William Meriwether was the consummate trader. He
knew when to hold, he knew when to fold. But as the chairman of
Long-Term Capital Management LP, he failed to recognize that his
luck and his money were fast running out.
</P>
<P>
   Last week they did run out, as a consortium of big international
banks and brokerage firms agreed to inject $3.65 billion into
Long-Term Capital, the giant hedge fund that Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, worried would disrupt the
global financial markets if it failed.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet, introverted man with a head for numbers and a love of
chance, Meriwether by all accounts was deemed most likely to
succeed by those who worked with him over the years. A student of
the bond markets, he knew their anomalies _ and how to play them _
better than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But in his previous work as a bond-trading star at Salomon
Brothers, Meriwether had something he would sorely come to need at
Long-Term Capital: the backing of a big firm with the deep pockets
that can let a trader ride out almost any market storm.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the very public bailout of recent weeks, Meriwether
has remained a man of mystery. He has given only a couple of
interviews over the years and is rarely seen on the celebrity
charity circuit in New York, unlike other men and women of fortune
on Wall Street. He has even bought up most of the photographs taken
of him in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   So what kind of a man is Meriwether? And how could such a
reputedly brilliant trader who had chalked up so many successes
over the last 25 years wind up nearly bankrupting his firm?
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether is not talking about his past, present or future. But
conversations with people who have worked with him in his years on
Wall Street reveal a man revered by those around him, who
nonetheless remained remote, even lonely; a man always hunting for
the edge that would make his bets _ whether in bonds, at the race
track or on a Chicago Cubs game _ more calculated than wild.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man whom co-workers describe as scrupulously honest, yet
who has been associated with two of the biggest disasters in Wall
Street history: the 1991 attempt by a Meriwether underling to rig
the market in two-year Treasury notes and now the fall of Long-Term
Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   People who have never met Meriwether may remember him as the man
featured at the start of Michael Lewis' book ``Liar's Poker.'' As
recounted there, Meriwether supposedly challenged John Gutfreund,
then the chairman of Salomon Brothers, to up the ante from $1
million to $10 million in a game of ``I dare you'' played with
serial numbers on a dollar bill. Gutfreund, no pansy himself,
walked away, according to the book.
</P>
<P>
   This story almost certainly helped forge the romantic view of
Meriwether as a Wall Street cowboy, willing to make a bet that even
his rich boss shrank from. The only trouble is, it never happened.
</P>
<P>
   According to people who were there, it was not Meriwether who
made the challenge. It was John O'Grady, a gregarious and blustery
Salomon partner who ran technical support for the traders. O'Grady
died in 1989. (Lewis, who is traveling, was not available for
comment.)
</P>
<P>
   According to those who know him well, the story is also out of
character, because Meriwether made only the most calculated of
bets, both personally and for the firm.
</P>
<P>
   He loved to bet on Chicago Cubs games, for example, but would
not do so until he had first received the weather report to see
which way and how hard the wind was blowing at Wrigley Field. That
way he could better guess how the Cubs home-run hitters might do
against the opposing pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These weren't big bets,'' said a person who had knowledge of
them at the time. ``He just liked to have a lot of things he could
analyze.'' More often than not, he came away a winner.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   From Golf Caddie to Club Owner
</P>
<P>
   Born in Chicago in 1947, Meriwether grew up on the city's South
Side. Like another famed money manager _ Peter Lynch of Fidelity _
Meriwether caddied at a nearby golf course to earn money. Friends
believe Meriwether is an only child.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he received a bachelor's degree in business from
Northwestern University. He earned an MBA from the University of
Chicago in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The next year he moved to New York, a 27-year-old recruit in
Salomon Brothers' vaunted management-training program. Another
member of that program recalls that Meriwether was friendless in
New York and roomed at a Manhattan athletic club. His first
assignment was on the desk that arranged financing for the firm's
customers, called the repurchase or repo department.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that Meriwether first made his mark. The desk was a
fairly limited operation and acted as a service function for the
government bond desk. ``It had never been a money-making
proposition,'' said a person who was there at the time. ``But John
Meriwether turned it into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether's second assignment was to trade short-term agency
securities, such as those backed by the Federal Intermediate Credit
Bank. Aided by what people who worked alongside him called a
near-photographic memory, Meriwether took this backwater of the
bond market and made it spectacularly profitable.
</P>
<P>
   He understood better than others the proper differences, or
spreads, between the yields on agencies and those on Treasuries,
which are backed by the full faith and credit of the government.
</P>
<P>
   In a precursor to this summer's events, spreads on agency
securities began to widen dramatically in the mid-1970s. What
caused the change? A near-bankrupt New York City propelled
investors out of anything that looked at all risky for the relative
safety of Treasuries. Meriwether knew two things: that the widening
in the spreads was an aberration and that the agency securities he
traded, while not formally backed by the government, were still
good.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. ``He bought every single one he could, with the
acknowledgment of the senior partners,'' recalled a former
associate. ``He rode out the bad bumps. Boy, did it work well.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the late 1970s, Meriwether had an even better idea.
Through dealing with Salomon Brothers' customers, he saw the
beginnings of a business that would prove extremely profitable for
the firm. It was the bond arbitrage business, the ability to
capitalize on small discrepancies in prices between specific bonds
and the newly developed futures contracts that were based on them.
The business was in the infant stages _ a bank in Cleveland was
good at it and some of the Wall Street dealers were getting better.
Why not Salomon Brothers?
</P>
<P>
   He approached the firm's partners _ it was still a partnership,
not yet a public company. ``Why should we be executing these trades
for some of these new arb firms when we can do them ourselves?'' he
asked. Meriwether was given the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Deja Vu, of Sorts, but Different
</P>
<P>
   The story of Meriwether's first home run on the arbitrage desk
is eerily similar to the Long-Term Capital story now unfolding. But
there is a big difference: Meriwether did the bailing out then and
he _ as the banks and Wall Street firms that poured billions into
Long-Term Capital now hope to do _ later capitalized on the
comeback of a troubled portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   A big player in the Treasury futures market was a firm called
J.F. Eckstein &AMP; Co., which had made a big bet that a disparity in
prices between Treasury bill futures and the underlying security
would converge. But in a brief two weeks, the prices of the bills
rocketed. Eckstein, who expected prices to fall, was quickly
depleting capital, struggling to meet margin calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first real period of turmoil in the fledgling
financial futures markets, and Meriwether understood it,'' Eckstein
recalled Thursday. Almost alone in the market as a willing buyer,
Meriwether took over a good part of Eckstein's portfolio. ``The
Treasury bills loosened up and the prices converged,'' one trader
said. ``Meriwether made a fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years later Meriwether finds himself in a similar
position. Unlike Eckstein, however, Meriwether is still running his
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, it is easy to see how Meriwether might later have
been felled by thinking that when spreads widen, they always come
back. After all, with spreads on emerging market debt, junk bonds
and mortgage-backed securities much wider this spring than in
years, they had to narrow, didn't they? Once they did, anyone
willing to take the gamble would generate a windfall.
</P>
<P>
   There is one big difference, however. At Salomon Brothers, when
Meriwether asked for the necessary capital to make a huge trade, or
additional money to cover it when it temporarily lost value, he
always got it. At Long-Term Capital Management he was not so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when he went to his clients in early September with hat
in hand, he did so still a staunch believer that his money-losing
trades would come back.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the paper losses in these roughly $90 billion in
positions had eroded his capital to just $600 million from $4.8
billion at the start of 1998. Convinced the trades would work out
in the end, he asked for more money to shore up his capital and
allow him to keep the positions. Salomon Brothers might have given
it to him. But this time, he was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A Natural Gambler, but a Careful One
</P>
<P>
   Back at Salomon Brothers, Meriwether made partner in 1980. As
his prominence in the firm grew, so did his ability to take greater
risk. Indeed, he thrived on it, former colleagues say. ``He liked
to be involved with chance,'' one said. ``But it was always
calculated.''
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether was a natural gambler. He would take his group to
Atlantic City, N.J., roughly twice a year. Department meetings
would sometimes be held at the Meadowlands race track in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether's love of horses extends beyond the track. He houses
several thoroughbreds on his property in the northern reaches of
Westchester County. And he is a trustee of the New York Racing
Association, which operates Belmont Park, Aqueduct and Saratoga
Springs. Meriwether's wife, the former Mimi Murray, is a rider who
trained for the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Salomon Brothers was bought by Phillip Brothers, a
commodity trading firm known on the Street as PhiBro. Some sources
who were at Salomon Brothers at the time say one reason it took
place was that top partners worried about what might happen if
Meriwether's big trades went bad, wiping out the partnership. With
the takeover, their own money was no longer on the line backing his
bets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Meriwether's bigger and bigger bets kept paying off during
the 1980s, generating bigger and bigger profits for the firm.
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards, Meriwether did not earn an outsized
paycheck at Salomon Brothers. In 1989 he took home roughly $8
million; the next year he received $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, disaster struck. A trader on Meriwether's desk,
Paul Mozer, tried to corner the market in an issue of two-year U.S.
Treasury notes. While Meriwether reported the infractions to his
superiors, the violations were not reported to the Treasury until
much later.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal shook Salomon Brothers to its core. Gutfreund and
Thomas Strauss, the president, left when Warren Buffett, a big
owner of Salomon stock, took over to help clean up the mess.
Meriwether resigned. He later settled an administrative proceeding
with the Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission in which he neither
admitted nor denied that he had been negligent as a supervisor. He
agreed to a three-month suspension and a $50,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Meriwether was quite wealthy. But it was his
investment in his new firm, Long-Term Capital Management, that
brought him true riches. Although his net worth is a secret, former
colleagues estimate that at the peak, he was probably worth more
than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   One Calculation Left Undone
</P>
<P>
   For years, Meriwether lived humbly. From 1981 until 1993, home
was the same small apartment on York Avenue, on Manhattan's upper
East Side.
</P>
<P>
   While he lived relatively modestly, he had expensive tastes in
golf clubs, joining three of the most prestigious in the United
States: Shinnecock Hills on eastern Long Island, Winged Foot Golf
Club in Westchester County and Cypress Point, near Pebble Beach,
Calif. He is said to shoot in the 70s. He even owns a golf course
in Waterville, Ireland, with some of his partners.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether is a deeply private man who lets in only a handful of
people. These people are, in return, very protective. ``He is a
very quiet person, even introverted,'' said one former Salomon
partner.
</P>
<P>
   At Salomon, he was known to be always available to people who
wanted to bounce an idea off him. ``One of the reasons he inspired
the loyalty he did was that he would not try to take the credit,''
said Stephen Modzelewski, a former colleague of Meriwether who now
runs a hedge fund. ``Usually the managers would steal the ideas of
subordinates.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his colleagues, his integrity was never in doubt. He would
suddenly remember, on occasion, to pay up on a bet long since
forgotten by everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned by the recent unfolding of events at Long-Term Capital
Management, former colleagues cannot help but wonder how such a bad
thing could have happened to such a brilliant person. Apparently
neither Meriwether nor any of his associates, including two Nobel
laureates in economics, had bothered to do a worst-case scenario on
their trades. If they had, these people believe, the firm would
never have been leveraged to the degree that it was.
</P>
<P>
   At Salomon, recalled a former trader there who worked with
Meriwether, ``we would always do what we called the
`yield-to-worst' calculation, which took into effect the world
going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, yield-to-worst was one calculation Meriwether either
ignored or forgot to do.

TOP HOUSE DEMOCRATS BACK LIMITED IMPEACHMENT PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic House leaders Thursday night brushed
aside any possibility of a quick censure deal for President
Clinton, and instead for the first time endorsed a proposal that
would allow party members to vote for a limited impeachment inquiry
next week, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would give Democratic representatives the freedom
to vote for an inquiry instead of hewing to a party line against an
investigation that could leave them vulnerable before the November
elections. The proposal would impose a time limit of one to three
months on the inquiry and restrict the investigation to Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky, according to several Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   While this means that most Democrats will oppose the
Republicans' impeachment inquiry, it nonetheless puts them on the
record as supporting a formal impeachment investigation into the
president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cannot be an open-ended fishing expedition,'' said Rep.
John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, at an afternoon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic measure is certain to fail in the
Republican-controlled Congress. Republicans on the Judiciary
Committee have already drafted a resolution that would place no
time limits or restrictions on an impeachment inquiry so that an
investigation could delve into matters like campaign finance or the
White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic leaders hope their proposal may keep as many as
50 Democrats from voting for the Republican proposal next week and
giving their opponents' plan a bipartisan endorsement. Some
Democrats, especially those in swing districts, are concerned about
looking too easy on Clinton prior to November's elections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Anticipating next week's vote, the president and Hillary Rodham
Clinton are making personal pleas to members, urging them to vote
against any sort of inquiry, according to some Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Mike McCurry said the White House
was still trying to carry the argument that there are ``no grounds
for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not get to everybody,'' he said. ``We don't pretend
that we will. But I think a lot of people, as they think about the
argument and think about the gravity of impeachment and think about
what the framers meant when they talked about high crimes and
misdemeanors will want to think twice about that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening, Clinton called Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., a
dean of the House, to gauge his feelings on the matter. And Mrs.
Clinton spoke with, among others, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and
Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., during a recent visit to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is our president,'' Kennedy said Thursday,
recounting Mrs. Clinton's conversation with him.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy said some Democrats are clearly worried about taking
too easy a stance about Clinton's behavior. ``One of the things
that's very destructive is the worry that many members have that
there's another shoe to drop, and they don't want to be caught
going back to their districts saying, `I voted against an inquiry
and look what they found,' '' Kennedy said. ``They're looking to
cover their political behinds.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on a
Republican-written resolution, modeled on the Watergate proposal,
that would officially open an impeachment inquiry. The committee
will also vote on the Democratic alternative. A full House vote on
both proposals should occur later next week.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Democratic investigator will argue before the
committee Monday that the evidence delivered by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr does not rise to the level of impeachment, Democratic
officials said. Republicans will argue that the evidence suggests
the opposite and that the matter should be investigated further.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats vehemently oppose the Republican resolution, saying it
contains no time limit and is far too broad. The resolution also
gives Democrats the power to subpoena witnesses and grants the
White House full representation during the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, Conyers asked that he ``limit both the time
and scope'' of the inquiry. But Hyde has said he is simply doing
what the Democrats have asked for all along, following the
Watergate model, which placed no restrictions on either the time or
the subject of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue that they must leave the window open in case
Starr sends another referral to the House. A bipartisan group of
members on the panel is starting a conversation with Starr to find
out whether he intends to send another referral.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day they want us to follow the Watergate model,'' said
Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla, a member of the panel. ``The next day
they say, `Don't follow the Watergate model.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Added his colleague Rep. Stephen Buyer, R-Ind., ``There is a
tremendous amount of double-speak going on. What's the purpose of
double-speak? To create diversion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, in what has become a familiar war of words over
Watergate, said Republicans are comparing apples to oranges and are
unfairly applying the Watergate standard to a scandal that is less
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an investigation into the wholesale subversion of
government involving multiple agencies, the FBI, the CIA and
others,'' Conyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has approved the release Friday of about 5,000
pages of supplemental evidence to the Starr report, including the
testimony of the president's secretary, Betty Currie, and the
transcripts of tapes between Ms. Lewinsky and her former friend,
Linda Tripp.

FAA ASKS WHETHER AIRLINERS CAN GET TOO OLD TO FLY SAFELY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration said on
Thursday that it would consider whether airliners can get too old
to fly, which would be a change from its longstanding belief that
jets are eternal if they are inspected often enough.
</P>
<P>
   As a first step, the agency said it would expand a program that
focuses on the problems of aging aircraft. That program, which has
been limited to a study of the skeleton and skin of aging aircraft,
was started after an accident in 1988 in which the fuselage of an
Aloha Airlines jetliner peeled apart like a sardine can.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Rodney Slater, the secretary of
transportation, announced a plan to evaluate nonstructural systems,
including wiring and hydraulic systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's U.S. fleet has an average age of nearly 16 years,''
Slater said. ``Ten years from now, a larger and older fleet will
have an average age of 18 to 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some planes are much older than 16. Northwest Airlines said
earlier this year that it expects to fly its DC-9's for 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   Once a plane has been manufactured, nearly all FAA requirements
are based on aircraft performance, with the agency ordering
inspection or repair after it gets reports from planes in the field
or in the shop that parts have deteriorated. This approach may not
suffice for wiring, though, because some wires are hard to see. And
even if the wires are visually inspected, deterioration is hard to
find, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Wiring in older planes has been under intense scrutiny by the
agency since the explosion of TWA Flight 800, a 25-year-old Boeing
747, off Long Island on July 17, 1996. The crash, which killed 230
people, led to the discovery of wiring problems in various older
planes.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Garvey, the administrator of the FAA, said the agency would
undertake a five-year study of older aircraft systems, in part to
determine ``whether or not there should be a life expectancy for
some of the wiring.'' In practice, experts say, if airlines had to
replace a lot of wiring on older planes it would be a death
sentence for the planes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few components automatically replaced at a certain
age is the commercial airline pilot; they have to retire at 60.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Ms. Garvey said it was not clear
where ``older'' began. Asked about Swissair Flight 111, a
7-year-old MD-11 that crashed off Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, she said
she was not clear whether planes that age would be covered by the
new program.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Garvey and other aviation officials confirmed on Thursday
that they were interested in whether mylar insulation used on that
plane may have encouraged the spread of fires in other accidents.
But a spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada,
which is in charge of the investigation of the Swissair crash, said
the Mylar insulation recovered from the plane did not show heat
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported on Thursday that investigators were
interested in the insulation blankets, although there is no
evidence that they played a role in the Swissair fire and
subsequent crash, which killed all 229 people aboard.

   The Boeing Company recommended a year ago that the blankets be
replaced at the next major maintenance overhaul. But Hans Klaus, a
spokesman for Swissair, said that the plane that crashed had not
had a major overhaul since that recommendation was made, and that
it had its last overhaul in August 1997, 13 months before the
crash. Replacement of the blankets has not been required by the FAA
or any other agency, Klaus said, adding that Swissair has not
decided whether to replace the blankets on its other planes.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 large airlines that fly MD-11's and other McDonnell
Douglas planes began a two-day meeting on Thursday in Long Beach,
Calif., where the planes were manufactured. They are going over the
approximately 20 outstanding recommendations from the manufacturer
on smoke and fire problems to determine whether any of the work
should be accelerated in response to the Swissair crash, said a
Boeing spokesman, John Dern.
</P>
<P>
   In Halifax, Nova Scotia, a spokesman for Canada's Transportation
Safety Board, Jim Harris, said that some of the blankets had been
recovered but that they showed no fire damage. Less than 10 percent
of the plane has been recovered so far, and very little of that was
from the cockpit area, which is what most interests the
investigators, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said salvage workers in the Canadian and United States
navies planned to begin raising small pieces of wreckage in larger
batches soon in an effort to recover more before the weather made
such work impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Divers have recovered a computer that controls one of the three
engines, he said, and investigators have sent it to Pratt &AMP;
Whitney, in East Hartford, Conn., in the hope that technicians
there can retrieve data from its memory chips.

FAMILY AFFAIR FOR THE SABERHAGENS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston's Game 3 starter Brett Saberhagen will share the
field at Fenway Park today with his wife, Lynn, who will sing the
national anthem before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably be more nervous for her than for me,''
Saberhagen said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Mrs. Saberhagen might have had the better season.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never got booed,'' Saberhagen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox will tap into their history for the rest of the
pregame ceremonies. The ceremonial opening pitches will be thrown
out by Boston hitting coach and former left-field star Jim Rice and
by former Red Sox third baseman Frank Malzone. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been a postseason baseball game played at Fenway
Park since Oct. 6, 1995. That was Game 3 of one of that year's
American League Division Series, and the Red Sox opponents then,
like today, were the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The starter for the Indians that day was Charles Nagy, who goes
again for Cleveland this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians won that game, 8-2, driving Boston starter Tim
Wakefield from the mound in the sixth inning when Cleveland scored
five times, building its lead to 8-1. Nagy was solid, yielding just
one run in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave Cleveland, which had won the first two games of
the series at home, a 3-0 sweep and a spot in the American League
Championship Series. The Indians defeated the Seattle Mariners in
the ALCS before losing to the Atlanta Braves in the World Series. &QL; 
SHADY DEALINGS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The starting time for Game 3 is just after 4 p.m., and a topic
of discussion yesterday was whether the shadows that move across
the area between home plate and the pitching mound in the late
afternoon would adversely affect batters' ability to see the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Some players and Red Sox manager Jimy Williams agreed a
light-to-shadow pitch could be hard to pick out because hitters
might not be able to distinguish the rotation of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday afternoon, however, the shadows across the field had
covered both the mound and plate by 4 p.m.

ABORTION RIGHTS FORCES WIN RARE VICTORY IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate negotiators agreed Thursday to
require most federal health plans to cover prescription
contraceptives for women, giving an unusual victory on Capitol Hill
to advocates of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the future of the measure was in doubt because it was
attached to a spending bill that includes a controversial provision
regarding the Federal Election Commission. That provision could
scuttle the spending bill, which would finance the Treasury
Department and the Postal Service and which still must be approved
by the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The contraceptive measure would require the federal health
plans, which affect 1.2 million female federal employees who are of
child-bearing age, to cover the five methods of contraception that
have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in
this country _ birth control pills, diaphragms, inter-uterine
devices, Norplant and Depo-Provera. Currently, only 19 percent of
federal health plans cover those methods.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate approved the contraceptive measure earlier
this year. But the opponents of abortion were furious about the
approval and persuaded Republican leaders to have negotiators
reopen discussion on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of contraceptives has driven up the out-of-pocket cost
of health care for women. And many male members of Congress seemed
persuaded to support coverage of contraceptives for women, since
almost all of the 285 federal health plans cover Viagra, the male
impotency drug.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, with pressure building to resolve the spending bills
before Oct. 9, when temporary financing of the government expires,
the negotiators agreed to include the contraceptive measure in
their conference report on the $13.4 billion bill for the Treasury
Department and Postal service.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who pushed the contraceptive measure
through the House, hailed Thursday's agreement as the first major
accomplishment by abortion rights advocates since the Republicans
took control of Congress in 1994. She said the negotiators had
agreed to include the measure because in an election year they did
not want to be perceived as opposing contraception or be seen as
rejecting a measure that had passed both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats said the were upset that the bill contains a
provision that is seen as interfering with the independence of the
Federal Election Commission. That provision would require a
four-vote majority among the seven federal election commissioners
every four years to retain the general counsel and staff director.
The provision is aimed at getting rid of Lawrence Noble, the
current general counsel, who has investigated the campaign finance
practices of groups like the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The contraceptive measure is one of four related matters that
have helped stall four spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The three other bills that are stalled in part because of
abortion-related matters include the agriculture bill, in which
there is a dispute over whether the federal Food and Drug
Administration should use taxpayer money to approve drugs like
RU-486, which induce abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign operations bill is also stalled over whether to
finance international family planning programs that may also
promote abortion, while the labor and health bill is delayed
because of a provision that would block access of minors to
contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the measure on insurance coverage for contraceptives,
Helen Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, said that the bill was bad policy. She said
contraception had failed to stem the number of abortions, teen-age
pregnancies or out-of-wedlock births. ``Public-relations-wise, it's
a good tactic for them,'' she conceded, ``but in terms of social
policy, this is a failure.''

WHEN ENOUGH REALLY IS ENOUGH  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ala.)  (af) 
 By FRED BROCK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elton Pasea is a mutual fund salesman's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Pasea, 76, a native of Trinidad, lives quite nicely in
Nederland, Texas, on $1,200 a month: $700 from Social Security and
$500 from a union pension. He has never owned stocks, bonds or
mutual funds. His life savings of $33,000 are invested in
certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   He is, he says, having the time of his life. He even manages to
save some money, but it goes into the bank. ``I don't know anything
about stocks,'' said Pasea, a widower. ``I've never even considered
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And he apparently has never considered that, according to
projections by mutual fund companies, he should be eating cat food.
Or at least wallowing in financial misery, sorry that he didn't
take the companies' advice and save more.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have a million-dollar nest egg, and his income isn't
at least 70 percent of his pre-retirement figure. That's what the
projections say he needs. How can the poor wretch possibly be
having a good time?
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the Elton Paseas of this world are living
proof that many such estimations of retirement needs are
self-serving, the product of an industry that has a vested interest
in convincing people to save as much as possible _ in its mutual
funds, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Waddell, a money-management specialist and associate
professor at Auburn University, calls many of the projections
outrageous because, he says, much of the data on which they are
based are unrealistically inflated. He accuses the fund industry of
``fear selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many Americans have bought into the slick sell as
they approach the final decade or so of their working lives.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, of course, the postwar generation has been
famous for spending, not saving. So, in a panic, these born-again
savers are playing catch-up, pouring billions of dollars into
mutual funds and stocks and helping to fuel the bull market of the
90s.
</P>
<P>
   They watch every twitch of the Dow. Their angst is palpable.
When the market slumps, they joke about having to work until they
are 80.
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps these folks should lighten up a bit. The truth is
that if your home is paid for and you are willing to move to a
relatively inexpensive area of the country, you won't need nearly
as much money in retirement as you might have been led to believe.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in a high-cost, high-tax metropolitan area in the
Northeast, for example, calculate how much of the money you spend
goes to maintain yourself in that environment _ and how much you
spend on work-related items like parking, commuting, clothes and
lunches. Stop working and move to a lower-cost area and watch the
expenses disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention taxes. Nine states have no income tax: New
Hampshire, Florida, Tennessee, Texas, South Dakota, Alaska, Nevada,
Washington and Wyoming. In addition, Delaware, New Hampshire,
Alaska, Montana and Oregon have no sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful, though, of property taxes. You might be willing to
settle for a state with a modest sales or income tax if property
taxes are low. The October issue of Kiplinger's magazine compares
these kinds of data from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   And if you have frugal inclinations, you could be in a for a
pleasant surprise. Just consider Pasea.
</P>
<P>
   He retired to Nederland on the Gulf Coast in 1984 after 41 years
of roaming the world as a merchant seaman. He wanted a small town
and a warm climate in which to indulge a lifelong passion:
bicycling. He rides every day (4,000 miles last year alone). He
takes a couple of big bicycle trips a year _ one of them is usually
in Europe _ all within his annual income of $14,400.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have many health-related expenses. Wiry and fit from
all that riding, he also watches his diet, which consists mostly of
fish and vegetables, and has never smoked.
</P>
<P>
   Pasea's house is paid for. If it needs repairs, he usually does
them himself. Texas has no state income tax, and his property taxes
run a little less than $400 a year. His utility bills average $100
a month. He drives a 1984 Nissan with ``only'' 216,000 miles on the
odometer, so at some point he may have to dip into his savings to
replace it.
</P>
<P>
   His total expenditures in July were less than $500. This left
him enough money to buy a plane ticket to Vancouver, British
Columbia, where he spent three weeks in August with a friend. ``It
takes very little for me to live,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not stint when it comes to bicycles. He has spent
about $3,000 on his two high-performance road bikes and related
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Music is another passion. An amateur musician who used to play
the clarinet, Pasea sometimes splurges on CDs _ modern classical
(his ``first love'') and jazz.
</P>
<P>
   And the rewards of such a Spartan life style? ``I'm the happiest
guy in Texas,'' Pasea said.

<P>
   Did conspicuous consumption disappear with the 1980s? Not where
large, expensive sport utilities are concerned. It seems that the
bigger and more expensive the luxury sport utility, the better it
sells.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Lexus LX 470 and its virtually identical cousin,
the Toyota Land Cruiser. Both of these full-sized sport utilities,
priced from almost $47,000 to almost $59,000, were redesigned for
the 1998 model year and introduced in April. They are unchanged for
the 1999 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the pricier LX 470 have unexpectedly exceeded those of
the Land Cruiser in some months this year, but the Land Cruiser is
expected to close the year ahead of its cousin. Lexus is
constrained in the number of LX 470s it can build because of
limited availability of suspension components.
</P>
<P>
   This comes at a time of unprecedented choices for the seemingly
limited pool of consumers who can afford these vehicles. Still
leading the charge is the wildly successful Lincoln Navigator,
introduced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Motor Co. has an even bigger sport utility in the
works. Cadillac will soon introduce the Escalade, based on the
Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon. Last spring GMC added an even more
luxurious version of its Yukon, the Denali. The Chevrolet and GMC
Suburban remains a perennial favorite and the Range Rover _ the
granddaddy of pricey utilities _ is holding its own.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the phenomenal growth of the North American sport
utility market shows no signs of slowing, and the subsegment of the
large, expensive, gas-guzzling types is demonstrating the most
rapid rise in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus introduced its first sport utility, the LX 450, in 1996 to
keep its car buyers from moving into Range Rovers, Jeep Grand
Cherokees and Suburbans. Based on the highly regarded Toyota Land
Cruiser, the LX 450 added a formal grille and Lexus badging
outside, butter-soft leather upholstery and rich wood trim inside,
some additional equipment and $7,000 to the price tag.
</P>
<P>
   The formula remains largely the same this time around. The LX
470 _ the name change from the 450 connotes the more powerful
4.7-liter V8 engine _ and the new Land Cruiser still share the same
basic architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The two are by no means the biggest sport utilities available;
those honors go to the Chevrolet and GMC Suburban. Even the
gargantuan Lincoln Navigator is a foot longer than the LX 470 and
Land Cruiser. The Toyota sport utilities also are shorter than the
Cadillac Escalade, though Toyota has managed to add a third-row
seat that Cadillac did not.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the Navigator and its bold, chrome-laden grille,
the styling of the LX 470 and the Land Cruiser is understated.
Their lines have been softened from those on the previous
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable distinctions between the two is the LX 470s
four-beam projector headlights, its side body cladding and running
boards that match the body color.
</P>
<P>
   Both have a high step into the cabin, but the LX 470 has an
adjustable height control that the Land Cruiser does not. The
system lowers the vehicle for easier entry, raises it for off-road
driving or levels it for highway cruising.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, both the LX 470 and the Land Cruiser are roomy and
comfortable. The LX 470 comes standard with a third-row seat,
providing reasonably comfortable accommodations for up to eight
people. The third seat costs an extra $1,135 in the Land Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   It is removable in both vehicles, though it is a two-person job.
If you don't want to remove the seat but need extra room, the seat
splits and the halves fold sideways out of the way. The second-row
seats also fold and tilt forward for more cargo-carrying
capability.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in interior ambiance between the base Land
Cruiser and the LX 470 is like that between the Toyota Camry and
Lexus ES 300. Both have all the comfort and convenience you need
but one provides more luxurious flair.
</P>
<P>
   The LX 470 comes standard with creamy leather and elegant
touches of genuine walnut wood trim; leather in the Land Cruiser is
a $1,820 option. The Land Cruiser's instrument panel layout of
rotary knobs and buttons is typical of a Toyota. Controls are
logically placed, easy to operate and highly readable.
</P>
<P>
   The LX 470s instrument panel, equally functional, has the same
holographic feel as that of the flagship LS 400 luxury sedan and is
stunning at night.
</P>
<P>
   Both sport utilities are well-equipped with standard cruise
control, three power outlets, power windows and locks and reclining
second-row seats. The Land Cruiser is available with five major
options _ rear air-conditioner, locking rear differential, leather,
power moonroof and the third seat _ which, in total, add $5,000 to
the nearly $47,000 price tag.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The LX 470, at $56,400, comes with virtually every standard
feature imaginable, some of which are not available on the Land
Cruiser. The only options are the power moonroof at $1,270 and the
Nakamichi premium audio system at $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   The most innovative feature in the LX 470 is the in-dash compact
disk player that requires no CD changer. The player swallows up to
six CDs, fed one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard features in the LX 470 but not in the Land
Cruiser include: power tilt and telescope memory steering column;
memory for driver's seat and mirrors; rear-seat automatic climate
control; Homelink garage and security gate opener, and self-dimming
inside and outside mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   As for safety features, both of the sport utilities come with
standard dual front air bags, anti-lock brakes, daytime running
lights and pretensioning seat belts. Neither vehicle is equipped
with side air bags.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change in the LX 470 and Land Cruiser from the
models they replace is under the hood. Their predecessors had been
accused of being overpriced and underpowered with their V6 engines.
</P>
<P>
   Both now are powered by a sophisticated and refined 4.7-liter
dual overhead-cam V8 engine, a derivative of the LS 400's engine.
It produces 230 horsepower and 320 foot-pounds of torque and is
mated to an electronic four-speed automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities don't take top honors in horsepower _ the 1999
Navigator packs a whopping 300. Still, the Toyota utilities run
strong, smooth and silent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Land Cruiser and the LX 470, in particular, ride
and handle like significantly smaller vehicles than their domestic
competitors. But a test drive revealed a subtle difference in ride
and handling between the two. The LX 470 is outfitted with its own
suspension system, which is more sophisticated than that of the
Land Cruiser and provides a ride more in the vein of a luxury
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to northern Michigan, the tested LX 470 glided over
the state's notoriously rough pavement without notice. The pleasant
ride is reminiscent of the riding-on-a-cloud feeling of the LS 400
sedan. Even more impressive is the braking capability of the LX 470
and Land Cruiser. At more than 5,000 pounds, the two nearly match
the braking of many 3,500-pound domestic sedans in testing by
automotive enthusiast magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The two vehicles also meet California's stringent low-emission
standards, but both are gas hogs. Fuel economy _ an oxymoron in
this instance _ is about 13 miles a gallon in the city and 16 on
the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Both the LX 470 and Land Cruiser, with its long history of
traversing the African deserts, are extremely capable off-road.
Each comes only with full-time four-wheel-drive; a low range is
engaged by shifting a lever next to the transmission shifter.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Cruiser, with its more adventurous buyers, is more
likely to explore off-road; still, the Lexus plowed through a foot
of snow on an unpaved road without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   The LX 470's extras come at a premium. While the Land Cruiser
carries a base price of $46,898 (easily climbing to nearly $52,000
with all of the goodies), the Lexus starts at $56,400 and climbs to
$58,870 fully loaded, making it the second-most-expensive sport
utility, behind the Range Rover at about $65,000.
</P>
<P>
   The added features, the ultra-refined suspension, the exclusive
Lexus nameplate and the pampering Lexus ownership experience are
worth an extra $6,000 or so, aren't they? If one is consuming, why
not do it conspicuously? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Very refined, very expensive.

COMEBACKERS SABERHAGEN, NAGY FACE KEY TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bret Saberhagen and Charles Nagy, Game 3 starters in
the Boston-Cleveland American League Division Series, each have had
their share of setbacks over the course of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen's have been all physical. Nagy's, his critics
suggest, mostly mental.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both have displayed the grit necessary to mount comebacks.
Saberhagen overcame numerous injuries plus major surgery to his
right shoulder to post a 15-8 record for the Red Sox this season,
leading them to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy also won 15 games and was especially strong after the
All-Star Break. However, he had to overcome the stigma of being
bypassed as the Game 7 starter in last year's World Series, and
surrendering the hit that cost the Indians the world championship.
He also had an alarmingly poor first half this season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Saberhagen and Nagy have been given the responsibility of
starting a game that would give its winner a stranglehold on this
deadlocked division series, and the loser a noose. Statistically,
both appear equipped to do the job: Nagy is 6-1 in his career
against the Red Sox; Saberhagen was 2-0 against Cleveland this
season.
</P>
<P>
   For Saberhagen, who won two games in the World Series for Kansas
City in 1985, leading the Royals to the title, this year's return
to prominence represents the capper to his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to get back to what I once was,'' he said
yesterday, ``and to contribute in the postseason and get another
World Series ring. Nothing beats it.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, Boston manager Jimy Williams said, is ``a very
strong-hearted individual that went through a very difficult
operation to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen signed with the Red Sox as a minor-league free agent
in December 1996, after missing the entire season after shoulder
surgery in May when he was property of the Colorado Rockies. He
pitched briefly last year in the minors and with Boston, then came
to spring training this season as nothing more than a possible
fifth starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really weren't sure what we were going to get,'' Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Saberhagen said, he's not much different than
in his glory days with the Royals and, later, with the New York
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The control is (still) there,'' he said. ``I don't throw 95 or
96, but I throw 93-94. I am happy the quality is there and I am not
just an average pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagy was far less than average for much of his season. He was
winless from June 5 through July 17, going 0-4 with a 5.72
earned-run average. Even with his 3-1 September, he finished with a
5.22 ERA. His 34 home runs allowed ranked third worst in the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course of the year I fell into some bad habits,''
said Nagy, not elaborating. ``We went back and looked at some tapes
and saw some things that I wasn't doing in the previous year. I
just made the adjustments and it seems to have helped.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his trying World Series experience last year, Nagy said
it no longer bothers him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long time ago. I've put it behind me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With a pivotal game before them, Saberhagen and Nagy know that
whoever writes the best comeback story today could be in the
American League Championship Series next week.

   (italics)Ah, school days. In these fast-changing times,
additional education often seems a necessity in business. And
job-related instruction _ in-house or through extension courses _
is a rapidly growing field. But in many instances, the experience
is a far cry from those halcyon days of crayons and
show-and-tell.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Remember when the computers arrived? And everybody had to take
instruction?
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy C. VanLeuven of Cooperstown, N.Y., can't forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may seem an impossible story,'' she writes. ``I assure
you it is true.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she was working as a civil-service employee in
local government for a politically connected boss.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. VanLeuven writes: ``Several of us wondered about her
capabilities, especially when she insisted that Penelope was
pronounced PENN-a-loap and that the correct pronunciation of Iowa
was eye-OH-wah. But that was nothing compared to the day the office
`went computer.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We were given instruction in pairs as to the procedure for
entering information, correcting errors, retrieving information,
etc. When the instructor asked the boss if she wanted to sit in on
the session, she said she really didn't have to, because she had
the same computer at home and used it frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after some encouragement she sat down opposite the new
computer and said, `Yes, yes, I know all this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she added, `What is (italics)this(end italics) key?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was the enter key.

   As Krista Ryan knows well, one important aspect of job-related
education is communication.
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Ryan graduated last year from Brooklyn Law School, she
moved to Boston to work in the legal department of a large mutual
fund company. This semester, she decided to enroll in a course in
accounting at the Harvard Extension School.
</P>
<P>
   During the first class, the professor, a scholarly-looking
Bostonian, kept repeating the mantra ``Assets equal liabilities
plus onus equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Onus equity?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ryan's class in corporate law had familiarized her with
equity, but onus equity was a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   She wondered: Was it especially hard-earned money put into the
company? A special obligation of sorts? She found the answer in the
first chapter of her textbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy to report that my misunderstanding had more to do
with a Bahston accent than the subject,'' she writes. ``Ah, but of
course, he meant `owner's equity.' ''

   Tom Newman of Racine, Wis., who has been working in training and
development since 1960, says he has witnessed his share of the
unusual, including the time a woman arrived for a communications
workshop at 10 a.m., halfway through the four-hour session.
</P>
<P>
   When it finished at noon, Newman told her, ``Even though you
were two hours late, I hope you got something from the program.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman replied: ``I wasn't late. I was on time.''
</P>
<P>
   After Newman begged to differ, the woman asked, ``Wasn't this
the inventory control meeting, from 10 to 12 noon?''
</P>
<P>
   Newman said, ``No, it was a communications workshop.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman had the last word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she said, ``it was pretty interesting anyhow.''

   When it comes to workplace instruction, learning takes place on
both sides of the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Ruth Sherman, the president of a consulting and
training company in Greenwich, Conn., received a call from a labor
union interested in courses in communication and
conflict-management skills for its members.
</P>
<P>
   Going through her customary questions at an initial meeting with
union representatives, Ms. Sherman asked what problem they hoped to
see solved by training. The two officials said they had been
getting negative feedback from the businesses they negotiated with.
Ms. Sherman pressed for more specifics.
</P>
<P>
   The men said that when a conflict arose, it inevitably
deteriorated into name-calling. In fact, they said, they were
invariably called gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ain't no gangsters,'' Ms. Sherman was assured.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherman told them that the negotiators would do better at
keeping talks from degenerating if they developed more
self-awareness.
</P>
<P>
   The representatives seemed interested in further training and
said that the next step would be to take up the matter with their
boss. Ms. Sherman scheduled a follow-up call for two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Ms. Sherman picked up the telephone to make that
call, she happened to glance at a newspaper. The federal government
had begun an investigation of the union local. Not only was it
suspected of having mob ties, but the two officials Ms. Sherman had
counseled were identified as captains in a notorious criminal gang.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherman says she doesn't know how things worked out. ``But
looking back,'' she writes, ``I guess that self-awareness would not
have been at the top of their list.''
</P>
<P>

   Gordon Marshall of Milwaukee begins his reminiscence with a
question: ``What sounds duller than training for government
accountants?
</P>
<P>
   ``As a division head in Milwaukee responsible for training our
accountants from small-town field offices, I was in for a
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   On the second morning of class, one trainee who had come to town
for the classes failed to show up. Concerned, Marshall set about
tracking him down. Later in the day, the man called in to say he
had been jailed overnight after an encounter with decoy prostitutes
from the Milwaukee Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astounded but relieved,'' Marshall writes.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, at the outset of training, Marshall extended his
instruction to include cautioning his trainees about the friendly
police decoys. But the next day, one of the class was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall called the police.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, they were holding one naive accountant on a charge
of soliciting a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall has become philosophical about all this.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' he writes, ``we accountants do like figures.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the world's finance ministers and central
bankers gathered last year in Hong Kong, they nervously
congratulated each other for containing _ at least for the moment _
a nasty financial brush fire in Asia. In a year's time, many
predicted in hallway chatter, the troubles in Thailand and
Indonesia would look like a replay of Mexico in 1995 _ a rough bump
in the road for a world enjoying remarkable prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about bad market calls. Twelve months later, as the same
financial mandarins clog Washington with their limousines and glide
through endless receptions at the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, just about
everything that could have gone wrong in the world economy has: the
worst downturn in Japan since World War II, economic meltdown in
Russia, a depression in Indonesia that is plunging 100 million
people below the poverty line, and deep fears over what happens
next in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this year's IMF meeting most remarkable, though, is
that the harshest criticisms are directed at the monetary fund
itself, and, by extension, at the U.S. Treasury, which is viewed as
the power behind the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in place of confident predictions, there are mutual
recriminations. Arguments are breaking out over whether the true
culprits were crony capitalists and weakened leaders like Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, or huge investors who poured money into
the world's emerging markets with reckless abandon in the mid-1990s
and panicked in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds of billions
of dollars have fled from economies on four continents _ seeking
the safest havens possible, often in the United States _ and the
money is not returning anytime soon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And the subtext of every seminar on capital flows and every
conclave of nervous ministers will be some painfully blunt
questions: Can this be stopped? Or is the world headed for a global
recession?
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three years ago the IMF was created after the Bretton
Woods conference which sought to stabilize the world economy and
secure the peace after World War II. Now it is under attack from
all sides, charged not only with worsening a bad situation by
misjudging the economics, but with being politically tone-deaf in
some of the most volatile capitals in the world, from Jakarta,
Indonesia, to Moscow. For the first time, there are disturbing
questions about whether the institution itself is still capable,
financially or politically, of containing the kind of economic
contagion that caught the world unaware.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the IMF's critics were largely found in Africa and South
Asia, were the fund was often viewed as arrogant; today they
include Wall Street's biggest players and top officials in the most
powerful economies of Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few _ including former Secretary of State George Schultz
and members of Congress who are increasingly suspicious of all
international institutions _ are talking about scrapping the IMF
altogether. But almost everyone is talking about creating a ``new
financial architecture'' that can do what the old one clearly
cannot: smother financial wildfires before they leap around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other
leaders, after months of silence, have edged into the debate, in
some cases wresting the issue for the first time from their finance
ministers and central banks. Their fear, their advisers say, is
that 15 months of financial turmoil are now threatening political
stability.
</P>
<P>
   The blunt-speaking Prime Minister of Singapore, Goh Chok Tong,
recently described the cost of failure in stark terms that both
Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin have avoided. ``A
prolonged economic downturn in Asia will revive latent tensions
against the West,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns have turned this year's meeting into a tumbled
mass of worries and a groping for short and long-term solutions.
The Japanese, the French, the Southeast Asians are all arriving in
Washington with different diagnoses of what went wrong, and
different solutions about how to set it right. The United States
has its own set of plans, a mix of suggestions to force more
disclosure of financial data in countries around the world and to
impose more American-style financial standards and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an ideological argument is breaking out over whether
the world should slow down a long march toward more free and open
markets _ a strategy pressed by the Clinton administration for the
past six years. Others argue that it is unwise to start rebuilding
the hospital while the patients are still on the operating tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year the standard answer that all of us were given came
down to this: `We have the IMF and the World Bank, and they know
best,''' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said over breakfast
in Washington the other day, reflecting on how the crisis turned 30
years of astounding growth in his country into an overnight
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they said everything that went wrong was our fault,'' he
said. ``But now, now I think people know that much of the problem
came from the outside, and we need something better.''
</P>
<P>
   And the IMF itself is beginning to fight back, an awkward role
for an institution dominated by Ph.D. economists who are
unaccustomed to being openly challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every place you turn you read the same story, that we came in,
that we made things worse,'' said Stanley Fischer, the deputy
managing director of the fund, who was born in Northern Rhodesia _
now Zambia _ and became chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's economics department before taking a job that has now
put him in the center of the financial storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We frequently get the blame, some of it well-deserved,'' he
said. ``But it is politically convenient for governments around the
world to cry, `The IMF made us do it,' and pin their mistakes on
us. That's fine. We'd rather be loved, but more than that we'd like
to be effective.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS
</P>
<P>
   On a steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, the IMF's top
official, slipped into Jakarta to the private residence of
President Suharto and sat down for a four-hour meeting to tick off,
line by line, the huge reforms Indonesia would have to implement in
return for tens of billions of dollars in emergency aid. Two
previous deals had collapsed when Suharto ignored the fund's
conditions, so Camdessus insisted that he strike a deal directly
with Suharto, then Asia's longest-serving leader.
</P>
<P>
   It was a meeting of men who knew different worlds of power
politics: Suharto rose as a general in central Java, and Camdessus
had detonated mines in Algeria for the French army before entering
the French Treasury on his way to becoming head of France's central
bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all there,'' a senior IMF official recalled. ``He was
told he had to dismantle the national airplane project, the clove
monopoly, all the distribution monopolies.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Camdessus looked at the impassive Suharto and
said, ``You see what this means for your family,'' a reference to
their vast investments in the country's key industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I called in my children, and they all understand.'''
</P>
<P>
   But within months, that exchange in Jakarta came to symbolize
the IMF's twin troubles: Its inability to understand and reckon
with the national politics of countries in need of radical reform,
and its focus on economic stabilization rather than the social
costs of its actions.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto had no intention of fulfilling the agreement. It was,
one of his former Cabinet members said, ``a delaying move that was
obvious to everyone except Camdessus.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one reason why the IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf is
that its senior staff is almost entirely composed of Ph.D.
economists. There are few officials with deep experience in
international politics, much less the complexities of Javanese
culture that were at work in Indonesia. Historically, experts in
politics and security have gravitated to the United Nations,
development experts to the World Bank, and economists to the IMF _
creating dangerous gaps in a crisis like this one.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the fund had only a rudimentary understanding of
what would happen if its demands were met and all Indonesia's state
monopolies were quickly dissolved. While that system lined the
pockets of the Suhartos and their friends, it also distributed
food, gasoline and other staples to a country that stretches for
3,000 miles over thousands of islands. To help balance the budget,
the fund demanded a quick end to expensive subsidies that keep the
price of food and gasoline artificially low.
</P>
<P>
   But that, combined with the huge currency devaluation that
sparked the crisis, resulted in high prices and shortages that
fueled riots that continue to this day, as millions of Indonesians
lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF _ unintentionally, its officials insist _ also sped
Suharto's resignation, insisting on the elimination of ``crony
capitalism,'' code words for removing the Suharto family from the
center of the economy. Ultimately, that may prove to be Indonesia's
salvation, if the new government can contain the rioting against
the ethnic Chinese minority _ whose money is desperately needed to
save the country's fast-shrinking economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worth noting,'' Fischer said this week, ``that our
programs in Asia _ in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand _ only took
hold after there was a change in government.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Indonesia experience has revived the argument
that the IMF is so focused on stabilizing banks and currencies, on
preventing capital flight and freeing up markets, that it is blind
to the social costs of its actions. Among the toughest critics has
been its sister institution, the World Bank, whose main charge is
alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen the tension almost every day,'' one senior World
Bank official said recently. The bank has gone to extraordinary
lengths in recent months to differentiate its role from that of the
fund, and to announce a tripling of aid to the poorest in the
countries hit by the economic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Even U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has joined the argument,
warning in a speech at Harvard recently that ``if globalization is
to succeed, it must succeed for poor and rich alike. It must
deliver rights no less than riches. It must be harnessed to the
cause not of capital alone, but of development and prosperity for
the poorest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   IMF officials say they are changing strategies when they see
they are exacting too great a social cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult formula to get exactly right,'' Fischer
said in August, as Russia was teetering and the IMF was sending in
$4.8 billion in aid that was rapidly wasted. ``You need enough
discipline to send the right message to the markets and keep
investors from fleeing. But you need enough leeway to keep people
from suffering more than they otherwise would.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, he noted, the IMF has allowed more spending to
sustain subsidies for basic goods for longer periods in Indonesia,
Korea and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new flexibility at the IMF'' a senior Indonesian
official concluded recently. ``It is a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY?
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration admits that the IMF has many
failings, many of them on display this year. But it insists that
the world has gone through global financial crises without an IMF
once before in this century _ and the result was the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt the situation over the past year would have
been much worse _ with greater devaluations, more defaults, more
contagion, and greater trade dislocations _ without the program
agreed with the IMF and the finance it has provided,'' Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Congress last week.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans and some Democrats are unconvinced. Even though
the Senate has overwhelmingly approved an $18 billion contribution
to the fund to help it fight new crises, the House defeated that
measure two weeks ago. The fund's last hope of getting the money,
which will free up nearly $100 billion in contributions from other
nations waiting for the United States to act, will come when the
House and Senate try to resolve their budget differences in a
conference committee in the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   A rejection, Rubin insists, would send a message around the
world that the United States is turning its back on the one
institution charged with restoring economic stability.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere else in the world, though, politicians and
businessmen insist that one of the biggest problems with the IMF is
that, contrary to the view of Congress, it acts as the U.S.
Treasury's lap dog. Ask in Jakarta or Moscow, and the response is
the same: The IMF never ventures far without looking back for the
approving nod of its master.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That view may not be far wrong. In ordinary times, the United
States largely leaves its hands off, as the IMF's executive board _
made up of 24 representatives of the 182 member nations _ delve
into the intricacies of budget policy in Greece or banking
regulation in Argentina. ``Surveillance'' of the world's economies
is the fund's main activity.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States weighs in, however, is when the IMF is
called on to rescue a country in deep trouble. Only then does the
IMF _ and the U.S. Treasury _ have the leverage to extract
commitments in return for billions in aid. In theory, the U.S.
influence is limited: It has an 18.5 percent vote in the fund.
Germany, Japan, France and Britain have about 5 percent each. But
in practice the United States usually gets its way, exercising its
influence behind the scenes, often in interactions between Fischer
and Summers.
</P>
<P>
   The two met when Fischer was on the MIT faculty and Summers was
a graduate student taking one of his classes, later becoming a
colleague at MIT. Each served as chief economist of the World Bank.
It was Summers who was instrumental in placing Fischer in the
fund's no. 2 job, and these days they talk constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually a warm relationship,'' Fischer said this summer.
``Remember, this is a job where you cannot turn to outsiders for
advice _ you can't call the chief economist at a Wall Street firm,
or even many of your academic friends, because so many of the
issues are confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury's relations with Camdessus are often more strained
as he plays the role of world diplomat, traveling the globe and
trying to coax along political leaders. The tensions were obvious
from the start of the Asia crisis. The fund made little secret of
its displeasure that the United States was not offering direct aid
to Thailand, a major U.S. ally, as a sign of support and
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the backlash in Congress when Mexico was bailed out
with U.S. money, that was the last thing the Treasury planned to
do. Summers, in turn, thought the fund was not forcing the Thais to
implement its reform commitments rigorously enough or disclose
their true financial picture. Within the U.S. government there was
other dissension: The State and Defense Departments felt the United
States should do more for Thailand, but backed off when the
Treasury asked if they would like to pony up some aid out of their
own budgets.
</P>
<P>
   There were other conflicts. When Japan used the last IMF meeting
to propose setting up a $100 billion ``Asia Fund'' _ one that would
exclude the United States and would probably offer aid under much
more relaxed conditions than the IMF does. Rubin called up
Camdessus at breakfast one morning and told him that the Japanese
proposal would undercut the IMF's authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just had a dispute with Michel,'' Rubin reported to his
aides as he returned to his orange juice and croissant. One of them
shot back: ``And it's only 8 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus backed down at Rubin's insistence and walked away from
money that Asia could have used. Japan says it will be back with a
similar proposal this weekend, this time for a $30 billion fund.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus has also rankled U.S. officials with statements that
amounted to cheerleading to reassure the markets _ sometimes in the
face of the facts. In June, with Russia on its way to collapse,
Camdessus declared that ``contrary to what markets and commentators
are imagining'' about the slow collapse of Russia's economy, ``this
is not a crisis. This is not a major development.''
</P>
<P>
   The bailouts of Russia and South Korea were prime examples of
how Washington muscles into the IMF's turf as soon as major U.S.
strategic interests are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas, as South Korea slipped within days of running
out of hard currency to pay its debts in December, it sent a secret
envoy, Kim Kihwan, to work out a rescue package. ``I didn't bother
going to the IMF,'' Kim recalled recently. ``I called Summers'
office at the Treasury from my home in Seoul, flew to Washington
and went directly there. I knew that was how this would get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days the Treasury dispatched David Lipton, its most
experienced veteran of emergency bailouts, who is leaving his post
as undersecretary for international affairs this month, to shadow
the IMF staff's negotiations with the government in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer was displeased. ``To make a negotiation effective, it
has to be clear who has the authority to do the negotiating,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   WHO LOST RUSSIA?
</P>
<P>
   The pattern was repeated this summer, when the United States
raced to put together a $17 billion package for Russia. The IMF's
staff in Moscow declared that Russia needed no money at all _ it
just needed to enact policies that would restore confidence in
investors. The Americans and Germans came to a different
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, U.S. officials gathered in the White House situation
room to consider what might happen to Russia if the ruble was
devalued and market reforms collapsed and to push the IMF to come
up with emergency money. So the fund began assembling a last-ditch
program to prop up a country that had resisted its reform plans for
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus, though, was still hesitant, questioning whether the
IMF should risk its scarce resources in Russia. ``We had to pull
Michel along,'' a senior Treasury official recalled.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Camdessus' instincts were right while the
approach championed by Rubin and Summers proved disastrously wrong.
The first installment of that payment _ $4.8 billion _ was wasted,
propping up the currency long enough, in the words of one IMF
official, ``to let the oligarchs get their money out of the
country.'' Then Yeltsin reversed his commitments, let the ruble
devalue anyway, began printing money with abandon and fired
virtually every reformer in his government _ resulting in a
collapse of the IMF agreements and the indefinite suspension of its
aid program.
</P>
<P>
   Now, inside the IMF and on Capitol Hill, there are
recriminations over ``who lost Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Fischer argues that ``there are no apologies owed for
what we attempted in Russia.'' But some IMF officials complain
privately that they let Rubin and Summers run roughshod over them,
striking a deal that fell apart within weeks as the Russian
parliament rebelled and Yeltsin backed away from his commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Summers responds that the United States ``took a calculated
risk'' because ``it was vastly better that Russia succeed than not
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian collapse touched off new rounds of economic
contagion, with investors fleeing Latin America, and triggering
huge losses in hedge funds like Long Term Capital, the Greenwich,
Conn., investment firm that needed to be rescued by Wall Street
powerhouses whose money it had invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia was a turning point,'' said Robert Hormats, the vice
chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``It made the world realize that
some countries can fail, even if the IMF and the Treasury
intercede. And that changed the perception of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the countries meet to face a future that the IMF has
warned could be very bleak, they need to reverse those perceptions,
or watch countries slowly starve for lack of capital. The emerging
markets are calling for controls on short term investments. The
French want a stronger IMF. The Americans say the answer is more
disclosure, so that investors are better warned, and tougher
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are usually nice, quiet meetings; everyone very
polite,'' a top U.S. official said earlier this week. ``Not this
year.''

MARKET PLACE: HINTS OF CHANGE AT GE CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By REED ABELSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has GE Capital, the mammoth financial-services operation, become
too much of a good thing for its parent, General Electric Co.? Its
relentless growth over the years has made it a key source of profit
for GE and one of the reasons that the company is famous for making
its numbers. But with the tumult abroad and at home causing
investors to shy away from financial-service concerns, GE could be
looking for ways to divert attention from this golden goose.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is rampant that General Electric will soon announce
sweeping changes at the subsidiary. Gary Wendt, GE Capital's chief
executive and the man largely responsible for its success, is
widely expected to leave. In addition to naming new leadership to
replace him, General Electric is said to be close to a
reorganization of GE Capital that would make it easier to manage
and a less visible force on the parent company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric does not comment on ``rumors and speculation,''
according to Anthony Zehnder, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   With about $40 billion in revenue last year, GE Capital is now
composed of 28 businesses ranging from credit cards to truck
leasing to insurance. Without doubt, though, GE Capital is a hefty
contributor to General Electric's overall profit, about 40 percent
of net earnings in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The talk, among analysts and others who closely watch GE
Capital, is that the subsidiary will undergo some sort of shake-up
in which it will be split into separate businesses. The expectation
is that three distinct units will be created, splitting off the
insurance business and dividing the others, perhaps along
commercial and consumer lines.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the businesses, like equipment leasing, may also be
folded back into divisions within General Electric. GE Capital
Railcar Services, for example, a leasing business, could be
combined with transportation-system businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization may make sense on a lot of levels. Given the
current disdain for financial-service concerns, out of investors'
fear of emerging markets, an economic slowdown and derivatives that
go bump in earnings, GE may want to de-emphasize that aspect of its
business.
</P>
<P>
   Although its stock has already suffered _ it is off 22 percent
from the July high _ investors are still awarding it a hefty
price-earnings multiple just above 28, more than twice that of many
insurance companies or money-center banks. It closed Thursday at
$75.5625. Microsoft recently surpassed GE as the United States'
largest company by market value.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the company's smoother-than-silk earnings record
accounts for some of that premium. ``GE has this pristine growth
rate, year after year,'' much of which is due to the cushion
afforded a financial-services subsidiary, said David Tice, a Dallas
money manager who tends to cast a skeptical eye on companies. While
he concedes that the managers at GE are nothing if not smart,
``there is more risk within GE than most people give it credit
for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in an ugly market environment, some critics have been much
crueler, calling GE Capital ``a hedge fund in drag,'' as Kathryn
Welling reported last month in Barron's _ which dredges up images
of billion-dollar losses.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts like Jeffrey Sprague at Salomon Smith Barney have
argued that GE Capital does nothing so speculative and is not
really vulnerable to disasters in emerging markets, General
Electric may want the business to have lower visibility, though a
company executive wrote a letter to Barron's defending GE Capital.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit from all this reshuffling could be that investors
and analysts poring over General Electric's financial statements
will be less struck by GE Capital's prominence. There would be more
contributors to earnings, and some of the existing business lines
could have the benefit of some of GE Capital's profits.
</P>
<P>
   GE may also be hoping that a little reorganization could squeeze
more income out of GE Capital, at a time when the parent company
can use all the help it can get to keep delivering ever-higher
profits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is also Wendt. Despite his well-publicized role in making
GE Capital a roaring success, he is said to have a poor
relationship with John Welch Jr., the 62-year-old chairman and
chief executive of General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Wendt's confession, during his ugly divorce
proceedings, that he and Welch were not the best of friends, has
helped fuel this talk, people who know both men say they do not get
along very well. Welch may also be looking for a successor, and
many believe that Wendt is not it. Wendt did not return phone calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that Wendt will move to a high position at a
rival financial-services company like Chase Manhattan. Chase
declined to comment. Wendt, who recently remarried, could also
choose a life of leisure and simply retire. He has said publicly
that he has no plans to leave GE Capital, which is based in
Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   But the real intrigue is about who would succeed Wendt. While
Denis Nayden, GE Capital's current president, may seem like a
natural, he could end up with only a piece of the action if GE
Capital is carved up. Names that are being bandied about as other
executives who might rise in the reshuffling are Michael Neal and
Michael Frazier, both of whom are currently GE Capital executives.
</P>
<P>
   In order to bring GE Capital a little closer to home, which may
also be Welch's goal, the talk is that General Electric will have
the executives report to the company's current chief financial
officer, Dennis Dammerman. He could also be named as an interim
head of the whole group.
</P>
<P>
   As the man responsible for the numbers at General Electric,
Dammerman is said to be in Welch's favor. ``He has tremendous
respect on the Street,'' said an executive recruiter, who spoke on
the condition that he not be named.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors always abound at General Electric, but many people
believe that change really is afoot, given investor sentiment and
the need to replace Wendt if he leaves. ``We are definitely going
through a changing of the guard,'' an analyst said.

SPORTS COLUMN: THIS DARRYL IS ALREADY A SURVIVOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BBA-STRAWBERRY-CANCER.) 
(jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ ``Hey, Skip.''
</P>
<P>
   This was behind the batting cage at noon on a Sunday in
Montreal, during the pennant race of September 1984, back when the
Mets were young, when Darryl Strawberry was going to hit 1,000 home
runs and help the Mets win 10 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry and Davey Johnson went off in a corner and had a
terse little conversation, and pretty soon Strawberry was out of
the lineup, not up to playing so soon after whatever he had been
doing on Saturday night. I remember one of the Mets' coaches
banging his fungo bat against the batting cage.
</P>
<P>
   That was a Darryl Strawberry who could not look anybody in the
eye, who offered a limp handshake, and very often a limp
explanation for things that had gone wrong. That was a Darryl
Strawberry who nearly wrecked his life and other lives, through
drugs and alcohol and other diversions, to avoid facing the world
and himself in any sober way.
</P>
<P>
   We never really know how anybody will react to misfortune, but
it is reasonable to assume this was not a man who could have faced
terrible news with clarity and discipline. Then again, that was not
the same Darryl Strawberry who found out Thursday that he must have
an operation for colon cancer, perhaps as soon as tomorrow. This
Darryl Strawberry is not only physically straight but also mentally
and spiritually straight.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, in another baseball season, Darryl
Strawberry is now a Yankee, a survivor. Thursday, Joe Torre
recalled two meetings in 1996: ``Darryl came to us after the
All-Star break and obviously he brought a lot of baggage, but I
judge people on what I see, and he said he'd do anything for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the playoff series with the Texas Rangers, I was trying
to decide whether to play him or Big Daddy,'' Torre said, referring
to Cecil Fielder. ``Darryl said: `I can handle sitting. Why don't
you play Big Daddy?'''
</P>
<P>
   This was not some furtive bailout by the troubled man of an
earlier time. This was the alert decision by a grown-up, a player
who wanted to take the pressure off his manager.
</P>
<P>
   At some time, in one of those treatment centers, Darryl
Strawberry accepted that he had come close to going to jail, that
perhaps his second marriage and his life itself would not survive,
unless he stayed sober day by day.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in New York, who felt personally let down by
Strawberry, as if he had cost them money, would make condescending
comments about him. They did not want to know of his renewal, which
was real and tangible, up close.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he was still the same Straw _ the vile odor of his furtive
cigarette stinking out a tiny corner of the clubhouse, the bulging
chaw inside his cheek (tobacco is indeed a potent addiction), the
salty talk, the street wisdom. But Darryl was clean now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have different personalities, but I'm as close to him as
anybody in the clubhouse,'' Bernie Williams said Thursday. ``He's a
guy you can relate to. He's so down to earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Homer Bush, the earnest rookie, Thursday recalled joining the
Yankees in 1997, the same day Strawberry returned from a brief
training stint in the minor leagues. ``He talked to me, he told me
he liked the way I played, he said I was going to have a good
career,'' Bush said. ``He gave me advice.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the advice he gave, Strawberry suppressed the lesson of
his childhood friend, Eric Davis, who underwent an operation for
colon cancer last year and came back to play for the Orioles in the
playoffs. Davis has been preaching regular checkups, but Strawberry
ignored the pain in his intestines.
</P>
<P>
   After all his tax troubles, he needs every paycheck, every next
bonus phase in his contract, so he waited for the pain to subside
until finally he had to consult a doctor this week. In their shock
Thursday, the Yankees said that they hoped he had sought treatment
in time.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees looked stricken as they trudged out to a spiritless
workout. Tears rimmed the eyes of players who gave interviews.
Torre said this was not something one would wish ``on your worst
enemy.'' Nobody tried to sugarcoat this dreadful blow to their
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a good person,'' said David Cone, Friday
night's starting pitcher, who knows Strawberry from the wild Met
days. ``He's made his mistakes, we all have, but he's turned it
around. He's a team leader. We're all optimistic he has the
strength to beat it.''
</P>
<P>
   This may not be much consolation, but this horrible thing has
happened to a man whose strength will be even more of a blessing
than he could have known.

U.S. DELIVERS WARNING; GIVES MILOSEVIC TWO WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for changes in lede; some additional refinements.)  (lh) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO will have both the political authorization
from its members and the military forces in place to act against
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia in two weeks, senior
U.S. officials said Thursday, if he does not stop the violence
against ethnic Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   He must agree to remove his special police forces from the
province of Kosovo, to allow relief to 300,000 refugees and to
begin serious negotiations toward a political solution, the
Americans said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they have not delivered a formal ultimatum to
Milosevic, but they have warned him that they are serious this time
about military action and will take it if he does not comply.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that they are under new congressional and public
pressure because of widely publicized atrocities traced to Serbian
forces, the officials said that they expect Milosevic to comply
with these international demands before force is used. But the only
way he will do so, the officials said, is if he thinks NATO's
warnings, this time, are credible.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. officials like National Security Adviser Sandy Berger,
insisted on Thursday that these new warnings are credible. ``If
Milosevic does not comply, NATO must be prepared to act militarily
and it will,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   America would not act alone, he said, but within NATO. ``And the
events and atrocities of the last week or so have quickened the
pace of our European allies.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Security Council condemned the atrocities and
demanded that the Yugoslav government punish those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   But some U.S. officials acknowledged that the threats of
reprisals have come very late, after Milosevic has already
accomplished most of his aims _ beating back the insurgent Kosovo
Liberation Army and destroying the livelihoods of many of its
civilian supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call this policy by embarrassment, or policy by
shame,'' said another senior administration official who requested
anonymity. ``But we are at last serious, and our European allies
are at last serious. This is not an empty exercise, and we do not
have our fingers crossed behind our backs. Our goal is a diplomatic
solution. But if there is no legitimate change on the ground, I am
confident that we and NATO will follow through on these threats.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the atmosphere of threat, the State Department
issued a travel advisory warning Americans not to travel to
Yugoslavia and asking those Americans already there to consider
leaving.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And the administration's top national security officials,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; Defense Secretary William
Cohen; Berger, the national security adviser, and Air Force Gen.
Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, went to
Capitol Hill to provide senators with a confidential briefing about
Kosovo and NATO military preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They laid out the stakes in Kosovo and the importance of being
prepared to use force and had a serious consultation with senators
about what decisions may follow in the next few days,'' an official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Albright told reporters: ``The combined threat of the
use of force and diplomacy is the best way of proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The briefing was well-attended, senators said, and the officials
laid out a strategy that focuses on help for the refugees and
diplomatic action, but backed up by the use of force if Milosevic
does not heed international demands.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said that the recent media coverage
of the latest killings of ethnic Albanians ``have pushed many of us
over the atrocity line.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he told the officials: ``With all due respect, it's time
to shoot or shut up.'' He said he was disappointed that the U.S.
position still seemed insufficiently aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said he favored the use of air power
in Kosovo and would support a congressional resolution to that
effect.
</P>
<P>
   And Senate Democratic Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota said
that military action ``may be required'' to enforce diplomatic
efforts. ``I do believe that some of these people only seem to
understand diplomacy and its merit once they've seen the
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morton Abramowitz, a former State Department official and an
expert on the Kosovo problem, said he did not expect military
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not holding my breath,'' he said. ``I think every
opportunity is being given to Mr. Milosevic to pull back. We are
trying to get the ethnic Albanians and the Serbs to some sort of
agreement, but what that agreement is remains very unclear, and I'm
skeptical that all this is the way to any durable settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the decision to press ahead and ``cock the
trigger'' resulted from a Cabinet-level meeting of national
security officials two weeks ago and a series of conversations with
key allied officials, in particular the British, French and
Germans. The result was a Security Council resolution Thursday that
fell just short of specifically authorizing force. The Germans and
Italians remain more concerned about taking NATO action without
going back to the Council, officials say, while the Russians oppose
it.
</P>
<P>
   But given the new revulsion at the recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo _ producing wrenching television film and
photographs _ European countries are now more willing to use force
without going back to the United Nations, U.S. officials insisted
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Recent atrocities have also prompted former Republican
presidential candidate Bob Dole to urge military action in Kosovo,
a call recently echoed by other key Republican Senators like John
McCain of Arizona, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Smith of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, NATO asked member nations to provide specific
military forces for an operation against Serbian or Yugoslav
targets. The next step, possibly as early as a week from now, would
be an activation order giving political authorization by NATO
members to the NATO commander to take military action at any time.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior U.S. official said that even this activation order
would have a waiting period built in to it, ``to allow Milosevic to
see the hand writing on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav claims that attacks on ethnic Albanians had ended are
``blatantly untrue'' said a State Department spokesman, James
Rubin, while his Pentagon counterpart, Kenneth Bacon, said that
while Belgrade ``says they are withdrawing back to the barracks,
they are continuing to fight at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible plan would involve an initial wave of air strikes
followed by a pause and a warning of crippling strikes to follow, a
U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What NATO has planned is a graduated series of possible air
strikes which could, at the high end, involve a very considerable
number of airplanes,'' Bacon said. ``The goal of the options is to
reduce or degrade the Serbian military's ability to continue
striking the Kosovar Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger and other officials emphasized the urgency of Milosevic's
compliance before winter sets in and starts freezing refugees to
death in the mountains.

 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Isaac Mizrahi, who was once considered the designer
most likely to inherit the mantle of Donna Karan and Calvin Klein,
representing the next generation of American fashion, announced on
Thursday that he would close his business this week.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected news startled the New York fashion community,
which had built Mizrahi into one of its most beloved and ballyhooed
figures.
</P>
<P>
   His exuberant designs and equally endearing personality _ one
part cherubic mama's boy, one part haute aesthete _ endeared
Mizrahi to the fashion press and retailers, who devoted endless
pages in magazines and square footage in stores to his clothing.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, his sales were less than stellar and his
celebrity did not pay the bills. Chanel Inc., the American arm of
the French fashion house, which had quietly bankrolled the designer
since 1992, pulled the plug after years of losses, said Michael
Rena, executive vice president of Chanel.
</P>
<P>
   Rena would not give details on the extent of the losses to the
business, whose gross sales industry estimates put at $20 million
to $30 million a year. But clearly, Chanel had grown weary of the
drain. Despite the creativity and irrepressible personality for
which Mizrahi was known to fashion insiders, he failed to create a
signature image, like Ms. Karan or Klein, with which average
shoppers could identify.
</P>
<P>
   He therefore forfeited the chance to develop lucrative licenses
for shoes, jeans and fragrances, or a cheaper secondary collection
that would lead to a high-volume business. Chanel saw a future that
perhaps looked very much like the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew and we knew where we were heading,'' Rena said. ``We
told him there was a point beyond which we were not going to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi will remain in his Manhattan offices through November to
tie up loose ends. ``For me, it's bittersweet,'' he said. ``I don't
know what it says about fashion. I don't know what it says about
me. A lot of it is luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi said he had canceled his runway show of designs for
spring 1999, which was scheduled for next month in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden shuttering of his business indicates one of the
perennial weaknesses of the fashion industry, which tends to make
celebrities of designers with little regard for their commercial
viability. There was perhaps no designer whose press and retail
loyalty was so out of synch with the performance of his collection
in stores.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, sales of Mizrahi's collection have been
inconsistent, with only 50 to 60 percent selling at full price,
compared with other top designer lines that typically sell 70 to 80
percent at full price.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the end came just as retailers reported that sales
were looking up. In the last year, stores like Barneys and
Bloomingdale's had reinstated Isaac Mizrahi shops in their stores.
``We were willing to invest in him because of his creativity,''
said Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice president and fashion director of
Bloomingdale's. ``The clothes this season had been selling better
than in many seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The demise of his business, even in the face of this recent
turnaround, illustrates how difficult it has become for his
generation of designers to thrive. Many of the best designers now
routinely hire themselves out to famous and established houses,
primarily in Europe, to support their own lines.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion has become increasingly challenging for companies
existing in a the nebulous middle ground in size and customer
appeal. Mizrahi's is the third prominent fashion business to close
this year. Earlier, Kenar and Andrea Jovine declared bankruptcy and
shut their doors.

   It is a peculiarity of fashion, a hybrid of commerce and art,
that a collection theoretically designed to sell can be lauded and
considered successful even when it does not. Fashion journalists
and store executives often do not see the paradox in this position.
Stores will often carry collections like Mizrahi's for reasons of
prestige and service to a small customer base; Ruttenstein calls
such collections ``fluff.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Mello, president of Bergdorf Goodman, said Mizrahi's line,
although not a top seller, embodied a significant statement of the
store's support of American designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very important representative of American fashion and
we have so much European fashion here at Bergdorf we like to
represent American fashion when we can,'' Ms. Mello said. ``That's
why it's particularly upsetting when we lose a designer collection
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   At Barneys New York, the store has run hot and cold with Mizrahi
since he installed his own shop-within-a-store on the third floor
of the flagship Barneys on Madison Avenue. Two weeks ago, the
department store held a trunk show and luncheon for the designer.
Judy Collinson, an executive vice president, said at the time that
the business had turned around.
</P>
<P>
   While fashion executives nurtured Mizrahi, the harsh realities
of a changing business were setting in. Large brands like Ralph
Lauren are dominating more of the retail space with not only their
top lines but also with cheaper, secondary collections.
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi's foray into a less expensive collection was a disaster.
He opened Isaac, a cheaper line, in 1996 and closed it within three
seasons. This proved the writing on the wall for Chanel. ``We went
into this not so much to invest in a designer line but to invest in
the Isaac line, which never really achieved the volume,'' Rena
said. Mizrahi said, ``The company has never been profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was financially unprepared for the huge demands
stores now put on manufacturers, especially of secondary or bridge
collections; apparel makers are expected to pay for advertising, to
accept unsold goods at the end of the season and even to pay for
sales people. ``The bridge business is based on guarantees to
department stores,'' said Rick Rector, president of the Isaac
Mizrahi Co. ``It was a losing proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fault for the closing of his company must lay with
Mizrahi. Sometimes his clothing owed more to 1950s television
dreamscapes than to women's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad,'' said Liz Tilberis, the editor in chief of
Harper's Bazaar. ``A smile has gone out of the fashion industry.
But the saddest part is we are heading toward a kind of mediocrity.
I mean commercialism. Of course, we have to have commercial clothes
in the stores. But we must have a little madness.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi said on Thursday that he plans to concentrate on his
emerging career as an actor, screenwriter and film producer. But he
is not entirely ready to give himself up to Hollywood. If another
suitable backer came along, he said, he would return to design.
Many predicted that Mizrahi would receive offers to become a
designer for a house other than his own, as many of his
contemporaries have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never imagined my role as a designer diminishing and my role
in film making expanding,'' he said on Thursday, reflecting on the
position in which he has found himself. ``It's not what I dreamed
of 12 years ago. As an artist, I feel there is something noble
about fashion _ I know this sounds pretentious. At this point, I
can't say it's over.''

STRAWBERRY HAS COLON CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ A dark cloud settled over the New York
Yankees Thursday, and it had nothing to do with the American League
playoffs. After arriving here, the Eastern Division champions
discovered that teammate Darryl Strawberry has colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Still numb from the news _ which was relayed from Strawberry in
New York to pitcher Andy Pettitte to manager Joe Torre and then to
the entire team _ Yankee players filed out of their clubhouse at
The Ballpark in Arlington with sad faces. Some shed tears.
</P>
<P>
   But they set aside their emotions for a show of solidarity. At
the start of Thursday night's first ESPN ``SportsCenter'' telecast,
they gathered as a team behind sportscaster Harold Reynolds and
collectively wished Strawberry the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping that Darryl was watching,'' veteran outfielder
Tim Raines said. ``We wanted him to know the whole team was behind
him. We had spoken to Darryl earlier and he didn't want to let
anybody think it was worse than it was. That's the Darryl that we
all know. He wants us to support him. And one of the ways we can do
that is go out and play well in these games.''
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing his second series of tests in as many days at
New York's Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, Strawberry
received the diagnosis. A colonoscopy revealed a maglinant turmor
in his colon about the size of a walnut, and the 36-year-old
outfielder-DH will undergo surgery at Columbia perhaps as early as
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook is encouraging: ``Because of the location (of the
tumor) and his good health, prognosis for a full recovery is
excellent,'' said Yankees spokesman Rick Cerrone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was deep concern on the part of his colleagues, for
whom the news overshadowed any enjoyment they may have taken from
winning the first two games of this best-of-five Division Series in
New York, setting up a chance for a sweep tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something you fear when you know your're going in for
tests,'' said Torre. ``The only thing we can do is just pray and
realize that some of the things we think are really important are
sort of insignificant. We know what we have to do. This ball club
has been able to focus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never faced anything this dramatic, although a couple of
years ago, when David Cone went down with the aneurysm (in his
arm), there was a lot going on. But we came to realize we just had
to do something and deal with it. We have a job to do and we're
pulling for each other. I think everybody realizes this is what he
wants us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry had stayed home Wednesday when the Yankees beat the
Rangers, 3-1, because doctors had dsicovered a growth on his colon.
He had been playing with abdominal pain for the last month or so
but had told none of his teammates and had sought no treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But after a trip to Baltimore and a conversation with Eric Davis
_ his lifelong friend, who this year staged a successful comeback
from colon cancer _ Strawberry was jolted into action. Davis had
reminded him that his cancerous condition began with a similar
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's diagnosis ended what had been a triumphal season for
Strawberry, the onetime Mets sensation who had overcome years of
substance abuse, a tax conviction, marital problems, and injuries
to hit 24 homers for a Yankee team that won a league-record 114
games. Those achievements seemed hollow after the news spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it strikes this close to home,'' said Cone, ``it shakes
you up. Reality sets in. You realize what's more important. It's
amazing to me that Darryl was concerned about the team, the welfare
and mind-set of the team. He said he was proud of the team not
because we won 114 games but because of the type of people we have
on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt Darryl has had a lot of turmoil in his life.
But he really was on the right track. He turned it around and was
one of the team leaders, one of the most respected people in our
clubhouse. He has the strength to beat this. Eric Davis did.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone added that he knew from personal experience that these can
be difficult times for all concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you hear about the kind of tests that are being done,
it's scary. These sort of life-and-death situations supersede
baseball in every way. When you look back and see what's happened
to Dan Quisenberry (Cone's ex-teammate with the Kansas City Royals,
who died of brain cancer Wednesday) and his family, it's tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went through my situation, I didn't understand what was
happening to me. I needed to be educated. I didn't know if it was
life-or-death. I didn't know if my career was over. I'm sure Darryl
has those kind of fears. He doesn't know what's going on. It can be
very confusing and very scary. Our hearts are with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis spoke with Strawberry Thursday morning. He was moved
enough to organize a nationwide press conference to reaffirm his
faith that such a diagnosis doesn't have to be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encouraged Darryl to have faith in the Lord and to lean on
those who love him the most,'' said Davis. ``The one thing we
should learn from this is that this disease can strike any one of
us at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   The players' reaction did not surprise Torre. He has worked hard
to create a club where everybody feels a part of the family.
Strawberry, a marquee star early in his career, was just one of th
guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sort of an extended family,'' Torre said. ``Darryl
spends more time with us than he does with his family. My voice
cracked a little when I told the team. There was complete silence,
some sobbing, and some very sad people. You really don't know what
the right thing is to do. It's sure not comfortable. Darryl just
said he was looking to get this over with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, meanwhile, must return their attention to the task
at hand _ tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood is down right now,'' said Joe Girardi. ``But we all
understand he wouldn't want the team to wear their hearts on their
sleeves. We just go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Petitte, ``He wanted to let everybody know how proud he was
to be a part of this team. We truly respect each other. He said,
`Pray for me.' That's what we plan to do. He assured us that he
would be fine and get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone said he would wear Strawberry's number 39 on the back of
his cap tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's no cheap motivational (ploy),'' he said. ``It just
means I'm going to be ready. I can't say how I will go about it,
but I'll be ready.'

ASTROS TIE SERIES WITH 5-4 VICTORY AGAINST PADRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Ricky Gutierrez may not be fast, just fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Astrodome was shocked and deflated after San Diego Padres
pinch hitter Jim Leyritz's two-out, two-strike, two-run homer tied
the score in the top of the ninth inning. But Gutierrez used his
sneaky speed to eventually score the winning run on Bill Spiers'
single in the Houston Astros' dramatic 5-4 victory yesterday that
knotted their National League Division Series at a game apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the fastest guy we have,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said of Gutierrez. ``But I guess he's fast enough, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   After closer Billy Wagner allowed Leyritz's homer, Gutierrez
started Houston's ninth by beating out a chopper to shortstop for
an infield single. Leyritz dropped Brad Ausmus' foul bunt on a
diving attempt _ ``I overdove,'' Leyritz said. Gutierrez, however,
moved to second as Ausmus got the sacrifice down. Then, after the
Padres brought in closer Trevor Hoffman, Gutierrez shocked San
Diego, Dierker and the entire Dome by stealing third on the first
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't plan it, but they weren't looking at me even a
little,'' Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   The steal, which didn't even draw a throw, drastically changed
San Diego's strategy. Hoffman intentionally walked Craig Biggio,
attempting to set up an inning-ending double play against Spiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great play on Ricky's part,'' Padres manager Bruce
Bochy said. ``I think he surprised us all. It was disheartening.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dierker: ``It was totally on his own. I'm not smart enough
to even consider something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   After swinging feebly at two Hoffman pitches, Spiers poked a
low, 1-2 changeup into right field to plate Gutierrez and give the
Astros their first postseason victory in almost 12 years _ since
Oct. 12, 1986, in Game 4 of the NL Championship Series against the
New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   This best-of-five series shifts tomorrow to San Diego's Qualcomm
Stadium, where the Padres were 54-27 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get it to the outfield any way I could,''
said Spiers, who besides his game-winning single had two early
doubles to help Houston build a 3-0 lead. ``It wasn't pretty, but I
got enough of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting long-awaited life from its star-studded Killer B's, the
Astros struck early. After an 0-for-10 performance in Game 1
dropped the trio of Biggio-Derek Bell-Jeff Bagwell to 2-for-47 over
two playoffs, they responded yesterday with three hits, three runs
scored and four runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros got two hits in eight innings off Kevin Brown in Game
1. They matched that total against Andy Ashby on six pitches.
Biggio started the game with a single up the middle, moved to third
on Spiers' double and scored on Bagwell's groundout to give Houston
its first lead in five playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Houston added two more in the third when Biggio walked, Spiers
again doubled him to third and Bagwell spanked a line-drive single
to center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to come through in a pressure game,'' Biggio said.
``The Killer B's thing is nice when we're winning, but I was
thinking about changing my last name if we'd lost this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros starter Shane Reynolds and his dipping splitter rolled
into the sixth inning allowing just one hit. Consecutive hits by
Quilvio Veras, Steve Finley and Tony Gwynn pulled the Padres within
3-2 before Bell's homer in the eighth gave Wagner a two-run
cushion.
</P>
<P>
   After sandwiching a Ken Caminiti infield single around two outs,
Wagner fed Leyritz a steady diet of 99-mph fastballs before his 3-2
offering was lined just inside the right-field fair pole into the
seats to make it 4-4 and set up Houston's league-leading 28th
victory in its last at-bat this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It blew my mind that it stayed fair,'' said Wagner, who ended
the inning by striking out pinch hitter George Arias with two
runners on. ``But this team hasn't given up all year.''

MUSCLE AND BONE DISORDERS LINKED TO WORKPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences gave ammunition Thursday to
supporters of new occupational safety standards by issuing a report
stating that workplace activities, like lifting and repetitive
motions, often contribute to muscle and skeleton disorders like
back injuries and tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Stating that workplace injuries are a serious national problem,
the academy's report estimated that the cost of these injuries
ranges from $13 billion to $20 billion a year. The report, drawn
from the work of 66 scientists, also concluded that these injuries
can be reduced by numerous safety-related measures.
</P>
<P>
   The academy made its report at the request of Republicans who
are seeking to delay, or even block, the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration from promulgating new guidelines aimed at
reducing musculoskeletal disorders.
</P>
<P>
   With some scientists asserting that many of these injuries are
feigned or stem from psychological problems, many Republicans
maintain that new guidelines are unnecessary, because they see
definitive proof linking workplace conditions to such injuries.
Spurred by business lobbyists, Congress enacted legislation last
year that barred the safety and health administration from issuing
the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of new standards seized on Thursday's report to
assert that it underlines the need for tougher workplace standards.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, said, ``The National
Academy of Sciences report shows that there is no truth to the
claims by some industry groups and conservative Republicans that
there is no scientific evidence that musculoskeletal disorders are
caused by workplace exposures.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Lundeen, spokesman for the National Coalition on
Ergonomics, a Washington-based business group that opposes new
standards, insisted that the report was not a major setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will perhaps send a message to those who want to create
regulations today, but that would be premature,'' Lundeen said.
``It would cost millions of dollars while failing to prevent one
injury. The report says we need more research. We still need to
answer the fundamental questions about how many repetitions are too
many. Until we know something this fundamental, we are rushing to
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that when the scientists studied workplaces
where there were frequent stresses on the upper body, neck and
back, ``the positive relationship between the occurrence of
musculoskeletal disorders and the conduct of work is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy's scientists found that injuries to the upper
extremities could often be found among sawyers and auto assembly
workers, while back injuries were common among material handlers
and hospital workers who lift patients.
</P>
<P>
   The report added that ``there is compelling evidence from
numerous studies'' that as the amount of workplace stress to
muscles and skeleton is reduced, ``the prevalence of
musculoskeletal disorders at the affected body region is likewise
reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous steps, the report said, can be taken to reduce
injuries, like a regimen of exercises for nursing-home workers who
lift patients. The report said additional research would be helpful
to study many aspects of such injuries, like how tissue responds to
repetitive lifting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   Elizabeth Dole first called for new protective guidelines in
1990, when she was secretary of labor, but Congress has blocked
OSHA's efforts to issue such guidelines over the past two years.
Agency officials plan to promulgate such guidelines next summer,
saying they would recommend practices embraced by companies that
have greatly reduced disorders
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said, ``In light
of these strong findings by 66 of the nation's leading scientists,
I hope Congress will reject any further attempts to delay the
development of a protective standard.''

 &HT;    Cubs: Wood's problem is motion
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen and Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Kerry Wood the probable starter for Game 3
Saturday, the Cubs will stress form over pitch count.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said Wood's doctors, trainers and the
right-handed phenom himself have told him that ``it's not going to
be so much with Kerry a matter of how many pitches he throws, as
much as it's going to be the position of his arm when he's
throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood believes the tenderness in his sore elbow, which caused him
to miss all of September, was caused by a mechanical flaw. Wood
threw 51 pitches Monday in an instructional league game in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels when he throws out of a certain slot that it causes
some problems with him,'' Riggleman said. ``What happens is if you
get tired, you tend to drop your arms in that slot where you can
have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggleman said the only reason Wood would not start the first
Chicago home game Saturday would be if the Braves are swinging the
bat well against right-handers and he decides to go with Terry
Mulholland, a left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ``Kerry's repertoire is kind of exceptional from
just about everybody else, so that would weigh heavier in our
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Still working
</P>
<P>
   Rookies Marty Malloy, who toiled seven years in the system
before the Braves called him up Sept. 6, and Odalis Perez, who was
chosen instead of World Series veteran Norm Charlton, survived the
cut to the Braves' 25-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   Malloy will be insurance at second base for Keith Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long ride, and it's been a fun ride,'' Malloy
said. ``This is what dreams are made of and something I'll cherish.
Hopefully, I'll get an opportunity to do something to help this
team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, a 20-year-old left-hander who made his major-league debut
Sept. 1, has an 0-1 record and 4.22 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm capable,'' Perez said. ``I am not surprised. In
the 10 times I've been pitching here, I've had one bad outing. The
other nine times, I think I've been doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Special feelings for Atlanta Jeff Blauser, in his first
postseason with a team other than the Braves, said about playing
his former team, ``I don't know if I would call it special. I have
a feeling about playing (here), but they're still the opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   The shortstop, who lives in Alpharetta, pinch-hit in the eighth
inning Wednesday and flew out to left. ``Oh, sure, I would have
liked to have started,'' said Blauser, who was on the DL Aug.
25-Sept. 9 with an elbow irritation, ``but I understand I haven't
started a whole lot over the last month, so it wasn't a surprise.
You still have an opportunity to do something big in the
postseason, come off the bench, like Matt Mieske did (against the
Giants).''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch!
</P>
<P>
   What looked like a head-butt was really a congratulatory hug
gone awry as Chipper Jones greeted Ryan Klesko at the plate
following Klesko's grand slam. ``I wanted to give him a bear hug,
but he dropped his head and almost knocked out three of my teeth,''
Jones said. ``I'll be better prepared next time.''

 &HT;    Cubs a veritable bye in opening round
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Doomsday Scenario didn't hit. There will be no Big
Unit in Round 1, no Trevor Hoffman, either. Instead, the Braves get
a fragile opponent with a fried pitching staff. Bobby Cox's
protestations to the contrary, sometimes his team does get lucky.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so there was a bit of skill involved. The Braves swept the
Mets, thereby defusing the division series danger. San Diego
would've been rough, San Diego followed by Houston perhaps
undoable. This way is eminently doable. Now the Astros, the single
greatest threat, have the more perilous trek. Now the Braves can
sit and wait for the dust out West to settle.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs? The Cubs are a veritable bye. The Cubs made the
playoffs only after trying hard not to. They wasted a seven-run
lead in Game No. 158 and a two-run lead in No. 162. They nearly
lost a five-run lead against San Francisco on Monday. In that game
Chicago used three starting pitchers _ a fourth warmed up _ and the
gassed-out Rod Beck, who's now the softest-throwing closer since
Hoyt Wilhelm.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the Cub bullpen, the Braves' relievers look as
impregnable as Fort Knox. In how many postseason series has this
team held an edge there? The way to beat the Braves in the playoffs
is to have your starting pitchers keep it close and then let your
bullpen win it. The Cubs can manage neither.
</P>
<P>
   The heralded Kerry Wood might not work in the series, his prized
arm tired from the strain of so many strikeouts. That leaves the
likes of Kevin Tapani, Steve Trachsel, Mark Clark and Terry
Mulholland. This does not compare to Smoltz-Glavine-Maddux. The
Cubs cannot match pitches with the Braves. Their only hope is for
some wind-blowing-out atrocities in Wrigley, but even there the
Braves catch a break.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the better team has been forced to open on the
road. (Not that it much bothered the Braves, who are 6-0 away in
the division series.) There was always the possibility of immediate
trouble. No more. Baseball has righted that inequity. The Braves
should have two games in the bank by the time they see Chicago,
whereupon the Cubs will go quietly. They've already had their
wild-card party, not to mention the various celebrations involving
Sammy Sosa. Time now for this flawed bunch to go the way of all
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say that the Braves are invincible. A strong and
determined opponent can take them. Houston seems such a team, but
Houston must first survive San Diego, which is no lock. And the
Padres, who might have upended the Braves in a best-of-five,
probably don't have the depth of starting pitching to do it in
best-of-seven.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how bleak everything seemed three weeks ago? The Braves
were unraveling, in need of a hoary clubhouse meeting, in danger of
losing the league's best record. Things have changed. The Braves
finished hot. They got a kind draw. It's possible they could reach
the World Series without seeing Houston. This is still not a great
assemblage by Braves standards, those 106 wins notwithstanding, but
it might be good enough. It is way too good to lose to the Cubs.
Braves sweep.

 &HT;    Strawberry leaves park before game
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Darryl Strawberry left Yankee Stadium before
Wednesday's game and the Yankees are not sure when he is going to
be able to play.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said doctors had discovered something the size of ``a
pimple'' on his colon. More tests were planned for today, a travel
day for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   While he is on the active roster for this divisional series
against the Rangers, Strawberry continues to be bothered by
mysterious abdominal pains.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee manager Joe Torre did not disclose what Strawberry told
him about his medical condition. The Yankees did not detail his
condition, either. But Torre did say, ``Cancer always comes to
mind. It's something you're taught to fear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was feeling better,'' said Strawberry, 36. ``Anybody
would be a little concerned because the problem I am having is
inside my body. It's not like a baseball injury or anything. No one
really knows what it is.'' Strawberry played in 101 games this
season, used both as an outfielder and designated hitter and hit
.247 with 24 homers and 57 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   An awesome Wells
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's John Smoltz may be considered the game's most
productive postseason pitcher, but Yankees left-hander David Wells
is not far behind. After his win Tuesday night, Wells is now 5-0 in
the postseason and has a string of 15 consecutive scoreless
innings. Smoltz is 11-3 in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Bomber talk
</P>
<P>
   Yankees general manager Brian Cashman is awaiting the birth of
his first child, which could come any time. Will Cashman be able to
travel with the club this weekend to Texas? ``If the doctor says it
could happen this weekend, I will have to talk to the Boss (George
Steinbrenner),'' he said. ... Reportedly, Yankees manager Torre has
agreed to a two-year contract extension that would begin after the
1999 season. Torre is making $1 million a year. ... How big are the
Yankees in New York? Despite it being only a divisional playoff
game, they graced the front pages Wednesday of the Daily News, Post
and Newsday. It must have been a slow day in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ranger talk
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were upset that the Yankees had given them just 40
tickets for each of the games in New York. ``We have too much class
to do it, but we should give him (Steinbrenner) the same treatment
when we get back to Texas,'' a Ranger front office executive told
the New York Post. This issue goes back to the 1996 playoffs when
Steinbrenner thought the wives of Rangers players were cheering too
loudly.

 &HT;    Astros jet past Padres, head straight to San Diego
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It was ugly as the wicked Texas heat outdoors, and
about as draining. But desperate for any post-season good, the
Astros gladly took the win and headed for San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of being down two games in the best-of-five NL
Division Series, the Astros pulled out a 5-4 win Thursday night
when Bill Spiers lofted Padre closer Trevor Hamilton's ninth-inning
change up into right field. The Padres tied it in dramatic fashion
earlier in the ninth on pinch-hitter Jim Leyritz' towering two-run
home inside the right field foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't look good on the first two change ups he threw me,''
said Spiers, who went down in the strike zone to hit the 1-2 pitch.
''After that, I was just trying to get the bat on the ball and get
it to the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ''Looking at the replay, I was pretty lucky to get enough of the
bat on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than walk Spiers and load the bases with one-out, the
Padres elected to face him rather than Derek Bell and then
potentially cleanup hitter Jeff Bagwell. Bell had broken an
0-for-20 post-season slump with a homer in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   It could prove to be a huge victory for the psyche of the
Astros, victims of a three-game sweep by the Braves last year and
Kevin Brown's 16-strikeout performance in Game 1 of this series.
Their hitters had come under scrutiny for putting up just six runs
in those four games.
</P>
<P>
   ''This takes an awful lot of pressure off,'' said manager Larry
Dierker. ''These things grow larger than they are.''

 &HT;    Bad news, Killer B's: Ashby healthy again
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Andy Ashby swears he's healthy again, and that could
spell more bad news for the Astros' silent bats.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby (17-9) opposes Shane Reynolds (19-8) in a battle of
right-handers this afternoon in Game 2 of the National League
Division Series. Ashby has been troubled by tendinitis in his hip
late in the season, going winless in six starts before picking up a
victory in his final regular-season start against the Los Angeles
Dodgers. His ERA was 8.70 in that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw (Monday) for about 20 minutes, and I think the big
thing is the way I threw in my last two starts,'' Ashby said.
``Before the last two starts, I hadn't been able to do any side
work because of the tendinitis. It's a big plus to throw on the
side and not have any pain at all.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not what the Astros want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Although leading the NL in runs scored this season _ thanks in
part to the additions of Moises Alou and Carl Everett _ Houston
hitters flailed aimlessly at Kevin Brown in Game 1. In the last
four postseason games, including last year's three-game sweep by
the Braves, the Astros have scored a total of six runs.
</P>
<P>
   In those four games, the Killer B's _ Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell
and Derek Bell _ are a staggering 2-for-47 with 15 strikeouts. Bell
is 0-for-17 in the postseason, fanning three times in Game 1
against Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure at all,'' Bell said after Wednesday's
voluntary workout. ``It's three games last year and one this year.
That's just four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give credit to the guys we faced. When you face (Greg) Maddux,
(John) Smoltz and Kevin Brown _ do you want to go up and hit
against them? Here's the bat; you go do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cy Young campaign
</P>
<P>
   While Braves left-hander Tom Glavine has his Cy Youngsupporters,
Padres reliever Trevor Hoffman seems to rank as the favorite in the
Houston clubhouse. Hoffman saved an NL-record 53 games in 54
chances and allowed just two home runs all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trevor is having a Cy Young year, and he should be the Cy
Young winner in our league without a doubt,'' said second baseman
Biggio, who himself is in the MVP chase.
</P>
<P>
   But Padres manager Bruce Bochy probably did the Astros a favor
in the ninth inning of Game 1 when he pulled Brown in favor of
Hoffman. Houston scratched out an unearned run before losing 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Rotation Shuffle
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern product Joey Hamilton has been skipped over in
favor of left-hander Sterling Hitchcock for the Game 3 start and
will work out of the bullpen this series. In making the move, Bochy
said it came down to Hitchcock (9-7) pitching better in the second
half than Hamilton (13-13).

 &HT;    Tucker's HR provides little bit of redemption
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As soon as Michael Tucker saw Sammy Sosa looking up
Wednesday afternoon, his season started doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's two-run homer in the second inning of the Braves' 7-1
victory over the Cubs changed the right fielder's fortunes from
second-half slump to postseason productivity.
</P>
<P>
   With two out, Andruw Jones on second and pitcher John Smoltz on
deck, Tucker hit a 3-2 pitch from Mark Clark into the right-field
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little bit excited about it,'' Tucker said. ``I just
wanted to make sure (if it hit off the wall) that I was going to
get to second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked out and Sammy was turned around looking up. I said,
`OK, that's two runs. Now if we can get a couple more, and Smoltzie
holds them out, we can win the ballgame.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Big hits, even base hits, had been scarce for Tucker lately. He
had only one home run since Aug. 9, and was batting .186
(29-for-156) since the All-Star break. Before the break, he had 72
hits including 11 HRs and 36 RBIs, and was batting .277.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty depressing,'' Tucker said. ``You have a great
first half, 11 home runs, and you're looking forward to doing the
same thing the second half and things just went downhill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start looking at everything, you think you found the
answer, and things don't seem to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   He started to improve the last couple of weeks. And thanks to
his defensive play, including a highlights-tape catch of a ball he
almost misplayed in the third inning, Braves manager Bobby Cox
never yanked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike has never given up and has been hitting the ball better
lately,'' Cox said. ``He hit a bullet today and the ball was really
crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark threw a split-finger fastball he was trying to get down
and away, like he'd done with the previous pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hung it, and got it over the plate,'' said Tucker, who was
1-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Jim Riggleman didn't second-guess Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't execute the way he wanted to, but the thought was
right,'' Riggleman said. ``He threw a forkball and it didn't look
like a forkball and didn't act like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tucker's home run in Game 5 of the NLCS was his only
hit in 10 at-bats against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need him to have a big series, a big postseason,'' Chipper
Jones said. ``I don't think you really can comprehend the
importance of having somebody at the bottom of the lineup swinging
the bat well. It certainly takes a lot of the pressure off the guys
up top and in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully he'll go home and sleep easy tonight and bring some
confidence back to the park with him tomorrow.''

 &HT;    Cubs' biggest foe is history, not Braves
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This really isn't fair. While the Atlanta Braves have
just a single foe to conquer during this portion of the National
League Division Series, the Chicago Cubs must battle a couple.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are the easiest of the two. So this is awful news for
the Cubs, especially since they spent Wednesday at Turner Field
watching the Braves roll to the easiest of 7-1 victories during the
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the Braves overcame the apathy of the snoozing 45,598
reportedly in the stands to do everything right. When the Braves
weren't performing the big things, such as clobbering the Cubs
after a two-out error with a two-run homer from Michael Tucker and
Ryan Klesko's grand slam in the seventh, they were performing the
little things, such as pushing a runner from first to third on a
single and scoring on a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, for the Cubs, the Braves never stopped playing defense,
never stopped pitching, never stopped looking as if they were way
too potent for their weary visitors. The Cubs had that extra game
to play Monday night in Chicago against the San Francisco Giants.
As a result, with the New York Mets gasping toward oblivion, the
Cubs became the best of the least down the stretch for a wild-card
berth.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the Giants, the Mets, the Braves or anybody else
the Cubs are facing at the moment, the Cubs always have their
second and mightiest opponent in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Cubs history, and it's brutal. Just ask Greg Maddux,
baseball's pitching Picasso, who figures to save the Cubs from
extended misery by helping the Braves sweep their way to the NL
Championship Series on Saturday in Chicago. Well, this depends on
Braves pitcher Tom Glavine becoming his typically clutch self
tonight at the Ted, ... but so much for details.
</P>
<P>
   Let's return to Maddux, an expert who spent seven years in
Chicago through 1992. ``You heard about the past every day there,''
Maddux says. ``Even the music they played at the ballpark was from
the old days.''
</P>
<P>
   Those old days often begin with 1945, when some Chicago bar
owner said he was placing a hex on the Cubs for not allowing him to
parade his billy goat around the field before the last World Series
at Wrigley Field. That was the last World Series at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Cubs have suffered everything from last year's
0-14 start, to those awful seasons of rotating coaches as managers,
to former manager Lee Elia barking something like ``85 percent of
Chicago works and the rest boo the Cubs at Wrigley,'' to Leon
Durham becoming Bill Buckner before Bill Buckner during an NLCS, to
tons of June Swoons, to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Always 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Williams definitely remembers. ``So do Ron Santo (a Cubs
announcer) and Phil Regan (the Cubs' pitching coach),'' says
Williams, the Cubs' batting coach, mentioning those others who
joined him on that Cubs team that blew an 8 1/2-game lead against
the Mets in late August to finish 9 1/2 games behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``In tough times for this team, we (Williams, Santo and Regan)
always get questions about what happened in 1969, but these guys
don't know anything about those days,'' Williams says. After all,
Williams recalls how the current Cubs won miracle games at Wrigley
this season that included balls getting stuck in the ivy and down a
drain.
</P>
<P>
   There also is the ghost of Harry Caray pushing the current Cubs,
but ghosts are no match for Smoltz, Glavine and Maddux.

RANGERS SEEK BENEFITS OF SHUFFLED LINEUP, HOME FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ New York Yankees right-hander David Cone
expressed a degree of apprehension yesterday regarding his
scheduled start for Game 3 tonight of this American League Division
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a dangerous team right now,'' Cone said, ``and I
realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone chose a peculiar adjective to describe the AL West champion
Rangers, who, in losing the first two games at Yankee Stadium:
</P>
<P>
   Scored one run in 18 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hit .156 (10-for-64) and drew only one walk.
</P>
<P>
   Witnessed their Nos. 3-6 hitters _ left fielder Rusty Greer,
right fielder Juan Gonzalez, first baseman Will Clark and catcher
Ivan Rodriguez _ hit .129 (4-for-31) with one double and one run
batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of scares me to tell you the truth,'' said Cone, one
of four major-league pitchers to win 20 games this season. ``I know
in a five-game series that the momentum can swing in the course of
one game or one play. They're back in their home park, and they
play well here. So, it's my job to not let them get any momentum
going their way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will advance to the AL Championship Series with a
victory tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' offense might benefit from the return of two
left-handed batters to their lineup, center fielder Tom Goodwin and
designated hitter Lee Stevens, against the right-handed Cone (20-7,
3.55 earned-run average).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only been two games, but it just so happens to be a
five-game series,'' said Goodwin, who did not start either of the
previous two games against left-handers David Wells and Andy
Pettitte. ``I really don't see us being in some prolonged slump. I
don't see anyone panicking around here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two outstanding pitching performances, too. We showed
that we could match them pitch for pitch. We just need to get that
clutch hit here and there and maybe we can turn those close games
to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, one of the league's fastest players, will bat leadoff.
Goodwin's speed makes it easier for the Rangers to manufacture runs
through stolen bases and running from first to third on singles to
the outfield. He hit .324 in September.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also will regain the bat of Stevens, who hit .387
(12-for-31) with four home runs and seven RBI in his final 10
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also might benefit by returning home.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' .304 batting average at The Ballpark represented
the highest mark at home by an AL team since the 1984 Red Sox hit
.305 at Fenway Park. The Rangers averaged 6.20 runs per game at The
Ballpark, compared to a .274 batting average and 5.41 runs per game
in road contests.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also need the heart of their order _ Greer,
Gonzalez, Clark and Rodriguez _ to produce, although that foursome
would not be the only players struggling at the plate in this
series.
</P>

   The Yankees' first five hitters _ second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch, shortstop Derek Jeter, right fielder Paul O'Neill,
center fielder Bernie Williams and first baseman Tino Martinez _
hit .121 (4-for-33) in the series' first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there were times this season when our No. 3, 4, 5 and
6 hitters haven't done anything, but we knew we had 85 games
remaining or whatever the case may have been,'' Greer said. ``Now,
we're in a five-game series _ and those 12 to 20 at-bats become
more magnified.''
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse.

<P>
   ``I think the first thing to remember is that we cannot win
three games tomorrow night,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said,
``and you cannot get three hits in one at-bat.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A wisp of for-want-of-a-nail retrospection wafts
about the scandal now as lawyers for President Clinton rekindle
settlement talks with his original nemesis in the arena of sexual
misconduct charges, Paula Corbin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   If only, begin the might-have-beens, the Supreme Court had not
decided to allow a president to be sued while in office. Or if only
Clinton had managed to settle out of court earlier with Ms. Jones,
the outraged Arkansas office worker whose civil-suit charges of
sexual harassment, later dismissed, exploded into the dizzying
events of this year that have Clinton laboring to stave off
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this is happening,'' said Joseph Cammarata,
one of Ms. Jones' original lawyers from four years back, pondering
the sulfurous chain of events _ from the spark of a marginal
lawsuit to the cloud of looming impeachment charges _ ``this
dragnet of discovery,'' in the president's angry words.
</P>
<P>
   As someone there at the beginning, Cammarata looks back through
the might-have-beens and sees a folly-steeped, nonlethal variation
on a timeless capital notion: if only Lincoln hadn't gone to the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed how it started as a simple small lawsuit: a young
woman wants her day in court against the most powerful man in the
world, she winds up with a 9-to-nothing victory in the Supreme
Court, and here we all are,'' said Cammarata, speaking in his
office six blocks from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, with new lawyers at the helm, was dismissed on April
1, but not before the president was grilled for six hours about
sex. He denied in that deposition that he had had sexual relations
with Monica S. Lewinsky, and the now endlessly parsed denial is at
the heart of the impeachment struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Cammarata and his partner, Gilbert K. Davis, warned Ms. Jones
last year, shortly before she dismissed them, that in rejecting a
settlement offer of $700,000 _ one that would have spared the
president the Lewinsky investigation and impeachment
recommendations of the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr _ she was foolishly switching from defending her own good
name to trying to prove that ``Clinton is a bad person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' new lawyers, from Donovan Campbell Jr.'s Dallas firm,
argue that the president's lately confessed deeds speak far louder
than ``his false and empty words'' of denial that he sexually
accosted her. While trying to reinstate her suit, they are asking
for a $1 million settlement and dropping the sticking point in the
failed negotiations of the past: the demand for a clear apology
from Clinton _ ``the apology that will never happen,'' as Cammarata
warned Ms. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting for the phone to ring,'' said a smiling Cammarata,
speaking as a warrior in the legions of lawyers who, whatever the
state of the Republic, retain a lucrative stake in the president's
serial legal troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I'll inure some benefit,'' he said, referring to the
$800,000 lien that he and Davis claim on any settlement Ms. Jones
and her new lawyers manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, pigs get slaughtered, OK?'' the lawyer added, his
native Brooklyn street tone clear as he talked of avoiding a
mercenary settlement fight among Ms. Jones and her old and new
lawyers. ``If someone wants to be a pig about it, they get
slaughtered.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a spirit do the might-have-beens tinge the political
autumn here, centering on not one but two aggrieved spouses:
</P>
<P>
   If only Hillary Rodham Clinton had been more amenable to her
husband's making an earlier concession to Ms. Jones, muse some
Clinton defenders, as if the First Lady, and not the president,
were the ultimate client in Clinton's predicament.
</P>
<P>
   If only, say others, Steve Jones, the furious husband of Paula,
had not set out to make the president ``feel his pain,'' as
Cammarata puts it, by feeding her demand for a presidential
apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going to have to confess to everything on our terms,''
Jones said of the president early on. ``Those people in Washington
just don't seem to understand that being called a whore means
something, something we can't live with,'' he declared, incensed at
the ``trailer trash'' denunciations laughingly heaped on his wife
by the president's political operatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve's a strong guy,'' Cammarata said, speaking with the tone
of sympathy others show Mrs. Clinton for her mix of personal
forbearance and combative dismissal of her husband's critics.
``Steve felt his wife was being abused, and he wanted to do
something to equalize things.''
</P>
<P>
   Cammarata's might-have-beens are strictly about the president.
``He could have put this matter behind him,'' the lawyer said,
``but they were being cute, stalling it beyond the re-election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And later it could have been avoided, even if the president
didn't settle the suit, if he had simply told the truth in his
deposition,'' Cammarata added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president put himself in this position,'' Cammarata
asserted, sitting, as he said, right by the phone, which suddenly
rang. His secretary had a potential client on the line, a woman
with a sexual harassment grievance she felt strongly about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take her number,'' he instructed, ``and tell her I'll call her
back.''

BIG EUROPEAN MARKETS FALL STEEPLY, WITH GERMANY WORST

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ European stock markets, notably Germany's,
plunged Thursday, as investors across the Continent seemed to
conclude that they are no longer insulated from crises elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and other financial institutions were among the biggest
losers, battered by fears of more losses related to Asia, Russia
and Latin America as well as by the shock waves from the
near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the American hedge
fund.
</P>
<P>
   But traders and analysts said that Thursday's declines seemed to
be driven more by a general anxiety than by specific news
developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing really specific behind it,'' said Martin
Coughlin, a European equity trader with Salomon Smith Barney in
London. ``I think people are waking up to the fact that we are in a
bear market.''
</P>
<P>
   Though European markets had seemed relatively stable, analysts
said investors had become convinced that the Continent was in for a
measurable slowdown in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's benchmark DAX stock index fell 7.59 percent, with
renewed fears about the vulnerability of the nation's biggest
banks. Dresdner Bank, which acknowledged Wednesday that it would
have to take additional write-offs, dropped nearly 8 percent, to
57.20 marks _ roughly $34.50. Commerzbank dropped 9 percent, to
41.40 marks.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors circulated all day that more European banks would report
write-offs or take provisions for loan losses. The fears have been
in the air for months, but became more noticeable last week with
the bailout of Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   UBS AG of Switzerland, Europe's biggest bank, announced last
week that it would lose more than $700 million because of the
global financial crises and its exposure to Long-Term Capital.
Thursday, UBS rattled nerves again by announcing plans for a news
conference Friday morning in Zurich. Though bank industry
executives doubted that UBS would report more bad news a week after
its last disclosure, many investors were convinced that any news
would be bad news.
</P>
<P>
   But there was plenty to worry about elsewhere. German automakers
and chemical companies saw their stocks sink amid fears that
exports would be hurt by Asian recessions and by the recent
increase in the value of the mark, which makes German goods more
expensive elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Most other European markets were caught up in Thursday's selling
_ including London, Paris and Madrid. Blue chips in London sank
3.08 percent. The CAC index of leading stocks in Paris plunged 5
percent. Spain took nearly as hard a hit as Germany, with the
benchmark index losing 7.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Serge Vanheurck, a stockbroker at Kredietbank in Brussels, said
investors had suffered an abrupt and substantial loss of nerve.
``It is a pure loss of confidence,'' he said. ``People have lost
confidence in the stock market in general, and in the European
stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's fall in prices may also have been a correction from
too much complacency, as the storm clouds from Asia and elsewhere
became more ominous. Some analysts began noting six months ago that
European companies had been noticeably slower than American
companies to lower earnings forecasts, and warned of earnings
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   European investors have tended to be more averse to risk than
Americans. But in the first half of the year, European markets _
fueled by a long-awaited cyclical recovery and a rush into stocks _
grew faster than markets in the United States. Now they are falling
faster, as sentiment shifts from a fear of being left out to a fear
of being left in.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists pinned their hopes late Thursday on a recovery in the
Dow Jones industrial average, but they were disappointed when Wall
Street opened sharply lower. The markets sank even deeper. ``It
brought tears to your eyes,'' said Peter Pietsch, a spokesman for
Commerzbank.
</P>
<P>
   If there were not many concrete news developments Thursday,
there were reasons to feel grim. One was the International Monetary
Fund's unusually bleak forecast Wednesday for the world economy,
which envisioned growth slowing by half to about 2 percent for
1998.
</P>
<P>
   There was also new evidence Thursday that European exports,
which have been the engine of growth in Germany and France, are
sputtering. Michael Rogowski, head of the German machine-tool
manufacturers' association, said foreign orders dropped 4 percent
in August. The industry is cutting its growth forecast for 1998 to
4 percent from 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rogowski said the Asian crisis had become worse than companies
expected. But exports could also be hurt by a recent decline in the
dollar's value, relative to the German mark and other European
currencies. The dollar has dropped from 1.8 marks in August to 1.64
marks Thursday, hastened lately by the Federal Reserve's reduction
of U.S. interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Parrying a rare wave of criticism, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan on Thursday defended the central bank's
role in averting the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management LP,
saying that it had acted out of concern for the stability of the
financial markets rather than a desire to assist the investment
firm's wealthy owners.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the House Banking Committee alongside William
McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
Greenspan built a case that it was the central bank's
responsibility to play a role in addressing a crisis whose effects
could extend far beyond the fate of Long-Term Capital's owners,
investors and lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial market participants were already unsettled by recent
global events,'' Greenspan said, referring to the spread into
Russia and Latin America of the financial crisis that began last
year in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the failure of LTCM triggered the seizing up of markets,
substantial damage could have been inflicted on many market
participants, including some not directly involved in the firm, and
could have potentially impaired the economies of many nations,
including our own,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is usually heaped with praise for his stewardship of
the economy when he appears before Congress. But Thursday, two days
after cutting interest rates by one-quarter point to help insulate
the United States from the global crisis, he heard respectful but
nonetheless pointed questions and doubts from members of both
parties about the Federal Reserve's involvement in saving a risky
investment fund that catered to some of the wealthiest people.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers expressed considerable reservations about the
Federal Reserve's decision to use its influence to buy some time
for Long-Term Capital last week by helping to arrange a $3.6
billion rescue package from a group of big banks and investment
houses. And they asked whether the Fed and other regulators should
do more to regulate hedge funds and their sophisticated financial
dealings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., said the message from Washington to
welfare mothers and small businesses had been ``that it's not the
job of the federal government to rescue you.''
</P>
<P>
   The same message, he said, ``ought to also apply to rich
Greenwich, Connecticut, investors who are multimillionaires, that
we ought to use the same standards that we've used on the welfare
mothers on these large hedge funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., said there seemed to be a gap between
free market theory and decisions made by policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear a lot of speeches about free enterprise and the
marketplace, but a lot of folks don't like to practice it,'' he
said. ``The problem we have as representing our constituencies is
that there seem to be two rules, a double standard: one for Main
Street and another one for Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the committee's chairman, questioned
whether the Fed's efforts to put together a rescue package raised
antitrust concerns. He also questioned whether it had undermined a
separate offer from a group including multibillionaire investor
Warren Buffett and Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of that offer were reportedly less attractive to
Long-Term Capital's owners, including its founder, John Meriwether,
than the deal later struck by the group assembled by the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the only smart deal of the month that Long-Term
Capital did was they played the Fed off against another party,''
Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   Other members seemed to be searching in frustration for ways to
contain the risks posed by a small number of investment firms
operating outside the regulatory system, that use vast amounts of
borrowed money to make sophisticated financial market bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we are going to be comforted that the regulators
do now, in fact, have plans in place that would help avert such
unfortunate circumstances in our future,'' said Rep. Richard Baker,
R-La.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, however, stuck to his position that it would be
difficult or even counterproductive to impose more direct
regulation on the sophisticated investment firms known as hedge
funds. Regulating hedge funds, Greenspan said, would drive them to
operate from other nations with looser regulatory structures,
undermining the ability of the United States to monitor them even
indirectly through their lenders and investors.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to rein in gambling by those firms, Greenspan said,
was to encourage their lenders to assess more rigorously the risks
they are taking, and deny credit to those whose bets become unwise.
In that way, he said, banking supervisors and other regulators can
act as a second line of defense by pushing lenders to make sure
their risk assessments are adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from members of the committee, Greenspan
admitted that same approach had failed in the case of Long-Term
Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   But he said such failures were inevitable in markets, that he
had been surprised at how few there had been in the last five years
and that he expected more of them in the future. Moreover, he said,
if the financial system is unwilling to assume risks, the economy's
ability to grow would be impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not presume that the ideal outcome is more regulation,''
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from members of the committee to explain why
Long-Term Capital's troubles justified help from the Fed in
arranging a rescue plan, Greenspan and McDonough said no taxpayer
money was used and that the case should not be seen as a precedent
for future intervention in the marketplace by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they said, although the Fed brought all the players
together, the deal that emerged stripped Long-Term Capital's owners
of all but 10 percent of their stakes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Greenspan said, the plan ``may well work to
reduce the ultimate losses to the original owners of LTCM, but that
was a byproduct, perhaps unfortunate, of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that the case raised questions about
what economists call moral hazard _ the idea that rescuing
investors from a bet gone bad encourages further overly risky bets.
</P>
<P>
   But wiping out investors through a forced liquidation of the
sort that Long-Term Capital faced would have made investors perhaps
too frightened to take risks, Greenspan said, hurting the economy's
ability to grow. As a result, he suggested, it is appropriate to
intervene in the markets to stem potential panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Risk taking is a necessary condition for wealth creation,'' he
said. ``The optimum degree of risk aversion should be governed by
rational judgments about the marketplace, not the fear flowing from
fire sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maurice Hinchey, D-N.Y., pressed Greenspan on his
opposition to further regulation of exotic securities called
derivatives, which are essentially bets on the direction of stocks,
bonds, currencies and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan replied that the ``degree of supervision and
regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite
adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system.'' He
supported language in a spending bill now before Congress that
would prevent the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from
proceeding with an effort to develop tighter regulations on
derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   But Brooksley Born, the chairwoman of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, later stepped up her warnings of the perils of
not requiring more disclosure from banks and investment firms of
their derivatives positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lack of basic information about the positions held by OTC
derivatives users and the nature and extent of their exposures
potentially allows OTC derivatives market participants to take
positions that may threaten our regulated markets or, indeed, our
economy with any federal agency knowing about it,'' Ms. Born told
the committee.

RISK A SWEEP OR A SOSA, BUT TAKE YOUR SHOT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ At this bleak postseason point on the local
baseball front, it grieves both me and Tom Grieve to bring up Sammy
Sosa's name.
</P>
<P>
   It's nine long years since the worst trade in Rangers history,
but like with the Titanic, people still try to raise it _ this
season more than ever, for 66 obvious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The unfunny thing is, what has surfaced this week involves a
roundabout connection between the infamous 1989 trading of a young
Sammy, and the Rangers' current 0-2 skunking in the American League
Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   To get here, meaning the playoffs and a must-win Game 3 at The
Ballpark in Arlington tonight, general manager Doug Melvin had to
be a busy and successful dealer in late July. Incoming in his
trades were Todd Stottlemyre, Royce Clayton and Todd Zeile. Without
them, the Rangers would have been as broken as Will Clark's toe.
</P>
<P>
   But out-going in July were, among others, young third baseman
Fernando Tatis, who was in a bit deep at this stage of his career
because the Rangers had rushed him. Given time, however, and there
are many scouting eyes who predict Tatis can become another ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Sosa,'' said Melvin, rather calmly. ``I heard the Sosa
comparisons in meetings with our own baseball people, plus I lean
in that direction myself. That's why in July, with Tatis' name
coming up all the time from other clubs, I originally was very firm
in saying, ``no-no-no.''
</P>
<P>
   Grieve, the former GM and now a Rangers TV voice, wishes he had
stuck to his ``nada'' back in '89. He didn't want to trade Sosa,
nor kid pitcher Wilson Alvarez, but acquiring designated hitter
Harold Baines from the White Sox appeared to be a swell idea at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve and manager Bobby Valentine thought Baines provided the
answer to the franchise's finally winning a divisional title.
Instead, Baines sulked silently though the second half, and the
Rangers were 16 games back when a mercy-kill came with the end of
the season. For Grieve, however, there's still no mercy from that
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In baseball, the general rule is if you make a Sosa-Alvarez
kind of trade, or a Tatis kind of trade, you had better win,''
Melvin said. ``I don't know how Tatis or a couple of other lower
minor-league kids we traded in July will eventually pan out. But
the object was to win the division, get in the playoffs, take your
chances. And this team accomplished that.''
</P>
<P>
   But for what? To go into Yankee Stadium this week, sink into a
run-less trance, waste good pitching, and come home in a hopeless,
miracle-seeking state?
</P>
<P>
   Why, let's see, you have to go all the way back to ... to ... to
1995 it was, for the last time a team with a 2-0 lead in the first
round gagged the series by blowing three straight. The Yankees did
that against Seattle. See, all the Yankees heritage isn't glorious.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, back to Melvin and his July trading spree. Voices of
displeasure were heard locally, using the theory that no matter
what the Rangers did, they'd draw the Yankees in the first round,
and be swept. So big deal, don't waste prospects or time. Forget
the AL West. Give it to the Angels. Start regrouping for '99.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the dumbest baseball thing I'd ever hear _ actually,
it was beyond the dumbest. But those voices were many, and now, as
wrong as they were, they can still claim to be right, certainly if
the Yankees sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong,'' said Melvin. ``First, we're not out of this series
yet. I obviously don't like our position, but if the bats suddenly
come around, who knows. Here in Arlington, we're a better team in
all areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I didn't understand was how anyone who has followed the
history of this franchise, think winning a division is not
important. I heard some people say it (in July), and I couldn't
believe it. Where had they been for 25 years?''
</P>
<P>
   As in the 25 years it took the Rangers to crack the postseason
with a divisional title. Now there have been two in three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin: ``To start with, winning creates the right atmosphere
for our players, our fans who support us so well, and even for free
agents who are looking around every winter. We all know money
talks, but if things are close to equal, free agents want to be in
a good city and on a team that has a chance to win. We can provide
both.
</P>
<P>
   ``What winning the division this time does is help build on a
winning tradition. It's very important we create that. And if you
keep winning a division, sooner or later you will find a World
Series. The Denver Broncos did in football. We can, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin admits he will watch Tatis' career in St. Louis with much
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my biggest worry is Game 3,'' he said, smiling. ``And in
the future, we will all concern ourselves with being involved in a
lot more postseasons. I like it here in the playoffs, and whatever
it takes to get here, that's the one and only objective.''

WIFE WINS RIGHT-TO-DIE CASE; THEN A GOVERNOR CHALLENGES IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., Ky.)   (af)  
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Virginia judge ruled Thursday that a woman could
remove the feeding tube that has kept her comatose husband alive in
a vegetative state for more than three years, but Gov. James S.
Gilmore III ordered almost immediately that an appeal of the ruling
be taken to the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Michele Finn, was given the right to allow her
husband, Hugh, 44, to die in a nursing home, and she excoriated
Gilmore for having intervened and ``putting me through sheer
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They obviously have total disregard for me and my husband's
wishes _ not only for me, but for the laws of this state,'' Mrs.
Finn said at the Prince William County Circuit Court in Manassas, a
suburb of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   She maintained that her husband, a patient at the Annaburg Manor
Nursing Home in Manassas, would not have wanted to remain in a
vegetative state.
</P>
<P>
   Lila Young, Gilmore's press spokeswoman, said Thursday afternoon
in Richmond: ``The governor is highly sympathetic to the Finn
family and understands their anguish and has no wish to exacerbate
it. However, he feels that it is his job as governor to protect
those in society who can least protect themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's ruling, Judge Frank Hoss Jr. rejected Gilmore's
arguments, saying: ``The governor says Hugh Finn is not in a
persistent vegetative state. This court has found otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoss said Virginia law allowed the withholding of food and
water, adding, ``It merely permits the natural process of dying. It
does not relate to mercy killing or euthanasia.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robin Merlino, medical director of the nursing home, said
that when a feeding tube was removed, a comatose person became
dehydrated and the kidneys failed, leading to death. This can take
days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mrs. Finn's lawyers, Gary Eakes of Alexandria, Va.,
criticized Gilmore's efforts, saying, ``It's ironic that the
Virginia governor intervenes in a case where he says he is acting
to protect Hugh Finn's interests, but his actions are directly
contrary to the express wishes of Hugh Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   Eakes said Finn had prepared a directive that he be allowed to
die in such circumstances, but had been gravely injured in a car
accident before he could sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Marsh, the Prince William County court administrator,
said Gilmore's order that an appeal be made did not automatically
suspend Hoss' ruling, leaving Mrs. Finn free to have the feeding
tube removed.
</P>
<P>
   A state supreme court official said any member could order the
appeal to be heard and suspend Hoss' decision.
</P>
<P>
   Eakes said the family would not announce to the public when the
feeding tube would be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported Thursday night that the feeding
tube had been removed Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Finn is a former television news anchor in Louisville, Ky. His
aorta was ruptured in a traffic accident in Louisville in March
1995, depriving his brain of oxygen and leaving him unable to eat,
care for himself or communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Under Virginia law, life supports may be removed if a person is
in a persistent vegetative state, the condition that doctors said
Finn was in.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 18, however, a nurse employed by the state visited Finn
at the nursing home and filed a report in which she said that he
had greeted her with a ``Hi'' and had smoothed his hair during the
75 minutes she watched him. He had been taken to Manassas from
Louisville in 1996 to be nearer his parents' home in Woodbridge,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Finn said that the nurse was mistaken and that Finn did not
react but simply made guttural noises. She said her husband had
told her he would not want to live in such a condition.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Mrs. Finn decided to remove her husband's feeding tube.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Finn's brother John went to court to prevent Mrs. Finn
from removing the tube. Hoss ruled against John Finn on Aug. 31,
saying that Mrs. Finn, as her husband's guardian, had the right to
have the feeding tube removed.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, John Finn and other family members ended their
opposition, leaving Mrs. Finn free to have the tube removed on
Wednesday, the deadline Hoss had set for appeals. It was then that
Gilmore tried to block the removal, with his lawyers filing his
appeal just an hour before the tube could have been removed at
midnight.

BRUINS SIGN TWO KEY PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the Bruins were playing in Worcester against the
Penguins Wednesday night, assistant general manager Mike O'Connell
sat in the press box looking forlorn when he declared that he
didn't think center Jason Allison was anywhere near being signed.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours later, Allison, the Bruins' leading scorer,
was signed to a two-year deal and one of the team's other free
agents, Ted Donato, was also in the fold.
</P>
<P>
   Allison and his agent, Bob Gerow, flew into town for a long
meeting with the Bruins' brass Tuesday. On Wednesday, they flew
back to Toronto, no closer than they had been when they arrived.
But over the course of the next day, the sides seemed to ponder
their positions and Thursday, Allison phoned the Bruins, set up a
conference call for the afternoon and the sides hammered out a
two-year deal in 3-4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we left Boston, it looked like a dead end on both
sides,'' said Allison, who expects to arrive back in town sometime
today. ``There really wasn't much hope at the time. They were stuck
pretty low and I had a number I wasn't going to go off of for a
base. So I wanted to try to make it up in bonuses. My agent and I
sat down and structured what we thought would be a fair base salary
with bonuses. It's more creative this way. I can reach it if I play
well and if I don't reach it, well, I don't deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison reportedly will receive a base salary of $2.25 million
this year and $2.5 million next year. If he reaches 100 points for
two years in a row, he'll make roughly $9 million. Allison's first
bonus reportedly kicks in at 70 points, when he'll pick up
$100,000. If he gets to 80 points, he'll earn $475,000 more. For 85
points, he'd get an additional $300,000, another $200,000 for 90
points and $300,000 more for 100. All those bonuses automatically
would be part of the second year's contract if he reaches them.
</P>
<P>
   Allison said he didn't mind an incentive-laden contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I had to do to do a deal here,'' he said. ``I
wasn't scared of sitting out. But I didn't want to do that, and
they didn't want me to. I think the base is fair. The key was to
have a base I could live with. My worry was that if I was in the
top 10 in scoring for the next two years, I didn't want to be stuck
at $2 million if everyone else was making $6 million. I'm
definitely relieved. I didn't want to think about sitting out all
year. But I would've done it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said the team was thrilled to have finished the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started with that meeting in Boston. I think Jason
realized we were very serious,'' said O'Connell. ``I think he
understood it a little more and we had a better appreciation for
how he feels. It was that combination that made us able to get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The signings of Allison and Donato leave Kyle McLaren and Anson
Carter as the two Bruins who have yet to come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Donato, 29, was in a different situation than Allison, McLaren,
and Carter. Rather than haggling over money, he was unhappy about
his playing time in the second half of last season and had asked to
be traded.
</P>
<P>
   With other teams grappling with their own free agent problems
and trying to figure out who would start the season on their own
rosters, no teams appeared interested in adding another contract to
their mix and the Bruins to this point had been unable to
accommodate Donato.
</P>
<P>
   Donato didn't want to be relegated to a spare part once the
other Boston free agents re-signed and believed he'd be better off
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns, on the other hand, felt Donato should come into
training camp and show the club that he deserved more ice time than
he was getting in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said he made Donato no promises about a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing changed,'' said O'Connell. ``We were always wondering
why he wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato, who is expected to be at practice at the FleetCenter
this morning, has been a valuable member of the Bruins since
joining the club after the Olympics in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted has been a useful and versatile player for the Bruins for
many years and we look for that to continue,'' said
president/general manager Harry Sinden. ``He has assured us that he
will come in and give the hard effort he always has and we are
expecting a good contribution from him this season.''
</P>
<P>
   It's believed that Donato accepted the club's qualifying offer,
which will pay him $1.06 million.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burns, dissatisfied by the performance of several young players,
sent forwards Landon Wilson, Cameron Mann, Andre Savage and Shawn
Bates to Providence Thursday and recalled Jay Henderson, Eric
Nickulas and Marquis Mathieu to play in the final two exhibition
games Saturday and Sunday against the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave them every opportunity possible to show it and they
won't show it,'' said Burns. ``What do you want me to do? I'll find
12 of the best players if I have to and I'll play 12 guys. They've
got to get involved. We're giving players opportunities to show it
and they don't show it. Well, this is the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember, the Providence Bruins didn't have a
lot of success last year with the same players. We'll bring up
three more from there and give them an opportunity until we find
the right ones, that's all. Of course we're disappointed and I
think they are too but either they take it as a setback or as a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of many of the Bruins' key players in contract
disputes put coach and team largely back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is starting over again,'' said Burns. ``I won't just
dress guys for the reason of putting sweaters on their backs and
saying, `Go out there' because I have nobody else. I'll play with
12 guys, guys who are going to work hard and be proud of being
Boston Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Taylor's line will play on the power play, they'll kill
penalties and check. We'll make Ken Baumgartner a center if we have
to but we're not going to roll over and die because (some) guys
aren't happy, that I promise you. We're going to go to war with the
guys who want to go to war.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Burns didn't have any of what was last year's top
line. Sergei Samsonov was sidelined by the flu, Dmitri Khristich is
out with a shoulder injury, and Allison had yet to come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Thornton didn't skate with the team and will miss the
weekend games because of a minor shoulder injury. Burns said he
should be ready to go next week.

REVIVED SABERHAGEN ANSWERS DOUBTERS, INCLUDING HIMSELF  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He had conquered the major leagues as a relative
youngster, winning the American League Cy Young award and leading
the Kansas City Royals to a World Series championship at age 21. He
had battled back from injuries time and time again to add a
comeback player of the year award and a second Cy Young to his
collection of honors. And now he was being signed to a minor league
contract?
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 9, 1996, when the Boston Red Sox acquired Bret
Saberhagen in that modest deal, no one knew whether the Red Sox
were getting a broken-down, washed-up 32-year-old who would never
again be more than an average pitcher or a seasoned _ though
scarred _ star who simply needed time to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Most baseball people thought the former. Some thought he would
never pitch again. Saberhagen himself was not sure. All he knew was
that he wanted to return _ and not just to pitching, but to
pitching's upper echelon.
</P>
<P>
   So after two surgeries on his right shoulder within a year,
Saberhagen went through a training regimen he compared to ``hell
week in football.'' And when the work in the weight room and the
pool, combined with the uncertainty and the fear, drained him
mentally, he went to his wife, Lynn, the Red Sox physical therapist
Richard Zawacki and the Mets pitcher John Franco _ his former
teammate _ for encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Red Sox and the Cleveland Indians prepare for Game 3
of their American League division series on Friday, the doubts are
gone and the questions answered: the Red Sox got a gem that Dec. 9,
one who went 15-8 with a 3.96 earned run average this season to
earn the start Friday opposite the Indians' Charles Nagy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a tremendous effort,'' Boston Manager Jimy Williams said.
``He and Rich Zawacki worked really hard to get it done. He's a
very strong-hearted individual that went through a very difficult
operation to come back and be successful at this level. He's been
outstanding all season.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of times when Saberhagen, a Mets pitcher from
1992 to 1995, thought he would never again throw well enough to
merit a spot in the starting rotation of a playoff qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was heartening last year when he started six games for
the Red Sox after sitting out all of the previous season, his 6.58
ERA and 0-1 record did not foretell of a great 1998. So with the
expectations low, he entered spring training as Boston's fifth
starter. But before April was over, he showed that he had returned
to form by winning his first four outings, including two masterful
victories over the Indians in which he allowed just one run in 12
innings (0.75 ERA.)
</P>
<P>
   Nine victories later, the rehabilitated Saberhagen had won the
most games of his career since going 23-6 in his Cy Young season of
1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that I always wanted to do was get back to
pitching the way I was,'' said Saberhagen, who signed a three-year
extension with the Red Sox before the season. ``I'm very close, if
not completely all the way back to where I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did when he was one of the game's most dominant pitchers
in the 1980's, Saberhagen is throwing the curveball and changeup
with tremendous accuracy. And his fastball, though no longer 96
miles per hour, still hums toward the plate at 93 mph.
</P>
<P>
   While playing with Atlanta, the Indians' designated hitter,
David Justice, faced Saberhagen before his first shoulder surgery
in 1995. After going 2 for 20 against him this year, Justice
reached this conclusion: ``Ain't no difference. He's got the same
stuff.'' Actually, Saberhagen, who went 2-0 with a 0.50 ERA in
earning the 1985 World Series MVP award, might be stronger than
ever mentally. Obviously equipped to battle through adversity, he
was always a pick-me-up for the Red Sox this season, going 11-3
after Boston losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he's been able to do this year is a testimony to
his physical and mental toughness and ability when everyone had
written him off,'' Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove said.

THE MEDIA S.A.T.: TEST YOUR SARCASTIC APTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Bristol University included a course in
critical interpretation of the modern sports media, maybe we
wouldn't have to go through this recruiting process every few
years.
</P>
<P>
   The sad point is sports media critics are vanishing from the
landscape faster than DirecTV can hand out free T-shirts and caps.
More and more assume the position of acting as a clearinghouse for
network press releases, regurgitating ratings information as if
it's the Holy Grail or failing to grasp the fact that rights fees
paid to professional and amateur sports will forever dilute the
objectivity of the presentations for the home viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Are we going too fast for you?
</P>
<P>
   A correspondence course in Sports Media Criticism 101 would be
nice, but nice isn't what we're offering. If you may have what it
takes to continue this art form that's gone the way of cave
paintings, we suggest you attempt the Sarcastic Aptitude Test (our
SAT continues to measure ``aptitude'' rather than ``achievement''
because, quite frankly, there's nothing achieved by being
sarcastic).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will help you express your crankiness in a more
creative manner.
</P>
<P>
   --MULTIPLE CHOICE--
</P>
<P>
   1. The World Series matchup that Fox executives would like to
see the most is:
</P>
<P>
   a) Yankees-Cubs, because it represents the No. 1 and No. 3 TV
markets in the country.
</P>
<P>
   b) Red Sox-Cubs, because it creates a matchup of lovable losers.
</P>
<P>
   c) Braves-vs.-anyone, because it'll make for great shots of Ted
Turner nodding off on Jane Fonda's shoulder in the owners box.
</P>
<P>
   2. NBC has recovered from the absence of NFL games by showing:
</P>
<P>
   a) New NASCAR events.
</P>
<P>
   b) More golf events.
</P>
<P>
   c) Nonstop advertisements for ``A Night at the Roxbury.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Those most fearful of an extended NBA lockout and possible
cancellation of the season are:
</P>
<P>
   a) Executives at NBC.
</P>
<P>
   b) Executives at TNT.
</P>
<P>
   c) Marge Hearn.
</P>
<P>
   4. Major League Soccer's championship game this year will be
carried on:
</P>
<P>
   a) ABC
</P>
<P>
   b) ESPN
</P>
<P>
   c) Have the playoffs started yet?
</P>
<P>
   5. The future of women's sports on television is dependent upon:
</P>
<P>
   a) The commitment by the Lifetime network.
</P>
<P>
   b) The establishment of an all women's-sports channel.
</P>
<P>
   c) The speed with which a Women's Ultimate Fighting Championship
can be sanctioned.
</P>
<P>
   --COMPARE AND CONTRAST--
</P>
<P>
   6. Chris Berman is to baseball play-by-play as:
</P>
<P>
   a) Howie Mandell is to talk-show host.
</P>
<P>
   b) George Clooney is to emergency-room doctor.
</P>
<P>
   c) Dennis Miller is to acting.
</P>
<P>
   d) All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   --HISTORY-
</P>
<P>
   7. The greatest innovation in sports television in the last 10
years is:
</P>
<P>
   a) The on-screen time-and-score box at the top left corner by
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   b) The glowing yellow first-down line by ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   c) The mute button on the remote control.
</P>
<P>
   8. The worst innovation in sports television in the last 10
years is:
</P>
<P>
   a) The glowing hockey puck by Fox.
</P>
<P>
   b) The glowing yellow first-down line by ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   c) The carcinogenic sports-desk anchors who decide they are
required to have a 3{-minute introduction to each 30-second
highlight package, complete with arcane references and semi-sweet
puns that prove the clip they're about to show is from a sparsely
attended game between two teams going nowhere that couldn't get so
much as the score flashed in a pile of graphics on another local
sports show.
</P>
<P>
   -- MATHEMATICS--
</P>
<P>
   9. Bob Costas' self-importance is greater than or equal to:!off!
</P>
<P>
   a) Mark McGwire's biceps.
</P>
<P>
   b) Chris Berman's waistline.
</P>
<P>
   c) The Cirque du Soleil at the Bellagio in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   10. Network A pays $17.6 billion for the rights to the NFC.
Network B pays $11.6 billion for the rights to the AFC. Network C
pays $12 billion for the rights to NFL games on Sunday and Monday
nights. If each network has the same opportunity to sell
advertisements to recoup the cost of these investments, and none of
the networks were blackmailed into making these bids, which stands
to benefit financially the most?
</P>
<P>
   If your answer is Network D, please move to the next question.
</P>
<P>
   If you have some magic formula that shows either Network A, B or
C will turn a profit, please remember: We suggest no illegal
substances be taken before this exam.
</P>
<P>
   -- FINAL ESSAY QUESTION--
</P>
<P>
   The Beer, Babes and Billiards Channel _ pros and cons.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES:
</P>
<P>
   -- Joe McDonnell, awaking from a journalistic slumber to smack
Vic ``A Few Stamps Short of a Mailman'' Jacobs back into reality
after the later was duped by some ``mad love funkadelia'' from Karl
Malone on his AM-1150 show Wednesday. The Utah Jazz star dropped
loud hints on Jacobs about wanting to play in L.A. Jacobs took it
brick, line and sinker. Then Malone was offered a job to host a
show on the station. McDonnell squashed all that nonsense
immediately and continued to do so, in milder tones, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   -- A rehabilitated Marv Albert says in the Oct. 5 People
magazine: ``There are no more surprises coming from me, I can tell
you that!'' The surprise to us is that ABC's Boomer Esiason _ and
not Albert _ is included in the cover story naming ``TV's 40 Most
Fascinating Stars of '98.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Current MSNBC newsguy and former ESPN ``SportsCenter'' icon
Keith Olbermann, in the ``Scorecard'' section of the Oct. 5 Sports
Illustrated, has a somewhat self-serving but accurate review of the
ABC series ``Sports Night.'' ``How much more of my life can these
people borrow before they have to pay me?'' Which now signals the
alarm for ESPN Magazine to snipe at something on CNN-SI.
</P>
<P>
   -- Todd Donoho as left the building.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   -- A revived-baseball-crazed work force in the greater Los
Angeles area asks a simple question: Where are the playoff games on
the radio? TV is confusing enough with ESPN, NBC and Fox grabbing
for the best game possible. But on the car patrol, a hit-and-miss
selection of the daily games via ESPN Radio's syndicated broadcasts
have bounced around on San Diego's XTRA-AM (690), Burbank's KXTA-AM
(1150) and/or the Antelope Valley's tiny but mighty KAVL-AM (610) _
or none at all. We're told it should last through this first round
of play, maybe even into the ALCS and NLCS. Sure, why interrupt
people talking about sports to carry the actual sport instead?
Because the radio stations fear breaking up the continuity.
</P>
<P>
   -- KCBS Channel 2 has changed its singular Sunday NFL offering
from the Ryan Leaf-Peyton Manning matchup of San Diego-Indianapolis
at 10 a.m. to the 1 p.m. yawner of Oakland-Arizona. A station
spokesperson says it has to do with the fact that game works better
for them ``for competitive reasons'' in the later time slot and
``the Raiders have been playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Penn State-Ohio State game is on pay-per-view?
</P>
<P>
   -- The second-lowest ``Monday Afternoon Football'' rating of all
time _ 11.9, with a 17 share nationally. Sure, the Tampa
Bay-Detroit thrilla went head-on with the Cubs-Giants wild-card
playoff game on ESPN this week. And beat it from a ratings
standpoint. But if ABC's slide for this once invincible prime-time
(on the East Coast) slot continues, it might find itself trailing
``Buddy Faro'' by midseason. &QL;

Greene's approach to taming what he calls the ``explosive child''

approach,'' says Greene, a child psychologist. (Tom Herde/Boston

-- Wigs worn by the character Kate Mullins in the play,
``Titanic.'' The upkeep of the show between performances is a
formidable undertaking. It includes the maintenance of 71 wigs, all

dressers. (Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo) *LITE

-- Melissa Bell, left, and Theresa McCarthy in a dressing room
backstage at ``Titanic,'' which offers a particularly compelling
example of the magnitude and the minutiae of the little-seen drama
backstage. The show is a beast of a production: There are 44
actors: 21 men and 15 women in the cast, plus 8 understudies who
step into a variety of roles. (Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT10) NEW YORK -- Sept. 30, 1998 -- TITANIC-BACKSTAGE-1, 9-30
-- By the time the cast of ``Titanic'' gathers for its final scene
on deck, many backstage scenes have unfolded. Audiences rarely get
a glimpse behind the scenes, where the set and costume changes can
be as intricately choreographed as the dancing, where the
relationships may be easily as intense as those the actors portray
on stage, and where the unexpected crises can be even more
suspenseful than the plot. (Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo)

-- Everett Quinton as Lady Enid Hillcrest in a revival of ``The
Mystery of Irma Vep.'' The revival of the Ridiculous Theatrical
Company's 1984 hit, played with a consummate sense of timing is
just about all one could hope for in outrageous Gothic spoofing
that incorporates such dainty comic devices as leering Egyptian
mummies, blood-soaked oil portraits and bald men in bustles. (James

Maria Guleghina in the title role of ``Aida'' at the Metropolitan
Opera. Most strikingly, and very usefully in this opera, Ms.
Guleghina can rise from her gentle kind of delivery to be heard
over a stage full of chorus and principals, and can do so smoothly,
with no apparent exertion and no loss of tone. The effect is of a
zoom into a close-up in a crowd scene. (Sara Krulwich/New York

portrays the older sibling, while the younger brother is played by
his younger brother, 30-year-old Marcus. (Andrea Mohin/New York

Rose Mary Goodson is just one of the Congress locals who hauled
gallons of paint and a ladder up a rocky gorge to repaint The Frog,
a painted rock which has been a landmark in the community since the
late 1920's. It's not an easy task, painting a 60-ton frog. First,
there's the barbed-wire fence that has to be scaled while lugging
an extension ladder and several buckets of paint. Then it's a
rugged climb up to the creature, and at the top, there are few
places to anchor a ladder. (Sam Lowe/Arizona Republic Photo)

With a 1.46 million copies in its first printing, King's new novel,

COWBOYS SPECIAL TEAMS PICKING UP SLACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Troy Aikman's fractured collarbone figured to
make the running game the strength of the Cowboys' offense.
</P>
<P>
   But the ground game has been more or less stuck in neutral
against the New York Giants and Oakland Raiders the past two weeks.
And Aikman's backup, Jason Garrett, struggled against the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   If only the Cowboys could run the kick return a little more.
</P>
<P>
   Punt returner Deion Sanders and first-year kickoff returner
Kevin Mathis each rank in the top five in the NFC. Sanders has
certainly taken his play to another level with three punt returns
of more than 39 yards the past two games, including a 60-yarder
Sunday that nearly turned around a 13-12 loss against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis was also effective against the Raiders with returns of 31
and 36 yards. He combined with Sanders to help give the Garrett-led
offense an average starting position of their 41-yard line against
the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Though exasperated his team failed to capitalize on the good
returns against the Raiders, coach Chan Gailey likes the Cowboys'
chances if given similar opportunities against the Washington
Redskins on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shortens the field for your offense, and if you look at the
scoring percentages, it's phenomenal how much it improves the
better your return is,'' said Gailey, who said he has never been on
a team ``this explosive'' on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   While new to Gailey, a solid return game has been the norm under
special-teams coach Joe Avezzano. Selected NFL special-teams coach
of the year twice since joining the Cowboys in 1990, Avezzano said
his success is no secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I approach the kicking game the same way I approach the
offense and defense,'' Avezzano said. ``You have to be
fundamentally sound and put a group of players on the field that
believe what you are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Avezzano said he preaches to his return units the
importance of how a good return can aid the offense, he
acknowledged having quality returners goes a long way in helping
him get his point across.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the 11 guys out there on punt return, they understand the
importance and the possibilities because of our returner,'' said
Avezzano, who has had at least one of his return units ranked among
the top 10 in the league in each of the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guy is an exceptional guy. When we get an opportunity we
want to capitalize on it and everybody wants to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' thrilling efforts were expected. The multitalented
star, who doubles as a cornerback and receiver, is thought by many
to be the league's best returner. He ranks fourth in the NFL in
punt returns with an average of 17.6 yards per punt, and holds the
all-time league record for touchdown returns of any kind with 16.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, however, is somewhat of a surprise, considering one of
the Cowboys' biggest questions coming into this season was finding
someone to replace Herschel Walker.
</P>
<P>
   A second-year cornerback from Texas A&AMP;M-Commerce, Mathis
satisfied Gailey and Avezzano with his play during the preseason
and has continued to develop. His 26.5 yards per return average
ranks fourth in the NFC and is better than Walker's 23.3 average
from last season.
</P>
<P>
   All that's left for Mathis to do is break the long one. He could
get that opportunity against the Redskins, who rank last in the NFL
in kickoff coverage and have allowed three returns of more than 44
yards, including a 90-yard touchdown return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been close,'' Mathis said. ``I was just a move or two
away against the Raiders. But I'm just trying to do a good job to
set up the offense and carry on the tradition here under coach
Avezzano.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As their wealth grew rapidly, John Meriwether and
some of his 15 partners at Long-Term Capital Management LP even
considered buying a vineyard in France early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Meriwether, his friend and partner Eric Rosenfeld, and
some of their colleagues, were wine buffs who had amassed
considerable cellars that boasted rows of the choicest vintages
from the best vineyards in Bordeaux and Burgundy, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   And money was certainly not a problem. Among them, the 16
managing partners had amassed spectacular wealth by the end of last
year, totaling well more than $1.5 billion. ``Dynastic wealth,'' as
one of their friends put it Thursday, ``Serious dynastic wealth.''
Which, he added, ``they created in an extraordinary period of time,
and then lost.''
</P>
<P>
   In a spectacular riches-to-rags story, that wealth has now, in
just a few months, been all but dissipated, with a few of the 16
partners even facing the prospect of personal bankruptcy, said
friends and colleagues interviewed in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   In a settlement thrashed out this week at the Manhattan offices
of the law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &AMP; Flom, a group of banks
and brokerage firms took over 90 percent of Long-Term Capital,
recapitalizing it with $3.6 billion and leaving the former owners
with just 10 percent of the business. Of that 10 percent, the
firm's 16 partners now hold less than a third.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a few partners who joined more recently,
11 of the group started with Meriwether in 1993 when he organized
the investment partnership after his 1991 ouster from Salomon
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Capital was easy to come by, and the best brains in Wall Street
had realized that raising one's own capital and running one's own
hedge fund brought much bigger profits than working for some big
old battleship like Salomon Brothers, where just paying the
overhead for the firm's headquarters cost millions of dollars a
day.
</P>
<P>
   The group also had the cream of Wall Street supporting its
venture: Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. helped it get established, acting as
placing agent for the new fund; Simpson Thacher &AMP; Bartlett was the
group's legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the partners at Long-Term Capital came from
Salomon's offices in downtown Manhattan, where they had gained fame
and fortune for their work with Meriwether and Rosenfeld. They were
Victor Haghani, Gregory Hawkins, Lawrence Hilibrand, Hans
Hufschmid, Arjun Krishnamachar, Richard Leahy, Robert Merton and
Myron Scholes.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 12 of Long-Term's 16 principals, or managing
partners, were Salomon veterans, but the core of the group was
Meriwether, Rosenfeld, Hilibrand and Haghani, former colleagues
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all nice, good honest people; that's the tragedy of
this whole thing,'' William McIntosh, a former Salomon partner who
is now an adjunct professor at Howard University, said, discussing
the managing partners of Long-Term. ``They're all intellectual,
they all get along well, and they are all good friends to one
another.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The group of former Salomon executives is also extraordinarily
cohesive and complementary. At the core of the academic group at
the firm are Mullins, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, and Scholes and Merton, who are both former Nobel Prize
winners in economics.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether, Rosenfeld, Haghani, Hilibrand and most of the other
partners have the strategy and trading expertise. Robert Shustak is
in charge of trading systems and operations.
</P>
<P>
   Golf, one of Meriwether's favorite pastimes, is part of the glue
that has bound the partnership together, friends said. ``They all
got into golf,'' the friend said. ``Every now and again, they would
go off and play golf together, down in the islands, or over in
Waterville.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterville is the internationally renowned golf course in County
Kerry, in southwest Ireland, where Meriwether, 51, and Leahy, a
veteran of Salomon's mortgage sales business, are partners. ``It's
a world-class golf course,'' one of their friends said Thursday,
Meriwether and a group of partners ``bought it in a bar right from
the owner, 10 or 11 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Hufschmid, who along with Haghani manages the Long-Term Capital
office on Conduit Street in London's West End, had run Salomon's
foreign exchange business, which had at times generated fabulous
profits for the Wall Street firm. Hawkins had run the mortgage
business on Salomon's renowned bond arbitrage desk.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Rosenthal, a spokesman for the partners of Long-Term
Capital, declined to comment Thursday, and several of the partners
have not returned messages left at their homes or offices in recent
days.

NYC AGREES TO PAY IN CHOKING DEATH SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city has agreed to pay nearly $3 million to
settle a group of lawsuits filed by the family of Anthony Baez, a
Florida man whose death in 1994 after a confrontation with police
outside his family's home in the Bronx ignited a heated debate
about police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department later ruled that Baez had been the victim
of an illegal chokehold used by Officer Francis Livoti, who has
since been dismissed from the force. Livoti had been acquitted of
criminally negligent homicide in a state trial in 1996, but he was
convicted last June in U.S. District Court in Manhattan of
violating Baez's civil rights. He is to be sentenced next week.
</P>
<P>
   In settling the civil cases, the city will not admit any
liability in Baez's death, lawyers for both sides said. But the
city's decision to settle the suit capped what from the start of
the case seemed to be an eagerness among top city officials to put
it behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ usually an outspoken defender of the
police _ never openly supported Livoti, and Police Commissioner
Howard Safir dismissed Livoti from the force even though he had
been acquitted in the criminal trial. Further, a mainstay of the
city's defense was that Livoti was a renegade and that the city
should not be held liable for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Justice Douglas McKeon of state Supreme Court in the
Bronx rejected the city's position that it was not responsible for
Livoti because he had violated department policy by using the
illegal chokehold, setting the stage for the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city feels it is appropriate to put this unfortunate
incident to rest,'' said city Corporation Counsel Michael Hess,
``and that a fair and equitable settlement was arrived at in order
to dispose of all four pending lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Baez's death in 1994 focused a harsh spotlight on police
brutality in New York. The case was widely held up as proof by many
minorities that the Police Department was rife with officers with
little regard for their rights, or, indeed, their lives, and it has
continued to resonate as a political issue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last year, Baez's mother, Iris Baez, ran an independent campaign
for Bronx borough president on a platform as a crusader against
police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, city officials and lawyers for the family said they
were satisfied with the $2.94 million settlement, which the city
said was believed to be the largest recovery made against it in a
wrongful-death action stemming from police misconduct. The family
had sought $48 million in the wrongful-death suit.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Baez and other family members were not available for
comment on Thursday night. But one of their lawyers, Susan Karten,
said the settlement was significant ``because the city does not pay
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the city is not admitting liability, Ms. Karten said
the settlement ``acknowledges for the first time the city's
responsibility in keeping Livoti on the force.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether Livoti's tendency toward abusive
behavior should have been recognized earlier by the department
became a central issue in the civil lawsuit and in the larger
debate about how the department dealt with Livoti in the years
before Baez's death.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition of Livoti's former commander taken by the Baez
family's lawyers, the supervisor, William Casey, testified that
nine police brutality complaints had been lodged against Livoti
before the 1994 death of Baez, yet senior police officials had
rejected a recommendation by the commander that Livoti be
transferred to a clerical job or a less stressful precinct.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony indicated that the transfer was rejected because
Livoti was a police union delegate and was protected by connections
high up in the chain of command. In addition to the department's
handling of Livoti and the abuse complaints against him, the civil
lawsuit highlighted the roles of other police officers who were on
the scene when Livoti was accused of using the illegal chokehold
</P>
<P>
   In the criminal case, Livoti's defense was that his client had
never used a banned chokehold to subdue Baez, and that Baez, who
was 29, had died after suffering an asthma attack during a struggle
with police. The confrontation occurred after Baez and his brothers
were involved in a late-night family football game, and an errantly
thrown football hit a police cruiser.

RULES TO JUICE OFFENSE COULD LET NHL EMULATE BASEBALL'S HOME-RUN
BINGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Joe Nieuwendyk witnessed the excitement baseball's
home-run derby generated and pondered the contention that a
``juiced'' ball helped create the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa
sweepstakes, he decided that the NHL could learn a lesson or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``So find a way to juice the puck then,'' the Stars' center
joked.
</P>
<P>
   They're trying, Joe, they're trying.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly, but the NHL would like nothing better than a
similar race chasing the single-season goal-scoring record of Wayne
Gretzky _ 92 set in 1981-82. With that goal _ and goals in general
_ in mind, the NHL has rewritten much of its rule book in hopes of
creating the attraction sports fans seem to find in big offensive
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take 20 fans in the stands on any given night, chances
are 10 of them will want to see me or Mike (Modano) or Nieuwie
score and the other 10 will want to see someone beat the heck out
of somebody else,'' said Brett Hull _ an ardent lobbyist for more
scoring. ``Does the league need more scoring? Of course it does.
That's what the people in the seats are paying to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL might finally be listening to Hull. League officials
have made significant changes to the markings on the ice surface,
perhaps the most significant in a single season since 1926. The
goal line was moved two feet farther from the end boards to 13
feet. The goal crease was shaved two feet on each side to eight
feet in width. The neutral zone was compressed four feet from 58
feet to 54, with two extra feet committed to each offensive zone.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there will be a leaguewide crackdown on the size of
goaltender equipment, with even the width of a jersey to be
measured. And the league also will experiment with two referees in
hopes of further reducing the amount of obstruction or holding away
from the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Each rule is aimed at getting more scoring into the game _ and
with good reason. Television ratings are at a relative standstill
and the league last season had its lowest scoring average (5.28
goals per game) since the 1955-56 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league was very serious about it, and they still are,''
Stars general manager Bob Gainey said. ``It's a difficult thing to
change. But the encouraging thing is you can see results of the
change.''
</P>
<P>
   At least a handful of players would like to see even more
results from the changes. Pittsburgh Penguins winger Jaromir Jagr
was the only player to break 100 points (102) last season, while
only four players _ Teemu Selanne, Peter Bondra, Pavel Bure and
John LeClair _ had 50 or more goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of talented players out there and there's no
reason we shouldn't have more scoring,'' Nieuwendyk said.
</P>
<P>
   If the new rules work, then maybe Hull or Nieuwendyk or Jagr or
the Mighty Ducks' Paul Kariya will get 50 goals. If the changes
really work, maybe all four will, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   The league is not without its offensive talent. On the Stars
alone, three players have 50-goal seasons in their past _ Hull,
Nieuwendyk and Modano. In addition, Pat Verbeek has scored more
than 40 goals on four occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Around the league there is 50-goal potential from at least 10
players: Jagr, Kariya and Ducks teammate Selanne, the Capitals'
Bondra, the Islanders Ziggy Palffy, the Flyers' Eric Lindros and
LeClair, the Coyotes' Keith Tkachuk, the Maple Leafs' Mats Sundin
and the Canucks' Bure (if he returns from a contract holdout).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will help any player who has skill,'' said Craig
Button, the Stars' director of player personnel. ``You're adding
two feet of space to the offensive zone and that means the puck is
going to stay in the offensive zone longer and players are going to
have more offensive chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull hopes the rules changes do help, but even he's not sure.
The man who once scored 86 goals in a season and has three of the
top 14 goal-scoring seasons in league history said getting back to
the high-flying days of the 1980s is likely impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different game now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the offensive lobbyists aren't about to back down. So
it is a different game, and maybe there needs to be a more radical
look at how to change it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if these rule changes will help. Because while
they have opened up the opportunity for more one-on-one play around
the net, they probably won't create more speed through the neutral
zone,'' Verbeek said. ``This might sound crazy, but what they need
to do is outlaw the trap just like the NBA outlawed the zone
defense. If they do that, then maybe we can get some real scoring
back.''
</P>
<P>
   That does sound crazy. But right now, the scorers are desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, really,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``Can we look at some way to
juice the puck? They have to be able to do something.''

1999 IRL SEASON FINALE SET FOR TEXAS MOTOR SPEEDWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A yearlong effort to make Texas Motor
Speedway the feature venue for the Indy Racing League outside of
Indianapolis has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   TMS general manager Eddie Gossage, with the aid of IRL driver
and Plano resident Greg Ray, announced yesterday that the speedway
will be host to the 1999 Pep Boys Indy Racing League season finale,
a race that could potentially crown the series champion. The Lone
Star 500K is scheduled for Sunday, Oct. 17, 1999, and again will be
the second of two IRL stops at the 1.5-mile superspeedway next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better place to decide a championship than at the Texas
Motor Speedway,'' said Fred Nation, vice president of corporate
communications and public relations for the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway. ``Everything's big in Texas. We want the Pep Boys Indy
Racing League championship to be excited to be at the biggest place
we run on the planet outside of Indianapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the interest IRL races have drawn at TMS, Gossage and
Ray have lobbied IRL officials to host the finale for almost a
year. The track was able to add a second date this season, but the
possible fireworks of a championship-crowning race is what the
speedway sought.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL's first stop at TMS next season will be June 12, the
first stop after the Indianapolis 500. TMS is the only speedway to
play host to two IRL races and has drawn crowds second only to the
Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic for the speedway and for the Indy Racing
League,'' Ray said. ``And being a hometown boy, it's fantastic for
me as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Local fans have shown their desire to watch the 220-plus-mph
performances and side-by-side racing the IRL has brought to Texas.
Last month's race drew an estimated 81,000 fans and the night race
drew around 100,000. Both events were the top two draws outside the
Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw cars doing things that they simply aren't supposed to
do,'' Gossage said. ``We said this really has something going for
it, and we want to be the leader. We are the shining star on the
IRL schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Nation said IRL planned to release the season's full schedule
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking forward to a Texas-sized celebration a year from
now,'' Nation said.

EXCERPTS FROM GREENSPAN'S REMARKS BEFORE CONGRESS

HEDGEFUND-MERIWETHER, HEDGEFUND-PARTNERS)  
(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from testimony by Alan Greenspan before
the House banking panel:
</P>
<P>
   Had the failure of LTCM triggered the seizing up of markets,
substantial damage could have been inflicted on many market
participants, including some not directly involved with the firm,
and could have potentially impaired the economies of many nations,
including our own. With credit spreads already elevated and the
market prices of risky assets under considerable downward pressure,
Federal Reserve officials moved more quickly to provide their good
offices to help resolve the affairs of LTCM than would have been
the case in more normal times. In effect, the threshold of action
was lowered by the knowledge that markets had recently become
fragile. Moreover, our sense was that the consequences of a fire
sale triggered by cross-default clauses, should LTCM fail on some
of its obligations, risked a severe drying up of market liquidity.
The plight of LTCM might scarcely have caused a ripple in financial
markets or among federal regulators 18 months ago _ but in current
circumstances it was judged to warrant attention. ...
</P>
<P>
   Quickly unwinding a complicated portfolio that contains exposure
to all manner of risks, such as that of LTCM, in such market
conditions amounts to conducting a fire sale. The prices received
in a time of stress do not reflect longer-run potential, adding to
the losses incurred. Of course, a fire sale that transfers wealth
from one set of sophisticated market players to another, without
any impact on the financial system over all, should not be a
concern for the central bank. Moreover, creditors should reasonably
be expected to put some weight on the possibility of a large market
swing when making their risk assessments. Indeed, when we examine
banks we expect them to have systems in place that take account of
outsized market moves. However, a fire sale may be sufficiently
intense and widespread that it seriously distorts markets and
elevates uncertainty enough to impair the overall functioning of
the economy. Sophisticated economic systems cannot thrive in such
an atmosphere. ...
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 23, the private sector parties arrived at an agreement
providing a capital infusion of about $3.5 billion in return for
substantially diluting existing shareholders' stake in LTCM.
Control of the firm passed from the current management to a
committee determined from the outside by the new investors. Those
investors intend to shrink LTCM's portfolio so as to reduce risk of
loss and return the remaining capital to the investors as soon as
practicable. I do not rule out the possibility that the new owners
of what is left of LTCM may decide to keep part of it in business.
That is their judgment to make.
</P>
<P>
   This agreement was not a Government bailout, in that Federal
Reserve funds were neither provided nor ever even suggested.
Agreements were not forced upon unwilling market participants.
Creditors and counterparties calculated that LTCM and, accordingly,
their claims, would be worth more over time if the liquidation of
LTCM's portfolio was orderly as opposed to being subject to a fire
sale. And with markets currently volatile and investors skittish,
putting a special premium on the timely resolution of LTCM's
problems seemed entirely appropriate as a matter of public policy.
...
</P>
<P>
   It is questionable whether hedge funds can be effectively
directly regulated in the United States alone. While their
financial clout may be large, hedge funds' physical presence is
small. Given the amazing communication capabilities available
virtually around the globe, trades can be initiated from almost any
location. Indeed, most hedge funds are only a short step from
cyberspace. Any direct U.S. regulations restricting their
flexibility will doubtless induce the more aggressive funds to
emigrate from under our jurisdiction. The best we can do in my
judgment is what we do today: Regulate them indirectly through the
regulation of the sources of their funds. ...
</P>
<P>
   For so long as there have been financial markets, participants
have had on occasion to weigh the costs and, especially, the
externalities associated with fire-sale liquidations of troubled
entities against short-term assistance to tide the firms over for a
time. It was such a balancing of near-term costs and longer-term
benefits that presumably led J.P. Morgan to convene the leading
bankers of his age _ both commercial and investment _ in his
library in 1907 to address the severe panic of that year. Such
episodes were recognized as among those rare occasions when
otherwise highly effective markets seize up and temporary ad hoc
responses were required. The convening of LTCM investors and
lenders last week at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York could be
viewed in that long tradition. It should similarly be viewed as a
rare occasion, warranted because of the potential for serious
disruptions to markets.

LEAKS CLOUD DEATH INQUIRY ON JONBENET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ Sheets of white paper covered windows in the
courtroom where a grand jury met Thursday to pursue its
two-week-old investigation into the murder of JonBenet Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   But the white sheets were only symbolic screens in a week when
major characters in the almost two-year-old murder mystery waged a
war of leaks and letters, battling for the hearts and minds of the
12 jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ramseys did not do it,'' Lou Smit, a homicide detective,
said in a resignation letter dated Sept. 20 but released on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Smit reviewed police reports on the case for 18 months for the
Boulder County prosecutor's office. ``The `case' tells me that John
and Patsy Ramsey did not kill their daughter, that a very dangerous
killer is still out there and no one is actively looking for him,''
Smit said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the Boulder Police Department of ``going in the wrong
direction,'' Smit, a detective for 32 years, added, ``There is
substantial, credible evidence of an intruder and lack of evidence
that the parents are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The detective's resignation letter prompted Ramsey to make a
rare public statement in the 21-month-old case on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Smit as ``the only experienced homicide detective who
has ever been assigned long term to find the killer of JonBenet,''
Ramsey, in a written statement, lambasted the Boulder Police
Department as ``little more than a lynch mob.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The killer could never have guessed that he or she would be so
lucky as to have the resulting investigation conducted by such
closed-minded police,'' continued Ramsey, the father of the
6-year-old beauty pageant contestant whose body was found on Dec.
26, 1996. ``You have wasted almost two years trying to prove your
original theory. Meanwhile, my family knows a vicious killer still
walks the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet others critical of how the investigation has been handled do
not support Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Before the grand jury started work on Sept. 15, Steve Thomas,
the lead police detective in the case, wrote a resignation letter
denouncing the office of Alex Hunter, the Boulder County district
attorney, as ``thoroughly compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   Under grand jury rules in Colorado, jurors may not discuss
testimony outside the courtroom but are permitted to read news
reports about a case they are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the recent leaks and letters from acquaintances of
the Ramseys, Craig Silverman, a former Denver prosecutor, said,
``They are playing to the grand jury.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent days, as a succession of Boulder police detectives
have appeared before the grand jury, court observers say the
Ramseys and their defenders are trying to score a counterpunch with
the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people are looking and saying, `Hey, there is a forum
here, let's use it,'' said Bob Grant, the Adams County district
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Ramsey's criticism that Boulder police had not
investigated alternative theories, Mark Beckner, the Boulder police
chief, noted that his detectives had interviewed about 600 people
and investigated 122 suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey, in his statement, addressed ``the killer,'' saying, ``We
have been told that the authorities have your DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is true, it was presumably leaked to the Ramseys or
their lawyers. The release of Smit's confidential resignation
letter also constitutes a leak.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Hal Haddon, Ramsey's lead lawyer, has demanded
police investigations of leaks that seemed to implicate the
Ramseys. This round of leaks, favoring the Ramseys, has been met by
silence from Haddon.
</P>
<P>
   The leaks seemed to be timed to counteract a report Sunday on
the ABC news magazine ``20/20'' that cast an unfavorable light on
the Ramseys.
</P>
<P>
   But, on Sunday, only hours before ``20/20,'' The Associated
Press ran Smit's week-old resignation letter. Taking the bloom off
the ABC report, Smit was quoted in Boulder newspapers on Monday,
saying, ``I believe that justice is not being served, that innocent
people are being targeted and could be charged with a murder they
did not commit.''

JOHN GOTTI JR. RELEASE ON $10 MILLION BAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Nine months after he was jailed on a welter
of racketeering charges, John A. Gotti, the son of the Gambino
crime family boss, walked out the front door of the federal
courthouse here as a theoretically free man, but one who will have
to spend the months until and during his trial under strict house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Bouncing down the courthouse steps, Gotti, 34, dressed in a
black turtleneck, black jeans and white sneakers, forced his way
past cameras, walked into a bear hug from his brother-in-law,
Carmine Agnello, and then slipped into a white Mercedes driven by
his sister, Victoria. He was to be taken to his $700,000 home in
Oyster Bay on Long Island where his wife and four children were
preparing a party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balloons are blown up, the decorations are hung and I
suspect the food will be Italian,'' said one of his five lawyers,
Gerald L. Shargel.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's release on bail came after two grueling weeks of
negotiations between his lawyers and federal prosecutors who were
determined to keep Gotti behind bars, even after Judge Barrington
Parker of U.S. District Court agreed to his release. Although two
dozen of Gotti's relatives and friends posted $10 million worth of
homes and businesses as collateral for his bail, prosecutors
subjected them to intense scrutiny to make certain that none were
bought with criminal earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Gotti's lawyers had to fight until the last moment
over $2 million of the bail bond that is secured by an estate owned
by Ms. Gotti, a novelist, and her husband, Agnello. Agnello is
regarded by federal law-enforcement authorities as a senior crime
family apparatchik. The government finally consented to Gotti's
release even as it undertakes a fresh inspection of Agnello's tax
returns for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to Gotti's ample crowd of supporters _ many of them
bull-necked young men in pressed jeans and white sneakers, but
others elderly friends so loyal they were willing to put up their
homes to guarantee his bail _ it was the day they have been waiting
for. ``We're happy to see young John is going home,'' said his
lawyer, Bruce Cutler. ``Everybody's excited; everybody's happy, and
this is the beginning in the battle to clear John's name.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gotti walked to his car he was asked how he felt and he said,
``Great,'' and then he was asked what he was looking forward to and
he replied ``my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Under conditions negotiated between the government and defense
lawyers, Gotti will be confined to his Oyster Bay house around the
clock. He will have to wear a electronic ankle bracelet that tracks
his movements, and will only be able to see visitors on an approved
list. His calls will be monitored and a security guard he must pay
for will be posted outside his house at all hours.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti has been accused of extorting payments from the Scores
strip club in Manhattan and defrauding people who bought prepaid
telephone cards, charges that could result in a maximum sentence of
20 years in prison. His father, John Gotti, 58, is spending a life
sentence in a federal penitentiary in Illinois on charges of
murder. He recently had surgery for throat cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said they regard the younger Gotti, known as
Junior, as the acting boss of the Gambino family in his father's
absence and have fought to keep him in jail.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gotti's trial is scheduled for early January. His lawyers have
said they were eager to spring him from jail so they could consult
on defense strategy without the technical difficulties of visiting
him at the Westchester County Jail in Valhalla, where has been held
since his arrest in January. According to a ruling Thursday by U.S.
Magistrate Mark D. Fox, who is handling the details of the bail
agreement, Gotti will have to apply for visits to his lawyers'
offices in midtown Manhattan if he wants to meet with other
defendants in the complex case.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident by the way Gotti walked into the courtroom
Thursday that a deal had been reached. For the first time in three
court sessions, Gotti smiled, his eyes glinting merrily behind gray
glasses. He waved at his sisters _ Victoria and Angela _ and at his
longtime personal lawyer, Richard Rehbock, and he patted his
stomach, chortling about the weight he had apparently lost during
his imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the jury box and two spectator benches were the two
dozen people who had put up their homes as collateral for the bail.
Gotti's lawyers have repeatedly sought to portray them as humble
working people devoted to Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler suggested that it was important to Gotti that it not seem
as if he was so desperate to get out of jail that he was forced to
rely on friends' generosity. ``The dignity is very important to
him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the hearing began, Shargel told Fox that ``it's been a long
and difficult process, but I'm happy to report to you that we have
raised in excess of $10 million in collateral supported by real
property.'' He conceded, however, that there was still an
unresolved matter.
</P>
<P>
   Agnello and Victoria Gotti own an estate in Old Westbury valued
at $4 million that they have offered as surety, and until recently
it was part of the $10 million collateral. Of that amount, parcels
worth $1.5 million are registered in Miss Gotti's name and some of
the remainder is owned jointly with Agnello.
</P>
<P>
   Government prosecutors evidently did not want to accept any
parcels in Agnello's name alone, questioning the legitimacy of
their financing. But they agreed to accept $2 million in parcels
owned exclusively or shared by Miss Gotti, forcing the Gotti team
in recent days to scramble for additional collateral from friends
and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Vincent Heintz, a government prosecutor, asked for
one additional proviso: the right to inspect the tax returns of
Agnello, who owns several business involved in automobile salvage
and parts, to see if his contributions to Miss Gotti's part of the
property were legitimate. Fox gave the lawyers until next Thursday
to inspect Agnello's tax records.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Rehbock, the longtime Gotti lawyer, ridiculed
the prosecutorial demands, saying that Agnello, through his
automobile enterprises, ``made more money than God every year.''

ASTROS MAKE A BEELINE TO OFFENSE AND EVEN SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For two years, the Killer Bees had been more like
Killer Zzz's in the National League Division Series. As their bats
slept, so slept the Astros' offense. But Craig Biggio, Derek Bell
and Jeff Bagwell awakened from their postseason slumber Thursday at
the Astrodome, and with the help of a game-winning hit by Bill
Spiers, Houston beat San Diego, 5-4, and evened the series at one
game each.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers (who should be named an honorary member of the Killer
Bees for the B in his first name) answered another clutch
postseason home run by Jim Leyritz of the Padres with what Spiers
called ``the biggest hit of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The single in the bottom of the ninth, off San Diego's ace
closer, Trevor Hoffman, scored Ricky Gutierrez to break a 4-4 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who were swept in the first round by the Atlanta
Braves last fall, had not won a postseason game since Game 4 of
their 1986 National League Championship Series with the Mets. After
Tuesday's Game 1 loss to the Padres here, Biggio, Bell and Bagwell
were a combined 2-for-47 in Houston's last playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio and Bagwell jokingly changed their last names Thursday _
Biggio to Howell (in honor of his teammate Jack Howell) and Bagwell
to Mantle (because Mickey Mantle has the most postseason home
runs). It also changed their luck, for Biggio scored two runs,
Bagwell drove in three and Bell homered for his first career
postseason hit, as the Astros took a 4-2 lead into the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   But after Leyritz delivered a tying two-run pinch-hit home run
down the right-field line on a 3-2 pitch off Billy Wagner with two
out, it looked as if Houston might have to wait longer for another
postseason victory.
</P>
<P>
   The clutch homer by Leyritz evoked memories of his game-tying
home run for the Yankees off Mark Wohlers of Atlanta in Game 4 of
the 1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   This one came off a 99 mile-an-hour fastball. ``I pretty much
know I supplied all the power to that home run,'' said Wagner, who
never strayed from his fastball during Leyritz's eight-pitch
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed,'' said Wagner, that the ball stayed fair. So was
Leyritz. ``That's why I stood there at home plate,'' the former
Yankee said.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously shaken, Wagner allowed two singles after Leyritz's
fourth career postseason home run. But the Houston closer finally
struck out pinch-hitter George Arias to leave runners on first and
second.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez led off the ninth against San Diego right-hander
Dan Miceli by beating out single to short, as Chris Gomez's hurried
throw pulled Leyritz off first. And, after Leyritz ``overdove'' an
attempt at a diving catch on foul bunt by Brad Ausmus, Ausmus
fought off a tough full-count pitch to sacrifice Gutierrez to
second.
</P>
<P>
   On came Hoffman, the premier closer in the game. And on
Hoffman's first pitch, Gutierrez made the decision of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman has two moves to the plate, one with a slide step, one
with a higher kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cubbie gave me the no-hold sign,'' said Gutierrez, referring
to third-base coach Mike Cubbage. ``And once I saw Hoffman give me
the big leg kick, I took off.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez was running on his own. The Houston shortstop had only
13 stolen bases in 20 attempts during the regular season. But
because Hoffman forgot to go to the slide step (which results in a
quicker move to the plate), the San Diego catcher Greg Myers did
not even attempt a throw to third.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres responded by intentionally walking Biggio _ who had
scored Houston's first two runs _ to set up a potential double
play. Up stepped Spiers, who had doubled twice in his four previous
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers was well aware that Hoffman, who had saved Game 1 after
recording 53 saves in 54 attempts during the season, has _ in
Spiers' words _ ``the best change up in baseball.'' But Spiers
swung and missed at the first pitch, took a ball, and then fouled a
change up off to fall behind 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   The next change up, Spiers said, ``was down and away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I reached out and got it,'' said Spiers, who golfed the
pitch into right field as Gutierrez easily scored the winning run
from third, enabling the Astros to leave for San Diego with a split
of the first two games.

YANKEES OUTFIELDER STRAWBERRY HAS COLON CANCER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ New York Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry
talked to his manager and teammates before Wednesday's evening
playoff game against the Rangers, and told them not to worry about
a few extra medical tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees knew better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see in his eyes that there was more than that,'' Tim
Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, 36, yesterday was diagnosed with colon cancer after
tests at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. He is
scheduled to have surgery tomorrow to remove a walnut-sized tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the Yankees were scheduled to start batting practice
here yesterday afternoon, Strawberry called the visiting clubhouse.
Andy Pettitte, who pitched the Yankees to a 2-0 lead in Game 2,
answered the phone. New York manager Joe Torre heard from a
teary-eyed Pettitte, then spoke with Strawberry before calling a
team meeting to inform the rest of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was complete silence, some sobbing, very sad people,''
Torre said. ``Hopefully, this is just another obstacle he will be
able to handle. There was no question he was trying to be upbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said Strawberry's condition was a reality check for his
team, which could not celebrate a 3-1 victory Wednesday quite like
the Yankees wanted. The somber mood of Yankees players continued
after batting practice yesterday, which ended at about 6 p.m.
Yankees players gathered on the field at The Ballpark in Arlington.
With his teammates crowded around him, Raines spoke to Strawberry
on camera with ESPN analyst Harold Reynolds before the Yankees
retired to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a message in person, and we're hoping that Darryl was
watching,'' Raines said. ``We want to make sure Darryl knew we're
behind him and his family. We know how strong he is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the location of the tumor and Darryl's otherwise
excellent health, the prognosis for a full recovery is excellent,''
Yankees spokesman Rick Cerrone said.
</P>
<P>
   About 95,000 cases of colon cancer are detected each year,
according to the American Cancer Society. An estimated 46,000
people die of colon cancer annually. The five-year survival rate is
61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's boyhood friend and fellow ballplayer Eric Davis is
recovering from colon cancer. Davis, who grew up with Strawberry in
South Central Los Angeles, found out he had cancer last season. The
Baltimore Orioles' designated hitter bounced back this year to have
one of his best seasons, finishing fourth in the American League
batting race.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry spoke with Davis yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's upbeat about it and ready for the challenges that he's
going to have,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, once the toast of New York baseball as a young star
with the New York Mets, overcame his addiction to drugs and other
off-field problems to resurrect his career as a part-time player
with the Yankees. He capped his comeback by helping the Yankees win
the 1996 World Series. This season, he hit 24 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees teammates vowed to not let him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team was a little bit down today, but we all understand
Darryl would want us to go out, wear his heart and courage on our
sleeves and we will do that tomorrow,'' catcher Joe Giradi said.
``He doesn't want us to sit and worry about him.''

NEWS OF STRAWBERRY'S ILLNESS RATTLES CONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JEFF SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Darryl Strawberry stunned his New York
Yankees teammates when he called the visiting clubhouse at The
Ballpark in Arlington yesterday to inform them he had been
diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his colon. No one took the news
harder than tonight's starting pitcher, David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all very worried, very concerned, but we're also all
optimistic that he can beat this,'' said Cone, visibly shaken at a
news conference. ``Our hearts are really with him right now.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cone, the news hit close to home.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, his former Kansas City Royals teammate, Dan
Quisenberry, died after a nine-month battle with brain cancer. Cone
himself missed four months of the 1996 season after undergoing
surgery to remove an aneurysm from his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   When put into perspective, it's understandable why baseball
games don't mean as much as they once did to Cone, long known as
one of the game's best big-game pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a rookie in Kansas City, Dan was a big influence on
my career,'' said Cone, who will put Strawberry's No. 39 on the
back of his hat tonight. ``When you look back at the past couple of
days and see what happened to him and his family, it shakes you up.
You kind of forget about hanging a slider or the magnitude of the
game and realize what's important when someone's health is on the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   As Strawberry's is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl and I have been close for a long time, and we've had
our ups and downs in New York,'' Cone said of his New York Mets
teammate from 1987-90 and his Yankees teammate since 1996. ``I'm
sure he's going through the same fears I was, and that he doesn't
know what's going on. He probably doesn't understand all the
medical jargon that's being thrown his way. It's an extremely
difficult situation and it can be very confusing and very scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone said education is a key to helping cope when struck with
the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went through my situation, I didn't understand what was
happening to me. I needed to be educated,'' Cone said. ``I didn't
know if it was life or death or if my career was over but those
sort of life-and-death situations supersede baseball in every
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who was informed of his condition in May 1996, returned to
pitch in September. His baseball career, by far his secondary
career at that point, would not be over.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning from his own medical nightmare, Cone has won a
World Series game, been a part of his second world championship
team and pitched in an All-Star Game. And Sunday, he won his 20th
game, becoming the first pitcher in major-league history to produce
20-win seasons 11 years apart.
</P>
<P>
   And, although his 1998 statistics (20-9 record, 3.55 ERA, 209
strikeouts) are not as impressive as his 1988 numbers (20-3, 2.22
ERA, 213 strikeouts) with the New York Mets, Cone is regarded as a
money pitcher come October.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remind yourself that you really weren't supposed
to get him back until probably May or June,'' Yankees manager Joe
Torre said. ``Once he settled in and started giving us the number
of innings that he gave us, that was incredible for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the Rangers should expect the usual from Cone, a
fastball in the low 90s which will come from multiple release
points, one of baseball's best splitters, two curveballs that come
in at different speeds, and a few sliders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rangers are a dangerous team right now because they have
nothing to lose and it's my job not to let them get any momentum
going their way,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   However, no matter how dangerous Cone believes the Rangers might
be, he knows firsthand that nothing in baseball _ even a playoff
game _ means as much to him as what happened over the past two
days.

JOHN GOTTI JR. RELEASED ON $10 MILLION BAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct hed; no other changes.)  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Nine months after he was jailed on a welter
of racketeering charges, John A. Gotti, the son of the Gambino
crime family boss, walked out the front door of the federal
courthouse here as a theoretically free man, but one who will have
to spend the months until and during his trial under strict house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Bouncing down the courthouse steps, Gotti, 34, dressed in a
black turtleneck, black jeans and white sneakers, forced his way
past cameras, walked into a bear hug from his brother-in-law,
Carmine Agnello, and then slipped into a white Mercedes driven by
his sister, Victoria. He was to be taken to his $700,000 home in
Oyster Bay on Long Island where his wife and four children were
preparing a party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balloons are blown up, the decorations are hung and I
suspect the food will be Italian,'' said one of his five lawyers,
Gerald L. Shargel.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's release on bail came after two grueling weeks of
negotiations between his lawyers and federal prosecutors who were
determined to keep Gotti behind bars, even after Judge Barrington
Parker of U.S. District Court agreed to his release. Although two
dozen of Gotti's relatives and friends posted $10 million worth of
homes and businesses as collateral for his bail, prosecutors
subjected them to intense scrutiny to make certain that none were
bought with criminal earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Gotti's lawyers had to fight until the last moment
over $2 million of the bail bond that is secured by an estate owned
by Ms. Gotti, a novelist, and her husband, Agnello. Agnello is
regarded by federal law-enforcement authorities as a senior crime
family apparatchik. The government finally consented to Gotti's
release even as it undertakes a fresh inspection of Agnello's tax
returns for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to Gotti's ample crowd of supporters _ many of them
bull-necked young men in pressed jeans and white sneakers, but
others elderly friends so loyal they were willing to put up their
homes to guarantee his bail _ it was the day they have been waiting
for. ``We're happy to see young John is going home,'' said his
lawyer, Bruce Cutler. ``Everybody's excited; everybody's happy, and
this is the beginning in the battle to clear John's name.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gotti walked to his car he was asked how he felt and he said,
``Great,'' and then he was asked what he was looking forward to and
he replied ``my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Under conditions negotiated between the government and defense
lawyers, Gotti will be confined to his Oyster Bay house around the
clock. He will have to wear a electronic ankle bracelet that tracks
his movements, and will only be able to see visitors on an approved
list. His calls will be monitored and a security guard he must pay
for will be posted outside his house at all hours.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti has been accused of extorting payments from the Scores
strip club in Manhattan and defrauding people who bought prepaid
telephone cards, charges that could result in a maximum sentence of
20 years in prison. His father, John Gotti, 58, is spending a life
sentence in a federal penitentiary in Illinois on charges of
murder. He recently had surgery for throat cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said they regard the younger Gotti, known as
Junior, as the acting boss of the Gambino family in his father's
absence and have fought to keep him in jail.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gotti's trial is scheduled for early January. His lawyers have
said they were eager to spring him from jail so they could consult
on defense strategy without the technical difficulties of visiting
him at the Westchester County Jail in Valhalla, where has been held
since his arrest in January. According to a ruling Thursday by U.S.
Magistrate Mark D. Fox, who is handling the details of the bail
agreement, Gotti will have to apply for visits to his lawyers'
offices in midtown Manhattan if he wants to meet with other
defendants in the complex case.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident by the way Gotti walked into the courtroom
Thursday that a deal had been reached. For the first time in three
court sessions, Gotti smiled, his eyes glinting merrily behind gray
glasses. He waved at his sisters _ Victoria and Angela _ and at his
longtime personal lawyer, Richard Rehbock, and he patted his
stomach, chortling about the weight he had apparently lost during
his imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the jury box and two spectator benches were the two
dozen people who had put up their homes as collateral for the bail.
Gotti's lawyers have repeatedly sought to portray them as humble
working people devoted to Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler suggested that it was important to Gotti that it not seem
as if he was so desperate to get out of jail that he was forced to
rely on friends' generosity. ``The dignity is very important to
him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the hearing began, Shargel told Fox that ``it's been a long
and difficult process, but I'm happy to report to you that we have
raised in excess of $10 million in collateral supported by real
property.'' He conceded, however, that there was still an
unresolved matter.
</P>
<P>
   Agnello and Victoria Gotti own an estate in Old Westbury valued
at $4 million that they have offered as surety, and until recently
it was part of the $10 million collateral. Of that amount, parcels
worth $1.5 million are registered in Miss Gotti's name and some of
the remainder is owned jointly with Agnello.
</P>
<P>
   Government prosecutors evidently did not want to accept any
parcels in Agnello's name alone, questioning the legitimacy of
their financing. But they agreed to accept $2 million in parcels
owned exclusively or shared by Miss Gotti, forcing the Gotti team
in recent days to scramble for additional collateral from friends
and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Vincent Heintz, a government prosecutor, asked for
one additional proviso: the right to inspect the tax returns of
Agnello, who owns several business involved in automobile salvage
and parts, to see if his contributions to Miss Gotti's part of the
property were legitimate. Fox gave the lawyers until next Thursday
to inspect Agnello's tax records.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Rehbock, the longtime Gotti lawyer, ridiculed
the prosecutorial demands, saying that Agnello, through his
automobile enterprises, ``made more money than God every year.''

SENATE APPROVES ROAD THROUGH ALASKA WILDERNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Ark.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Voting mainly on party lines on a question that has
become a touchstone in the debate over development and preservation
of wilderness, the Senate on Thursday approved a gravel road
through remote wildlife habitat in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The road, barely 30 miles long, would slice across the edge of a
wildlife refuge and wilderness area on the Aleutian Peninsula,
where it would connect an isolated village called King Cove to a
long-range air strip in the town of Cold Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Without the road, its backers say, about 700 residents of King
Cove must continue to use unreliable air and boat service in
emergencies, often risking dangerous winds and seas as they seek
medical evacuation to Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the road call the project an unjustifiable
precedent that threatens the seasonal breeding grounds of protected
migratory birds, and they say that improved air or sea service
would be a better alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Thursday, 59-38, was a victory for the state's
congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   But with President Clinton likely to veto the measure, the final
outcome may depend on whether its sponsors can insert the road
proposal into a huge spending bill that is likely to emerge just
before Congress heads home for the Nov. 3 elections. Three
Republicans voted against the bill, and six Democrats voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has repeatedly warned that it will
veto a big spending bill if it contains an array of
anti-environmental provisions that are under consideration. Indeed,
the White House seems to be itching for a partisan fight over
environmental priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But while many Republicans in Congress still appear reluctant to
engage in that broad fight, they were willing Thursday to cast
their lot with the Senate's two powerful Alaskans, Ted Stevens and
Frank Murkowski, both Republicans. A companion bill in the House,
sponsored by Rep. Don Young of Alaska, also a Republican, has not
come to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, a leader of Republican
environmentalists, voted for the road.
</P>
<P>
   Last February Chafee's staff had assembled a score of
environmental lobbyists in his office to plan strategy for opposing
the road, environmental advocates said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They speculated that the senator had changed his position out of
deference to the power of Stevens, who as chairman of the
Appropriations Committee exerts tremendous influence at a time when
a dozen spending bills are in their final stages. A Chafee aide
said Chafee voted reluctantly for the road after Alaska's senators
convinced him of its merits.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said in angry tones Thursday that two-thirds of Alaska's
land was off limits to development and that vital health services
were being denied to his state's residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't use it without permission from some bureaucrat who is
compelled by extreme environmentalists,'' he said. ``They are so
extreme that they say this 330,000-acre Izembek refuge, the
smallest wilderness in Alaska, is so sacrosanct that it can't move
its border 60 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., called the road project a
dangerous precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building a road through a wilderness in Alaska, no matter how
short or how long, would be the first time in the nation we have
voted deliberately to authorize a road through a wilderness area,''
Bumpers said. ``And once you go down that road, nobody knows where
it is going to end.''

SPORTS COLUMN: UNCERTAINTY HOVERING OVER JETS QUARTERBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells was deftly presidential Thursday when he
announced a fundamental change in the New York Jets lineup: Vinny
Testaverde would be the starting quarterback against the Miami
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he told Glenn Foley he would be back in the
starting lineup when he was ready to play. That is ``when he's
ready to play like he was before San Francisco, he'll be back in
the lineup,'' Parcells said. ``That's what I told him, and that's
what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if the Jets win their second consecutive game
with Testaverde as the starter? Parcells hedged and finally said,
somewhat exasperated: ``I don't know. I don't know the answers to
the questions, and whatever I say you're going to put a spin on it;
not that that's wrong, I just want to avoid that. Do you blame
me?''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said that he was just trying to avoid a whole bunch of
``stuff'' going on. ``In a lot of ways.''
</P>
<P>
   So, with 13 games left in the season the 1-2 Jets have a
quarterback dilemma, not a quarterback controversy. Foley is 1-6 as
a starter; Testaverde has had one winning season in an 11-year
career. For Parcells, the decision to start Testaverde wasn't about
personality or ego but about eliminating uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's courageous, swashbuckling style of play continues to
take its physical toll. Parcells said he wasn't comfortable with
what he saw over the past week. Foley, bothered by torn rib
cartilage, wasn't sharp. Maybe he was trying to protect his ribs by
playing it safe rather than running the entire offense, stretching
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to explain it exactly: just a certain way the
ball flies, just a certain way ...,'' Parcells said, pausing. ``I
thought about the right word to use; the word uncertainty is the
word that describes what I'm trying to tell you. In my mind,
there's still a strong degree of uncertainty about his ability to
do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no animosity between the two players; no camps dividing
the team. Foley and Testaverde, who have adjoining lockers, stood
virtually shoulder to shoulder Thursday when they held separate
interviews. There was Testaverde on the left, diplomatically
warding off questions about a deeper meaning to Sunday's start.
There was Foley, visibly more agitated, saying that he hadn't
resigned himself to not starting but that he wasn't going to kick
and scream. ``You can't fight the situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's making the decision. You don't argue with him. You
respect the people you're working for, you respect what they've
been through. He's been through a lot: He's won Super Bowls, he's a
champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells used the Foley-Testaverde interlude as a point of
departure for a broader discussion of football life. They represent
a life cycle of changing ambitions in microcosm: Foley turns 28 on
Oct. 10, Testaverde 35 on Nov. 13. Foley is hungry, eager to prove
himself, to prove that he can complete one full season as
somebody's starting quarterback, that his career should not carry a
stamp: ``Fragile, Handle With Care.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley suffered a season-ending shoulder injury in 1995; a
season-ending knee injury last year, and a season-threatening rib
injury this year. Testaverde is searching for a different
mountaintop. He won the Heisman Trophy in 1986 as a senior at the
University of Miami. He has not played for an NFL championship. His
competitive fire burns with a different heat. Parcells, at 57,
understands Foley's frenetic ambition, but he probably identifies
with Testaverde's veteran attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'd like to be the man,'' Parcells said. ``I don't
think he's lost that. But what I think happens to some of these
guys; as you get older you just gain an appreciation for what you
got. It's like you say, `Gosh, I got a chance to play a young man's
game, here I am 34, 35.' Don't tell me Warren Moon needs the money;
don't tell me Elway needs the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing for me coaching: people ask me that all
the time: `What are you doing?' But people gain an appreciation for
this game that they didn't have before; I know I'm one of them. I
have a much greater appreciation for the people in the game than I
had as a young coach; I was too busy trying to make my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has made his way: three Super Bowl appearances, two
championships, a brilliant reclamation project with the Jets last
year. Now he faces a significant test: an unbeaten division rival,
an unproved defense and a darkening cloud of uncertainty hovering
overhead.

   This is a father-daughter story about a father who didn't take
his children to baseball games but wrote great novels, and a
daughter who saw ``Lawrence of Arabia'' at age 7 and forever after
wanted to make movies. There was a lot of life and pain along the
way, but things worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter, Susanna Styron, is now the director and co-writer
of ``Shadrach,'' her first feature film, about a freed slave who
walks 600 miles to die on his former plantation. It is based on a
semi-autobiographical short story of the same name by her father,
William Styron, who said, naturally, that he is thrilled about the
success of a daughter he calls his fellow ``neurotic
perfectionist.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a story, however, about a watershed father-daughter
bonding experience, which would make it tidy enough for a film of
its own. It is more subtle and ordinary, just like real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful thing to share,'' Ms. Styron, 43, said at
her turn-of-the-century Victorian house in Nyack, N.Y., this week.
``But it wasn't like we were healing old wounds or anything.'' She
added, ``If somebody offered me the chance to do another of his
books, I wouldn't. Because I don't want to spend my whole life
being a daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shadrach,'' which opened last week in New York and Los
Angeles, began as a 1978 Esquire short story. It takes place during
the Depression in the Tidewater country of Virginia, where a
tobacco-plantation clan, the Dabneys, have descended into
moonshining and good-hearted squalor. Paul, a 10-year-old boy from
the right part of town _ based on the young Styron _ comes to spend
a few days with his best friend, Little Mole Dabney, just as the
ailing 99-year-old Shadrach turns up asking for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Styron, who was 23 and just starting a career making
documentaries when the story appeared, immediately called her
father and told him to save it for her. ``I told him I loved it and
to please not let anybody else have the rights to it,'' she said.
``Although I don't think anybody ever asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Years passed _ 14 _ in which Ms. Styron moved to Los Angeles,
got married (to actor Darrell Larson, who plays Paul's father in
``Shadrach'') had two children and wrote screenplays. Her father,
already the author of ``The Confessions of Nat Turner,'' published
``Sophie's Choice,'' was hospitalized for a suicidal depression,
then wrote a 1990 memoir, ``Darkness Visible,'' about what he
called his descent into and return from ``madness.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Ms. Styron picked up her father's short story again,
and with a friend, Bridget Terry, wrote the screenplay, adding a
new beginning and end. Then for the next five years, she tried to
get it made. It didn't help, apparently, that she was Styron's
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was turned down by EVERYBODY _ twice,'' she said. ``In
France, England and the United States. You name it, they passed.''
People told her it was ``too small, too soft, we already have
something with black people in it.'' She laughed, ruefully.
Finally, she made a deal with a company called New Image. Harvey
Keitel signed on as Dabney, Andie MacDowell as Mrs. Dabney. It was
filmed last summer around Wilmington, Del.; the entire project cost
$4.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Her father came down for four days to watch, and didn't meddle.
``He was very helpful in his comments, which weren't many,'' Ms.
Styron said. ``He also completely understood that although this was
his story, it was my film.'' Last week, The New York Times said
``Shadrach'' was ``slight, sweet, sentimental,'' while The Los
Angeles Times called it ``flawless'' and ``deeply felt.''
</P>

<P>
   Ms. Styron talked on the front porch of her house, which looks
out on the Hudson River and has wisteria growing on the porch
railings. She and her family moved in three years ago; under the
house they found a tombstone from 1865, for ``Clarence F.,'' who
died on Valentine's Day when he was 17 months old. ``Clarence,'' as
the family calls him, now leans against a willow tree in the front
yard. ``He's our guardian angel,'' Ms. Styron said. She is a thin,
birdlike redhead, and said she began writing screenplays so she
could stay at home after her first child was born. ``I could barely
stand to be away from her,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her own childhood was spent in Roxbury, Conn., where her father
stayed up late writing, slept late in the mornings, and fell into
black moods. ``I would not say there was not closeness,'' she said.
``I would say there was turmoil. There was pain. There was
sadness.'' She added, ``He was scary sometimes, but I've always
felt fairly close to him. I'm also more like him. I fight back with
him. We have similar temperaments, and it keeps us engaged with
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was 10, her father gave her an 8-mm movie camera.
``She'd get her little sisters dressed up in costumes, and then
she'd direct,'' said Ms. Styron's mother, Rose. ``She got
performances out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when Ms. Styron's father was in the psychiatric
unit of Yale-New Haven Hospital, Ms. Styron spliced all the home
movies together, then brought them in a special reel to her father
on Christmas Day. The whole family watched with him. He had gone in
two weeks before, and would stay for another six.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful way to take your clinically depressed
father and give him a boost,'' Styron said. ``It lifted my spirits
enormously.''

POLAND STANDS ITS GROUND NEXT TO SINKING RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ When Russia went into a tailspin earlier this
year, Poland's stock market crashed. Investors pulled $1 billion in
short-term capital out of the country and prepared for Poland to
descend into the maelstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the panic that threatened to upset Eastern Europe's largest
economy, and most notable success story, appears at the moment to
have receded. Russia remains in distress, but Poland is moving
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the stock market sprang back 6.2 percent and the
currency, the zloty, has gained against major currencies like the
dollar and the mark.
</P>
<P>
   (On Thursday, the stock market fell 6.74 percent as shares fell
sharply in many countries, but it is up 4.8 percent over the last
month.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, as if to demonstrate its confidence to a
world hanging on every shift in mood and perception, the National
Bank of Poland, the central bank, trimmed its key lending rate to
18 percent from 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Boguslaw Grabowski, a member of the central bank's monetary
policy council, which oversees the currency, described the zloty's
recent volatility as ``its biggest test ever'' and said that ``the
exam was passed excellently, without intervention from the National
Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The volume of short-term capital flight, he said in an
interview, was about $1 billion of a total $4.5 billion in
short-term capital invested in the country, and the central bank
has been heartened by a gradual revival of capital flows to Poland.
</P>
<P>
   As an important engine for growth in the region, Poland's
success has eased the fear that the crisis in Russia could spill
over to its smaller neighbors to the west, which are still
struggling to overhaul their economies after decades of communist
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The zloty has fared remarkably well,'' said Krzysztof Sidor,
head of research at the Pioneer investment fund in Poland. Outflows
of capital, he said, have been largely a result of investors
``taking profit in Poland to cover Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Poland is not home free. The economy's resilience can in
large measure be attributed to its success in hooking itself to the
locomotive of Western Europe, and an expected slowdown there could
weaken Poland further.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union accounts for about 70 percent of Polish
trade, roughly the share that went to the Soviet Union and its
allies before communism collapsed in 1989, and the United States is
the top source of foreign direct investment, which in the first
half of this year totaled more than $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Bergeron, head of research for Citibank in Warsaw,
described Poland's economy as a ``rail car attached to the
high-speed European train.'' But Western Europe's train is fast
losing steam as a result of the crisis in emerging markets and the
slowing growth in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Bergeron modestly trimmed his Polish growth
estimate for next year to 4.6 percent, from an earlier forecast of
5.8 percent. The central bank still expects growth of 5.4 percent
to 5.5 percent, but with economies slowing in Western Europe,
Poland cannot escape the effects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Poland's success has been a result of large injections
of foreign direct investment, which this year reached $20.6
billion, pushing Poland past Hungary as the region's biggest
recipient since 1989. But with corporate profits under pressure in
the United States and Western Europe, where most of that capital
originates, the flow of money to Poland could dwindle.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While 65 percent of jobs in the economy are now in the private
sector, large chunks of business remain to be privatized, including
Telekomunikacja Polska, the phone company, which the government
plans to bring to the stock exchange in November.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, heavily indebted branches of the nationalized economy,
like health care and the coal and steel industries, continue to
weigh heavily on the government budget. A selloff of nationalized
assets, given wildly gyrating world stock markets, will prove
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   What calms investors, however, is the fact that Poland has sound
financial accounts, bolstered by an economy that is proving
remarkably resilient. Though Poland's official trade with Russia
accounts for only 8 percent of the total, it is supplemented by a
vigorous cross-border trade, often based on barter, that adds about
$500 million a month to Poland's export earnings. Thus far, that
trade has not collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   From January to July, Poland's total exports, which rose 20
percent from 1997 levels, outstripped imports, which rose by 15
percent, pushing the current account deficit down to $2.6 billion,
from $3 billion in 1997. Even as capital gushed out of emerging
markets from Indonesia to Russia and Brazil, Poland's currency
reserves steadily rose to $27.5 billion from $24.3 billion in June,
before Russia's troubles began.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're by far the best of a weaker bunch,'' Bergeron of
Citibank said.

ADVERTISING: A NEW SPOT FOR CHANEL NO. 5 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The marketers of Chanel No. 5 will again ask consumers to
``Share the fantasy,'' with a lavish spot that tries to make a sale
with a fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   The extravagant, elaborate spot, based on ``Little Red Riding
Hood,'' will run initially in the United States, to be shown on
Monday on MTV _ the first time a commercial for Chanel No. 5 has
appeared on that youth-oriented cable television network. The
pitch-cum-fable will be supplemented by advertising in magazines
and in stores that sell Chanel No. 5, and then be introduced in
slightly different versions in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial was conceived by Luc Besson, the French director
of films like ``The Fifth Element'' and ``La Femme Nikita,'' with
creative contributions from Jacques Helleu, artistic director at
the Chanel couture house in Paris. It features the model Estella
Warren as a grown-up Little Red in a riding hood that Karl
Lagerfeld, the designer of Chanel apparel, created for the
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The spot, which updates ``Little Red Riding Hood'' by adding
splashes of sophistication and sex, marks a return to the
larger-than-life, surrealistic style of advertising that was
emblematic of the No. 5 fragrance from 1979 through the early
1990s, most notably in Dali-esque commercials directed by Ridley
Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a tough world where there are a lot of problems, fantasy is
healthy,'' said Arie Kopelman, president and chief operating
officer of Chanel Inc. in New York, the U.S. unit of Chanel.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial also exemplifies the ambitious efforts by
marketers of venerable brands to keep them fresh as competition
intensifies in categories like fashion that are particularly
vulnerable to the whims of fickle consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to ``keep an old brand healthy and young,'' Kopelman
said. ``You have to reach out and bring in new users.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to accomplish that is to continually remake campaigns.
For Chanel No. 5, which was introduced in 1921, Chanel has changed
commercials five times in the last 19 years, presenting spiels
centered on such elements as imaginary pools and gardens, Marilyn
Monroe and the art of Andy Warhol.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a brand that's over 75 years old, it's hard to convey
modernity,'' said Laurie Palma, vice president for fragrance
marketing at Chanel Inc. ``Advertising helps us keep the brand
modern, not just classic.''
</P>
<P>
   And this time, though the commercial is imbued with many fantasy
elements, there is a harder-selling orientation as evinced by the
appearance of the number five every few moments along with a giant
wall of glowing No. 5 bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercial is a fairy tale for big kids, focused on Chanel
No. 5 in a way we think takes everything we've ever done creatively
full circle,'' Kopelman said.
</P>
<P>
   The spot starts with music from the film ``Edward Scissorhands''
and a shot of Ms. Warren treading a footbridge to an armored door
marked with the ``5'' from the No. 5 logo. She gains entry with an
access code _ yes, 5. Taking a bottle from the wall, she proceeds
to the exit. The Eiffel Tower amid cinematic snow reveals the
setting to be Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at not having a French element,'' Kopelman said,
``but it's key to remind people that this product, the first
designer fragrance, is after all French.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a black wolf emerges, ready to pounce. But beauty
prevails over the beast, defusing the attack with a tender shush.
As Ms. Warren departs, the wolf howls and the camera pulls back to
show an oversized ``5'' on the floor, which then becomes a bottle
of Chanel No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The American version of the spot ends with an announcer urging
viewers to ``Share the fantasy.'' The European version omit those
final words and runs longer than the 30-second American version.
</P>
<P>
   The spot will make its debut on MTV as part of the plans to
reach ``a younger audience,'' Ms. Palma said, ``which at one point
was 40-plus but is now 30-plus or even younger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we've learned,'' she added, ``is that young people
increasingly talk about escaping from reality and the stress in the
world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lyle Saunders, vice president for creative services at Chanel
Inc., noted the popularity of extreme sports and computer games
with that demographic group as proof of their burgeoning interest
in fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   In early November, the spot will be shown on two other cable
networks watched by younger consumers, VH1 and E Entertainment
Television. A month later, it will begin on broadcast TV stations
in 38 big markets around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel Inc. intends to spend more than $3.2 million to advertise
Chanel No. 5 on television in the fourth quarter, Kopelman said,
compared with almost $1.3 million in the corresponding period a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine ads will run in titles including Elle, Harper's
Bazaar, Los Angeles, The New Yorker and Vogue. The in-store
advertising will take place at such chains as Bloomingdale's, Lord
&AMP; Taylor, Macy's, Nordstrom, Robinsons-May and Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the commercial to appear in France on Oct. 16 and
then expand to Germany, Italy and Spain in early December.
</P>
<P>
   And if a red-hooded blonde, a wall of perfume bottles and a
howling wolf are not sufficient to stimulate additional sales for
Chanel No. 5, there is a packaging innovation, too: For the first
time, an eau de parfum spray will be sold in the brand's classic
beveled bottle.

</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education
affirmed that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.
At the time of the ruling, four other cases had been made part of
the Brown case, including one in which Redding argued for school
integration in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Redding, Delaware's only black lawyer for two decades, was
prominent in the struggle for desegregation there, in fields
including housing. He was a longtime local counsel for the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Delaware. He
worked for the Public Defender's Office in Wilmington, Del., from
1965 to 1984 and then retired from the law.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Alexandria, Va., Redding was reared in Wilmington. He
received a bachelor's degree in 1923 from Brown University and a
law degree in 1928 from Harvard. He became the first black to be
admitted to the Delaware bar and began practicing law in the state
in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Simple Justice: The History of Brown vs. Board of
Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality'' (Random
House, 1976), Richard Kluger described Redding as a ``man of great
dignity and elocution that would be well regarded in Buckingham
Palace'' who ``fought, largely alone, for the civil rights and
liberties of black Delawareans.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Jack Greenberg, who worked with Redding as a lawyer
for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, on civil rights
cases in Delaware, said, ``His father was a mailman, and he came
back to Delaware because his father thought there should be a black
lawyer in Delaware.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, who now teaches civil rights law at Columbia Law
School, first met Redding several years before the Brown ruling. At
that time, Greenberg recalled Thursday, ``He was one of a very
small group of black lawyers in the country who were handling civil
rights cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Redding and Greenberg worked together in the years preceding the
Brown ruling on a civil rights case involving the University of
Delaware, which did not admit blacks, and on another one that
became part of the Brown case.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Delaware case began in 1949 and involved black
students from Delaware State College who had been refused admission
to the university. As Kluger wrote, Greenberg and Redding ``put
together an overwhelming case on the comparative merits of the
white university and the Delaware State College for Negroes.'' The
university lost the case in 1950 and was desegregated by court
order.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg went on to work with Redding in on a suit filed in
1951 on behalf of black schoolchildren in Delaware who had not been
permitted to enroll in white public schools in the state.
</P>
<P>
   A court ruled in favor of the black schoolchildren in 1952, but
the state of Delaware appealed that ruling and the case went on to
become part of the Brown case before the High Court. The Delaware
case was the last of the five school cases heard by the court, and
Redding and Greenberg, as Kluger put it, ``held that the temporary
relief granted to the clients by the courts below was not
sufficient and that the state ought to be permanently enjoined from
segregating its students.''
</P>
<P>
   Redding's brother Saunders Redding, an author and Cornell
professor, died in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Redding's first marriage, to Ruth Albert Cook Redding,
ended in divorce. His second wife, the former Gwendolyn Carmen
Kiah, died in June.
</P>
<P>
   Redding is survived by three daughters, Ann Holmes Redding of
Atlanta, Rupa Cook Redding-Lallinger of Chapel Hill, N.C., and
Judith Boardman Redding of Aberdeen, Md., and five grandchildren.

BASEBALL COLUMN: A RERUN OF 1978 FOR DENT AND ZIMMER? 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The New York Yankees have done two-thirds of
their part, and with David Cone pitching Friday night, they can
reasonably be expected to notch the final third. The Boston Red Sox
have a little more work to do. They are only a third of the way
toward creating the playoff series to end all playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   One more Yankees victory over the Texas Rangers, Friday or
Saturday here or Sunday night in New York, and two victories for
the Red Sox over the Cleveland Indians will place the Red Sox in
Yankee Stadium next Tuesday night for the start of the American
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great,'' Don Zimmer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a fun series if that's what happens,'' Bucky Dent
said. ``It's going to create a lot of excitement simply because of
the Yankees and Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   The careers of Zimmer, a coach with the Yankees, and Dent, a
coach with the Rangers, are inexorably linked forever because of
the Yankees and the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone _ a Martian or a Plutonian, perhaps, not know _
Zimmer was the Red Sox manager who oversaw the team's 14-game
collapse in 1978, and Dent was the Yankees' shortstop whose
three-run home run sealed the Red Sox demise in a legendary playoff
game 20 years ago Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being that it's 20 years after we beat them in a one-game
playoff is just going to add more drama,'' Dent said of the dream
series next week.
</P>
<P>
   Texas fans could accuse Dent of treasonous behavior for even
speaking hypothetically. But some events transcend current
allegiances or paychecks, and Dent understood that when the
possibility of a Red Sox-Yankees series was raised.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer, too, discussed it even though every time the rivalry
between the Yankees and the Red Sox is raised, he is asked about
and reminded of his worst managerial nightmare. Were the teams to
play for the American League pennant, the questions would cascade
again.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. ``They all do that now anyhow,'' he said, speaking
of his visits to Boston. ``I've almost got that wore out now. Some
of the younger guys up there don't even know what '78 was.''
</P>
<P>
   But baseball thrives on history, on great events of the past.
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa spent the summer chasing the ghosts of
Babe Ruth and Roger Maris, and the country followed their every
stride, urging them on, cheering deliriously when they neared the
ghosts, then caught them, then passed them.
</P>
<P>
   Fans and nonfans alike in New York and Boston, and all stops in
between and on the fringes, if not the entire nation, could not
resist a post-season encounter of this kind.
</P>
<P>
   If there are downsides to the wild-card format, one has to
grudgingly acknowledge the occasional upside. This dream series is
made possible only through the advent of the wild card. Until the
wild card, the teams could never meet in the post-season because
they played in the same league or division.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the year the wild card made its debut, the Yankees and
the Red Sox both reached the post-season, the Yankees as the wild
card, the Red Sox as division champions. But no clamor for a league
series between the two arose. The Yankees were too busy scrapping
with the Seattle Mariners in a memorable five-game series, and the
Red Sox were too quickly ushered out of the playoffs by the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But the time seems right this year. Maybe it has something to do
with the year ending in an ``8.''
</P>
<P>
   Dent, like Zimmer, cannot go to Boston without hearing about
'78. ``Oh yeah,'' he said when asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a great baseball town, a great tradition,'' Dent
said. ``They've had to overcome all these nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone forgiven him for burying the beloved Sox? ``No,'' he
said, laughing. ``Never. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Randolph played next to Dent in the Yankees' infield and
now coaches in the opposite dugout. Don't think he hasn't
daydreamed of the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm hoping for,'' he said after arriving at the
Ballpark in Arlington. ``It would be great. It would get the
rivalry going again. That's what baseball needs. It would be just
like old times.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph admitted that he had allowed his daydreams to go beyond
a series with the Red Sox. What better way to top off the year than
playing the Chicago Cubs in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting ahead of myself,'' he said. ``It's a long shot,
but the Red Sox and the Cubs would be great. That would be the
ultimate post-season for me.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Zimmer. ``Wouldn't it be something to play one or the
other or both?'' asked the ancient coach, who managed the Cubs in
1989, the last time they were in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the Red Sox beat the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be very sweet for them,'' Dent said. ``For them it
would wipe out a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph laughed at the prospect of a Red Sox victory. ``Well,''
he said, ``they need one real bad. It's been a long time. But we're
going to make sure that doesn't happen. We'll make sure they'll
suffer a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Red Sox were to win, they could play the Cubs in the
World Series. The last time the Red Sox won the World Series, they
played the Cubs. That happened in another year that ended in ``8,''
1918.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about that,'' Randolph said. ``I don't want to
see that.''

BASKETBALL COLUMN: FOR WILKENS, IT'S HARDLY THE BILLING THAT
COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ The statue of Larry Bird will be unveiled
on Friday afternoon, a few hours before the enshrinement dinner.
Like the hotel rooms here, nearly every event surrounding his
induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame is sold out.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how old, the Bird story is still a compelling one _
rife with details about the hick from French Lick, Ind., who along
with Magic Johnson strapped the National Basketball Association on
his shoulders in 1979 until his back gave out in 1992. Perhaps
Boston's greatest sports icon, Bird will be paid homage less than
an hour's drive from the working-class city he seemed to personify
on the floor. He is deserving as ever.
</P>
<P>
   It is just too bad Lenny Wilkens' legend has to come second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that doesn't bother me at all,'' Wilkens, who will join
John Wooden as the only one to be inducted into a sports hall of
fame as both a player and a coach, said Thursday night. ``I mean, a
lot of friends and family will be here and I'm happy for Larry and
everybody else going in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' he added, ``people aren't really talking about
basketball, with the lockout. We're not in the forefront. And
baseball has had a great year. It's not a huge deal that people
aren't noticing.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Bird, Wilkens will enter the hall with Marques
Haynes, the first Harlem Globetrotter to be inducted, the former
Rochester Royal and Boston Celtics star Arnie Risen and three other
coaches, the longtime NBA mentor Alex Hannum, the University of
Texas women's coach Jody Conradt and the Yugoslavian coach
Aleksandar Nikolic.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens never had a genuine superstar to bail him out. All he
did was win with what he had. Even then, he had to surpass Red
Auerbach, his presenter Friday, as the winningest coach of all time
for people to raise a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens, 60, still going strong with the Atlanta Hawks, plans to
honor the remaining four years of his contract. He understands
where the league has been, where it has gone and, most important,
why he can't be a curmudgeon if he is going to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find his ability to communicate with today's players truly
special, coming from the era Lenny came from,'' said Hannum, who
once devoted entire scouting reports to Wilkens, the resourceful
point guard in shiny satin trunks. ``He almost transcends time, in
a way. He's gone from dealing with all the good guys who didn't
have agents to dealing with the modern player. I know I couldn't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brooklyn in 1937, Wilkens went on to play at Boys High
before starring at Providence College. He entered the Hall of Fame
as a player in 1989 and was named to the NBA's team of top 50
players in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 25 seasons as a coach, he has won 1,120 games and a
championship with Seattle in 1979. Factor in the regular season,
playoffs and All-Star games, and no other person has participated
in more games in league history as a player and a coach (3,319).
And yet, when his name came up as a candidate for a vacant job for
much of the last decade, it somehow always came after Pat Riley and
Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always funny for me to watch everyone else get the
attention, but now it just makes me damn mad,'' Wilkens' wife,
Marilyn, said. ``He's carried himself with dignity and class
throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understood the laid-back label, either. Larry Bird was
so laid back last year, at times he looked like a corpse. But he
was dubbed a genius. For one year of coaching. Lenny's been around
for 36 years. I love Larry and it's no fault of his. But what are
these double standards? It makes you wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens said: ``Perception is not reality. People assumed John
Wooden was laid back, too. How can you be laid back and win as many
games as we did? My players know differently.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There might be other factors, too. When we won a
championship in Seattle, it was clear across the world in many
ways. The only halfway decent media market I've coached in has been
Atlanta, and that's partly because of CNN. I would've loved to be
in some of those other places. I would've loved to coach a
superstar like Michael Jordan or Patrick Ewing. But I haven't. So
I'm not going to cry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the video montage of Bird's career is played Friday night
at the enshrinement dinner, some of the greatest players and
coaches will stand and applaud. The ovation should be electric and
memorable. You just hope they don't forget to clap as loud for
Lenny. &QL;

EDITORIAL: FAIR TAXATION IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 2:
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth in sales of goods over the Internet raises hard
questions about how states might fairly tax those transactions. The
same problem has existed for years in mail-order sales. Consumers
are technically liable for sales taxes on all purchases, including
out-of-state catalog purchases, but mail-order companies are
required to collect sales taxes only in states where they maintain
a physical presence. This loophole costs state and local
governments about $3.5 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The National Governors' Association and local government groups
are rightly worried that they will lose billions more a year from
Internet sales that would otherwise be taxable in a traditional
store. That loss _ estimated to reach $10 billion a year in the
next decade _ will have a disproportionate impact on states that
depend heavily on sales taxes, providing a tax break mostly for the
affluent who have access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Online service providers and electronic commerce lobbying
groups, of course, want to make cyberspace tax-free, arguing that
taxation would choke off Internet growth. Tax policy should not
discriminate against electronic sales. But neither should the
Internet be protected from taxes that apply in other realms of
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should keep the principle of parity in mind as it works
through the proposed Internet Tax Freedom Act. The bill is intended
to give state and federal officials some breathing room to tackle
these issues in a coordinated fashion. The House version, approved
in June, would establish a three-year moratorium on any new
Internet sales taxes and taxes on access to online services. It
would also create a national advisory commission to examine ways to
improve tax collection on all remote sales, including possible
changes in Federal law to close the out-of-state-sales loophole.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, which debates the bill Friday, should resist
extending the moratorium to five years, as some senators want. A
long moratorium is unnecessary and would be hard to undo as
consumers and businesses become accustomed to a tax-free
cyberspace. In the meantime, the dozen states that have enacted
Internet access taxes should be allowed to keep those taxes in
place. Congress has no good reason to truncate state taxing
authority, particularly since Internet commerce is thriving.

COMMENTARY: MAYOR OWES THE DRUG WAR'S GENERAL A SALUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's enduring passions is
to demonize people as moral or social defectives when their only
sin is daring to disagree with him.
</P>
<P>
   No question, a lot of New Yorkers admire that part of his
personality. Polls consistently show that many approve of the
pugnacious way he sets his agenda, even when they also describe him
as unlikable. It takes a tough guy to run a tough town, and all
that.
</P>
<P>
   But New Yorkers do not lack an appreciation for fair play.
</P>
<P>
   Just as many of them, if not more, are weary of being constantly
lectured about civility by someone who is cosmically uncivil to
those holding opinions different from his own. Time and again, the
mayor has taken a verbal blowtorch to people offering even mild
dissent, casting them as morally bankrupt, politically fossilized,
fiscally corrupt or, one of his favorite constructions,
intellectually dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani may have outdone himself in his recent jihad against
methadone programs for heroin addicts.
</P>
<P>
   He was not content simply to preach the virtues of abstinence
from all drugs while taking exception with Gen. Barry McCaffrey,
the White House drug czar, who proposes expanding methadone
treatment. Even though this is a complex matter crying out for
reasoned debate, the mayor, as usual, could not keep from picking
up the same flamethrower that he aims at the likes of Khallid Abdul
Muhammad. He cast the general as an enemy of decency.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give up the idea of a drug-free America is a disgrace,'' he
said. He also said, ``I think General McCaffrey is a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   That made James McDonough mad.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough is the director of strategy in McCaffrey's drug-policy
office. That makes him something less than a neutral observer. But
as a retired Army officer himself, he has known the general for 30
years. And to hear his colleague being vilified with words like
``disaster'' and ``disgrace'' was more than he could take.
</P>
<P>
   ``To characterize him as a disaster,'' McDonough said by phone
from Washington, ``is profoundly unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   And profoundly disrespectful, others would add. Agree or not
with McCaffrey's ideas on drugs, he has more than earned the right
to courteous treatment, especially from someone who never wore his
country's uniform, like Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   This ``disaster,'' now 56, was the youngest four-star general,
as well as the most highly decorated Army general on active duty,
when President Clinton appointed him to the drug post in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Twice he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the United
States' second-highest medal for valor. ``If you get one, that's
incredible,'' McDonough said. ``If you get two, you're lucky to be
alive.'' Other McCaffrey medals include two Silver Stars, three
Bronze Stars and three Purple Hearts, for wounds received in the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you about that third Purple Heart,'' McDonough
said. ``He's commanding an infantry company, attacking a dug-in
North Vietnamese unit, when he takes a .50-caliber round in his
left arm. It almost completely severs the arm. Those rounds are
big. The fact that he doesn't die is a miracle. But he refuses to
be evacuated. Why? There he is, a young company commander who
doesn't want to leave his men.''
</P>
<P>
   His wounds were so severe that his wife, Jill, burned the
letters that he had written her, to help them erase the memory of
the war. Eventually, he regained use of the arm. Years later,
during the Persian Gulf war, McCaffrey led the 24th Infantry
Division on the ``left hook'' assault up the banks of the Euphrates
that wiped out dozens of Iraqi divisions.
</P>
<P>
   And where was Giuliani, who is about the same age, while Barry
McCaffrey was getting shot up in Vietnam? Attending law school and
clerking for a federal judge, who wrote to the draft board to
secure a deferment for his protege.
</P>
<P>
   That puts the mayor in the same category as other tough-talking
Republican men of the Vietnam generation who may have their eyes on
the White House: Dan Quayle, Newt Gingrich, Pat Buchanan, Jack
Kemp. One way or another, all managed to avoid regular Army service
when the bullets were flying.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, while he was being reviled as a disaster, McCaffrey
was asked what he thought of Giuliani. He called him ``a great
mayor,'' having learned at the cost of his own blood what it means
to be an officer and a gentleman.

RABBI DENIES PLAYING POLITICS  
 FROM WEAPONS TO LECTURE TOURS  
 END OF A SOLO  
 UNFAMILIAR ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Those who expect politics _ or religion _ to exist in
a vacuum don't know New York.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting the Kol Nidre service Tuesday evening at Central
Synagogue's temporary sanctuary in the 7th Regiment Armory on Park
Avenue, RABBI PETER RUBINSTEIN asked the congregation to take note
of someone he said had been a special friend to the congregation in
the last few weeks, SENATOR ALFONSE D'AMATO.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation's 126-year-old landmark home was damaged in a
fire in August, and Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur services were held
at the armory using a backdrop created by the designer Robert
Isabell.
</P>
<P>
   The D'Amato introduction troubled some in the congregation.
``Whatever he did, mention it in the newsletter,'' said one person
who attended the service. ``I'd be equally outraged if it were
Chuck Schumer.'' Schumer is D'Amato's Democratic challenger.
</P>
<P>
   MARTIN KLEIN, the president of the synagogue, said that the
mention of D'Amato and other public officials was not meant to
inject politics into the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in any way, shape or form,'' he said. ``This is a
religious event, it was a spiritual evening and we did pay thanks
to a host of people who had been very helpful to us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and Rubinstein had also mentioned Gov. George
Pataki, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, state Sen. Roy Goodman, and Jerome
Hauer, the director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management,
all of whom had attended the Rosh Hashana service.
</P>
<P>
   From Weapons to Lecture Tours
</P>
<P>
   SCOTT RITTER, who quit last month as the U.S. weapons inspector
in Iraq, has decided to try talking to nondiplomats for a while.
Ritter, 37, is heading to the lecture circuit. This week he signed
a deal with Greater Talent Network, a lecture-booking agency that
also represents RICHARD HOLBROOKE, President Clinton's choice for
representative at the United Nations; ADMIRAL WILLIAM CROWE JR.,
the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and New York GOV.
GEORGE PATAKI.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter was said to be traveling Thursday and not available to
discuss what he plans to lecture about. The head of Greater Talent,
DON EPSTEIN, would not say how much money Ritter would command as a
speaker, but did say that he was marketing Ritter to corporations
and colleges.
</P>

   ``For colleges, he wants to get the word out, talk about Iraq,''
Epstein said. ``Corporate America sees him from a different point
of view: leadership, crisis management, strategic planning. He
relates to them, Wall Street, the banks, what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein also said that Ritter _ who charged the Clinton
administration with privately blocking efforts to uncover Iraq's
clandestine weapons programs while publicly expressing support _
was not interested in playing the Washington game of attack and
counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no ax,'' Epstein said of Ritter. ``He's a Boy Scout
kind of guy. You really have the sense that he really knows what's
going on here, but he doesn't want to make this personal and he
thinks that everybody else is making it personal.''
</P>
<P>
   End of a Solo
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Friday is the last day that the ``Today'' show host
is a single guy. MATT LAUER is scheduled to marry ANNETTE ROQUE on
Saturday in Water Mill. And Lauer's decorator, JENNIFER POST, has
been busy.
</P>
<P>
   Lauer hired Ms. Post to work on his East Side apartment before
he began dating Ms. Roque. But with Ms. Roque moving uptown from
her loft in TriBeCa, Ms. Post has made some changes. She removed
what she called ``some of the masculine touches,'' like sailing and
golfing prints. ``She's bringing her pictures, her art,'' Ms. Post
said, not to mention antiques. Lauer also agreed to give up a
golfing closet for wardrobe space, Ms. Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfamiliar Role
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ARNOT WALKER was not a household name except,
perhaps, in two high-profile realms, the Democratic party and ABC
News.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday PETER JENNINGS was the anchor for something quite
different from a newscast: a memorial service for Walker, who had
been his spokesman for eight years and who died on Monday. Before
he went to ABC News, Walker worked for BELLA ABZUG, GERALDINE
FERRARO, WALTER MONDALE, JOHN GLENN, FRANK LAUTENBERG and other
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings looked out at the crowd of 600 at the Brick Church, on
Park Avenue at 91st Street _ a crowd that included the chairman of
ABC News, ROONE ARLEDGE, and dozens of correspondents, producers
and executives _ and thanked them on behalf of Walker's ``most
intimate friends.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, shook his head and tried again. ``We are all Arnot's
most intimate friends,'' he said.

5 N.J. TEENS HOSPITALIZED AFTER INGESTING TOXIC WEED 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARMINGDALE, N.J. _ As four teen-agers lay in the hospital after
eating a toxic weed to try to get high, teachers at Howell Township
High School in this small flatlands town found themselves giving
unusual drug lectures on Thursday _ on the dangers of the wild and
plentiful plant, which grows within a block of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after one such talk, a 16-year-old boy went to the
nurse's office, complaining he was not feeling well after having
ingested the seeds of the plant, jimson weed, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The five cases underline what appears to be the growing
popularity of the weed among teen-agers in the area seeking a quick
high _ whether or not they know of its potentially deadly effects.
Howell Police Detective Eric Rice said bags of 100 seeds sell for
$5, and teen-agers chat about them on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Three days ago, the four teen-age boys became critically ill
after eating the seeds. Three of them remained in critical
condition Thursday at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in nearby
Neptune, while the fourth was listed in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials refused to identify them or discuss their
cases. But Dr. Charles Dadzie, head of the pediatric unit, said all
were still suffering from hallucinations, rapid heartbeats,
periodic seizures and dryness of the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The boy who was stricken Thursday was also at the hospital, and
listed Thursday afternoon in satisfactory condition, with symptoms
less severe than the four earlier victims. They include a
13-year-old, two 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Daniel Cosgrove of the New Jersey State Police said the
earlier victims were too incoherent from the effects of the weed to
tell police about how they came to ingest it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were totally out of it,'' he said. ``The next day, they
were still out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that we get the word out to other young people,
that they don't go out and try it,'' he said. ``It can have a fatal
effect on your system. You can slip into a coma.''
</P>
<P>
   Information on how many seeds the five ingested was not
available, but Dadzie said that one can get a poisonous reaction by
ingesting as few as 20 of the peppercorn-size seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have declined to discuss where the
five victims obtained the seeds or where they were when they ate
them. But the seeds are easily obtainable.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters found several of the three-foot-tall jimson weed
plants at the edge of a cornfield, growing among some wild
raspberries near from Howell High School.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the plants were common in open fields and
woodlands and along creek banks throughout Farmingdale and
surrounding Howell Township, including the meadows south of the
Howell police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Students said they did not believe that use among local students
was rampant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anyone who goes near them,'' said one high school
senior, Stefanie Negro. She said her classmates had a mixed
reaction to the five cases. ``I feel bad they're suffering,'' Ms.
Negro said as she started work this afternoon at an ice cream
parlor on Main Street. ``But don't go asking for trouble. If you do
something stupid you've got to expect problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But some officials fear that the recent spotlight on jimson weed
is prompting other teen-agers to try it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids hear that it's a hallucinogen, and they think it could be
a good high,'' said Dr. Steven Marcus, executive director of the
education program for the New Jersey Poison Control Center. ``But
it's extremely hard to control the dose and the side effects are
completely disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said there was no part of the plant that was safe. ``The
roots are toxic. The leaves are toxic. The pods are toxic,'' he
said. ``The stems are toxic.''

AMBULANCE DRIVER ARRESTED AFTER CRASH KILLS THREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An ambulance driver was arrested on charges of
manslaughter Thursday after the police said she sped through a red
light on a nonemergency call and caused a crash that killed three
children Wednesday night in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The children _ aged 2, 5 and 7 _ died almost instantly when the
Nissan Sentra that their mother was driving was struck by the
private ambulance at 11:55 p.m., the police said. Their 9-year-old
sister was critically injured in the crash, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the ambulance, Anne Lamberson, 34, of Queens, was
arrested on three counts of manslaughter, said Detective Thomas
McGrath of the accident investigation squad.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said, ``It was not a legitimate
emergency, and she should not have been driving with her lights and
sirens on, and she should not have gone through a red light.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lamberson was driving east on Kings Highway at 50 to 70 mph
_ the limit there is 30 mph _ when she ran through a red light at
Bedford Avenue and struck the car, which was going south, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The car was being driven by Angela Igwe, 32, an immigrant from
Nigeria who was taking her four children home to Coney Island from
the Flatbush beauty parlor where she works. Horrified witnesses
described seeing Ms. Igwe crawling out of the car and begging for
help for her children, who were trapped inside the crumpled
wreckage. No one in the car had been wearing a seat belt, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was screaming that she was losing her children, that she
needed a telephone to call for help,'' said Sean Doyle, 22, who
heard the crash and saw neighbors rush to try to pull the children
from the car.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the police and ambulances arrived and took the
injured to hospitals. One of Ms. Igwe's sons, Akintonde Morak, 2,
was pronounced dead at Coney Island Hospital; her other son,
Olusegun Morak, 5, was pronounced dead at Community Hospital of
Brooklyn, and one of her daughters, Damilola Morak, 7, was
pronounced dead at Kings County Hospital Center, the police said.
Ms. Igwe and her eldest daughter, Ibornka Morak, 9, were taken to
Kings County Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, Ms. Igwe was listed in serious but
stable condition; Ibornka was in critical condition, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   An uncle of the children, Isaac Muyibi, 38, visited the scene of
the crash Thursday and saw the crumpled Nissan, with the tiny
sneakers that belonged to his nephews and niece still lying by the
bloodstained back seat. ``When I saw the sneakers of those kids, it
touched me more than I can say,'' he said somberly Thursday when he
returned to Ms. Igwe's apartment. ``There was so much damage. I can
only imagine the pain that they had gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said the ambulance, which is operated by Transcare
Ambulance, a private company in Long Island City, Queens, was on
its way to pick up a patient on East 86th Street in Canarsie for a
``nonpriority'' medical call when it crashed into Ms. Igwe's car,
which had the right of way. He said skid marks indicated that the
ambulance driver tried to brake just before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulances of the city's Emergency Medical Service, like police
and fire vehicles, are allowed to speed and run through red lights
in emergencies provided that they slow down before the light to
make sure that the intersection is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Smith, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of
Health, which monitors private ambulance companies, said that only
in emergencies where there is the potential for loss of life or
limb should private ambulances use their lights and sirens or speed
and run red lights.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Transcare Ambulance were not returned Thursday.

EDITORIAL: THE KILLING IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Oct. 2:
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its European allies are rapidly
approaching a decision point on whether to take military action to
end Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's butchery in Kosovo. The
need for outside intervention is urgent. Recent days have brought
harrowing reports of massacres of women, children and the elderly
by Serbian forces. With winter coming, hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have been driven from their homes, many
having to hide without shelter or food in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Milosevic withdraws his special police, who are
responsible for the brutality in Kosovo, in a matter of days, NATO
warplanes and cruise missiles should strike Serbian airfields and
military installations in Kosovo and the rest of Serbia until he
does. As long as Serbian forces are present, the displaced in
Kosovo will remain in the hills, where they may starve or freeze to
death this winter. Kosovo's humanitarian organizations must be able
to move freely to provide assistance to these people and help them
return to and rebuild their destroyed villages.
</P>
<P>
   The objective of air strikes should be limited to getting
Milosevic to deliver on his repeatedly broken promise to withdraw
his security forces. This should be accompanied by an investigation
by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia of
whether he should be indicted for the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   The use of military force is not the ideal way to handle the
conflict in Kosovo, especially because Washington and the
international community do not support the desire of Kosovo's
Albanians to create an independent state. Negotiation would have
been the best way to secure a restoration of the self-government
that Milosevic stripped from Kosovo in 1989, and perhaps even to
secure the granting of autonomous status for Kosovo equal to that
of Serbia or Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic's ethnic cleansing and attacks on innocents have
pushed the world to the brink of a military response. U.S.
officials said Thursday that Milosevic had about two weeks to stop
the attacks and remove his forces. The United Nations Security
Council should authorize the use of force. If it fails to do so
because of Russian opposition, which is likely, NATO should move
ahead anyway if military action proves necessary to save thousands
of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, France and Italy have been reluctant to intervene
without a firm Security Council resolution. But all three have
edged toward approval of air strikes even without explicit Security
Council authorization in recent days because of public pressure at
home and disclosure of the massacres. NATO ambassadors are now
meeting nearly daily, and member nations have pledged fighter
planes for air strikes. NATO has not yet taken a final decision,
however. If all members of the alliance are not willing to
intervene, Washington, London and other partners they can muster
should be prepared to act on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has a history of using terror, then retreating under
threat of force, only to resume his attacks when the world turns to
other problems. In Kosovo, Serbian officials are already declaring
that their military campaign is over. If that is the case, there
may still be time for a negotiated settlement. But Washington must
be wary of Milosevic's feints, and be ready to take action if the
killing and intimidation continue. A lack of resolve will only
further embolden him.

BRAVES COME FROM BEHIND TO TAKE 2-GAME LEAD OVER CUBS IN DIVISIONAL
PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the ninth inning, the Chicago Cubs were two outs
from victory. But when Thursday night's game ended, they were one
loss from elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a dramatic home run by Javy Lopez, a game-winning hit
by Chipper Jones, and critical mistakes by the Cubs, the Atlanta
Braves have grabbed a commanding 2-0 lead in this
three-of-five-game division series.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the bottom of the ninth inning, and the Braves
trailing, 1-0, Lopez hit a towering home run to left field that
sent the game into extra innings. Then in the bottom of the 10th, a
one-out single by Jones scored Walt Weiss from second base, giving
Atlanta a thrilling 2-1 victory at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional victory for the Braves, and a deflating loss
for the Cubs, who were on the verge of tying the series, riding a
masterly pitching performance by Kevin Tapani.
</P>
<P>
   But it all fell apart for the Cubs after Lopez hit a long drive
over the left-field fence that sent the Turner Field record crowd
of 51,713 into a frenzy. It tied the game, it ruined Tapani's
shutout, and it was the start of a disaster for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Things continued to go badly for the Cubs in their 10th when
they ran themselves out of an opportunity to take the lead. A walk
to Glenallen Hill, a sacrifice by Gary Gaetti, an intentional walk
to Mickey Morandini, and a steal of third base by Hill gave Chicago
runners at the corners with one out.
</P>
<P>
   But on a 3-2 count, Jeff Blauser struck out, and it turned into
an inning-ending double play when Lopez threw out Morandini who was
going on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Morandini threw down his helmet in disgust, as Hill looked on in
disbelief, stranded at third base. Then the Braves ended the game
against Terry Mulholland, who took over from Tapani (nine innings,
five hits, seven strikeouts, three walks). Weiss walked with one
out, then the Cubs made another mistake, when Tony Graffanino laid
down a sacrifice bunt, and Mulholland missed the bag covering first
base after taking a flip toss from Mark Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Graffanino was safe at first, putting runners on first and
second with one out. Jones hit the next pitch for a line drive to
left field that easily scored Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves ran onto the field in celebration. The Cubs walked
off the field dejectedly. They will try to keep their season alive
in Game 3, Saturday night at Wrigley Field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That the game evolved into a pitchers' duel between Tom Glavine
and Tapani was no surprise. Glavine was a 20-game winner during the
regular season, and he has won more games (179) than any other
left-hander over the last 11 years. Tapani fell just short of the
20-victory mark (19-6), and he defeated the Braves twice during the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine could not have pitched much better on Thursday night,
allowing just three hits, striking out seven, and walking one
through seven innings. But after five scoreless innings, Chicago
got its first hit of the game, its first run of the game, and its
first lead in the series in the top of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Morandini led off by grounding a single to right field. Scott
Servais followed with a flared single to right, putting runners on
first and second. After a nifty sacrifice bunt by Tapani moved the
runners up, the Braves kept the infield back, and Lance Johnson's
groundout to second base scored Morandini.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine retired the Cubs by striking out Manny Alexander on a
questionable call, but scoring the first run of the game was a big
psychological boost for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   With Glavine making the Cubs look so feeble at the plate, the
weight fell on Tapani to keep the Cubs in the game. And Tapani was
up to the task. He ended an Atlanta threat in the first inning by
striking out Ryan Klesko with two out and runners at the corners.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the fifth inning, Tapani escaped more trouble by
cleaning up a mess he created. Tapani made his first mistake by
walking the eighth-place hitter, Michael Tucker. That allowed
Glavine to sacrifice Tucker to second base.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tapani made another mistake, when he was called for a balk
by the plate umpire, Bill Hohn, moving Tucker to third base with
one out.
</P>
<P>
   But at that point, Tapani did some of his best pitching. He
struck out Weiss swinging to keep Tucker at third, then ended the
inning by getting Keith Lockhart to fly out to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta threatened again in the seventh inning, but Tapani bore
down. After Tucker singled with two out, Manager Bobby Cox sent
Ozzie Guillen up to bat for Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tucker stole second base, giving Guillen a chance to drive
home a run. But Tapani got Guillen to ground softly back to the
mound, and Chicago took its 1-0 lead into the eighth inning.

VALLONE ACCUSES PATAKI OF AVOIDING GUBERNATORIAL DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In strikingly harsh terms, Peter Vallone's
gubernatorial campaign Thursday accused Gov. George Pataki of
ducking debates with Vallone, echoing the charges that Pataki
leveled four years ago at Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, the New York City Council speaker, has tried to make it
impossible for Pataki to say no to debates by placing no conditions
on them. He has said that any time, place or format the governor
chooses will be fine with him, and he has left it to Pataki, a
Republican, to decide whether minor-party candidates will be
included.
</P>
<P>
   More than two weeks have passed since Vallone won the Democratic
primary and began calling, almost daily, for debates. But talks
over when, where and how the candidates should meet appear to have
broken down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just clear that they're not serious about debates,''
Kevin McCabe, Vallone's campaign manager, said in an interview
Thursday. ``It's a game. It's a silly, hypocritical, pathetic
little game they're playing.''
</P>
<P>
   McCabe and Pataki's campaign manager, Zenia Mucha, met Sept. 23
to discuss terms of possible debates. According to both of them,
McCabe said any terms were acceptable, leaving it to Ms. Mucha to
dictate them.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe said he had asked for another meeting as soon as possible
and that Ms. Mucha had not yet responded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha conceded that she had put off any more talks, and she
would not say when they would resume. She said she broke off
negotiations because Vallone had distorted the governor's record on
issues from abortion to college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's important that he be given some extra time to
educate himself about the issues that affect the state and to
acquaint himself with the governor's record,'' she said of Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he begins to demonstrate some knowledge of the issues and
some knowledge of the governor's record, we'll sit down and discuss
it. Until then, I don't see any need to continue negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was not stalling, trying to avoid debates or to
wait until so late in the campaign that they would have no effect.
``We intend to debate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Vallone, the matter is urgent, even desperate. With less
than five weeks to go in the campaign, he trails Pataki by a wide
margin in the polls and in the size of his campaign treasury, and
badly needs a dramatic stroke to spur his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's campaign said Thursday that the governor, who has
already spent $10 million in his re-election bid, had $9.2 million
on hand. Vallone's camp said the challenger had about $248,000 on
hand, after spending $4.4 million so far. The gubernatorial
candidates must file campaign disclosure statements Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Vallone tried to focus attention Thursday on debates and not
on campaign war chests.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional political wisdom is that a strong incumbent would
not want to debate because it would raise the opponent's stature
and risk the sort of televised blunder that could make a lead
quickly evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   But as debates become increasingly common in campaigns, voters
might take a dim view of a front-runner who openly shunned them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Pataki demanded debates with Cuomo, but they never took
place. He said of the incumbent, ``He lacks the guts to show up and
debate me one on one.''
</P>
<P>
   In this year's primaries, the Democratic candidates for
governor, state attorney general and the U.S. Senate all met in
debates.
</P>
<P>
   If Pataki agreed to debates, the most difficult question about
the terms would be whether to include minor-party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, a Republican turned Democrat, is
the Liberal Party nominee, but neither Vallone's camp nor Pataki's
is inclined to include her in debates.
</P>
<P>
   Independence Party nominee B. Thomas Golisano, who drew 4
percent of the vote in the 1994 race, would be the most difficult
to ignore because he has spent so much money on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   After saying last month that he would spend $10 million of his
money on this race, Golisano raised the figure this week to $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   That would roughly match Pataki's spending but over a shorter
period of time, allowing Golisano in the final month of the race to
mount one of the most intensive media campaigns the state has seen.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 2:
</P>
<P>
   Congressional conference committees are supposed to be the forum
where lawmakers resolve differences between bills passed by the
House and Senate, not reverse key policy decisions on which both
chambers basically agree. Yet Republican congressional leaders have
badly abused the conference process to pursue their obsessive drive
to oust Lawrence Noble, the able general counsel of the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Noble's various investigations of Republican fund-raising
practices and his efforts to end soft-money abuses have not pleased
the GOP. But he has a record of evenhanded enforcement, and his
allies managed to thwart earlier attempts to get rid of him by
amending the Treasury spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana, the leader of the
anti-Noble forces, refuses to concede defeat, and this week his
stubbornness was rewarded. Over the objection of Democrats,
language designed to force Noble's removal was included in the
final bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., has vowed a filibuster. If Levin
succeeds, the Republicans would then be expected to attach the
Treasury bill _ and with it the objectionable anti-Noble provision
_ to an omnibus spending bill that will be sent to the White House.
President Clinton needs to make plain now that he will not sign any
bill that contains an attack on Noble and, more broadly, the FEC's
independence.

TV SPORTS: LOCAL FOX STATION EXPECTING BIG RETURN ON YANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market may be gyrating madly, but the value
of the New York Yankees as a televised product is soaring. The
Yankees won 114 games this season and their television ratings are
splendid. So it's not shocking that WNYW/Channel 5 heavily outbid
WPIX/Channel 11 to carry 50 Yankee games in both 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees should do for Channel 5 what the NFL did for the
Fox network,'' said Michael Wach, the general manager of Fox-owned
Channel 5, referring to the stunning $1.6 billion deal Fox made in
1993 for the National Football Conference package. ``We will make
money with the games.''
</P>
<P>
   WNYW will pay between $350,000 and $400,000 a game _ or $17.5
million to $20 million per season. WPIX bid somewhat less than
$300,000 per game.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, gets none of
the WNYW money. It flows to the MSG Network through its 12-year,
$486 million deal that allows it to control the team's local cable
and broadcast rights.
</P>
<P>
   The WNYW deal acknowledges how highly MSG values Yankee rights.
At $350,000 per game, WNYW's payment will nearly equal what MSG is
paying the Yankees. MSG's rights payment to the Yankees in 1999
will be $54.25 million, or $361,666 per game. In 2000, the rate
rises to $368,333 per game.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier deals with WPIX, MSG had never done so well. From
1991 to 1993, MSG paid the station $5 million to carry 50 games a
season. MSG paid $2.5 million in 1994 and 1995, and shared
advertising revenues with WPIX.
</P>
<P>
   WPIX's final Yankees deal to carry 40 games in 1997 and 50 games
this past season _ for which it paid between $200,000 and $250,000
per game _ was ``marginally profitable,'' said Paul Bissonette,
WPIX's station manager.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 days ago, Bissonette sensed that WPIX was out of the
running after a 48-year run. ``MSG said they had an offer far
beyond what we offered, and there was no further discussion,'' he
said. ``They were in a pre-emptive situation where they didn't
expect us to come back and top the bid.''
</P>
<P>
   WNYW's strategy was obviously borrowed from the Fox playbook.
Like the network before it bought the NFC package, WNYW is
struggling, and it needs a reliable ratings producer and image
enhancer like Yankee games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we carry games in prime time, the games will be an
excellent lead-in to the news,'' Wach said. ``It's a whole new
audience stream that wasn't watching us. In image alone, it's a
whole different level for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee games this season averaged a 6.7 Nielsen rating on WPIX,
the best in 10 years. For the Fox baseball games seen Saturday
afternoons on WNYW, the rating averaged a 7.2. ``That's a big
audience to promote to,'' Wach said.
</P>
<P>
   And make no mistake: this was a Fox deal. Thursday's
announcement was organized by Fox Sports and faxed on Fox Sports
stationery. No deal this big can occur without an OK from the lead
Fox, Rupert Murdoch, or dispensation to occasionally pre-empt Fox
Network prime-time shows.
</P>
<P>
   WNYW will show about eight weeknight prime-time games, compared
with 29 this season on WPIX. ``We'll pre-empt the prime-time nights
that have the least negative effect on the network,'' Wach said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most of WNYW's Yankee games will be seen on weekends and late
nights from the West Coast, to avoid pre-empting Fox programming.
</P>
<P>
   WPIX carried the Yankees on Thursday and Friday nights, two of
the evenings that the WB Network was not supplying entertainment
programming. But the WB recently added Thursdays, and WPIX would
have had trouble finding 50 Yankee slots if it had made a new deal
with MSG.
</P>
<P>
   MSG comes out a big winner, getting more money and being able to
show more games in prime time than it had, which lets it sell
advertising at higher rates. MSG's Yankee games averaged a 3.76
rating, up 34 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As for announcers, Wach only said that he wants to find a role
for the retired Phil Rizzuto. Hopefully, WNYW will not bring Bobby
Murcer and Tommy John back. Murcer showed little improvement over
the years, making too many mistakes and being inattentive to
details. The occasional insight from John was often counterbalanced
by too much yakking.
</P>
<P>
   WNYW's arrival as a baseball telecaster can only please the New
York Mets, whose deal with WWOR/Channel 9 has expired. A bidding
war between WWOR and WPIX could break out. Mark Bingham, a Mets'
senior vice president, would not say if the Yankee-less WPIX has
come calling. He said: ``We're thrilled that another player is
jumping into the marketplace. People are waking up to the value of
marketing with baseball and aligning themselves with baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bissonette described any interest by WPIX in a Mets' package as
premature. But he added, ``We would never rule anything out.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 2:
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers, always on the lookout for interesting places to
rendezvous, can now add the Main Concourse of Grand Central
Terminal to the city's list of grand indoor spaces. The Beaux-Arts
structure, of course, remains a railroad station that must
accommodate nearly 500,000 people a day. But it is now full of
simple pleasures that can be had free and on foot, from the
sweeping new marble staircase at the east end to the celestial
beauty of the restored Sky Ceiling mural 120 feet above the
concourse floor. And what better place could there be to meet a
friend or arriving visitor than the four-sided brass clock in the
center of the concourse?
</P>
<P>
   The terminal was rededicated Thursday, an official act that will
not put an end to debates among preservationists and purists about
the esthetic choices the architects and the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority made during the process of restoration.
There is already disappointment about some of these choices. But it
is important to remember that the mission was to restore a 1913
rail terminal, with all the commercial bustle that entails, not to
create a brand new space.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Central's new guardians, chiefly the MTA, now confront two
challenges. The most obvious is to ensure that the $200 million
that this project will ultimately cost will not be wasted by
subsequent neglect. The old terminal fell victim to the ravages of
deferred maintenance. That cannot be allowed to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Second, even though about 90 percent of the commercial space has
now been leased, there will inevitably be turnover. Responsible
officials must make sure that future tenants, and the design of the
spaces they occupy, are compatible with the overall majesty of the
space. This is, after all, one of the great gateways to the city,
and it would be a travesty if commuters and visitors found
themselves trekking through yet another deadening shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   These are not unreasonable fears. In June the MTA allowed a
115-foot-long banner promoting the movie ``Godzilla'' and a laptop
computer to cover three arched windows over the east balcony. This
was a temporary expedient, the authority says, but even so, it did
not inspire confidence. It made one wonder whether the authority
truly appreciates what the architects have wrought _ whether, in
other words, it understands that the light that streams through the
terminal's huge windows is just as important as the time and money
that has been spent on restoring them.

TAXI AGENCY SAYS CABBIES TAMPERED WITH METERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tampering with taxi meters may no longer be as
prevalent as it once was, but the practice is not extinct, Taxi and
Limousine Commission inspectors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Eight cabbies had their licenses suspended Thursday after a
sting operation at John F. Kennedy International Airport turned up
three ``zappers'' _ devices attached to meters to make them run
faster _ and five other yellow cabs with evidence of
meter-tampering. The inspectors also temporarily suspended the
medallions of the cabs, blocking their owners from operating them.
</P>
<P>
   The taxi commission refused to release the names of the owners
and drivers, but said it would consider revoking the drivers'
licenses permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an egregious crime that we really view as stabbing
right into the heart of the integrity of the industry,'' said Allan
J. Fromberg, the agency's spokesman. ``Our intention is to see that
these people never have this kind of opportunity again.''
</P>
<P>
   The drivers and owners do not face criminal charges, Fromberg
said, because there is no criminal statute that covers tampering
with a taxi meter. Drivers would face administrative hearings
before their licenses could be revoked, and Fromberg said the
owners could be forced to sell their medallions.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors made the rounds of the cab holding areas at
Kennedy and La Guardia airports beginning at 4 a.m. and checked 300
cabs mostly at random, Fromberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the cabs that were checked were on a list of 175
vehicles that were the subject of overcharging complaints in recent
months. Of those seven, one was found to have a zapper.
</P>
<P>
   Fromberg said the zappers _ all found at Kennedy Airport _ were
wired into the meter to allow a driver to send an electronic pulse
to the meter, causing it to advance. &QL;

VACCO SEEKS THE REMOVAL OF THE APOLLO THEATER BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The state attorney general's Office filed a lawsuit
late Thursday that seeks to remove Rep. Charles Rangel and several
other board members of the nonprofit foundation that runs the
Apollo Theater, contending that the board failed to manage the
theater's finances responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit represents the latest twist of fortune for a Harlem
landmark. In May, state officials announced that they would
withhold $750,000 in loans and grants from the foundation until
questions about its finances were answered.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the theater's stagehands went on strike in a squabble
that state officials said was related to the theater's finances.
The strike was settled earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, Dennis Vacco, the state attorney general, has been
investigating whether the nonprofit Apollo Theater Foundation,
which manages the state-owned theater, made deals that were
inordinately beneficial to Percy Sutton, the former Manhattan
borough president, who produced shows at the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco contends that there were inappropriate business dealings
between Sutton _ a close friend of Rangel's _ and the board that
enabled Sutton's company, Inner City Broadcasting, to significantly
underpay the foundation for control of the television show, ``It's
Showtime at the Apollo.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Vacco has called for the removal of the entire
board in order to examine the foundation's finances, which Vacco's
office says are in utter disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' Vacco said in a statement, ``the Apollo
officers and directors generally abdicated through their conduct
and omissions, their legal responsibility to reasonably, prudently,
loyally, carefully and obediently, manage all of the affairs of the
foundation. As a consequence, they have caused financial harm to
one of Harlem's, and one of New York City's, greatest assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel, a Harlem Democrat, said Thursday night that the
theater's finances are in good shape. He said that he had yet to
see the complaint, but he speculated that the lawsuit was rooted
more in Vacco's campaign for re-election than in any financial
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange that this is happening this close to the
election,'' Rangel, speaking by telephone from his office in
Washington, said. ``It makes so little sense that I don't even go
into combat with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton did not return a telephone call placed to his home
Thursday night, and a lawyer representing the Apollo Theater
Foundation also did not return a call.
</P>
<P>
   Under a five-year licensing agreement, Inner City Broadcasting
was to pay the foundation $2,000 for each taping of ``It's Showtime
at the Apollo,'' or 25 percent of the show's profits, whichever was
greater.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials at the Empire State Development Corp.,
the state agency that owns the Apollo, the foundation's executives
told its board that Sutton owed at least $3 million under the
agreement, but it received and accepted only $200,000 when it asked
for payment.
</P>
<P>
   This, Vacco contended, was insufficient for a nonprofit
organization. According to the lawsuit, the board failed to insure
that it obtained all of the compensation to which it was entitled,
and failed to obtain detailed financial reports from Inner City.
The board also did not ask to inspect Inner City's records.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's suit also focused on another aspect of
business dealings between the foundation and Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   After the original licensing agreement to produce ``It's
Showtime at the Apollo'' expired at the end of last year, the
foundation opened bidding on a new agreement. Two groups were in
the running _ Inner City Broadcasting, and the African Heritage
Network.
</P>
<P>
   Both submitted bids for $1.5 million. Sutton's company won the
bid, state officials said, by changing its bid to $1.6 million at
the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the lawsuit seeks to remove six people from the
foundation's board: Rangel, Arthur Hill, George Dalley, the Rev.
William James, Lloyd Williams and Richard Greene.
</P>
<P>
   The other four board members _ Ossie Davis, Marianne Spraggins,
Evelyn Cunningham and George Woody _ expressed concern about the
finances several months ago, Vacco's office said, and would be
expected to form the nucleus of a new board.
